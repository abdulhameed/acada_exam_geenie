I have called the Congress into extraordinary session because there are serious, very serious, choices of policy to be made, and made immediately, which it was neither right nor constitutionally permissible that I should assume the responsibility of making.

On the 3d of February last I officially laid before you the extraordinary announcement of the Imperial German Government that on and after the 1st day of February it was its purpose to put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every vessel that sought to approach either the ports of Great Britain and Ireland or the western coasts of Europe or any of the ports controlled by the enemies of Germany within the Mediterranean. That had seemed to be the object of the German submarine warfare earlier in the war, but since April of last year the Imperial Government had somewhat restrained the commanders of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then given to us that passenger boats should not be sunk and that due warning would be given to all other vessels which its submarines might seek to destroy, when no resistance was offered or escape attempted, and care taken that their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their lives in their open boats. The precautions taken were meagre and haphazard enough, as was proved in distressing instance after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business, but a certain degree of restraint was observed The new policy has swept every restriction aside. Vessels of every kind, whatever their flag, their character, their cargo, their destination, their errand, have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board, the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of belligerents. Even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of Belgium, though the latter were provided with safe-conduct through the proscribed areas by the German Government itself and were distinguished by unmistakable marks of identity, have been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or of principle.

I was for a little while unable to believe that such things would in fact be done by any government that had hitherto subscribed to the humane practices of civilized nations. International law had its origin in the at tempt to set up some law which would be respected and observed upon the seas, where no nation had right of dominion and where lay the free highways of the world. By painful stage after stage has that law been built up, with meagre enough results, indeed, after all was accomplished that could be accomplished, but always with a clear view, at least, of what the heart and conscience of mankind demanded. This minimum of right the German Government has swept aside under the plea of retaliation and necessity and because it had no weapons which it could use at sea except these which it is impossible to employ as it is employing them without throwing to the winds all scruples of humanity or of respect for the understandings that were supposed to underlie the intercourse of the world. I am not now thinking of the loss of property involved, immense and serious as that is, but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of the lives of noncombatants, men, women, and children, engaged in pursuits which have always, even in the darkest periods of modern history, been deemed innocent and legitimate. Property can be paid for; the lives of peaceful and innocent people can not be. The present German submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare against mankind.

It is a war against all nations. American ships have been sunk, American lives taken, in ways which it has stirred us very deeply to learn of, but the ships and people of other neutral and friendly nations have been sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way. There has been no discrimination. The challenge is to all mankind. Each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it. The choice we make for ourselves must be made with a moderation of counsel and a temperateness of judgment befitting our character and our motives as a nation. We must put excited feeling away. Our motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the nation, but only the vindication of right, of human right, of which we are only a single champion.

When I addressed the Congress on the 26th of February last, I thought that it would suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms, our right to use the seas against unlawful interference, our right to keep our people safe against unlawful violence. But armed neutrality, it now appears, is impracticable. Because submarines are in effect outlaws when used as the German submarines have been used against merchant shipping, it is impossible to defend ships against their attacks as the law of nations has assumed that merchantmen would defend themselves against privateers or cruisers, visible craft giving chase upon the open sea. It is common prudence in such circumstances, grim necessity indeed, to endeavour to destroy them before they have shown their own intention. They must be dealt with upon sight, if dealt with at all. The German Government denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all within the areas of the sea which it has proscribed, even in the defense of rights which no modern publicist has ever before questioned their right to defend. The intimation is conveyed that the armed guards which we have placed on our merchant ships will be treated as beyond the pale of law and subject to be dealt with as pirates would be. Armed neutrality is ineffectual enough at best; in such circumstances and in the face of such pretensions it is worse than ineffectual; it is likely only to produce what it was meant to prevent; it is practically certain to draw us into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness of belligerents. There is one choice we can not make, we are incapable of making: we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated. The wrongs against which we now array ourselves are no common wrongs; they cut to the very roots of human life.

With a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step I am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves, but in unhesitating obedience to what I deem my constitutional duty, I advise that the Congress declare the recent course of the Imperial German Government to be in fact nothing less than war against the Government and people of the United States; that it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it, and that it take immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough state of defense but also to exert all its power and employ all its resources to bring the Government of the German Empire to terms and end the war.

What this will involve is clear. It will involve the utmost practicable cooperation in counsel and action with the governments now at war with Germany, and, as incident to that, the extension to those governments of the most liberal financial credits, in order that our resources may so far as possible be added to theirs. It will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible. It will involve the immediate full equipment of the Navy in all respects but particularly in supplying it with the best means of dealing with the enemy's submarines. It will involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the United States already provided for by law in case of war at least 500,000 men, who should, in my opinion, be chosen upon the principle of universal liability to service, and also the authorization of subsequent additional increments of equal force so soon as they may be needed and can be handled in training. It will involve also, of course, the granting of adequate credits to the Government, sustained, I hope, so far as they can equitably be sustained by the present generation, by well conceived taxation....

While we do these things, these deeply momentous things, let us be very clear, and make very clear to all the world what our motives and our objects are. My own thought has not been driven from its habitual and normal course by the unhappy events of the last two months, and I do not believe that the thought of the nation has been altered or clouded by them I have exactly the same things in mind now that I had in mind when I addressed the Senate on the 22d of January last; the same that I had in mind when I addressed the Congress on the 3d of February and on the 26th of February. Our object now, as then, is to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the observance of those principles. Neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of the world is involved and the freedom of its peoples, and the menace to that peace and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic governments backed by organized force which is controlled wholly by their will, not by the will of their people. We have seen the last of neutrality in such circumstances. We are at the beginning of an age in which it will be insisted that the same standards of conduct and of responsibility for wrong done shall be observed among nations and their governments that are observed among the individual citizens of civilized states.

We have no quarrel with the German people. We have no feeling towards them but one of sympathy and friendship. It was not upon their impulse that their Government acted in entering this war. It was not with their previous knowledge or approval. It was a war determined upon as wars used to be determined upon in the old, unhappy days when peoples were nowhere consulted by their rulers and wars were provoked and waged in the interest of dynasties or of little groups of ambitious men who were accustomed to use their fellow men as pawns and tools. Self-governed nations do not fill their neighbour states with spies or set the course of intrigue to bring about some critical posture of affairs which will give them an opportunity to strike and make conquest. Such designs can be successfully worked out only under cover and where no one has the right to ask questions. Cunningly contrived plans of deception or aggression, carried, it may be, from generation to generation, can be worked out and kept from the light only within the privacy of courts or behind the carefully guarded confidences of a narrow and privileged class. They are happily impossible where public opinion commands and insists upon full information concerning all the nation's affairs.

A steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a partnership of democratic nations. No autocratic government could be trusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants. It must be a league of honour, a partnership of opinion. Intrigue would eat its vitals away; the plottings of inner circles who could plan what they would and render account to no one would be a corruption seated at its very heart. Only free peoples can hold their purpose and their honour steady to a common end and prefer the interests of mankind to any narrow interest of their own.

Does not every American feel that assurance has been added to our hope for the future peace of the world by the wonderful and heartening things that have been happening within the last few weeks in Russia? Russia was known by those who knew it best to have been always in fact democratic at heart, in all the vital habits of her thought, in all the intimate relationships of her people that spoke their natural instinct, their habitual attitude towards life. The autocracy that crowned the summit of her political structure, long as it had stood and terrible as was the reality of its power, was not in fact Russian in origin, character, or purpose; and now it has been shaken off and the great, generous Russian people have been added in all their naive majesty and might to the forces that are fighting for freedom in the world, for justice, and for peace. Here is a fit partner for a league of honour.

One of the things that has served to convince us that the Prussian autocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very outset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities and even our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel, our peace within and without our industries and our commerce. Indeed it is now evident that its spies were here even before the war began; and it is unhappily not a matter of conjecture but a fact proved in our courts of justice that the intrigues which have more than once come perilously near to disturbing the peace and dislocating the industries of the country have been carried on at the instigation, with the support, and even under the personal direction of official agents of the Imperial Government accredited to the Government of the United States. Even in checking these things and trying to extirpate them we have sought to put the most generous interpretation possible upon them because we knew that their source lay, not in any hostile feeling or purpose of the German people towards us (who were, no doubt, as ignorant of them as we ourselves were), but only in the selfish designs of a Government that did what it pleased and told its people nothing. But they have played their part in serving to convince us at last that that Government entertains no real friendship for us and means to act against our peace and security at its convenience. That it means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors the intercepted Zimmermann note to the German Minister at Mexico City is eloquent evidence.

We are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that in such a government, following such methods, we can never have a friend; and that in the presence of its organized power, always lying in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose, there can be no assured security for the democratic governments of the world. We are now about to accept gage of battle with this natural foe to liberty and shall, if necessary, spend the whole force of the nation to check and nullify its pretensions and its power. We are glad, now that we see the facts with no veil of false pretence about them, to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples, the German peoples included: for the rights of nations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life and of obedience. The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.

Just because we fight without rancour and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.

I have said nothing of the governments allied with the Imperial Government of Germany because they have not made war upon us or challenged us to defend our right and our honour. The Austro-Hungarian Government has, indeed, avowed its unqualified endorsement and acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopted now without disguise by the Imperial German Government, and it has therefore not been possible for this Government to receive Count Tarnowski, the Ambassador recently accredited to this Government by the Imperial and Royal Government of Austria-Hungary; but that Government has not actually engaged in warfare against citizens of the United States on the seas, and I take the liberty, for the present at least, of postponing a discussion of our relations with the authorities at Vienna. We enter this war only where we are clearly forced into it because there are no other means of defending our rights.

It will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity towards a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us -- however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts. We have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship -- exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions towards the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy, who live amongst us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it towards all who are in fact loyal to their neighbours and to the Government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.

It is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts -- for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free. To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.",Why couldn't the U.S. just stop sending ships to the place which the Germans declared a war zone and tell Mexico to not side with the Germans?

- [Voiceover] We're now entering into 1944
0:03
where the Americans and the Allies are able to go
0:06
even more on the offensive versus the Japanese
0:10
and get closer and closer to Japan,
0:12
get in bombing range of Japan
0:14
and deprive the Japanese of,
0:17
I guess you could say, their forward bases.
0:19
And so right as we enter into 1944,
0:21
and once again I'm giving you an overview
0:23
I'm not giving every single battle that occurs,
0:25
the Unites States is able to take Kwajalein.
0:28
Which, once again, the strategic value of a lot of these,
0:32
these islands are tiny
0:33
they're barely large enough to have primitive bases
0:38
plus, kind of an air field,
0:39
but they're incredibly valuable because
0:41
the bombers can land, refuel, get resupplied
0:45
and then take off from there
0:47
and then be on the offensive even further in.
0:51
I guess you could say in Japanese territory.
0:53
And with the taking on Kwajalein,
0:54
just as a bit of a reminder,
0:56
the Americans, amongst other things,
0:58
now had control of the Soloman Islands.
1:03
They now have control of the Marshall and Gilbert Islands.
1:06
They now have control of the Marshall and Gilbert Islands.
1:10
And as we'll see, the real theme of 1944
1:13
as we get into the middle of and the end of the year
1:15
is to get as close as possible to the Japanese mainland.
1:19
Because the Americans now had a B-29,
1:23
or they had the B-29 bomber that had a 1500 mile radius.
1:28
1500 mile, I guess I could say 1500 mile range.
1:32
Which means if they're able to get points of
1:36
where their bombers could land and take off,
1:38
and once again these bombsers are way too large and heavy
1:41
to land on a carrier,
1:42
but if they can find islands where they can do that from
1:44
within a 1500 mile range of Japan
1:47
then the United States could have bombing attacks
1:49
directly on Japan and hopefully get closer to
1:53
an end to the war.
1:55
So that was really the theme,
1:56
get as close as possible to Japan
1:58
and then there was a secondary theme
2:00
of take back The Philippines.
2:01
One, it was a matter of pride, it was a former US possession
2:04
ever since the Spanish-American War.
2:08
But then on top of that,
2:09
The Philippines are incredibly strategic for shipping lanes
2:12
from Indonesia, remember those raw materials,
2:14
those resources, that oil that Japan wanted
2:17
from Indonesia.
2:19
If you control The Philippines
2:21
you're gonna control the shipping lanes between
2:23
Indonesia and Japan.
2:26
So you could deprive Japan of those natural resources.
2:28
So The United States' kind of
2:30
main focal areas in 1944,
2:33
get as close as possible to Japan, get within bombing range,
2:36
and take The Philippines.
2:38
And this is exactly what they did.
2:41
As we go into the summer of 1944,
2:45
and one, there were some, as early as the summer of 1944,
2:48
some bombing raids that took off in China to Japan
2:53
with the new B-29s.
2:56
So you do have some of these that happened as early,
2:59
some of these bombing raids happened as early
3:02
as summer of 1944.
3:05
But in terms of actual islands, or territory
3:09
The United States takes or takes back
3:11
in the summer, in June of 1944,
3:14
you have The Battle of the Philippine Sea.
3:17
So Battle of Philippine Sea occurs right around,
3:21
right around here.
3:23
It's a victory for The US. It's a victory for The US.
3:27
And it ends up really, really
3:31
hurting Japanese ability
3:35
to field carriers,
3:36
have air warfare from carriers
3:40
because so much of their
3:42
carrier capability
3:44
was damaged in The Battle of Philippine Sea.
3:47
So, The Battle of
3:52
Philippine
3:59
Battle of the Philippine Sea
4:00
this occurs in June
4:04
1944.
4:05
And along with that, in the summer,
4:08
the Allies are able to take several islands
4:12
in The Mariana Islands.
4:14
Once again, this is gonna be super important
4:16
because from The Marianas, they're able to launch
4:18
B-29 bombing attacks on the mainland in Japan.
4:22
And so over that summer the Allies,
4:24
the Americans in particular, are able to take Saipan,
4:28
they are able to take Guam,
4:33
they are able to take Tinian,
4:35
which is this little island right over here.
4:37
Some of these islands are quite hard to find.
4:39
They're super small, in fact,
4:40
even these little dots exaggerate their size,
4:43
if you were to actually go onto Google Maps or Google Earth
4:45
you'll see how small these are.
4:46
And I encourage you to look at them
4:47
it's really fascinating to see how small
4:49
some of these islands are.
4:50
They're really atolls, a lot of these are
4:52
more atolls then islands.
4:53
Not all of them are atolls.
4:55
But you see, they barely have enough space
4:57
for a landing strip for planes, especially the B-29s.
5:02
And then as we go further into the summer
5:04
and we start entering kind of later in the year,
5:08
the Americans are able to take,
5:10
at the time what was called Peleliu, now it's Palu.
5:14
So Peleliu, they're able to take Morotai,
5:20
and then perhaps most importantly in 1944,
5:23
this might be the biggest deal out of all of these
5:27
pacific battles that occur and all of these
5:28
naval battles that occur,
5:30
is The Battle of Leyte an The Battle of Leyte Gulf.
5:35
Because The Battle of Leyte was important
5:37
because in the process of taking Leyte
5:41
The United States essentially is able to knock out
5:44
the Japanese's ability to further defend,
5:48
I mean they will continue,
5:49
but realistically defend the rest of The Philippines.
5:52
So once Leyte is taken by the Allies
5:57
the odds of the Japanese being able to hold
6:00
the rest of The Philippines becomes very low.
6:03
And maybe even more important,
6:04
The Battle of Leyte Gulf, which occurs right around there,
6:08
it's an incredibly decisive battle for the American Navy.
6:12
The Japanese go all in, and that bet is not a good one.
6:16
The Japanese Navy is pretty much destroyed
6:19
in The Battle of Leyte Gulf.
6:22
And so 1944, once again,
6:25
very good year for the Allies.
6:27
Very bad year for the Japanese.
6:30
Now the Allies are in control of
6:34
they're in control of air strips,
6:36
from which they can take B-29 raids
6:39
to the mainland of Japan.
6:42
So air strips,
6:43
they can now, they're now within range
6:45
to do bombing attacks on the mainland of Japan,
6:48
and they now are very likely to control The Philippines
6:53
and control the shipping lanes from Indonesia to Japan
6:57
and they've all but destroyed the Japanese Navy.
7:01
So, once again, things are not looking very good for Japan.
7:05
And as we go into 1945, we'll see the Allies
7:09
get closer and closer and get more intense
7:13
bombing raids on Japan.
7:15
And every time they get closer,
7:16
the battles to take these islands,
7:18
Iwo Jima, Okinawa,
7:20
incredibly incredibly bloody
7:22
and The United States says,
7:24
'Well what do we have to do to get
7:25
the Japanese to surrender?'
7:27
And we'll see what, at least in the mind of Truman,
7:31
needs to happen.",Why did Hitler want to invade the first countries anyway 11 years after world war 1?

This exercises is from chapter 12 of the Kotz, Treichel in
0:03
Townsend and Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity book, and
0:06
I'm doing it with their permission.
0:09
So they tell us you place 2 liters of water in an open
0:13
container in your dormitory room.
0:15
The room has a volume of 4.25 times 10 to the fourth liters.
0:20
You seal the room and wait for the water to evaporate.
0:24
Will all of the water evaporate
0:26
at 25 degrees Celsius?
0:28
And then they tell us at 25 degrees Celsius, the density
0:31
of water is 0.997 grams per milliliter.
0:36
And its vapor pressure is 23.8 millimeters of mercury.
0:44
And this is actually the key clue to tell you how to solve
0:47
this problem.
0:47
And just as a bit of review, lets just think about what
0:49
vapor pressure is.
0:53
Let's say it's some temperature, and in this case
0:54
we're dealing at 25 degrees Celsius.
0:57
I have a bunch of water, and let me do
0:59
that in a water color.
1:00
I have a bunch of water molecules
1:03
sitting here in a container.
1:08
At 25 degrees Celsius, they're all bouncing around
1:12
in every which way.
1:15
And every now and then one of them is going to have enough
1:17
kinetic energy to kind of escape the hydrogen bonds and
1:21
all the things that keep liquid water in its liquid
1:23
state, and it will escape.
1:25
It'll go off in that direction, and
1:26
then another one will.
1:27
And this'll just keep happening.
1:29
The water will naturally vaporize in a room.
1:32
But at some point, enough of these molecules have vaporized
1:38
over here that they're also bumping back into the water.
1:42
And maybe some of them can be captured back
1:44
into the liquid state.
1:46
Now, the pressure at which this happens
1:50
is the vapor pressure.
1:51
As you can imagine, as more and more these water molecules
1:55
vaporize and go into the gaseous state, more and more
1:58
will also create pressure, downward pressure.
2:01
More and more will also be colliding with the
2:03
surface of the water.
2:04
And the pressure at which the liquid and the vapor states
2:09
are in equilibrium is the vapor pressure.
2:12
And they're telling us right now.
2:13
It is 23.8 millimeters of mercury.
2:18
Now, what we need to do to figure out this problem is
2:21
say, OK, if we could figure out how many molecules need to
2:26
evaporate, how many molecules of water need to evaporate to
2:29
give us this vapor pressure, we can then use the density of
2:33
water to figure out how many liters of water that is.
2:37
So how do we figure out how many molecules-- let me write
2:40
this down-- how many molecules of water need to evaporate to
2:59
give us the vapor pressure of 23.8 millimeters of mercury?
3:14
So what, I guess, law or formula-- and I never like to
3:18
just memorize formulas, but we've given this formal in the
3:21
past and it's probably one of the top most useful formulas
3:25
in chemistry, or really all of science-- what formula or law
3:30
deals with pressure?
3:33
They give us the volume of the room because that's where the
3:36
pressure will be inside of.
3:37
So we have pressure, the equilibrium vapor pressure.
3:41
We have a volume of a room right over here.
3:45
We know the temperature of the room right over there.
3:49
And we're trying to figure out the number of molecules that
3:52
need to evaporate for us to get that pressure in that
3:57
volume at that temperature.
3:59
So what deals with pressure, volume, number of molecules--
4:04
let's say in moles, so I'll write a lower case n-- number
4:08
of molecules, and temperature?
4:10
Well, we've seen this many, many times.
4:12
It's the Ideal Gas Law.
4:13
Pressure times volume is equal to the number of moles of our
4:20
ideal gas-- in this case we're going to use water as our
4:24
ideal gas, or vapor as our ideal gas-- times the
4:29
universal gas constant times temperature.
4:32
And this should never seem like some bizarre formula to
4:35
you because it really, really makes sense.
4:37
If your pressure goes up, then that means that either the
4:42
number of molecules have gone up, and we're assuming the
4:44
volume is constant.
4:45
That means either the number of molecules have gone up,
4:48
which makes sense-- more things bouncing onto the side
4:50
of the container.
4:51
Or your temperature has gone up-- the same number of
4:53
things, but they're bumping with higher kinetic energy.
4:56
Or if your pressure stays the same and your volume goes up,
5:01
then that also means that your number of molecules went up,
5:04
or your temperature went up.
5:05
Because you now have a bigger container.
5:06
In order to exert the same pressure you need either more
5:09
molecules or more kinetic energy for the molecules you
5:12
have.
5:12
And you could keep playing around with this, but I just
5:14
want to make it clear this isn't some mysterious formula.
5:16
The first time I was exposed to this I kind of did view it
5:18
as some type of mysterious formula.
5:20
But it's just relating pressure, volume, number of
5:22
molecules and temperature.
5:23
And then this is just the universal gas constant.
5:29
So let's just get everything into the right units here.
5:32
And then what we're trying to solve for, we want to figure
5:34
out the number of molecules of water.
5:36
So we want to solve for n.
5:40
And if we know the number of moles of water, we can figure
5:44
out the number of grams of water.
5:46
And then given the density of water we can figure out the
5:48
number of milliliters of water we are dealing with.
5:52
So let's just rewrite the Ideal Gas Law by dividing both
5:57
sides by the universal gas constant and temperature.
6:00
So that you get n is equal to pressure times volume, over
6:07
the universal gas constant times temperature.
6:10
Now, the hardest thing about this is just making sure you
6:13
have your units right and you're using the right ideal
6:15
gas constant for the right units, and we'll
6:17
do that right here.
6:18
So what I want to do, because the universal gas constant
6:24
that I have is in terms of atmospheres, we need to figure
6:27
out this vapor pressuree- this equilibrium pressure between
6:30
vapor and liquid-- we need to write this down in terms of
6:33
atmospheres.
6:35
So let me write this down.
6:36
So the vapor pressure is equal to 23.8
6:47
millimeters of mercury.
6:51
And you can look it up at a table if you don't have this
6:55
in your brain.
6:55
One atmosphere is equivalent to 760 millimeters of mercury.
7:06
So if we wanted to write the vapor pressure as
7:09
atmospheres-- let me get my calculator out, get the
7:12
calculator out, put it right over there-- so it's going to
7:15
be 23.8 times 1 over 760, or just divided by 760.
7:24
And we have three significant digits, so
7:27
it looks like 0.0313.
7:31
So this is equal to 0.0313 atmospheres.
7:40
That is our vapor pressure.
7:41
So let's just deal with this right here.
7:43
So the number of molecules of water that are going to be in
7:46
the air in the gaseous state, in the vapor state, is going
7:49
to be equal to our vapor pressure.
7:51
That's our equilibrium pressure.
7:55
If more water molecules evaporate after that point,
7:59
then we're going to have a higher pressure, which will
8:01
actually make them favor more of them going into the liquid
8:04
state, so we'll go kind of past the equilibrium, which is
8:06
not likely.
8:07
Or another way to think about it-- more water molecules are
8:10
not going to of evaporate at a faster rate than they are
8:12
going to condense beyond that pressure.
8:15
Anyway, the pressure here is 0.0313 atmospheres.
8:22
The volume here-- they told us right over here-- so that's
8:26
the volume-- 4.25.
8:28
4.25 times 10 to the fourth liters.
8:35
And then we want to divide that by-- and you want to make
8:37
sure that your universal gas constant has the right units,
8:40
I just looked mine up on Wikipedia-- 0.08-- see
8:46
everything has three significant digits.
8:48
So let me just allow that more significant digits and we'll
8:51
just round at the end.
8:52
0.082057, and the units here are liters atmospheres per
9:07
mole at kelvin.
9:12
And this makes sense.
9:13
This liter will cancel out with that liter.
9:14
That atmospheres cancels out with that atmospheres.
9:17
I'm about to multiply it by temperature
9:19
right here in kelvin.
9:21
We'll cancel out there.
9:22
And then we'll have a 1 over moles in the denominator.
9:24
A 1 over moles in the denominator will just be a
9:27
moles because you're going to invert it again.
9:29
So that gives us our answer in moles.
9:31
And so finally our temperature-- and you've got
9:33
to remember you've got to do it in kelvin.
9:35
So 25 degrees Celsius-- let me right it over here-- 25
9:39
degrees Celsius is equal to, you just add 273 to it, so
9:44
this is equal to 298 kelvin.
9:52
So times 298 kelvin.
9:56
And now we just have to calculate this.
9:58
So let's do that.
10:02
So let me clear this out.
10:04
So we have-- let me use my keyboard-- so 0.0313
10:10
atmospheres times 4.25 times 10 to the fourth.
10:21
That e just means times 10 to the fourth.
10:24
That's just the way that it works on this calculator.
10:27
And then divided by 0.082057 divided by-- actually, just to
10:39
make it clear, let me show you that I'm dividing by this
10:41
whole thing, so let me insert some parentheses right here.
10:50
So in the denominator we also are multiplying by 298.
10:53
And let me close the parentheses.
10:58
And then we get 54.4.
11:02
We only have three significant digits.
11:03
So this is equal to 54.4 moles.
11:10
And we could see this liters cancels out with that liters.
11:13
Kelvin cancels out with kelvin.
11:15
Atmospheres with atmospheres.
11:16
You have a 1 over mole in the denominator.
11:18
So then 1 over 1 over moles is just going to be moles.
11:24
Now, this is going to be 54.4 moles of water vapor in the
11:29
room to have our vapor pressure.
11:32
If more evaporates, then more will condense-- we will be
11:36
beyond our equilibrium.
11:37
So we won't ever have more than this amount
11:40
evaporate in that room.
11:41
So let's figure out how much liquid water that actually is.
11:47
Let me do it over here.
11:48
So 54.4 moles-- let me write it down-- moles of H2O.
11:59
That's going to be in its vapor form and
12:00
its going to evaporate.
12:01
But let's figure out how many grams that is.
12:04
So what is the molar mass of water?
12:08
Well, it's roughly 18.
12:10
I actually figured it out exactly.
12:11
It's actually 18.01 if you actually use the exact numbers
12:16
on the periodic table, at least one that I used.
12:18
So we could say that there's 18.01 grams of H2O for every 1
12:28
mole of H2O.
12:30
And obviously, you can just look up the atomic weight of
12:33
hydrogen, which is a little bit over 1, and the atomic
12:36
weight of oxygen, which is a little bit below 16.
12:38
So you have two of these.
12:40
So 2 plus 16 gives you pretty close to 18.
12:43
So this right here will tell you the grams of water that
12:47
can evaporate to get us to that equilibrium pressure.
12:51
So let's get the calculator out.
12:53
So we have the 54.4 times 18.01 is equal to 970-- well,
13:05
we only have three significant digits-- so 900, if your round
13:07
this 0.7, it becomes 980.
13:10
So this is 980 grams of H2O needs to evaporate for us to
13:17
get to our equilibrium pressure,
13:19
to our vapor pressure.
13:20
So let's figure out how many milliliters of water this is.
13:24
So they tell us the density of water right here.
13:27
0.997-- let me do this in a darker color-- 0.997 grams per
13:33
millileter.
13:34
Or another way you could view this is for everyone 1
13:39
milliliter you have 0.997 grams of water
13:49
at 25 degrees Celsius.
13:52
So for every milliliter-- this is grams per milliliter-- we
13:55
want milliliters per gram because we want this and this
13:58
to cancel out.
13:59
So we're essentially just going to divide 980 by 0.997.
14:04
So what is that?
14:05
Get the calculator out.
14:06
So we have 980-- not cover up our work-- divided by 0.997 is
14:16
equal to 980-- we'll just round this-- 983.
14:21
So this is equal to 983.
14:25
This and this canceled out, or that and that canceled out.
14:29
So 983 milliliters of H2O.
14:32
So we've figured out, using the Ideal Gas Law, that at 25
14:38
degrees Celsius, which was 298 kelvin, that 983 milliliters
14:44
of H2O will evaporate to get us to our
14:47
equilibrium vapor pressure.
14:50
Nothing more will evaporate, because beyond that if we have
14:53
higher pressure than that, then you'll also have more
14:57
vapor going to the liquid state.
14:58
Because you'll have more stuff bouncing here.
15:01
So if this much volume of water evaporates, we'll have
15:07
the state where just as much is evaporating as just as much
15:11
is condensing.
15:11
So you will never get to a higher pressure than that at
15:16
that temperature.
15:18
So going back to the question, we figured out that 983
15:21
milliliters of water will evaporate.
15:23
The question was is that we placed 2 liters of water in an
15:26
open container.
15:28
So we just figured out that only 983 milliliters of that--
15:31
so that's a little bit less than a liter.
15:34
So this is a little bit less than 1,000 milliliters, and
15:40
this is 1 liter.
15:41
So a little bit less than half of this will evaporate for us
15:47
to get to our vapor pressure.
15:48
So to answer our question-- will all of the water
15:50
evaporate at 25 degrees Celsius?
15:52
No-- if we're assuming the room is sealed-- well, no, all
15:55
of it will not.
15:56
Only a little bit less than half of it will.","while using the gas law, should we not add the vapour pressure to the atmospheric pressure?"

Dr. Steven Zucker: We're on the first floor
0:04
of Orsanmichele, which is this extraordinarily
0:07
complicated and important building.
0:09
It's a grainary and it's odd to think
0:11
of a grainary right in the middle of town.
0:13
Dr. Beth Harris: Well, we don't often
0:15
think about granaries.
0:17
Granaries were a place to store grain.
0:20
Dr. Zucker: But this was incredibly important
0:21
because there were years when a town
0:23
might be under siege and you couldn't get to the fields,
0:26
or there might be bad harvests.
0:27
Dr. Harris: Right, so right here on the first floor
0:29
of Orsanmichele, there was a grain market
0:32
and it was open.
0:33
Dr. Zucker: And then upstairs there were
0:35
the storage areas and those are huge spaces.
0:38
Dr. Harris: So this was, at one point,
0:39
the church and then became a grainary
0:42
and there was an image of the Madonna
0:45
that was located here that was believed to have
0:47
miraculous powers and at some point it burned
0:50
and then another image of the Virgin was created
0:53
Dr. Zucker: Was endued with the same powers
0:56
and I think we're up to the third version.
0:58
This was by Bernardo Daddi, but it's surrounded
1:01
by this extraordinary alter,
1:03
which was by [Orcania], who we generally
1:05
think of as a painter.
1:07
Dr. Harris: It's an amazing tabernacle
1:09
housing this miraculous image of the Virgin,
1:12
so we have to imagine that this space was once open.
1:16
Dr. Zucker: Okay, so the walls that are there now
1:17
we're not there originally.
1:18
This was really a part of the city.
1:20
The city, in a sense, flowed through it.
1:22
I think it's important to think about this place
1:24
as an intersection of the spiritual,
1:27
it was a church, and of the sort of everyday
1:30
business of the city, that is it was a grainary.
1:32
In even it's location, it's midway between
1:36
the great cathedral the Duomo and
1:38
of the town hall, the Signoria.
1:40
Dr. Harris: It's here that the first Renaissance
1:42
sculptures were created for the niches
1:45
on the outside of this building.
1:47
It's in this context that the first, really,
1:50
humanist Renaissance sculptures are born.
1:53
Dr. Zucker: Let's go upstairs
1:54
because sculptures that used to be in the niches
1:56
are now all protected upstairs in the area
1:58
that used to hold the grain.
2:00
Dr. Harris: We just climbed up a long flight of stairs
2:03
and we entered a large open space,
2:06
filled with the sculptures, the monumental figures,
2:10
that stood on the outside of Orsanmichele
2:13
in the niches.
2:15
Dr. Zucker: So, now if you go outside,
2:16
you see casts of the originals, which are here
2:19
because it's safer from the elements.
2:21
Dr. Harris: To protect them.
2:22
Dr. Zucker: Yeah.
2:23
Dr. Harris: In the very early 15th century
2:24
the guilds of Florence each were responsible
2:27
for completing a figure for a niche
2:31
on the outside of Orsanmichele
2:33
and the guilds each commissioned a sculptor
2:35
of their choice and we're sitting in front
2:39
of Donatello's Saint Mark, which was commissioned
2:42
by the Linen Drapers Guild.
2:44
Donatello gives us this classical figure.
2:47
Dr. Zucker: So, what is classical about it?
2:49
I mean, the first things your eyes see,
2:51
of course, is this incredible contrapposto
2:52
that comes through even under that heavy cloth.
2:55
I mean, look at the way, for instance,
2:57
that his right engaged leg, the drape falls down
3:01
to almost as if that's the fluting of the column.
3:03
Dr. Harris: And we can see his left knee
3:04
pressing through the drapery, so Donatello
3:07
is really reviving contrapposto,
3:09
which hasn't been seen in western art
3:12
in a thousand years.
3:14
Dr. Zucker: But it's so beautifully handled.
3:16
You have the sense of the absolute stability
3:19
of this figure and yet the sense of his movement.
3:22
Dr. Harris: The thing that's most impressive
3:24
is the psychological intensity of this figure,
3:26
which is really overwhelming.
3:29
There's a sense, almost as though,
3:31
along with the contrapposto, he's going to move
3:34
and he's going to speak.
3:36
There's a real sense of the dignity of Mark here
3:40
and I think by extension, that sense that one has
3:43
in the Florentine Renaissance of the dignity of man,
3:45
of human beings.
3:47
Dr. Zucker: There's a kind of intensity.
3:48
There's a kind of focus.
3:49
There's a kind of deep human sense of understanding
3:53
in that face, in the just little bit
3:56
of the furrow of the brow that you can see
3:58
and the way that the head is cocked slightly
4:01
and it's off-center in terms of the shoulders,
4:04
turning back around and there's an interior
4:07
awareness, a kind of interior intelligence
4:10
that comes through so starkly.
4:12
Dr. Harris: At the same time, without a halo.
4:16
Dr. Zucker: Yeah.
4:16
Dr. Harris: I have no doubt that this is
4:18
someone who sees something that ordinary human beings
4:22
don't see, when you look at his eyes,
4:24
he is, in a way, seeing past us.
4:26
Dr. Zucker: So, isn't that the core
4:28
of the story of the Florentine experience
4:30
in the 15th century?
4:32
You have this intensely devout culture
4:35
and yet at the same time, you have a culture
4:37
that is beginning to really celebrate human experience,
4:40
the individual and the idea of the rational.

khan_video_-oClpRv7msg_201622,Math,ESSAY,"•
0:00
We've talked a little bit about the law of demand which
0:02
tells us all else equal, if we raise the price of a product,
0:08
then the quantity demanded for that product will go down.
0:11
Common sense.
0:12
If we lower the price, than the quantity demanded will go up,
0:14
and we'll see a few special cases for this.
0:16
But what I want to do in this video is focus
0:18
on these other things that we've been holding equal,
0:21
the things that allow us to make this statement, that
0:23
allow us to move along this curve,
0:25
and think about if we were to change one of those things,
0:27
that we were otherwise considering
0:29
equal, how does that change the actual curve?
0:32
How does that actually change the whole quantity
0:34
demanded price relationship?
0:37
And so the first of these that I will focus on,
0:40
the first is the price of competing products.
0:50
So if you assume that the price of-- actually I
0:53
shouldn't say competing products,
0:54
I'll say the price of related products,
0:56
because we'll see that they're not competing.
0:59
The price of related products is one of the things
1:04
that we're assuming is constant when we, it's beheld equal when
1:08
we show this relationship.
1:10
We're assuming that these other things aren't changing.
1:13
Now, what would happen if these things changed?
1:16
Well, imagine we have, say, other ebooks-- books
1:28
is price-- price goes up.
1:32
The price of other ebooks go up.
1:35
So what will that do to our price
1:37
quantity demanded relationship?
1:40
If other ebooks prices go up, now all of a sudden, my ebook,
1:44
regardless of what price point we're at,
1:47
at any of the price points, my ebook
1:49
is going to look more desirable.
1:51
At $2, it's more likely that people will want it,
1:55
because the other stuff's more expensive.
1:57
At $4 more people will want it, at $6 more people will want it,
2:00
$8 more people will want it, at $10 more people will want it.
2:03
So if this were to happen, that would actually
2:05
shift the entire demand curve to the right.
2:09
So it would start to look something like this.
2:17
That is scenario one.
2:18
And these other ebooks, we can call them
2:20
substitutes for my product.
2:23
So this right over here, these other ebooks,
2:25
these are substitutes.
2:31
People might say, oh, you know, that other book looks
2:33
kind of comparable, if one is more expensive
2:35
or one is cheaper, maybe I'll read one or the other.
2:38
So in order to make this statement, in order
2:40
to stay along this curve, we have
2:42
to assume that this thing is constant.
2:44
If this thing changes, this is going to move the curve.
2:47
If other ebooks prices go up, it'll
2:49
probably shift our curve to the right.
2:50
If other ebooks prices go down, that
2:53
will shift our entire curve to the left.
2:55
So this is actually changing our demand.
2:58
It's changing our whole relationship.
3:00
So it's shifting demand to the right.
3:02
So let me write that.
3:03
So this is going to shift demand.
3:08
So the entire relationship, demand, to the right.
3:12
I really want to make sure that you have this point clear.
3:15
When we hold everything else equal,
3:17
we're moving along a given demand curve.
3:20
We're essentially saying the demand, the price
3:23
quantity demanded relationship, is held constant,
3:26
and we can pick a price and we'll
3:27
get a certain quantity demanded.
3:29
We're moving along the curve.
3:32
If we change one of those things,
3:33
we might actually shift the curve.
3:36
We'll actually change this demand schedule,
3:38
which will change this curve.
3:40
Now, there other related products,
3:43
they don't just have to be substitutes.
3:45
So, for example, let's think about scenario two.
3:49
Or maybe the price of a Kindle goes up.
3:59
Let me write this this way.
4:02
Kindle's price goes up.
4:06
Now, the Kindle is not a substitute.
4:07
People don't either buy an ebook or they won't either
4:11
buy my ebook or a Kindle.
4:13
Kindle is a compliment.
4:14
You actually need a Kindle or an iPad or something like it
4:17
in order to consume my ebook.
4:20
So this right over here is a complement.
4:25
So if a complement's price becomes more expensive,
4:28
and this is one of the things people
4:30
might use to buy my book, then it would actually,
4:32
for any given price, lower the quantity demanded.
4:36
So in this situation, if my book is
4:37
$2, since fewer people are going to have Kindles,
4:40
or since maybe they used some of their money
4:42
already to buy the Kindle, they're
4:43
going to have less to buy my book or just fewer
4:45
people will have the Kindle, for any given price is going
4:48
to lower the quantity demanded.
4:53
And so it'll essentially will shift,
4:54
it'll change the entire demand curve will shift the demand
4:57
curve to the left.
4:59
So this right over here is scenario two.
5:01
And you could imagine the other way,
5:03
if the Kindle's price went down, then
5:05
that would shift my demand curve to the right.
5:07
If the price of substitutes went down,
5:10
then that would shift my entire curve to the left.
5:13
So you can think about all the scenarios,
5:14
and actually I encourage you to.
5:15
Think about drawing yourself, think about for products,
5:17
that could be an ebook or could be some other type of product,
5:20
and think about what would happen.
5:22
Well, one, think about what the related products are,
5:24
the substitutes and potentially complements, and then
5:26
think about what happen as those prices change.
5:29
And always keep in mind the difference between demand,
5:32
which is this entire relationship, the entire curve
5:35
that we can move along if we hold everything else equal
5:38
and only change price, and quantity demanded,
5:41
which is a particular quantity for our particular price
5:44
holding everything else equal.",What happens to the graph if price were to remain constant but the amount of the good offered were to decrease?

Where we left off after the meiosis videos is that we had
0:03
two gametes.
0:04
We had a sperm and an egg.
0:07
Let me draw the sperm.
0:08
So you had the sperm and then you had an egg.
0:11
Maybe I'll do the egg in a different color.
0:14
That's the egg, and we all know how this story goes.
0:18
The sperm fertilizes the egg.
0:20
And a whole cascade of events start occurring.
0:23
The walls of the egg then become impervious to other
0:27
sperm so that only one sperm can get in, but that's not the
0:30
focus of this video.
0:31
The focus of this video is how this fertilized egg develops
0:35
once it has become a zygote.
0:38
So after it's fertilized, you remember from the meiosis
0:42
videos that each of these were haploid, or that they had--
0:48
oh, I added an extra i there-- that they had half the
0:51
contingency of the DNA.
0:56
As soon as the sperm fertilizes this egg, now, all
1:00
of a sudden, you have a diploid zygote.
1:03
Let me do that.
1:04
So now let me pick a nice color.
1:07
So now you're going to have a diploid zygote that's going to
1:10
have a 2N complement of the DNA material or kind of the
1:16
full complement of what a normal cell in our human body
1:20
would have. So this is diploid, and it's a zygote,
1:25
which is just a fancy way of saying the fertilized egg.
1:30
And it's now ready to essentially
1:31
turn into an organism.
1:33
So immediately after fertilization, this zygote
1:36
starts experiencing cleavage.
1:39
It's experiencing mitosis, that's the mechanism, but it
1:42
doesn't increase a lot in size.
1:44
So this one right here will then turn into-- it'll just
1:48
split up via mitosis into two like that.
1:52
And, of course, these are each 2N, and then those are going
1:55
to split into four like that.
2:01
And each of these have the same exact genetic complement
2:05
as that first zygote, and it keeps splitting.
2:08
And this mass of cells, we can start calling it, this right
2:14
here, this is referred to as the morula.
2:20
And actually, it comes from the word for mulberry because
2:22
it looks like a mulberry.
2:24
So actually, let me just kind of simplify things a little
2:26
bit because we don't have to start here.
2:28
So we start with a zygote.
2:32
This is a fertilized egg.
2:33
It just starts duplicating via mitosis, and you end up with a
2:38
ball of cells.
2:40
It's often going to be a power of two, because these cells,
2:43
at least in the initial stages are all duplicating all at
2:46
once, and then you have this morula.
2:51
Now, once the morula gets to about 16 cells or so-- and
2:54
we're talking about four or five days.
2:56
This isn't an exact process-- they started differentiating a
3:01
little bit, where the outer cells-- and this kind of turns
3:04
into a sphere.
3:05
Let me make it a little bit more sphere like.
3:08
So it starts differentiating between-- let me make some
3:12
outer cells.
3:13
This would be a cross-section of it.
3:15
It's really going to look more like a sphere.
3:18
That's the outer cells and then you have your inner cells
3:22
on the inside.
3:24
These outer cells are called the trophoblasts.
3:32
Let me do it in a different color.
3:40
Let me scroll over.
3:42
I don't want to go there.
3:43
And then the inner cells, and this is kind of the crux of
3:46
what this video is all about-- let me scroll
3:48
down a little bit.
3:49
The inner cells-- pick a suitable color.
3:54
The inner cells right there are called the embryoblast.
4:01
And then what's going to happen is some fluid's going
4:03
to start filling in some of this gap between the
4:06
embryoblast and the trophoblast, so you're going
4:08
to start having some fluid that comes in there, and so
4:14
the morula will eventually look like this, where the
4:18
trophoblast, or the outer membrane, is kind of this huge
4:21
sphere of cells.
4:22
And this is all happening as they keep replicating.
4:25
Mitosis is the mechanism, so now my trophoblast is going to
4:29
look like that, and then my embryoblast is going
4:34
to look like this.
4:36
Sometimes the embryoblast-- so this is the embryoblast.
4:46
Sometimes it's also called the inner cell mass, so let me
4:51
write that.
4:56
And this is what's going to turn into the organism.
4:58
And so, just so you know a couple of the labels that are
5:01
involved here, if we're dealing with a mammalian
5:03
organism, and we are mammals, we call this thing that the
5:07
morula turned into is a zygote, then a morula, then
5:10
the cells of the morula started to differentiate into
5:13
the trophoblast, or kind of the outside cells, and then
5:16
the embryoblast. And then you have this space that forms
5:22
here, and this is just fluid, and it's called the
5:26
blastocoel.
5:32
A very non-intuitive spelling of the coel part of
5:35
blastocoel.
5:37
But once this is formed, this is called a blastocyst. That's
5:40
the entire thing right here.
5:41
Let me scroll down a little bit.
5:44
This whole thing is called the blastocyst, and this is the
5:49
case in humans.
5:54
Now, it can be a very confusing topic, because a lot
5:57
of times in a lot of books on biology, you'll say, hey, you
5:59
go from the morula to the blastula or the
6:02
blastosphere stage.
6:04
Let me write those words down.
6:06
So sometimes you'll say morula,
6:10
and you go to blastula.
6:14
Sometimes it's called the blastosphere.
6:20
And I want to make it very clear that these are
6:22
essentially the same stages in development.
6:25
These are just for-- you know, in a lot of books, they'll
6:28
start talking about frogs or tadpoles or things like that,
6:32
and this applies to them.
6:33
While we're talking about mammals, especially the ones
6:35
that are closely related to us, the stage is the
6:38
blastocyst stage, and the real differentiator is when people
6:41
talk about just blastula and blastospheres.
6:44
There isn't necessarily this differentiation between these
6:47
outermost cells and these embryonic, or this
6:51
embryoblast, or this inner cell mass here.
6:54
But since the focus of this video is humans, and really
6:57
that's where I wanted to start from, because that's what we
6:59
are and that's what's interesting, we're going to
7:01
focus on the blastocyst.
7:03
Now, everything I've talked about in this video, it was
7:06
really to get to this point, because what we have here,
7:10
these little green cells that I drew right here in the
7:14
blastocysts, this inner cell mass, this is what will turn
7:18
into the organism.
7:19
And you say, OK, Sal, if that's the organism, what's
7:21
all of these purple cells out here?
7:24
This trophoblast out there?
7:27
That is going to turn into the placenta, and I'll do a future
7:30
video where in a human, it'll turn into a placenta.
7:34
So let me write that down.
7:35
It'll turn into the placenta.
7:38
And I'll do a whole future video about I guess how babies
7:41
are born, and I actually learned a ton about that this
7:44
past year because a baby was born in our house.
7:47
But the placenta is really kind of what the embryo
7:51
develops inside of, and it's the interface, especially in
7:54
humans and in mammals, between the developing fetus and its
7:59
mother, so it kind of is the exchange mechanism that
8:02
separates their two systems, but allows the necessary
8:05
functions to go on between them.
8:06
But that's not the focus of this video.
8:08
The focus of this video is the fact that these cells, which
8:12
at this point are-- they've differentiated themselves away
8:15
from the placenta cells, but they still haven't decided
8:18
what they're going to become.
8:20
Maybe this cell and its descendants eventually start
8:24
becoming part of the nervous system, while these cells
8:27
right here might become muscle tissue, while these cells
8:31
right here might become the liver.
8:36
These cells right here are called embryonic stem cells,
8:40
and probably the first time in this video you're hearing a
8:43
term that you might recognize.
8:45
So if I were to just take one of these cells, and actually,
8:48
just to introduce you to another term, you know, we
8:52
have this zygote.
8:54
As soon as it starts dividing, each of these cells are called
8:59
a blastomere.
9:00
And you're probably wondering, Sal, why does this word blast
9:04
keep appearing in this kind of embryology video, these
9:08
development videos?
9:09
And that comes from the Greek for spore: blastos.
9:13
So the organism is beginning to spore out or grow.
9:19
I won't go into the word origins of it, but that's
9:21
where it comes from and that's why everything has
9:23
this blast in it.
9:23
So these are blastomeres.
9:25
So when I talk what embryonic stem cells, I'm talking about
9:28
the individual blastomeres inside of this embryoblast or
9:34
inside of this inner cell mass.
9:36
These words are actually unusually fun to say.
9:39
So each of these is an embryonic stem cell.
9:43
Let me write this down in a vibrant color.
9:47
So each of these right here are embryonic stem cells, and
9:52
I wanted to get to this.
9:56
And the reason why these are interesting, and I think you
9:58
already know, is that there's a huge debate around these.
10:00
One, these have the potential to turn into anything, that
10:03
they have this plasticity.
10:05
That's another word that you might hear.
10:07
Let me write that down, too: plasticity.
10:12
And the word essentially comes from, you know, like a plastic
10:14
can turn into anything else.
10:17
When we say that something has plasticity, we're talking
10:19
about its potential to turn into a lot
10:21
of different things.
10:22
So the theory is, and there's already some trials that seem
10:26
to substantiate this, especially in some lower
10:28
organisms, that, look, if you have some damage at some point
10:31
in your body-- let me draw a nerve cell.
10:36
Let me say I have a-- I won't go into the actual mechanics
10:40
of a nerve cell, but let's say that we have some damage at
10:43
some point on a nerve cell right there, and because of
10:46
that, someone is paralyzed or there's some nerve
10:50
dysfunction.
10:51
We're dealing with multiple sclerosis or who knows what.
10:54
The idea is, look, we have these cell here that could
10:57
turn into anything, and we're just really understanding how
11:02
it knows what to turn into.
11:04
It really has to look at its environment and say, hey, what
11:06
are the guys around me doing, and maybe that's what helps
11:08
dictate what it does.
11:10
But the idea is you take these things that could turn to
11:12
anything and you put them where the damage is, you layer
11:16
them where the damage is, and then they can turn into the
11:19
cell that they need to turn into.
11:21
So in this case, they would turn into nerve cells.
11:24
They would turn to nerve cells and repair the damage and
11:29
maybe cure the paralysis for that individual.
11:32
So it's a huge, exciting area of research, and you could
11:35
even, in theory, grow new organs.
11:37
If someone needs a kidney transplant or a heart
11:39
transplant, maybe in the future, we could take a colony
11:43
of these embryonic stem cells.
11:44
Maybe we can put them in some type of other creature, or who
11:48
knows what, and we can turn it into a replacement heart or a
11:52
replacement kidney.
11:52
So there's a huge amount of excitement about
11:56
what these can do.
11:57
I mean, they could cure a lot of formerly uncurable diseases
12:01
or provide hope for a lot of patients who
12:03
might otherwise die.
12:05
But obviously, there's a debate here.
12:07
And the debate all revolves around the issue of if you
12:10
were to go in here and try to extract one of these cells,
12:15
you're going to kill this embryo.
12:17
You're going to kill this developing embryo, and that
12:21
developing embryo had the potential to
12:23
become a human being.
12:27
It's a potential that obviously has to be in the
12:28
right environment, and it has to have a willing mother and
12:33
all of the rest, but it does have the potential.
12:35
And so for those, especially, I think, in the pro-life camp,
12:40
who say, hey, anything that has a potential to be a human
12:44
being, that is life and it should not be killed.
12:47
So people on that side of the camp, they're against the
12:52
destroying of this embryo.
12:54
I'm not making this video to take either side to that
12:57
argument, but it's a potential to turn to a human being.
13:01
It's a potential, right?
13:04
So obviously, there's a huge amount of debate, but now, now
13:07
you know in this video what people are talking about when
13:10
they say embryonic stem cells.
13:12
And obviously, the next question is, hey, well, why
13:14
don't they just call them stem cells as opposed to embryonic
13:16
stem cells?
13:17
And that's because in all of our bodies, you do have what
13:20
are called somatic stem cells.
13:22
Let me write that down.
13:24
Somatic or adults stem cells.
13:29
And we all have them.
13:30
They're in our bone marrow to help produce red blood cells,
13:32
other parts of our body, but the problem with somatic stem
13:36
cells is they're not as plastic, which means that they
13:41
can't form any type of cell in the human body.
13:44
There's an area of research where people are actually
13:46
maybe trying to make them more plastic, and if they are able
13:50
to take these somatic stem cells and make them more
13:52
plastic, it might maybe kill the need to have these
13:56
embryonic stem cells, although maybe if they do this too
13:58
good, maybe these will have the potential to turn into
14:01
human beings as well, so that could
14:03
become a debatable issue.
14:04
But right now, this isn't an area of debate because, left
14:08
to their own devices, a somatic stem cell or an adult
14:12
stem cell won't turn into a human being, while an
14:15
embryonic one, if it is implanted in a willing mother,
14:19
then, of course, it will turn into a human being.
14:21
And I want to make one side note here, because I don't
14:24
want to take any sides on the debate of-- well, I mean,
14:30
facts are facts.
14:31
This does have the potential to turn into a human being,
14:33
but it also has the potential to save millions of lives.
14:36
Both of those statements are facts, and then you can decide
14:39
on your own which side of that argument you'd like to or what
14:42
side of that balance you would like to kind of
14:45
put your own opinion.
14:47
But there's one thing I want to talk about that in the
14:50
public debate is never brought up.
14:51
So you have this notion of when you-- to get an embryonic
14:55
stem cell line, and when I say a stem cell line, I mean you
14:58
take a couple of stem cells, or let's say you take one stem
15:00
cell, and then you put it in a Petri dish, and then you allow
15:04
it to just duplicate.
15:06
So this one turns into two, those two turn to four.
15:09
Then someone could take one of these and then put it in their
15:12
own Petri dish.
15:13
These are a stem cell line.
15:15
They all came from one unique embryonic stem cell or what
15:20
initially was a blastomere.
15:21
So that's what they call a stem cell line.
15:24
So the debate obviously is when you start an embryonic
15:28
stem cell line, you are destroying an embryo.
15:31
But I want to make the point here that embryos are being
15:33
destroyed in other processes, and namely, in-vitro
15:37
fertilization.
15:40
And maybe this'll be my next video: fertilization.
15:44
And this is just the notion that they take a set of eggs
15:48
out of a mother.
15:49
It's usually a couple that's having trouble having a child,
15:52
and they take a bunch of eggs out of the mother.
15:54
So let's say they take maybe 10 to 30
15:56
eggs out of the mother.
15:59
They actually perform a surgery, take them out of the
16:02
ovaries of the mother, and then they fertilize them with
16:06
semen, either it might come from the father or a sperm
16:09
donor, so then all of these becomes zygotes once they're
16:13
fertilized with semen.
16:15
So these all become zygotes, and then they allow them to
16:17
develop, and they usually allow them to develop to the
16:19
blastocyst stage.
16:21
So eventually all of these turn into blastocysts.
16:25
They have a blastocoel in the center, which is
16:30
this area of fluid.
16:32
They have, of course, the embryo, the inner cell mass in
16:37
them, and what they do is they look at the ones that they
16:41
deem are healthier or maybe the ones that are at least
16:44
just not unhealthy, and they'll take a couple of these
16:47
and they'll implant these into the mother, so all of this is
16:50
occurring in a Petri dish.
16:52
So maybe these four look good, so they're going to take these
16:55
four, and they're going to implant these into a mother,
16:57
and if all goes well, maybe one of these will turn into--
17:01
will give the couple a child.
17:02
So this one will develop and maybe the other ones won't.
17:05
But if you've seen John & Kate Plus 8, you know that many
17:09
times they implant a lot of them in there, just to
17:12
increase the probability that you get at least one child.
17:14
But every now and then, they implant seven or eight, and
17:17
then you end up with eight kids.
17:18
And that's why in-vitro fertilization often results in
17:21
kind of these multiple births, or reality
17:25
television shows on cable.
17:27
But what do they do with all of these other perfectly--
17:30
well, I won't say perfectly viable, but these are embryos.
17:33
They may or may not be perfectly viable, but you have
17:36
these embryos that have the potential, just like this one
17:41
right here.
17:42
These all have the potential to turn into a human being.
17:46
But most fertility clinics, roughly half of them, they
17:50
either throw these away, they destroy them, they
17:52
allow them to die.
17:54
A lot of these are frozen, but just the process of freezing
17:56
them kills them and then bonding them kills them again,
17:59
so most of these, the process of in-vitro fertilization, for
18:04
every one child that has the potential to develop into a
18:08
full-fledged human being, you're actually destroying
18:10
tens of very viable embryos.
18:14
So at least my take on it is if you're against-- and I
18:18
generally don't want to take a side on this, but if you are
18:21
against research that involves embryonic stem cells because
18:33
of the destruction of embryos, on that same, I guess,
18:36
philosophical ground, you should also be against
18:40
in-vitro fertilization because both of these involve the
18:47
destruction of zygotes.
18:49
I think-- well, I won't talk more about this, because I
18:52
really don't want to take sides, but I want to show that
18:54
there is kind of an equivalence here that's
18:56
completely lost in this debate on whether embryonic stem
19:00
cells should be used because they have a destruction of
19:02
embryos, because you're destroying just as many
19:04
embryos in this-- well, I won't say just as many, but
19:08
you are destroying embryos.
19:09
There's hundreds of thousands of embryos that get destroyed
19:12
and get frozen and obviously destroyed in that process as
19:16
well through this in-vitro fertilization process.
19:19
So anyway, now hopefully you have the tools to kind of
19:22
engage in the debate around stem cells, and you see that
19:25
it all comes from what we learned about meiosis.
19:29
They produce these gametes.
19:33
The male gamete fertilizes a female gamete.
19:35
The zygote happens or gets created and starts splitting
19:39
up the morula, and then it keeps splitting and it
19:42
differentiates into the blastocyst, and then this is
19:45
where the stem cells are.
19:47
So you already know enough science to engage in kind of a
19:50
very heated debate.",If DNA is nothing but chemical reconstrustion and duplication is it possible to simply introduce the right amount of the needed chemicals into like a soup where they will simply bond as they see fit?

- Let's now jump into understanding meiosis in some depth.
0:04
So let's start with the germ cell.
0:07
As we mentioned already, a germ cell is a cell that
0:10
it can either go to mitosis to produce other germ cells
0:14
or it can undergo meiosis in order to produce gametes.
0:18
So this is a germ cell right over here.
0:21
Let me draw the nuclear membrane.
0:25
Let me draw the nucleus larger because that's where
0:28
we care a lot about the chromosomes in it.
0:31
And let me draw a centrosome
0:33
which will play a role later on.
0:35
I wanna do that in ...
0:37
Let's see, I'll do that in this blue color.
0:39
Each centromosome has two centrioles in it.
0:43
I just wanna clarify some of the terminology.
0:45
And in the mitosis videos, I focused on
0:49
cells of an organism, I just kind of made it up,
0:52
that had two chromosomes, that had a diploid number of two
0:56
that had one homologous pair, that had one chromosome
0:59
from each of its parents.
1:01
For this video, I'm gonna focus on a species,
1:04
not human beings, that would have
1:06
23 pairs or 46 chromosomes.
1:08
I'm gonna focus on a species that has,
1:10
that's diploid number is four.
1:13
And so, let's say it has two chromosomes from the father.
1:17
And let me do that.
1:18
I'll do that in this orange color.
1:20
Now, I'll do that in the chromatin,
1:21
I'll kind of depict the chromatin sate,
1:23
it's kind of unwound.
1:24
So maybe it has a long one from the father
1:25
and it has a short one from the father.
1:28
And then it has homologous chromosomes from the mother.
1:31
So it would have the long one from the mother
1:33
and it would have the short one
1:37
from the mother just like that.
1:39
And obviously this is a huge simplification
1:42
but hopefully this discuss the point across.
1:44
So here, it has a diploid number of chromosomes.
1:47
So this is, let me write this down.
1:50
This is diploid
1:55
number is equal to,
1:57
we have four chromosomes.
2:00
And then this thing, this germ cell.
2:02
Let me write this down.
2:02
This is a germ cell right over here.
2:05
It will go through interphase.
2:08
So let me draw that.
2:09
So it will go through interface in which
2:13
it grows and it can replicate its DNA and its centrosome.
2:18
And so, let me draw that.
2:19
So after it goes through interface,
2:22
I wanna use my space carefully because I have a lot
2:24
of steps to go through.
2:26
After it goes through interface, I am going to have
2:31
in my nucleus here,
2:36
my DNA will have replicated.
2:38
So this long chromosome from my father,
2:42
now all the DNA will have replicated so
2:46
it may look something like that.
2:49
And it's attached
2:54
at a centromere,
2:56
All these centro words,
2:58
at a centromere right here.
2:59
But I'm still trying to draw it in kind of
3:01
the chromatin state.
3:02
It's actually all spread out.
3:03
It's not bunched up so that you can see it very clearly
3:06
as these X's in a simple microscope.
3:10
So it's just replicated.
3:11
And after replicating, it is still one chromosome.
3:14
It has twice the genetic material
3:16
but it is still one chromosome.
3:19
That one chromosome is now made up of
3:21
two sister chromatids.
3:24
we talked a lot about that in the mitosis video,
3:27
but it doesn't hurt to reinforce
3:28
because it can get a little bit confusing.
3:30
And then you have that shorter chromosome from the father
3:34
and then that also replicates into two sister chromatids
3:40
attached at a centromere.
3:43
So these are still two chromosomes from the father.
3:45
It has twice the amount of DNA but it's containing
3:48
the same information,
3:49
just duplicate versions of that same information.
3:52
And the same thing's gonna happen from the mother.
3:54
You had that long chromosome from the mother,
3:57
homologous to this right over here.
3:59
It's going to replicate.
4:01
So it's now going to be two sister chromatids.
4:06
And then you have a short strand from the mother
4:08
that was homologous to this one from your father.
4:11
And that's also gonna replicate.
4:13
And so, it's like that.
4:14
And at the end of interface,
4:15
it would actually all be spread out.
4:18
Once again, it won't be bunched up into these
4:20
clearly discernible X's.
4:22
I drew them a little bit that way, otherwise,
4:23
because you would have trouble seeing how that replicated.
4:26
And we also have replicated our centrosome
4:30
as we've gone through interface.
4:33
Now, we are ready.
4:34
In fact, now we are ready for either mitosis or meiosis.
4:38
But as I said, the focus of this video
4:40
is going to be meiosis so let's do some meiosis.
4:45
So the first phase,
4:46
so the first several phases we call meiosis I.
4:49
And the beginning of meiosis I is prophase I.
4:52
So let's see what happens in prophase I.
4:55
So prophase I.
4:57
And so, let me draw the cell right over here.
5:02
So prophase I.
5:04
A couple of things happen.
5:06
The nuclear membrane begins to dissolve.
5:09
This is very similar to prophase
5:12
when we're looking at mitosis.
5:15
So the nuclear envelope begins to dissolve.
5:19
These things start to maybe migrate a little bit.
5:22
So these characters are trying to go at different ends.
5:27
And the DNA starts to bunch up into kind of
5:31
its condensed form.
5:32
So now I can draw it.
5:34
So now I can start to draw it as proper.
5:37
So this is the one from the father
5:42
right over here.
5:43
And this is the one from the mother.
5:46
And I'm drawing, I'm overlapping on purpose
5:48
because something very interesting happens
5:50
especially in meiosis.
5:52
So it's the mother right over here.
5:57
Let me see.
5:58
Let's now do the centromere in blue now.
5:59
That's the centromere.
6:02
Now this is the shorter ones from the father.
6:07
These are the shorter ones from the mother.
6:10
And actually, let me just do draw them on opposite sides
6:12
just to show that they don't have to,
6:14
the ones from the father aren't always
6:15
on the left hand side.
6:16
So this is the shorter one from the father.
6:20
They couldn't be all on the left hand side
6:21
but doesn't this all they have to be.
6:23
And this is the shorter one from the mother.
6:24
And I will draw this overlapping although they could have.
6:27
Shorter one from the mother.
6:29
And once again, each of these, this is a homologous pair,
6:31
that's a homologous pair over there.
6:33
Now, the DNA has been replicated so
6:37
in each of the chromosomes in a homologous pair,
6:40
you have two sister chromatids.
6:42
And so, in this entire homologous pair,
6:44
you have four chromatids.
6:47
And so, this is sometimes called a tetrad.
6:49
So let me just give ourselves some terminology.
6:53
So this right over here is called a tetrad
6:56
or often called a tetrad.
6:59
Now, the reason why I drew this overlapping
7:01
is when we are in prophase I in meiosis I.
7:04
Let me label this.
7:05
This is prophase I.
7:09
You can get some genetic recombination,
7:11
some homologous recombination.
7:13
Once again, this is homologous pair.
7:16
One chromosome from the father
7:18
that I've gotten from the father.
7:19
The species or the cell got it from its father's cell
7:22
and one from the mother.
7:24
And they're homologous.
7:26
They might contain different base pairs,
7:28
different actual DNA, but they code for the same genes.
7:34
Over simplification, but in a similar place on each of these
7:38
it might code for eye color or I don't know,
7:41
personality.
7:42
Nothing is that simple in how tall you get
7:45
and it's not that simple in DNA but just to give you
7:48
an idea of how it is.
7:49
And the reason why I overlapped them like this
7:51
is to show how the recombination can occur.
7:54
So actually, let me zoom in.
7:56
So this is the one from the father.
7:59
Once again, it's on the condensed form.
8:00
This is one chromosome made up of two sister chromatids
8:05
right over here.
8:06
And I drew the centromere,
8:08
not to be confused with centrosomes.
8:10
That's where they are, those sister chromatids are attached.
8:13
And then, I will draw the homologous
8:17
chromosome from the mother.
8:19
So the homologous chromosome from the mother
8:23
just like that.
8:28
Homologous chromosome from the mother.
8:30
And the recombination can occur at a point
8:33
right over here.
8:35
So after you're done with the recombination,
8:38
this side might look something more like this.
8:41
So let me draw it like this.
8:46
So, they essentially break up
8:48
and they swap those little sections.
8:50
There's one way to think about it.
8:52
So this one, we'll now have a little piece from the mother.
8:56
It might code for similar genes.
8:58
But now it contains the mother's genetic information.
9:00
And then this one over here
9:06
will now have the piece.
9:10
And you could say even homologous piece from the father.
9:16
Let me do these two centromeres.
9:18
And this is really interesting.
9:21
All the time, there couldn't be recombination
9:23
and often times it can lead to kind of none optimal things,
9:26
nonsense code and DNA.
9:28
It might lead to a nonfunctional organism.
9:31
But this happens fairly common in the meiosis
9:36
and it's a way, once again, to get more variation.
9:38
We've talked about sexual reproduction before.
9:40
And sexual reproduction introduces variation
9:43
into a population.
9:44
And this, obviously, when different sperms
9:46
find different eggs that introduces variation.
9:48
But then, even amongst homologous pairs
9:50
you can actually have exchange between this chromosome.
9:54
And that's interesting because as we mentioned,
9:57
each of these chromosomes,
9:58
they code for a bunch of different genes.
10:00
And a gene is kinda looking code for a specific
10:03
or a set of proteins.
10:05
So this right over here,
10:09
and this is what I'm about to say is gonna be huge
10:11
over simplification.
10:12
Maybe right over here you coded for eye color
10:15
or it was related to, or it helps code for eye color.
10:18
And then you got that from your dad.
10:19
And here, it helped code for eye color.
10:21
And you got that from your mom.
10:22
Your mom might have trended you towards a lighter eye color
10:26
and your dad might have trended you
10:27
towards a darker eye color.
10:28
But now, the one from your mom is on this chromosome,
10:32
this gene, and then the one
10:34
or they've both the same gene.
10:35
They're just different allele.
10:36
They're coding for different variance of that gene.
10:38
And then the allele from your dad is over here.
10:41
And once again, some people get confused with genes
10:44
and chromosomes and all of these.
10:45
Each of these chromosomes contain a bunch of genes.
10:48
These are very long DNA molecules.
10:50
This code for a bunch of different genes.
10:53
So gene will be a little section of here that could code for
10:57
a particular protein.
10:59
So that's what happens in prophase I.
11:01
In prophase I, you have this condensation
11:05
of your chromosomes, of your homologous pairs.
11:09
You can have this recombination.
11:12
And it's really interesting, this recombination
11:14
doesn't tend to happen at just random points
11:16
that would kind of break the genetic information.
11:20
It tends to happen at fairly clean points.
11:22
And the places where this breakup is happening,
11:25
these are called the plural,
11:27
if you just talk about one point, it's a chiasma,
11:30
or if you're talking about the plural, it's chiasmata.
11:32
Sounds like it could be a horror movie.
11:34
So, chiasma.
11:36
Chiasma.
11:37
And the fact that they happen,
11:38
they tend to happen fairly clearly, this is once again,
11:41
kind of the beauty of the universe or at least
11:43
of biology is that through
11:46
billions of years of evolution, these things have kind of
11:50
optimized for more variation and to happen
11:54
in fairly clean ways.
11:56
So I'm gonna leave this video right there.
11:58
I know I just got to prophase I.
11:59
But this was a really, really important idea of
12:01
this homologous recombination or this chromosomal crossover
12:06
that we see right over here.
12:07
And then from there, we can continue
12:09
through the rest of meiosis I and then meiosis II.","So are Prophase and Metaphase the processes which they undergo to change into the forms shown, or the name for a cell in that form currently?"
khan_video_05qDIjKevJo_5,Social Studies,MCQ,"•
0:00
In the last video, we talk about how seasons on Earth
0:03
are not caused by how close Earth
0:06
is to the sun in its orbit.
0:08
And we also hint at the fact that it's actually
0:10
caused by the tilt of the earth.
0:12
And so in this video, I want to show you
0:14
how the tilt of the earth causes the seasons to happen.
0:19
So let's draw-- so I'm going to try
0:21
to draw as many diagrams as possible here.
0:23
Because at least for my brain they
0:25
help me visualize what's actually going on.
0:27
So we could imagine a top view first.
0:30
So let's have a top view.
0:32
That is the sun right over there.
0:35
And let me draw the earth's orbit.
0:37
So Earth's orbit maybe looks something like that.
0:41
Let me draw it almost, it is almost circular.
0:43
So I'll draw it as something that's
0:45
pretty close to a circle right over here.
0:47
And I'm going to draw Earth at different points in its orbit.
0:50
And I'm going to try to depict the tilt
0:53
of its rotational axis.
0:55
And obviously, this is not drawn anywhere near close to scale.
0:58
Earth is much further away from the sun,
1:00
and much, much smaller than the sun as well.
1:04
So I'll draw the earth at that point.
1:05
And at this point, the earth will
1:07
be tilted away from the sun.
1:09
So Earth's tilt does not change if you
1:12
think about the direction, or at least
1:13
over the course of a year, if we think
1:15
about relatively small periods of time.
1:17
It does not change relative to the direction
1:19
that it's pointing at in the universe.
1:22
And we'll talk about that in a second.
1:24
So let's say right over here we are pointed away from the sun.
1:28
So we're up and out of this page.
1:32
So if I wanted to put some perspective on an arrow
1:35
it would be up and-- actually it would be more like
1:39
up and out of this page.
1:42
So that's the direction.
1:43
If you were to come straight out of the North Pole.
1:44
And if you were to go straight out of the South Pole
1:46
you'd go below that circle right over there.
1:49
And if I wanted to draw the same position,
1:50
but if we're looking sideways along the plane,
1:53
the orbital plane, or the plane of Earth's orbit.
1:58
So if we're looking at it from that direction.
2:00
So let me do it this way.
2:02
If we're looking at directly sideways,
2:06
this is the sun right over here, and this
2:12
is Earth at that position.
2:18
This is Earth right over there.
2:20
If I were to draw an arrow pointing straight out
2:24
of the North Pole it would look something like this.
2:31
So this arrow and this arrow they
2:32
are both popping straight out of the North Pole.
2:35
And so when we talk about the tilt of the earth,
2:37
we're talking about the tilt of its orbital axis,
2:40
kind of this pole that could go straight between the South
2:43
Pole and the North Pole.
2:44
The angle between that and a pole that would actually
2:46
be at a 90-degree angle, or perpendicular,
2:49
to the plane of its orbit.
2:51
And so compared to if it was just straight up and down,
2:55
relative to the plane of the orbit.
2:57
So this right here is the angle of Earth's tilt.
3:00
Let me draw that a little bit bigger
3:02
just so it becomes a little bit clearer.
3:04
So if this is the plane of the orbit,
3:07
we're looking sideways along the plane of the orbit.
3:10
And this is Earth right over here.
3:15
My best attempt to draw a circle.
3:17
That is Earth.
3:19
Earth does not rotate.
3:20
Its axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the plane
3:24
of the orbit.
3:25
So this is how Earth would orbit.
3:27
This is how Earth would rotate if it was.
3:30
Earth rotates, Earth's rotational axis
3:33
is at an angle to that vertical relative
3:36
to the plane of its orbit, I guess you could say it.
3:39
It rotates at an angle like this.
3:42
So this would be the North Pole.
3:43
That is the South Pole.
3:47
And so it rotates like this.
3:52
And that angle relative to being vertical with respect
3:58
to the orbital plane, this angle right here for Earth
4:02
right now is 23.4 degrees.
4:14
And if we're talking about relatively short periods
4:17
of time, like our lifespans, that is constant.
4:20
But it is actually changing over long periods of time.
4:24
That is changing between-- and these are rough numbers--
4:27
it is changing between 22.1 degrees and 24.5 degrees,
4:36
if my sources are correct.
4:38
But that gives a rough estimate of what it's changing between.
4:41
But I want to make it clear, this
4:42
is not happening overnight.
4:44
The period to go from roughly a 22-degree angle to a 24
4:47
and 1/2-degree angle and back to a 22-degree angle is 41,000
4:52
years.
4:58
And this long-term change in the tilt, this
5:01
might play into some of the long-term climactic change.
5:04
Maybe it might contribute, on some level,
5:07
to some of the ice ages that have formed over Earth's past.
5:11
But for the sake of thinking about our annual seasons
5:13
you don't have to worry too much,
5:14
or you don't have to worry at all really
5:16
about this variation.
5:17
You really just have to know that it is tilted.
5:19
And right now it is tilted at an angle of 23.4 degrees.
5:24
Now you might say OK, I understand what the tilt is.
5:27
But how does that change the seasons
5:29
in either the Northern or that Southern Hemisphere?
5:33
And to do that, I'm going to imagine the earth when
5:36
the Northern Hemisphere is most tilted away from the sun,
5:40
and when it is most tilted towards the sun.
5:42
So remember this tilt, the direction this arrow points
5:45
into relative to the rest of the universe,
5:47
if we assume that this tilt is at 23.4%,
5:50
it's not changing throughout the year.
5:52
But depending on where it is in the orbit
5:54
it's either going to be tilting away from the sun,
5:56
as it is in this example right over here.
5:58
Or it will be tilting towards the sun.
6:03
I'll do the towards the sun in this magenta color,
6:06
or it would be tilting towards the sun.
6:08
So six months later when the earth is over here,
6:10
it's going to, relative to the rest of the universe,
6:14
it will be tilted in that same direction, up out of this page
6:21
and to the right.
6:26
Just like it was over here.
6:27
But now that it's on the other side of the sun that
6:30
makes it tilt a little bit more towards the sun.
6:32
If I were to draw it right over here,
6:36
it is now tilted towards the sun.
6:42
And what I want to think about is how much sunlight
6:47
will different parts of the planet receive.
6:49
And I'll focus on the Northern Hemisphere.
6:51
But you can make a similar argument
6:53
for the Southern Hemisphere.
6:54
I want to think about how much sunlight they receive when it's
6:57
tilted away or tilted towards the sun.
7:00
And so let's think about those two situations.
7:03
So first of all, let's think about this situation
7:05
here where we are tilted away from the sun.
7:07
So let me zoom in a little bit.
7:10
So this is the situation, where we're tilted away from the sun.
7:15
So if this is the vertical, so let me draw it.
7:18
I could actually just use this diagram.
7:20
But let me make it.
7:21
So we're tilted away from the sun like this.
7:24
I'm going to do this in a different color.
7:26
So if we have an arrow coming straight out of the North Pole
7:29
it would look like this.
7:33
And we are rotating around like that.
7:37
So we're out of the page on the left-hand side,
7:40
and then into the page on the right-hand side.
7:42
And so we're rotating towards the east, constantly.
7:45
So this arrow is in the direction of the east.
7:50
So when we're at this point in Earth's orbit, and actually
7:52
let me copy and paste this.
7:54
And I'm going to use the same exact diagram
7:56
for the different seasons.
7:58
So let me copy.
8:01
And then let me paste this exact diagram.
8:03
I'll do it over here for two different points.
8:09
So when we are here in Earth's orbit
8:13
where is the sunlight coming from?
8:14
Well, it's going to be coming from the left, at least the way
8:17
I've drawn the diagram right over here.
8:19
So the sunlight is coming from the left in this situation.
8:29
And so if you think about it, what part of the earth
8:33
is being lit by sunlight?
8:34
Or what part of the earth is in daylight,
8:36
the way I've drawn it right over here?
8:38
Well, the part that is facing the sun.
8:41
So all of this right over here is going to be in daylight.
8:46
As we rotate whatever part of the surface of the earth
8:49
enters into this yellow part right over here
8:51
will be in daylight.
8:53
But let's think about what's happening
8:55
at different parts of the earth.
8:55
So let me draw the equator, which separates our Northern
8:58
and Southern Hemispheres.
8:59
So this is the equator.
9:05
And then let me go into the Northern Hemisphere.
9:07
And I want to show you why when the North Pole is pointed away
9:10
from the sun why this is our winter.
9:13
So when we're pointed away from the sun--
9:15
Well, if we go to the Arctic Circle-- so let
9:17
me go right over here.
9:20
Let me go to some point in the Arctic Circle.
9:23
As it goes, as the earth rotates every 24 hours,
9:27
this point on the globe will just rotate around just
9:31
like that.
9:32
It will just keep rotating around just like that.
9:34
And so my question is, that point in the Arctic
9:36
Circle, as it rotates will it ever see sunlight?
9:39
Well, no, it will never see sunlight.
9:41
Because the North Pole is tilted away from the sun.
9:45
So what I'm drawing, what I'm shading here in purple,
9:49
that part of the earth, when it's completely tilted away,
9:52
will never see sunlight.
9:54
Or at least it won't see sunlight
9:55
while it's tilted away, while it's in this position,
9:58
or in this position in the orbit.
10:01
I won't say never, because once it becomes summer
10:03
they will be able to see it.
10:04
So no sunlight, no day, I guess you could say, no daylight.
10:10
If you go to slightly more southern latitudes,
10:14
so let's say you go over here.
10:15
So maybe that's the latitude of something like, I don't know,
10:18
New York or San Francisco or something like that.
10:21
Let's think about what it would see as the earth rotates
10:23
every 24 hours.
10:25
So this would be daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight,
10:28
then nighttime, nighttime, nighttime, nighttime,
10:30
nighttime.
10:31
This is now going behind the globe nighttime, nighttime,
10:33
nighttime, nighttime, nighttime, daylight, daylight, daylight,
10:36
daylight.
10:37
So if you just compare this.
10:38
So let me do the daylight in orange.
10:43
And then nighttime I will do in this bluish purplish color.
10:48
So night time over here.
10:50
So if you go to really northern latitudes,
10:52
like the Arctic Circle, they don't get any daylight
10:55
when we are tilted away from the earth.
10:57
And if we go to slightly still northern latitudes,
11:01
but not as north as the Arctic Circle, it does get daylight.
11:04
But it gets a lot less daylight.
11:05
It spends a lot less time in the daylight
11:08
than in the night time.
11:09
So notice if you say that this circumference represents
11:14
the positions over 24 hours, it spends much less time
11:17
in the daylight than it does in the nighttime.
11:24
So because, while the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away
11:28
from the earth, the latitudes in the northern hemisphere
11:32
are getting less daylight.
11:37
They are also getting less energy from the sun.
11:40
And so that's what leads to winter,
11:42
or just being generally colder.
11:45
And to see what happens in the summer
11:46
let's just go the other side.
11:48
So now we're going to the other side of our orbit
11:51
around the sun.
11:51
This is going to be six months later.
11:53
And notice the actual direction, relative to the rest
11:55
of the universe, has not changed.
11:57
We're still pointed in that same direction.
11:59
We still have a 23.4 degree tilt relative to, I guess,
12:04
being straight up and down.
12:06
But now once we're over here the light from the sun
12:08
is going to be coming from the right.
12:15
Just like that.
12:16
And now, if on this diagram at least,
12:18
this is the side of the earth that
12:21
is going to be getting the sunlight.
12:24
And let me draw the equator again,
12:27
or my best attempt to draw the equator.
12:29
I'll draw the equator in that same color
12:31
actually, in that green color.
12:34
So this separates the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere.
12:38
And now let's think about the Arctic Circle.
12:41
So let's say I'm sitting here in the Arctic Circle.
12:43
As the day goes on, as 24 hours go around,
12:46
I'll keep rotating around here.
12:47
But notice the whole time I am inside of the sun.
12:51
I'm getting no nighttime.
12:55
There is no night in the Arctic Circle
12:58
while we are tilted towards the sun.
13:00
And if we still do that fairly northern latitude,
13:03
but not as far as the Arctic Circle,
13:05
maybe in San Francisco or New York, or something like that .
13:09
If we go to that latitude, notice how much time
13:12
we spend in the sun.
13:13
So maybe we just enter.
13:15
So this is right at sunrise.
13:18
And then as the day goes on we're
13:21
in sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight,
13:23
sunlight, sunlight.
13:25
Then we hit sunset.
13:27
Then we hit nighttime, nighttime,
13:29
then we hit nighttime, and then we get sunrise again.
13:32
And so when you look at the amount of time
13:34
that something in the Northern Hemisphere
13:36
spends in the daylight versus sunlight,
13:38
you'll see it spends a lot more time in the daylight when
13:41
the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun.
13:45
So this is more day, less night.
13:53
So it is getting more energy from the sun.
13:56
So when it is tilted towards the sun
13:57
it is getting more energy from the sun.
14:00
So things will generally be warmer.
14:02
And so you are now talking about summer
14:08
in the Northern Hemisphere.
14:09
And the arguments for the Southern Hemisphere
14:11
are identical.
14:12
You could even play it right over here.
14:14
When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun,
14:16
then the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun.
14:19
And so for example, the South Pole
14:21
will have all daylight and no nighttime.
14:23
And southern latitudes will have more daylight than nighttime.
14:26
And so the south will have summer.
14:28
So this is summer in the south, in the Southern Hemisphere.
14:31
And it's winter in the north.
14:32
And then down here the Southern Hemisphere
14:34
is pointed away from the sun.
14:36
So this is winter in the Southern Hemisphere.
14:40
And you might be saying, hey Sal, what about you haven't
14:43
talked a lot about spring and fall.
14:45
Well let's think about it.
14:46
Well, if we're talking about the Northern Hemisphere,
14:48
this over here, we decided, was winter
14:51
in the Northern Hemisphere.
14:52
And we're going to rotate around the sun.
14:55
And at some point, we're going to get over here.
14:58
And then because of this tilt we aren't
15:02
pointed away or towards the sun.
15:04
We're kind of pointed I guess sideways
15:07
relative to the direction of the sun.
15:09
But this doesn't favor one hemisphere over the other.
15:13
So when we're over here in-- and this will actually
15:16
be the spring now- when we're in the spring,
15:21
both hemispheres are getting the equal amount of daylight
15:24
and sunlight, or for a given latitude
15:26
above or below the equator, they're
15:28
getting the same amount.
15:29
And the same thing is true over here
15:31
when we get to-- so this is spring.
15:33
This is the summer in the Northern Hemisphere.
15:35
Now this will be the fall in the Northern Hemisphere.
15:39
And once again, we're tilted in this direction.
15:42
And so the Northern Hemisphere isn't
15:44
tilted away or towards the sun.
15:48
And so both hemispheres are going
15:50
to get the same amount of radiation from the sun.
15:53
So you really see the extremes in the winters and the summers.
15:56
Now one thing I do want to make clear,
15:58
and I started off with just the length of day and nighttime.
16:01
Because frankly, that's maybe a little bit, or at least
16:03
in my brain, a little bit easier to visualize.
16:05
But that by itself does not account
16:07
for all of the difference between summer and winter.
16:10
Another cause, and actually this is probably the biggest cause,
16:14
is if you think about the total amount of sun.
16:16
So let's talk about the Northern Hemisphere winter.
16:19
And let's say there's a certain amount of sunlight
16:21
that is reaching the earth.
16:26
So this is the total amount of sunlight
16:28
that's reaching the earth at any point in time.
16:32
You see that much more of that is hitting the Southern
16:35
Hemisphere than the Northern Hemisphere here.
16:37
All of these, if you imagine it, all
16:40
of these rays right over here are
16:42
hitting the Southern Hemisphere.
16:45
So a majority of the rays are hitting the Southern
16:47
Hemisphere.
16:48
And much fewer are hitting the Northern Hemisphere.
16:50
So actually a smaller amount of the radiation period,
16:53
at even a given period in time, not even talking
16:55
about the amount of time you are facing the sun.
16:58
But at any given moment in time more energy
17:01
is hitting the Southern Hemisphere than the Northern.
17:04
And the opposite is true when the tilt is then
17:08
towards the sun.
17:09
And now a disproportionate amount of the sun's energy
17:16
is hitting the Northern Hemisphere.
17:19
So if you draw a bunch of, if you just
17:21
think that this is all of the energy from the sun, most
17:24
of it, all of these rays up here,
17:25
are hitting the Northern Hemisphere.
17:27
And only these down here are hitting the Southern
17:31
Hemisphere.
17:31
And on top of that, what makes it even more extreme
17:34
is that the actual angle, and of course, this is to some degree
17:37
is due to the fact that where the angle of the sun
17:40
relative to the horizon, or where you are on Earth.
17:44
But even more than that if you are on,
17:46
let's say that this is the land, and we're
17:50
talking about the winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
17:53
So let's say you're talking about,
17:55
let's say we're up over here at this northern latitude.
18:00
And we're just looking at the sun here.
18:04
And over here, you could see even
18:06
when we are closest to the sun the sun is not directly
18:09
overhead.
18:10
When we're closest to the sun the sun
18:12
still is pretty low on the horizon.
18:14
So it may be right over here when
18:16
we're closest to the sun in the winter the sun might
18:19
be right over here.
18:21
But if you look at that same latitude in the summer
18:26
when it is closest to the sun, the sun
18:30
is more close to being directly overhead.
18:33
It still won't be directly overhead.
18:35
Because we are still at a relatively northern latitude.
18:39
But the sun is going to be much higher in the sky.
18:45
And these are all related to each other.
18:46
It's kind of connected with this idea
18:48
that more energy is hitting one hemisphere or the other.
18:52
But also, when you have a, I guess
18:55
you could say, a steeper angle from the rays
18:58
of the sun with the earth, it's actually
19:00
going to be dissipated less by the atmosphere.
19:02
And let me just make it clear how this is.
19:05
So in the summer-- so let's say that that's the land.
19:10
And let's say that-- let me draw the atmosphere in white--
19:16
so all of this area right over here, this is the atmosphere.
19:18
And obviously there's not a hard boundary for the atmosphere.
19:21
But let's just say this is the densest part of the atmosphere.
19:24
In the summer, when the sun is higher in the sky,
19:32
the rays from the sun are dissipated by less atmosphere.
19:35
So they have to get through this much atmosphere.
19:38
And they're bounced off.
19:39
And they heat some of that atmosphere.
19:41
And they're absorbed before they get to the ground.
19:44
In the winter when the sun is lower in the sky,
19:49
so maybe the sun is out here.
19:51
Let me draw it a little bit.
19:53
So when the sun is lower in the sky relative to this point,
19:57
you see that the rays of sunlight
19:59
have to travel through a lot more atmosphere.
20:04
So they get dissipated much more before they
20:07
get to this point on the planet.
20:09
So all in all it is the tilt that
20:11
is causing the changes in the season.
20:13
But it's causing it for multiple reasons.
20:16
One is when you're tilted, we'll say
20:18
when you're tilted towards the sun,
20:20
you're getting more absolute hours of daylight.
20:23
Not only are you getting more absolute hours of daylight,
20:26
but at any given moment, most or more of the sun's total rays
20:30
that are hitting the earth are hitting the Northern
20:32
Hemisphere as opposed to the Southern Hemisphere.
20:35
And the stuff that's hitting the places that have summer,
20:40
it has to go through less atmosphere.
20:42
So it gets dissipated less.",shouldn't it get warm enough to melt the permanent ice cap?

0:00
Considering that I have a cold right now, I can't imagine a
0:03
more appropriate topic to make a video on than a virus.
0:08
And I didn't want to make it that thick.
0:09
A virus, or viruses.
0:14
And in my opinion, viruses are, on some level, the most
0:19
fascinating thing in all of biology.
0:21
Because they really blur the boundary between what is an
0:25
inanimate object and what is life?
0:30
I mean if we look at ourselves, or life as one of
0:33
those things that you know it when you see it.
0:35
If you see something that, it's born, it grows, it's
0:39
constantly changing.
0:40
Maybe it moves around.
0:41
Maybe it doesn't.
0:42
But it's metabolizing things around itself.
0:44
It reproduces and then it dies.
0:46
You say, hey, that's probably life.
0:48
And in this, we throw most things that we see-- or we
0:50
throw in, us.
0:52
We throw in bacteria.
0:55
We throw in plants.
0:57
I mean, I could-- I'm kind of butchering the taxonomy system
1:00
here, but we tend to know life when we see it.
1:03
But all viruses are, they're just a bunch of genetic
1:07
information inside of a protein.
1:09
Inside of a protein capsule.
1:11
So let me draw.
1:13
And the genetic information can come in any form.
1:16
So it can be an RNA, it could be DNA, it could be
1:22
single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA.
1:24
Sometimes for single stranded they'll write these two little
1:27
S's in front of it.
1:29
Let's say they are talking about double stranded DNA,
1:30
they'll put a ds in front of it.
1:32
But the general idea-- and viruses can come in all of
1:35
these forms-- is that they have some genetic information,
1:38
some chain of nucleic acids.
1:40
Either as single or double stranded RNA or single or
1:43
double stranded DNA.
1:44
And it's just contained inside some type of protein
1:47
structure, which is called the capsid.
1:49
And kind of the classic drawing is kind of an
1:53
icosahedron type looking thing.
1:56
Let me see if I can do justice to it.
1:58
It looks something like this.
2:00
And not all viruses have to look exactly like this.
2:02
There's thousands of types of viruses.
2:05
And we're really just scratching the surface and
2:06
understanding even what viruses are out there and all
2:09
of the different ways that they can essentially replicate
2:14
themselves.
2:15
We'll talk more about that in the future.
2:16
And I would suspect that pretty much any possible way
2:19
of replication probably does somehow exist
2:21
in the virus world.
2:22
But they really are just these proteins, these protein
2:25
capsids, are just made up of a bunch of little
2:27
proteins put together.
2:29
And inside they have some genetic material, which might
2:31
be DNA or it might be RNA.
2:33
So let me draw their genetic material.
2:35
The protein is not necessarily transparent, but if it was,
2:38
you would see some genetic material inside of there.
2:42
So the question is, is this thing life?
2:48
It seems pretty inanimate.
2:49
It doesn't grow.
2:50
It doesn't change.
2:51
It doesn't metabolize things.
2:53
This thing, left to its own devices, is just
2:55
going to sit there.
2:55
It's just going to sit there the way a book on a table just
2:59
sits there.
3:00
It won't change anything.
3:02
But what happens is, the debate arises.
3:06
I mean you might say, hey Sal, when you define it that way,
3:08
just looks like a bunch of molecules put together.
3:10
That isn't life.
3:11
But it starts to seem like life all of a sudden when it
3:14
comes in contact with the things that we normally
3:17
consider life.
3:18
So what viruses do, the classic example is, a virus
3:22
will attach itself to a cell.
3:24
So let me draw this thing a little bit smaller.
3:28
So let's say that this is my virus.
3:30
I'll draw it as a little hexagon.
3:32
And what it does is, it'll attach itself to a cell.
3:34
And it could be any type of cell.
3:35
It could be a bacteria cell, it could be a plant cell, it
3:39
could be a human cell.
3:41
Let me draw the cell here.
3:43
Cells are usually far larger than the virus.
3:48
In the case of cells that have soft membranes, the virus
3:51
figures out some way to enter it.
3:53
Sometimes it can essentially fuse-- I don't want to
3:58
complicate the issue-- but sometimes viruses have their
4:01
own little membranes.
4:02
And we'll talk about in a second where
4:03
it gets their membranes.
4:04
So a virus might have its own membrane like that.
4:08
That's around its capsid.
4:10
And then these membranes will fuse.
4:13
And then the virus will be able to enter into the cell.
4:16
Now, that's one method.
4:18
And another method, and they're seldom
4:19
all the same way.
4:20
But let's say another method would be, the virus
4:24
convinces-- just based on some protein receptors on it, or
4:26
protein receptors on the cells-- and obviously this has
4:29
to be kind of a Trojan horse type of thing.
4:31
The cell doesn't want viruses.
4:33
So the virus has to somehow convince the cell that it's a
4:36
non-foreign particle.
4:38
We could do hundreds of videos on how viruses work and it's a
4:41
continuing field of research.
4:43
But sometimes you might have a virus that just gets consumed
4:47
by the cell.
4:48
Maybe the cell just thinks it's something that it needs
4:49
to consume.
4:50
So the cell wraps around it like this.
4:56
And these sides will eventually merge.
4:58
And then the cell and the virus will go into it.
5:01
This is called endocytosis.
5:03
I'll just talk about that.
5:04
It just brings it into its cytoplasm.
5:06
It doesn't happen just to viruses.
5:11
But this is one mechanism that can enter.
5:12
And then in cases where the cell in question-- for example
5:17
in the situation with bacteria-- if the cell has a
5:20
very hard shell-- let me do it in a good color.
5:25
So let's say that this is a bacteria right here.
5:29
And it has a hard shell.
5:30
The viruses don't even enter the cell.
5:32
They just hang out outside of the cell like this.
5:36
Not drawing to scale.
5:37
And they actually inject their genetic material.
5:40
So there's obviously a huge-- there's a wide variety of ways
5:43
of how the viruses get into cells.
5:45
But that's beside the point.
5:46
The interesting thing is that they do get into the cell.
5:49
And once they do get into the cell, they release their
5:52
genetic material into the cell.
5:54
So their genetic material will float around.
5:56
If their genetic material is already in the form of RNA--
6:01
and I could imagine almost every possibility of different
6:05
ways for viruses to work probably do exist in nature.
6:08
We just haven't found them.
6:09
But the ones that we've already found really do kind
6:11
of do it in every possible way.
6:13
So if they have RNA, this RNA can immediately start being
6:20
used to essentially-- let's say this is the
6:23
nucleus of the cell.
6:25
That's the nucleus of the cell and it normally has the DNA in
6:28
it like that.
6:29
Maybe I'll do the DNA in a different color.
6:30
But DNA gets transcribed into RNA, normally.
6:37
So normally, the cell, this a normal working cell, the RNA
6:39
exits the nucleus, it goes to the ribosomes, and then you
6:43
have the RNA in conjunction with the tRNA and it produces
6:46
these proteins.
6:49
The RNA codes for different proteins.
6:51
And I talk about that in a different video.
6:53
So these proteins get formed and eventually, they can form
6:57
the different structures in a cell.
6:58
But what a virus does is it hijacks this process here.
7:03
Hijacks this mechanism.
7:04
This RNA will essentially go and do what the cell's own RNA
7:08
would have done.
7:09
And it starts coding for its own proteins.
7:11
Obviously it's not going to code for
7:12
the same things there.
7:13
And actually some of the first proteins it codes for often
7:15
start killing the DNA and the RNA that might otherwise
7:19
compete with it.
7:20
So it codes its own proteins.
7:22
And then those proteins start making more viral shells.
7:26
So those proteins just start constructing more and more
7:31
viral shells.
7:33
At the same time, this RNA is replicating.
7:36
It's using the cell's own mechanisms. Left to its own
7:39
devices it would just sit there.
7:40
But once it enters into a cell it can use all of the nice
7:43
machinery that a cell has around to replicate itself.
7:47
And it's kind of amazing, just the biochemistry of it.
7:51
That these RNA molecules then find themselves
7:54
back in these capsids.
7:57
And then once there's enough of these and the cell has
8:00
essentially all of its resources have been depleted,
8:05
the viruses, these individual new viruses that have
8:09
replicated themselves using all of the cell's mechanisms,
8:15
will find some way to exit the cell.
8:17
The most-- I don't want to say, typical, because we
8:20
haven't even discovered all the different types of viruses
8:23
there are-- but one that's, I guess, talked about the most,
8:26
is when there's enough of these, they'll release
8:28
proteins or they'll construct proteins.
8:30
Because they don't make their own.
8:32
That essentially cause the cell to either kill itself or
8:35
its membrane to dissolve.
8:37
So the membrane dissolves.
8:39
And essentially the cell lyses.
8:41
Let me write that down.
8:42
The cell lyses.
8:43
And lyses just means that the cell's membrane just
8:46
disappears.
8:46
And then all of these guys can emerge for themselves.
8:50
Now I talked about before that have some of these guys, that
8:53
they have their own membrane.
8:54
So how did they get there, these
8:56
kind of bilipid membranes?
8:58
Well some of them, what they do is, once they replicate
9:00
inside of a cell, they exit maybe not even killing-- they
9:07
don't have to lyse.
9:08
Everything I talk about, these are specific ways that a virus
9:11
might work.
9:12
But viruses really kind of explore-- well different types
9:15
of viruses do almost every different combination you
9:17
could imagine of replicating and coding for proteins and
9:22
escaping from cells.
9:23
Some of them just bud.
9:24
And when they bud, they essentially, you can kind of
9:26
imagine that they push against the cell
9:28
wall, or the membrane.
9:29
I shouldn't say cell wall.
9:30
The cell's outer membrane.
9:32
And then when they push against it, they take some of
9:36
the membrane with them.
9:38
Until eventually the cell will-- when this goes up
9:41
enough, this'll pop together and it'll take some of the
9:43
membrane with it.
9:44
And you could imagine why that would be useful thing
9:47
to have with you.
9:49
Because now that you have this membrane, you kind of look
9:51
like this cell.
9:52
So when you want to go infect another cell like this, you're
9:55
not going to necessarily look like a foreign particle.
9:58
So it's a very useful way to look like something that
10:02
you're not.
10:03
And if you don't think that this is creepy-crawly enough,
10:06
that you're hijacking the DNA of an organism, viruses can
10:10
actually change the DNA an organism.
10:14
And actually one of the most common examples is HIV virus.
10:18
Let me write that down.
10:21
HIV, which is a type of retrovirus, which is
10:27
fascinating.
10:28
Because what they do is, so they have RNA in them.
10:35
And when they enter into a cell, let's say that they got
10:38
into the cell.
10:39
So it's inside of the cell like this.
10:42
They actually bring along with them a protein.
10:46
And every time you say, where do they get this protein?
10:49
All of this stuff came from a different cell.
10:51
They use some other cell's amino acids and ribosomes and
10:54
nucleic acids and everything to build themselves.
10:56
So any proteins that they have in them came
10:58
from another cell.
11:00
But they bring with them, this protein reverse transcriptase.
11:04
And the reverse transcriptase takes their RNA and
11:07
codes it into DNA.
11:11
So its RNA to DNA.
11:14
Which when it was first discovered was, kind of,
11:16
people always thought that you always went from DNA to RNA,
11:19
but this kind of broke that paradigm.
11:22
But it codes from RNA to DNA.
11:23
And if that's not bad enough, it'll incorporate that DNA
11:29
into the DNA of the host cell.
11:31
So that DNA will incorporate itself into the
11:34
DNA of the host cell.
11:35
Let's say the yellow is the DNA of the host cell.
11:37
And this is its nucleus.
11:41
So it actually messes with the genetic makeup
11:44
of what it's infecting.
11:46
And when I made the videos on bacteria I said, hey for every
11:51
one human cell we have twenty bacteria cells.
11:53
And they live with us and they're useful and they're
11:56
part of us and they're 10% of our dry mass and all of that.
12:00
But bacteria are kind of along for the ride.
12:02
They don't change who we are.
12:03
But these retroviruses, they're actually changing our
12:07
genetic makeup.
12:07
I mean, my genes, I take very personally.
12:10
They define who I am.
12:12
But these guys will actually go in and
12:14
change my genetic makeup.
12:16
And then once they're part of the DNA, then just the natural
12:19
DNA to RNA to protein process will code
12:25
their actual proteins.
12:27
Or their-- what they need to-- so sometimes they'll lay
12:30
dormant and do nothing.
12:31
And sometimes-- let's say sometimes in some type of
12:33
environmental trigger, they'll start coding
12:35
for themselves again.
12:37
And they'll start producing more.
12:38
But they're producing it directly from the organism's
12:41
cell's DNA.
12:43
They become part of the organism.
12:45
I mean I can't imagine a more intimate way to become part of
12:49
an organism than to become part of its DNA.
12:51
I can't imagine any other way to
12:52
actually define an organism.
12:55
And if this by itself is not eerie enough, and just so you
13:00
know, this notion right here, when a virus becomes part of
13:06
an organism's DNA, this is called a provirus.
13:13
But if this isn't eerie enough, they estimate-- so if
13:16
this infects a cell in my nose or in my arm, as this cell
13:23
experiences mitosis, all of its offspring-- but its
13:27
offspring are genetically identical-- are going to have
13:29
this viral DNA.
13:30
And that might be fine, but at least my
13:32
children won't get it.
13:33
You know, at least it won't become part of my species.
13:35
But it doesn't have to just infect somatic cells, it could
13:38
infect a germ cell.
13:41
So it could go into a germ cell.
13:44
And the germ cells, we've learned already, these are the
13:46
ones that produce gametes.
13:49
For men, that's sperm and for women it's eggs.
13:52
But you could imagine, once you've infected a germ cell,
13:55
once you become part of a germ cell's DNA, then I'm passing
13:59
on that viral DNA to my son or my daughter.
14:02
And they are going to pass it on to their children.
14:05
And just that idea by itself is, at least to my mind.
14:10
vaguely creepy.
14:12
And people estimate that 5-8%-- and this kind of really
14:16
blurs, it makes you think about what we as humans really
14:19
are-- but the estimate is 5-8% of the human genome-- so when
14:26
I talked about bacteria I just talked about things that were
14:29
along for the ride.
14:30
But the current estimate, and I looked up this a lot.
14:33
I found 8% someplace, 5% someplace.
14:35
It's all a guess.
14:35
I mean people are doing it based on just looking at the
14:37
DNA and how similar it is to DNA in other organisms. But
14:40
the estimate is 5-8% of the human genome is from viruses,
14:47
is from ancient retroviruses that incorporated themselves
14:51
into the human germ line.
14:53
So into the human DNA.
14:55
So these are called endogenous retroviruses.
15:04
Which is mind blowing to me, because it's not just saying
15:07
these things are along for the ride or that they might help
15:09
us or hurt us.
15:10
It's saying that we are-- 5-8% of our DNA
15:14
actually comes from viruses.
15:16
And this is another thing that speaks to
15:17
just genetic variation.
15:19
Because viruses do something-- I mean this is called
15:24
horizontal transfer of DNA.
15:27
And you could imagine, as a virus goes from one species to
15:30
the next, as it goes from Species A to B, if it mutates
15:37
to be able to infiltrate these cells, it might take some--
15:41
it'll take the DNA that it already has, that
15:43
makes it, it with it.
15:45
But sometimes, when it starts coding for some of these other
15:48
guys, so let's say that this is a provirus right here.
15:52
Where the blue part is the original virus.
15:55
The yellow is the organism's historic DNA.
16:00
Sometimes when it codes, it takes up little sections of
16:04
the other organism's DNA.
16:07
So maybe most of it was the viral DNA, but it might have,
16:11
when it transcribed and translated itself, it might
16:14
have taken a little bit-- or at least when it translated or
16:16
replicated itself-- it might take a little bit of the
16:18
organism's previous DNA.
16:20
So it's actually cutting parts of DNA from one organism and
16:23
bringing it to another organism.
16:24
Taking it from one member of a species to another member of
16:27
the species.
16:27
But it can definitely go cross-species.
16:29
So you have this idea all of a sudden that DNA can jump
16:32
between species.
16:34
It really kind of-- I don't know, for me it makes me
16:36
appreciate how interconnected-- as a species,
16:39
we kind of imagine that we're by ourselves and can only
16:41
reproduce with each other and have genetic variation within
16:45
a population.
16:45
But viruses introduce this notion of horizontal transfer
16:50
via transduction.
16:53
Horizontal transduction is just the idea of, look when I
16:57
replicate this virus, I might take a little bit of the
17:00
organism that I'm freeloading off of, I might take a little
17:04
bit of their DNA with me.
17:06
And infect that DNA into the next organism.
17:09
So you actually have this DNA, this jumping,
17:11
from organism to organism.
17:13
So it kind of unifies all DNA-based life.
17:17
Which is all the life that we know on the planet.
17:20
And if all of this isn't creepy enough-- and actually
17:24
maybe I'll save the creepiest part for the end.
17:28
But there's a whole-- we could talk all about the different
17:30
classes of viruses.
17:31
But just so you're familiar with some of the terminology,
17:33
when a virus attacks bacteria, which they often do.
17:37
And we study these the most because this might be a good
17:41
alternative to antibiotics.
17:42
Because viruses that attack bacteria might-- sometimes the
17:45
bacteria is far worse for the virus-- but these are called
17:47
bacteriaphages.
17:52
And I've already talked to you about how they have their DNA.
17:55
But since bacteria have hard walls, they will just inject
17:57
the DNA inside of the bacteria.
18:00
And when you talk about DNA, this idea of a provirus.
18:06
So when a virus lyses it like this, this is
18:09
called the lytic cycle.
18:11
This is just some terminology that's good to know if you're
18:13
going to take a biology exam about this stuff.
18:16
And when the virus incorporates it into the DNA
18:18
and lays dormant, incorporates into the DNA of the host
18:22
organism and lays dormant for awhile, this is called the
18:25
lysogenic cycle.
18:28
And normally, a provirus is essentially experiencing a
18:32
lysogenic cycle in eurkaryotes, in organisms that
18:35
have a nuclear membrane.
18:38
Normally when people talk about the lysogenic cycle,
18:40
they're talking about viral DNA laying dormant in the DNA
18:44
of bacteria.
18:45
Or bacteriophage DNA laying dormant
18:48
in the DNA of bacteria.
18:51
But just to kind of give you an idea of what this, quote
18:53
unquote, looks like, right here.
18:59
I got these two pictures from Wikipedia.
19:01
One is from the CDC.
19:11
These little green dots you see right here all over the
19:14
surface, this big thing you see here, this is a white
19:17
blood cell.
19:20
Part of the human immune system.
19:21
This is a white blood cell.
19:27
And what you see emerging from the surface, essentially
19:31
budding from the surface of this white blood cell-- and
19:34
this gives you a sense of scale too--
19:36
these are HIV-1 viruses.
19:39
And so you're familiar with the terminology, the HIV is a
19:46
virus that infects white blood cells.
19:51
AIDS is the syndrome you get once your immune system is
19:54
weakened to the point.
19:55
And then many people suffer infections that people with a
19:58
strong immune system normally won't suffer from.
20:01
But this is creepy.
20:03
These things went inside this huge cell, they used the
20:06
cell's own mechanism to reproduce its own DNA or its
20:11
own RNA and these protein capsids.
20:14
And then they bud from the cell and take a little bit of
20:16
the membrane with it.
20:17
And they can even leave some of their DNA behind in this
20:20
cell's own DNA.
20:22
So they really change what the cell is all about.
20:25
This is another creepy picture.
20:26
These are bacteriaphages.
20:34
And these show you what I said before.
20:36
This is a bacteria right here.
20:38
This is its cell wall.
20:41
And it's hard.
20:42
So it's hard to just emerge into it.
20:45
Or you can't just merge, fuse membranes with it.
20:47
So they hang out on the outside of this bacteria.
20:52
And they are essentially injecting their genetic
20:55
material into the bacteria itself.
20:58
And you could imagine, just looking at the
20:59
size of these things.
21:01
I mean, this is a cell.
21:02
And it looks like a whole planet or something.
21:04
Or this is a bacteria and these
21:05
things are so much smaller.
21:06
Roughly 1/100 of a bacteria.
21:08
And these are much less than 1/100 of this cell we're
21:10
talking about.
21:11
And they're extremely hard to filter for.
21:15
To kind of keep out.
21:16
Because they are such, such small particles.
21:20
If you think that these are exotic things that exist for
21:23
things like HIV or Ebola , which they do cause, or SARS,
21:31
you're right.
21:32
But they're also common things.
21:33
I mean, I said at the beginning of this video that I
21:35
have a cold.
21:36
And I have a cold because some viruses have infected the
21:40
tissue in my nasal passage.
21:42
And they're causing me to have a runny nose and whatnot.
21:46
And viruses also cause the chicken pox.
21:48
They cause the herpes simplex virus.
21:50
Causes cold sores.
21:51
So they're with us all around.
21:53
I can almost guarantee you have some virus
21:56
with you as you speak.
21:57
They're all around you.
21:58
But it's a very
22:04
philosophically puzzling question.
22:06
Because I started with, at the beginning, are these life?
22:09
And at first when I just showed it to you, look they
22:11
are just this protein with some nucleic
22:13
acid molecule in it.
22:15
And it's not doing anything.
22:16
And that doesn't look like life to me.
22:17
It's not moving around.
22:18
It doesn't have a metabolism.
22:19
It's not eating.
22:20
It's not reproducing.
22:21
But then all of a sudden, when you think about what it's
22:23
doing to cells and how it uses cells to kind of reproduce.
22:27
It kind of like-- in business terms it's asset light.
22:29
It doesn't need all of the machinery because it can use
22:31
other people's machinery to replicate itself.
22:35
You almost kind of want to view it as a
22:38
smarter form of life.
22:39
Because it doesn't go through all of the trouble of what
22:42
every other form of life has.
22:44
It makes you question what life is, or even what we are.
22:47
Are we these things that contain DNA or are we just
22:51
transport mechanisms for the DNA?
22:54
And these are kind of the more important things.
22:56
And these viral infections are just battles between different
22:59
forms of DNA and RNA and whatnot.
23:02
Anyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.
23:04
But hopefully this gives you a good idea of what viruses are
23:08
and why they really are, in my mind, the most fascinating
23:12
pseudo organism in all of biology.",What's the red thing on the micrograph?

- [Voiceover] Check out this fine looking sneaker
0:02
right here, we're gonna use this shoe to illustrate
0:04
some more challenging normal force problems
0:07
and we're gonna take this as an opportunity to discuss
0:09
a lot of the misconceptions that people have about
0:11
the normal force.
0:13
So one misconception is that people forget
0:15
normal force is a contact force.
0:17
You only have a normal force when two surfaces
0:20
are in contact, so when the shoe's in contact with
0:22
the floor, there will be a normal force on the shoe
0:24
and a normal force on the floor.
0:26
Or if the shoe were in contact with the wall,
0:28
there would be a normal force on the wall
0:30
and a normal force on the shoe.
0:32
But if the shoe were just falling through the air,
0:34
here's what happens for a lot of people.
0:36
Let's say the shoe's just falling,
0:37
and you got a question and the question said,
0:39
draw the forces that are exerted on the shoe
0:41
while it's falling through the air.
0:42
People get so used to having normal forces
0:44
that they make a mistake, they do this, they say alright,
0:48
let me draw it over here.
0:50
They say there's a gravitational force and that's just fine.
0:52
There will be a gravitational force, there's always gravity,
0:54
the Earth's always pulling down,
0:56
and it pulls down with an amount mg.
0:58
But they're so used to having normal forces,
1:00
I mean normal forces pop up in so many different questions
1:03
it's almost just like a reflex,
1:05
people just automatically put, whoop, there's a normal force
1:08
there's gotta be a normal force, right?
1:10
There's always a normal force?
1:11
But there isn't always a normal force, if the shoe
1:13
is not in contact with the surface, you don't have a normal
1:16
force, it's not until this shoe makes it to the ground
1:20
or touches another surface that you'll have that
1:22
normal force, so if we stick this shoe right here
1:25
and we let it rest on the ground,
1:27
now you'll have a normal force and that normal force
1:29
will point up, and this is what people wanna say
1:32
and it's true when the surfaces are in contact
1:35
but if they're not in contact,
1:36
you don't have a normal force.
1:38
And then here's another misconception,
1:40
people think the normal force is always equal to mg,
1:43
because again, it's equal to mg
1:45
in so many different scenarios that people just
1:48
wanna say well it's always equal to mg, and again,
1:50
it's just like a reaction.
1:51
People see normal force, they just automatically replace it
1:54
with mg, and that'll be true in the simple case,
1:57
but I'll show you coming up how that's not gonna be true
1:59
and what you do if it's not true.
2:01
So for instance if we wanted to find what's the normal force
2:03
if this shoe has a mass m,
2:06
so let's assume that the shoe has a mass m,
2:08
what would the normal force be?
2:10
We can use Newton's second law,
2:11
we can always use Newton's second law,
2:13
so we'll say that acceleration equals the net force
2:17
divided by the mass, and in this case,
2:21
since these are vertical forces,
2:23
I'm gonna consider the acceleration
2:24
in the vertical direction and the net force
2:26
in the vertical direction.
2:28
And so what is the acceleration for the shoe vertically
2:30
if it's just sitting here in a room, sitting on the ground,
2:33
at rest and not changing it's motion,
2:35
not changing it's velocity, the acceleration's just gonna
2:37
be zero, so the vertical acceleration,
2:40
acceleration, excuse me, should be zero.
2:42
For the net force, I've got an upward normal force,
2:46
so I'm gonna make that positive,
2:48
if fn represents the magnitude of the normal force,
2:50
this would be positive Fn, I'm just gonna put positive here
2:54
even though I don't really need it but to show you
2:56
that it's upward, we're gonna consider upward to be positive
2:58
and then I've got this downward gravitational force,
3:00
and if mg represents the size of the gravitational force,
3:04
I'm gonna put a negative here to represent that that
3:06
gravitational force is down, and then I divide by
3:09
the mass of the shoe and if I do this I get that
3:13
these two forces, this net force divided by the mass
3:16
has to be zero, according to Newton's second law.
3:19
But I can multiply both sides by the mass and if I do that,
3:22
the left hand side is still zero,
3:24
and I'll get that this is equal to the normal force
3:27
minus mg, so I'll have normal force minus mg,
3:32
and if I finally solve for the normal force,
3:35
I'll get that the normal force is gonna equal mg,
3:38
and a lot of people are like yeah I already knew that, duh.
3:42
Normal force is always equal to mg, but it's only equal
3:45
to mg in this case because those were the only two forces,
3:47
look at the assumptions we made.
3:49
Only two forces were the normal force and the
3:51
gravitational force and we assumed that the acceleration
3:54
was zero, if you relax any of those requirements,
3:57
normal force is no longer going to be equal to mg.
4:00
And it was on a horizontal surface,
4:02
if you relax that requirement, again, there's no reason
4:05
to think this has to be in the Y direction,
4:07
you could have normal forces in the X direction.
4:09
So let's slowly, one point at a time,
4:12
try to relax some of these requirements and see what
4:14
that does to the normal force.
4:16
In other words, what if we just added another force?
4:19
What if we let the shoe sit here on the ground
4:22
and I push down on it?
4:23
So I'm pushing down on this shoe, I'm gonna say I'm pushing
4:26
down with a force, I'll just call it F1, so a force
4:31
of magnitude, F1, and it's pointing downward,
4:34
how would that change this now?
4:36
So this is, we're stepping it up, this is gonna be a little
4:38
harder, what do we do?
4:40
Well the acceleration is still zero, let's say it's still
4:42
just sitting there, so we don't have to do anything
4:45
with the left hand side that's still zero,
4:47
multiplying by m still makes that zero,
4:49
but now up here in this force up here,
4:50
I'm gonna have another force, I'm gonna have F1,
4:53
that points down so in my force diagram
4:55
I'd have another force that points down, F1,
4:58
that means I'd have to subtract it when I find
5:01
the net vertical force, I'd have F1,
5:03
this would be a negative F1 right here,
5:06
and when I solve for Fn I'd add mg to both sides
5:09
to cancel it and then I'd add F1 to both sides
5:12
to cancel this F1, this negative F1,
5:14
and I'd get mg plus F1.
5:17
So I get the normal force is gonna be bigger,
5:19
bigger by an amount F2 and that makes sense,
5:22
if you push down on a, oh no F2, wow,
5:25
F1, sorry about that, it's gonna be bigger by an amount F1,
5:28
so if I push down with an extra 10 Newtons of force,
5:32
there's more pressure, right?
5:34
That makes sense, the pressure between the ground
5:36
and the shoe is gonna be greater, you're squashing
5:37
these two surfaces together with greater force,
5:40
so the ground's gotta push up to keep the shoe
5:42
out of the surface, that's what this normal force does,
5:45
it exerts a force to keep the object out of the surface,
5:48
to keep the object from penetrating that surface,
5:51
so if I push down on an object, into a surface,
5:54
that normal force increases and it increases by the amount
5:57
you're pushing down, so that makes sense.
6:00
If you had an upward force, let's say you had an
6:01
upward force, someone's pulling up on the shoe
6:04
while you push down, you're fighting over the shoe,
6:06
you're wrestling over it with somebody because they just,
6:09
they love the shoe, they recognize the beauty of the shoe,
6:12
well crafted shoe, so if there's an F2 pointing up,
6:15
we now have another force in our diagram,
6:17
that force would point up, we would call this F2,
6:20
over here how would this change?
6:22
Again, still acceleration to zero,
6:24
but I'd have an upward force now so I'd have to add
6:26
F2 vertically because that's another force,
6:29
I'd have a plus F2 right here,
6:31
and then over here when I solve for this,
6:34
I add mg to both sides, I add F1 to both sides,
6:37
and I have to subtract F2 from both sides
6:40
so now I'd have Fn is mg plus F1 minus F2,
6:44
this also makes sense, if you pull up on a shoe,
6:47
you're relieving some of the pressure between the shoe
6:50
and the other surface, the shoe and the floor.
6:53
So if I pull up with 20 Newtons I'm gonna reduce
6:56
the normal force by 20 Newtons because I'm relieving
6:58
some of that pressure between the shoe and the floor.
7:01
Let's make it even harder.
7:03
Let's make this thing scary, sometimes you get really
7:06
crazy problems and you don't know what to do, let's say,
7:08
we have another force, let's say this force is gonna be
7:12
a diagonal force, so we're gonna pull this way.
7:17
That was not a well drawn force, let me draw it like this.
7:21
So we got a force this way at an angle.
7:24
Now we're talking, this is F3.
7:28
F3, at an angle of, we'll call it Fi, so the angle from
7:32
this horizontal line here is Fi.
7:37
Now what do we do?
7:38
So I've got this crooked angle in here, now this F3 is
7:41
gonna be pointing this way, so I'll add another force
7:44
to my force diagram, and I can figure out how to include
7:48
this into my vertical force version of Newton's second law,
7:53
I can't include the entire F3 force, here's a mistake
7:56
people make, they wanna just add F3 or subtract F3,
7:58
but I can't do that, this is the vertical form of
8:02
Newton's second law, this is only applying to the vertical
8:04
direction, the Y direction, but F3 is pointing both
8:07
vertically and horizontally.
8:09
So I have to only include the vertical part of F3
8:12
in this formula so what I have to do is say that alright
8:15
F3 is gonna have a vertical component,
8:17
that vertical component, I'll call it F3 Y,
8:20
for F3 in the vertical direction.
8:22
And it's also gonna have a horizontal component.
8:24
I'll just call that F3 X for F3 in the horizontal direction.
8:29
So if I wanna solve for F3 Y, I'll just use the definition
8:32
of sine and I know to use sine because this side is
8:35
the opposite to this angle, I know sine
8:38
relates opposite side, so I'm gonna write this as
8:40
sine of phi is gonna equal the opposite side is F3 Y
8:45
so F3 in the Y direction divided by F3 total,
8:50
the total magnitude of F3, and if I solve this for F3 Y,
8:53
I get F3 in the Y direction is gonna equal F3 times sine
8:59
of Fi, now I can include this in my force, my net force,
9:03
because this points upward, so since it points up,
9:07
this vertical component's gonna add a plus,
9:10
F3 sin theta over here, or sorry not theta,
9:14
it's gonna be F3 sin Fi, and I'll have a plus F3 sin fi
9:20
right here, and when we subtract this F3 sin phi from the
9:24
other side to get it over to here,
9:27
we're gonna get minus F3 sine phi and that makes sense
9:31
because if we pull up, we know we're reducing some
9:34
of the pressure, we'll reduce the normal force,
9:37
so this component, look at this component points up,
9:39
it's reducing some of the pressure
9:41
on the bottom of the shoe, the normal force goes down,
9:44
and so we subtract the F3 sin fi.
9:47
And one more way to step this problem up to the next level
9:50
would be to say that this room isn't really just a room,
9:53
maybe it's an elevator,
9:54
and this elevator is accelerating upward
9:56
with some acceleration A zero, in that case,
10:00
nothing would change on this right hand side.
10:02
Sometimes people think if there's acceleration,
10:04
there's gonna be some new force, but if these are the forces
10:07
those are the forces, the only thing that changes over here
10:10
if this was in an elevator that's accelerating up,
10:13
is that instead of zero, you'd replace this with a zero
10:16
or whatever the acceleration is, that's it,
10:19
that's the only change, you could still solve for fn
10:21
the same way, when you multiply by m it wouldn't be
10:23
zero on the left anymore, you'd have a m a zero,
10:26
and then a plus m a zero when you solve
10:30
for the normal force.
10:32
Alright, I think we've pretty much exhausted
10:34
this example of a shoe on the floor,
10:36
it's probably harder than any example you'll see
10:39
but now you know how to handle any type of force
10:41
you might meet or acceleration.","May we say that the normal force is a III law pair of the force that the shoe is exerting on the ground, which, in turn, is equal to the force (push) exerted on the shoe by some other object?"

We are being asked, what is the smallest-- this
0:04
is a little typo here-- what is the smallest
0:07
possible sum of squares of two numbers
0:10
if their product is negative 16?
0:14
So let's say that these two numbers are x and y.
0:19
So how could we define the sum of the squares of the two
0:22
numbers?
0:23
So I'll just call that the sum of the squares,
0:25
s for sum of the squares, and it would just
0:28
be equal to x squared plus y squared.
0:32
And this is what we want to minimize.
0:35
We want to minimize s.
0:40
Now, right now s is expressed as a function of x and y.
0:43
We don't know how to minimize with respect to two variables,
0:46
so we have to get this in terms of only one variable.
0:48
And lucky for us, they give us another piece of information.
0:51
Their product is negative 16.
0:54
So x times y is equal to negative 16.
1:00
So let's say we wanted this expression
1:03
right over here only in terms of x.
1:05
Well, then we can figure out what
1:07
y is in terms of x and then substitute.
1:10
So let's do that right over here.
1:11
If we divide both sides by x, we get y is equal to negative 16
1:16
over x.
1:17
And so let's replace our y in this expression
1:20
with negative 16 over x.
1:23
So then we would get our sum of squares
1:27
as a function of x is going to be
1:29
equal to x squared plus y squared.
1:32
y is negative 16 over x.
1:38
And then that's what we will now square.
1:41
So this is equal to x squared plus, what is this?
1:46
256 over x squared.
1:48
Or we could write that as 256x to the negative 2 power.
1:54
That is the sum of our squares that we now want to minimize.
1:59
Well, to minimize this, we would want
2:02
to look at the critical points of this, which
2:04
is where the derivative is either 0 or undefined,
2:07
and see whether those critical points are possibly
2:09
a minimum or a maximum point.
2:11
They don't have to be, but those are
2:12
the ones if we have a minimum or a maximum point,
2:15
they're going to be one of the critical points.
2:16
So let's take the derivative.
2:18
So the derivative s prime-- let me
2:21
do this in a different color-- s prime of x.
2:24
I'll do it right over here, actually.
2:26
The derivative s prime of x with respect
2:28
to x is going to be equal to 2x times
2:32
negative 2 times 2x plus 256 times negative 2.
2:38
So that's minus 512x to the negative 3 power.
2:45
Now, this is going to be undefined when x is equal to 0.
2:52
But if x is equal to 0, then y is undefined.
2:55
So this whole thing breaks down.
2:57
So that isn't a useful critical point, x equals 0.
3:01
So let's think about any other ones.
3:02
Well, it's defined everywhere else.
3:04
So let's think about where the derivative is equal to 0.
3:07
So when does this thing equal 0?
3:09
So when does 2x minus 512x to the negative 3 equal 0?
3:16
Well, we can add 512x to the negative 3 to both sides.
3:19
So you get 2x is equal to 512x to the negative third power.
3:26
We can multiply both sides times x to the third power
3:32
so all the x's go away on the right-hand side.
3:34
So you get 2x to the fourth is equal to 512.
3:40
We can divide both sides by 2, and you
3:42
get x to the fourth power is equal to 256.
3:49
And so what is the fourth root of 256?
3:52
Well, we could take the square root of both sides just
3:54
to help us here.
3:56
So let's see.
3:57
So it's going to be x squared is going to be equal to 256
4:01
is 16 squared.
4:03
So this is 16.
4:05
This is going to be x squared is equal to 16 or x is equal to 4.
4:12
Now that's our only critical point we have,
4:15
so that's probably the x value that
4:17
minimizes our sum of squares right over here.
4:19
But let's make sure it's a minimum value.
4:21
And to do that, we can just do our second derivative test.
4:24
So let's figure out.
4:25
Let's take the second derivative s
4:27
prime prime of x and figure out if we are concave upwards
4:31
or downwards when x is equal to 4.
4:34
So s prime prime of x is going to be equal to 2.
4:37
And then we're going to have negative 3 times negative 512.
4:41
So I'll just write that as plus 3 times 512.
4:45
That's going to be 1,536.
4:48
Is that right?
4:48
Yeah, 3 times 500 is 1,500, 3 times 12
4:51
is 36, x to the negative 4 power.
4:57
And this thing right over here is actually
4:59
going to be positive for any x.
5:04
x to the negative 4, even if the negative x value,
5:08
that's going to be positive.
5:09
Everything else is positive.
5:10
This thing is always positive.
5:12
So we are always in a concave upwards situation.
5:18
Concave upwards means that our graph might look something
5:22
like that.
5:23
Actually, I don't want to draw the little squiggle.
5:25
It might look something like that.
5:26
And you see there's a reason why the second derivative implies
5:29
concave upwards, a second derivative positive
5:31
means that our derivative is constantly increasing.
5:35
So the derivative is constantly increasing.
5:36
It's negative, less negative, even less negative.
5:39
Let me do it in a different color.
5:41
You see it's negative, less negative, even less negative,
5:45
0, positive, more positive.
5:47
So it's increasing over the entire place.
5:50
So if you have a critical point where
5:53
the derivative is equal to 0, so the slope is equal to 0,
5:57
and it's concave upwards, you see pretty clearly
6:00
that we have minimized the function.
6:04
So what is y going to be equal to?
6:06
We actually don't even have to figure out
6:08
what y has to be equal to in order
6:10
to minimize the sum of squares.
6:11
We could just put it back into this.
6:13
But just for fun, we see that y would be negative 16 over x.
6:17
So y would be equal to negative 4.
6:20
And we could just figure out now what our sum of squares is.
6:23
Our minimum sum of squares is going
6:26
to be equal to 4 squared, which is 16 plus negative 4
6:31
squared plus another 16, which is equal to 32.
6:35
Now I know some of you might be thinking, hey,
6:37
I could have done this without calculus.
6:39
I could have just tried out numbers whose product is
6:41
negative 16 and I probably would have tried out 4 and negative 4
6:45
in not too much time and then I would
6:47
have been able to maybe figure out it's lower than if I did
6:49
2 and negative 8 or negative 2 and 8 or 1 and 16.
6:53
And that's true, you probably would
6:55
have been able to do that.
6:56
But you still wouldn't have been able to feel good
6:58
that that was a minimum value, because you wouldn't
7:00
have tried out 4.01 or 4.0011.
7:03
In fact, you couldn't have tried out all of the possible values.
7:06
Remember, we didn't say that this is only integers.
7:08
It just happened to be that our values just worked out
7:12
to be integers in this situation.
7:14
You can imagine what would happen if the problem wasn't
7:17
if their product is negative 16, but what
7:19
if their product is negative 17?
7:23
Or what if the product is negative 16.5?
7:25
Or what if their product was pi squared?
7:28
Then you wouldn't be able to try everything else out
7:30
and you would have to resort to doing
7:32
what we did in this video.","5:19 it says its concave upwards, yet when plugged into a graphing calculator it shows to be concave dowards?"

Over many videos now, we've been talking
0:02
about how every interstellar object is moving away
0:06
from Earth.
0:07
And we've also been talking about how the further something
0:10
is away from Earth, the faster it's moving.
0:13
What I want to do in this video is
0:14
to put a little bit of numbers behind it,
0:16
or even better conceptualize what we've been talking about.
0:19
So one way to think about it is that, if at an early stage
0:22
in the universe, I were to pick some points.
0:24
So that's one point, another point, another point,
0:28
another point.
0:30
Let me just pick nine points so that I have a proper grid.
0:33
So this at an early stage in the universe.
0:36
If we fast forward a few billion years--
0:39
and I'm clearly not drawing it to scale-- all of these points
0:42
have all moved away from each other.
0:45
So this point is over here-- actually, let me
0:48
draw another column, just to make it clear.
0:54
So if we fast forward a few billion years,
0:57
the universe has expanded.
0:58
And so everything has moved away from everything.
1:01
And let me color code it a little bit.
1:03
Let me make this point magenta.
1:05
So this point, the magenta point is now here.
1:09
This green point has now moved away from the magenta point.
1:13
And now this blue point has now moved away
1:17
from the magenta point in that direction.
1:20
And we could keep going.
1:21
This yellow point is maybe over here now.
1:24
I think you get the general idea.
1:26
And I'll just draw the other yellow points.
1:29
So they've all moved away from each other.
1:34
So there's no center here.
1:35
Everything is just expanding away from things next to it.
1:39
And what you can see here is not only did this thing expand away
1:42
from this, but this thing expanded away
1:44
from this even further.
1:46
Because it had this expansion, plus this expansion.
1:50
Or another way to think about it is,
1:55
the apparent velocity with which something is expanding
1:58
is going to be proportional to how far it is.
2:00
Because every point in between is also expanding away.
2:04
And just to review a little bit of the visualization
2:06
of this-- one way to think of this,
2:08
if you think of the universe as an infinite flat sheet.
2:11
You can imagine that we're just taking
2:12
a sheet of, I don't know, some type of sheet
2:16
of stretchy material and just stretching it out.
2:19
We're just stretching it out.
2:21
That's if we kind of imagine a more infinite universe that
2:24
just goes off in every direction.
2:25
We're just stretching that infinite sheet out.
2:28
So it has no boundaries, but we're still stretching it out.
2:30
Another way to visualize it-- and this what we did earlier
2:33
on-- Is you can imagine that the universe is the three
2:38
dimensional surface of a four dimensional sphere.
2:41
Or the three dimensional surface of a hyper-sphere.
2:44
So at an early stage in the universe,
2:45
the sphere looked like this.
2:50
And these points here-- that magenta point
2:53
is right over here.
2:54
The green point is right over there.
2:57
Then we add the blue point up here.
3:00
And then let me just draw the rest of the yellow points.
3:03
And the yellow points are here.
3:05
They're all on the surface of this sphere.
3:09
Obviously I'm only dealing with two dimensions right now
3:12
and it's nearly impossible, or maybe impossible,
3:14
to imagine a three dimensional surface of a four
3:16
dimensional sphere.
3:17
But the analogy holds.
3:19
If this is a surface the balloon,
3:21
or the surface of a bubble, if the bubble
3:23
were to expand over a few billion years-- and once again,
3:29
not drawn to scale.
3:30
So now we have a bigger bubble here.
3:33
This part of the surface is all going to expand.
3:36
So once again, you have your magenta.
3:38
You have your blue dot.
3:41
You have your green dot right over here.
3:45
And then let me just draw the rest in yellow.
3:47
So they will have all expanded away from each other
3:51
on the surface of this sphere.
3:53
And just to make it clear that this is a sphere,
3:56
let me draw some contour lines.
3:58
So this is a contour line.
3:59
Just to make it clear that we are
4:00
on the surface of an actual sphere.
4:05
Now with that out of the way, let's think
4:07
about what is the apparent velocity with which things
4:11
are moving away?
4:11
And remember, we're going have to say, not only how far things
4:14
are moving away, but we're going to say how far they are moving
4:17
away from-- if the observer is us--
4:20
depending on how far they already are.
4:23
So what we're going to do-- we could say
4:26
is-- let me write this down.
4:28
All objects moving away from each other.
4:43
And the apparent relative velocity
4:56
is proportional to distance.
5:04
And what I've just written down here--
5:06
and this is why I wrote it down--
5:07
this is a rephrasing of, essentially, Hubble's Law.
5:14
And he came up with this by just observing
5:16
that when he looks-- especially the further out he looks,
5:18
the more redshifted objects are.
5:21
And not only were they moving faster and faster away
5:23
from Earth, but they seem to be moving faster and faster
5:27
away from each other.
5:28
So this is just a restating of Hubble's Law.
5:31
Or another way to say it is, from any point,
5:35
let's say from the earth, the velocity
5:37
that something appears to be moving
5:39
is going to be some constant times the distance
5:46
that it is away from the observer.
5:48
In this case, we are the observer.
5:50
And we put this little zero-- so this H here
5:53
is called Hubble's Constant.
5:59
And it's a very non-constant constant.
6:01
Because this constant will change depending
6:04
on where we are in the evolution of the universe.
6:07
So we put this little zero here, this little sub 0 right
6:11
over here, to show that this is Hubble's Constant right now.
6:16
And when we talk about distance, we're
6:17
talking about the proper distance right now.
6:25
And this has to be very important
6:26
because that proper distance is constantly
6:28
changing as the universe expands.
6:30
So the now will actually change slightly
6:33
from the beginning of this video to the end of this video.
6:35
But we could roughly say in kind of our current period of time.
6:40
And when we say proper distance, we're
6:41
talking about if you actually had rulers.
6:43
And if you were to just lay them down instantaneously--
6:46
obviously we can't do something like that.
6:48
But we can imagine doing something like that.
6:50
So that's what we're talking about it.
6:51
So just to give a sense of, or do a little bit of math
6:55
of how fast things are actually moving apart-- let
7:04
me actually write it someplace where
7:05
I have more space-- the current Hubble
7:08
Constant is 70.6 plus or minus 3.1.
7:16
So we have observed some variation here.
7:19
There is some error to our actual measurements.
7:23
Kilometers per second per megaparsec.
7:33
And remember, a parsec is roughly 3.2, 3.3 light years.
7:39
So another way to think about it is,
7:42
if this is where we are in the universe right now.
7:47
And if this object right over here--
7:49
if this distance right over here is one megaparsec, so 1 million
7:55
parsecs.
7:56
Or 3.26 million light years from Earth.
8:03
So just so we have a sense, this is
8:06
roughly 3.26 million light years from Earth.
8:11
Then this object will appear to be moving away.
8:14
Although it's not moving in space,
8:16
just the space that it's in is stretching in such a way
8:18
that it looks to be moving at, based on its redshift,
8:25
70.6 kilometers per second away from us.
8:31
So this is a huge velocity.
8:33
70.6 kilometers per second.
8:38
So this is a pretty fast velocity.
8:42
But you have to remember, this is over one megaparsec.
8:45
The Andromeda galaxy is not even a megaparsec away.
8:49
It is about 2.5 million light years.
8:51
So it's about 0.7 or 0.8 of a megaparsec.
8:55
So if you look at a point in space
8:56
a little bit further than the Andromeda galaxy,
8:59
it will look to be, right now, receding
9:01
at about 70.6 kilometers per second.
9:04
But what if you were to go twice that distance?
9:06
If you were to look at something that's almost 7 light years
9:09
away?
9:10
2 megaparsecs away?
9:12
So if you were to look at this object over here,
9:18
how fast would that be receding?
9:20
Well, if you just look at it over here,
9:22
it's 2 megaparsecs away.
9:24
So it's going to be twice this.
9:26
You're just going to multiply its distance-- 2
9:28
megaparsecs times this.
9:30
The megaparsecs cancel out.
9:31
So 70.6 times 2 is-- it's going to look to be moving,
9:38
It's not moving in space.
9:39
Remember, space is just stretching.
9:42
So its velocity, It's apparent velocity, will be 70.6 times 2.
9:46
So that's 141.2 kilometers per second.
9:51
And one question you say, well how did Hubble
9:54
know-- you can observe the redshift of objects moving away
9:58
from us.
9:58
But how did he know that they were moving away
10:00
from each other?
10:01
Well, if you were look at the redshift of this object,
10:03
and say, wow, that's moving away is 70.6 kilometers per second.
10:06
And then you were to look at the redshift of this
10:08
and say, wow, that's moving away from us
10:10
at 141.2 kilometers per second.
10:13
Then you also know that these two objects are moving away
10:17
from each other at 70.6 kilometers per second.
10:22
And we could keep doing this over different distances.
10:24
But hopefully this gives you a little bit bigger sense
10:28
of things.
10:29
And just remember, even though I said this is a huge distance--
10:31
a megaparsec is further than it is to the Andromeda galaxy.
10:35
The Andromeda galaxy is the nearest large galaxy to us.
10:38
There are some smaller galaxies that
10:40
are closer to us that are kind of satellite
10:42
galaxies around the Milky Way.
10:43
But the Andromeda is the nearest large galaxy to us.
10:48
And we also know that we're talking about hundreds
10:51
of billions of galaxies in just the observable universe.
10:57
So very quickly, as you go near the edge
10:59
of the observable universe, these velocities,
11:03
the apparent distance at which things move are moving away
11:06
from us, start to become pretty significant.","The Andromeda galaxy is it going to crash with us if we are moving away from each other and also sal said the we don`t move but the universe does so, is the universe pushing Andromeda and us together?"

Animal carcass again.
0:10
Animal.
0:11
The thing that all of these other things
0:13
have in common is that they're made
0:14
out of the same basic building block, the animal cell.
0:17
(music)
0:27
Animals are made up of your
0:28
run-of-the-mill eukaryotic cells.
0:30
These are called eukaryotic because they
0:32
have a true kernel in the Greek, a good nucleus.
0:36
That contains the DNA and calls the shots
0:38
for the rest of the cell, also containing
0:40
a bunch of organelles.
0:41
There's a bunch of different kinds of organelles
0:43
and they all have very specific functions.
0:45
All of this is surrounded by the cell membrane.
0:48
Of course, plants are eukaryotic cells too,
0:50
but theirs are set up a little bit differently.
0:51
Of course, they have oranelles that allow them
0:53
to make their own food, which is super nice.
0:55
We don't have those.
0:56
Also, their cell membrane is actually a cell wall
0:58
that's made of cellulose.
0:59
It's rigid which is why plants can't dance.
1:01
If you want to know all about plant cells,
1:03
we did a whole video on it and you can click on it hit here,
1:06
if it's online yet; it might not be.
1:08
A lot of the stuff in this video is going to apply
1:10
to all eukaryotic cells, which includes
1:12
plants and fungi and protists.
1:14
Rigid cell walls, that's cool and all,
1:16
but one of the reasons that animals
1:17
have been so successful is that their
1:19
flexible membrane, in addition to allowing
1:21
them the ability to dance, gives animals
1:23
the flexibility to create a bunch of different
1:24
cell types and organ types and tissue types
1:27
that could never be possible in a plant.
1:29
Cell walls that protect plants and give them structure
1:31
prevent them from evolving complicated nerve structures
1:34
and muscle cells that allow animals to be
1:37
such a powerful force for eating plants.
1:40
Animals can move around, find shelter and food,
1:42
find things to mate with, all that good stuff.
1:44
In fact, the ability to move oneself around
1:47
using specialized muscle tissue has been
1:49
100% trademarked by kindgom animalia.
1:51
Voiceover: What about protozoans?
1:53
Man: Excellent point.
1:55
What about protozoans?
1:56
They don't have specialized muscle tissue.
1:58
They move around with cilia and flagella and that kind of thing.
2:01
Way back in 1665, British scientist
2:04
Robert Hooke discovered cells with his
2:06
kind of crude beta version microscope.
2:08
He called them cells because they looked like
2:10
bare, spartan Monk's bedrooms with
2:13
not much going on inside.
2:14
Hooke was a smart guy and everything,
2:16
but he could not have been more wrong
2:18
about what was going on inside of a cell.
2:19
There is a whole lot going on inside of a eukaryotic cell.
2:22
It's more like a city than a Monk's cell.
2:24
In fact, let's go with that.
2:25
A cell is like a city.
2:27
It has defined geographical limits,
2:29
a ruling government, power plants, roads,
2:31
waste treatment plants, a police force,
2:32
industry, all the things a booming metropolis
2:35
needs to run smoothly.
2:36
But, this city does not have one of those
2:38
hippy governments where everybody votes on stuff
2:40
and talks things out at town hall meetings
2:42
and crap like that.
2:42
Nope.
2:43
Think fascist Italy circa 1938.
2:46
Think Kim Jong-Il's, I mean Kim Jong-Un's
2:48
North Korea and you might be getting a closer
2:50
idea of how eukaryotic cells do their business.
2:52
Let's start out with city limits.
2:53
As you approach the city of Eukaryopolis,
2:56
there's a chance that you will notice something
2:58
that a traditional city never has,
3:00
which is either cilia or flagella.
3:01
Some eukaryotic cells have either one or the other
3:04
of these structures; cilia being a bunch
3:06
of tiny little arms that wriggle around,
3:07
flagella being one long whip-like tail.
3:10
Some cells have neither.
3:11
Sperm cells, for instance, have flagella
3:13
and our lungs and throat cells have cilia
3:15
that push mucus up and out of our lungs.
3:17
Cilia and flagella are made out of long
3:19
protein fibers called microtubules,
3:21
and they both have the same basic structure;
3:22
nine pairs of microtubules forming a ring
3:25
around two central microtubles,
3:26
this is often called the 9+2 structure.
3:29
Anyway, that's just so you know when you're
3:31
approaching the city, watch out
3:32
for the cilia and flagella.
3:34
If you make it past the cilia, you will encounter
3:36
what is called a cell membrane, which is
3:38
a kind of squishy, not rigid plant cell wall,
3:41
which totally encloses the city and all of its contents.
3:44
It's also in charge of monitoring
3:46
what comes in and out of the cell,
3:47
kind of like the fascist border police.
3:49
The cell membrane has selective pemeability,
3:51
meaning that it can choose what molecules
3:53
come in and out of the cells, for the most part.
3:56
I did an entire video on this
3:58
which you can check out right here.
4:01
The landscape of Eukaryopolis, important to note,
4:03
is kind of wet and squishy; it's a bit of a swampland.
4:07
Each eukaryotic cell is filled with a solution
4:09
of water and nutrients called cytoplasm.
4:11
Inside of the cytoplasm is a scaffolding
4:14
called the cytoskeleton.
4:15
It's basically just a bunch of protein strands
4:17
that reinforce the cell.
4:18
Centrosomes are a special part of this reinforcement.
4:21
They assemble long microtubules out of proteins
4:23
that act like steel girders that hold
4:25
all the cities' building together.
4:26
The cytoplasm provides the infrastructure
4:28
necessary for all the organelles to do all of their
4:31
awesome amazing business, with the notable exception
4:33
of the nucleus, which has its own kind of cytoplasm
4:36
called the nucleoplasm, which is a more luxurious, premium
4:40
environment befitting the cell's beloved leader.
4:43
We'll get to that in a minute.
4:43
First, let's talk about the cell's highway system.
4:46
The endoplasmic reticulum, or just ER,
4:48
are organelles that create a network of membranes
4:50
that carry stuff around the cell.
4:52
These membranes are phospolipid bilayers
4:53
same as in the cell membrane.
4:54
There are two types of ER.
4:56
There's the rough and the smooth;
4:57
fairly similar, but slightly different shapes,
4:59
slightly different functions.
5:00
The rough ER looks all bumpy because it has
5:02
ribosomes attached to it and the smooth ER
5:04
doesn't, so it's a smooth network of tubes.
5:06
The smooth ER acts as a kind of factory warehouse
5:09
in the cell city.
5:10
It contains enzymes that help with the creation
5:11
of important lipids, which you'll recall
5:13
from our talk about biological molecules,
5:15
phospolipids and steroids that turn out to be sex hormones.
5:19
Other enzymes in the smooth ER specialize in detoxifying
5:22
substance like noxious stuff derived from drugs
5:25
and alcohol which they do by adding
5:27
a carboxyl group to them, making them soluble in water.
5:30
Finally, the smooth ER also stores ions in solutions
5:32
that the cell may need later on, especially
5:34
sodium ions which are used for energy in muscle cells.
5:37
The smooth ER helps makes lipids while the rough ER
5:40
helps in the synthesis and packaging of proteins.
5:42
Those proteins are created by another
5:45
type of organelle, the ribosome.
5:47
Ribosomes can float freely throughout the cytoplasm
5:49
or be attached to the nuclear envelope
5:51
which is where they're spat out from.
5:53
Their job is to assemble amino acids into polypeptides.
5:57
As the ribosome builds an amino acid chain,
5:59
the chain is pushed into the ER.
6:02
When the protein chain is complete,
6:03
the ER pinches it off and sends it to the golgi apparatus.
6:07
In the city that is the cell, the golgi is the post office,
6:10
processing proteins and packaging them up
6:13
before sending them wherever they need to go.
6:15
Calling it an apparatus makes it sound like a bit
6:17
of complicated machinery, which it kind of is
6:20
because it's made up of these stacks
6:22
of membranous layers that are sometimes called golgi bodies.
6:25
The golgi bodies can cut up large proteins
6:28
into smaller hormones and can combine
6:30
proteins with carbohydrates to make various molecules,
6:32
like, for instance, snot.
6:34
The bodies package these little goodies
6:36
into sacks called vassicles which have
6:37
phopholipid walls just like the main cell membrane,
6:40
then ship them out either to other parts of the cell
6:43
or outside the cell wall.
6:44
We learn more about how vessicles do this
6:46
in the next episode of Crash Course.
6:49
The golgi bodies also put the finishing touches
6:50
on the lysosomes.
6:52
Lysosomes are basically the waste treatment plants
6:54
and recycling centers of the city.
6:56
These organelles are basically sacks full of enzymes
6:58
that break down cellular waste and debris
7:01
from outside of the cell and turn it into
7:03
simple compounds which are transferred into
7:05
the cytoplasm as new cell building materials.
7:07
Now, finally, let us talk about the nucleus,
7:10
the beloved leader.
7:11
The nucleus is a highly specialized organelle
7:14
that lives in its own double-membraned,
7:16
high security compound with its buddy the nucleolus.
7:19
Within the cell, the nucleus is in charge
7:21
in a major way, because it stores the cell's DNA.
7:24
It has all the information the cell needs to do its job.
7:27
The nucleus makes all the laws for the city
7:30
and orders all the other organelles around
7:32
telling them how and when to grow,
7:33
what to metabolize,
7:34
what proteins to synthesize,
7:36
how and when to divide.
7:37
The nucleus does all this by using the information
7:39
blueprinted in its DNA to build proteins
7:41
that will facilitate a specific job getting done.
7:45
For instance, on January 1, 2012
7:48
let's say a liver cell needs to help break down
7:51
an entire bottle of champagne.
7:53
The nucleus in that liver cell would start
7:55
telling the cell to make alcohol dehydrogenase,
7:58
which is the enzyme that makes alcohol not alcohol anymore.
8:01
This protein synthesis business is complicated.
8:04
Lucky for you we will have, or may already have,
8:08
an entire video about how it happens.
8:10
The nucleus holds its precious DNA
8:12
along some proteins in a web-like substance
8:14
called a chromatin.
8:16
When it comes time for the cell to split,
8:18
the chromatin gathers into rod-shaped chromosomes,
8:21
each of which holds DNA molecules.
8:23
Difference species of animals
8:25
have different numbers of chromosomes.
8:26
We humans have 46.
8:28
Fruitflies have eight.
8:29
Hedgehogs, which are adorable, but less
8:31
complex than humans, have 90.
8:33
The nucleolus, which lives inside of the nucleus,
8:36
is the only organelle not enveloped by its own membrane.
8:39
It's just a gooey splotch of stuff within the nucleus.
8:43
It's main job is creating ribosomal RNA, or rRNA,
8:46
which it then combines with some proteins
8:48
to form the basic units of ribosomes.
8:50
Once these units are done, the nucleolus
8:52
spits them out of the nuclear envelope
8:54
where they are fully assembled into ribosomes.
8:57
The nucleus then sends orders in the form
8:59
of messenger RNA, or mRNA, to those ribosomes,
9:02
which are the henchmen that carry out the orders
9:05
in the rest of the cell.
9:06
How exactly the ribosomes do this
9:08
is immensely complex and awesome;
9:11
so awesome, in fact, that we're going to give it
9:13
the full Crash Course treatment; an entire episode.
9:16
Now, for what is, totally, objectively speaking, of course,
9:19
the coolest part of the animal cell,
9:21
its power plants, the mitochondria, the smooth
9:25
oblong organelles where the amazing
9:28
and super important process of respiration takes place.
9:31
This is where energy is derived from carbohydrates,
9:34
fats and other fuels and is converted into
9:36
adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, which is like
9:39
the main currency that drives life in Eukaryopolis.
9:42
You can learn more about ATP and respiration
9:44
in an episode that we did on that.
9:46
Now, of course, some cells like muscle cells
9:48
or neuron cells need a lot more power than
9:50
the average cell in the body, so those cells
9:52
have a lot more mitochondria per cell.
9:55
Maybe the coolest thing about mitochondria
9:57
is that long ago animal cells didn't have them.
10:00
They existed as their own sort of bacterial cell.
10:04
One day, one of these things ended up inside
10:07
of an animal cell, probably because the animal
10:09
cell was trying to eat it, but instead of eating it,
10:11
it realized that this thing was really super smart
10:14
and good at turning food into energy, and it just kept it.
10:19
It stayed around.
10:20
To this day they sort of act like their own
10:21
separate organisms.
10:23
They do their own thing within the cell.
10:25
The replicate themselves.
10:26
They even contain a small amount of DNA.
10:28
What may be even more awesome, if that's possible,
10:30
is that mitochondria are in the egg cell
10:34
when an egg gets fertilized.
10:36
Those mitochondria have DNA.
10:37
Because mitochondria replicate themselves
10:39
in a separate fashion, it doesn't get mixed
10:41
with the DNA of the father.
10:42
It's just the mother's mitochondrial DNA.
10:44
That means that your and my mitochondrial DNA
10:46
is exactly the same as the mitochondrial DNA of our mothers.
10:50
Because this special DNA is isolated in this way,
10:53
scientists can actually track back and back and back
10:55
and back to a single mitochondrial Eve
10:58
who lived about 200,000 years ago in Africa.
11:01
All of that complication and mystery and beauty
11:03
in one of the cells of your body.
11:07
It's complicated, yes, but worth understanding.",What happens to cell and organelles inside the cell when the cell die?

Male: Hello and welcome to the wonderful world
0:03
of fungi or [funji]; both are acceptable pronunciations,
0:08
but I say fungi because it's fungus, not [funjus],
0:11
though [funjus] is also fun to say.
0:14
Fungi are a little bit like plants
0:15
and more like animals than you might think.
0:17
They diverged from protists about a billion years ago
0:20
and today scientists estimate that there are
0:22
about 1.5 million species of fungi on the earth,
0:26
though in a formal taxonomic way,
0:28
we only know about 100,000 or so of them,
0:30
and those that we have met are wonderful, weird
0:33
and in some cases, deadly.
0:35
The fact is, death is pretty much what fungi are all about.
0:38
Sure, there are the fun fungi,
0:40
like the single-celled saccharomyces,
0:42
also known as yeast.
0:43
Without them we wouldn't have beer or wine or bread.
0:46
It's also true that fungi are responsible
0:48
for all kinds of diseases from athlete's foot
0:50
to potentially deadly histoplasmosis,
0:53
AKA Spelunker's Lung caused by fungus
0:56
found in bird and bat droppings.
0:57
Fungi can even make people crazy.
0:59
When the fungus Claviceps purpurea
1:01
grows on grains used to make bread or beer,
1:03
it causes gangrene, nervous spasms, burning sensations,
1:07
hallucinations and temporary insanity.
1:10
Once compound in this fungus, lysergic acid,
1:12
is the raw material used to make LSD.
1:14
Finally, there's the destruction that some
1:16
fungi bring onto other animals.
1:18
More than 6 million bats in North America
1:20
have died since just 2007 due to a fungal disease
1:23
called White Nose Syndrome,
1:25
and a fungus has been implicated in several
1:26
extinctions of amphibians and threatens many more,
1:29
perhaps as many as 1/3 of all amphibians on earth.
1:32
But none of this is what I mean
1:33
when I talk about fungi and death.
1:36
While some members of the fungus family are total bummers,
1:38
all of them together perform perhaps the most vital function
1:41
in the global food web.
1:43
They feast on the deceased remains
1:45
of almost all organisms on the planet.
1:48
By doing that, they convert the organic matter
1:50
that we're all made of back into soil
1:53
from which new life will spring.
1:55
So fungi, they thrive on death
1:57
and in the process make all life possible.
1:59
(bopppy music)
2:09
Aha! You didn't expect to see me in the chair so soon,
2:11
but before we go any deeper into the kingdom fungi,
2:14
I wanted to make a toast to Louis Pasteur
2:17
in the form of a Biolo-graphy.
2:19
(1920's music)
2:24
By Pasteur's time, beer had been brewed
2:26
for thousands of years in cultures all over the world.
2:29
Some experts think it may have been
2:31
the very reason that our hunter-gatherer ancestors
2:34
started farming and cobbled together
2:36
civilization in the first place.
2:37
For all those millennia, no one understood
2:39
how its most important ingredient worked.
2:42
Until brewers could actually see what yeast were doing,
2:45
the magic of fermentation was essentially ""magic.""
2:49
Pasteur himself was never a big beer drinker,
2:51
but part of his academic duties in France
2:54
required him to help find solutions to problems
2:56
for the local alcohol industry.
2:58
As part of this work in 1857, he began
3:01
studying yeast under a microscope
3:04
and discovered that they were, in fact, living organisms.
3:07
In a series of experiments on the new-found creatures,
3:09
he found that in the absence of free oxygen
3:12
yeast were able to obtain energy
3:15
by decomposing substances that contained oxygen.
3:18
We now know that Pasteur was observing yeast
3:20
undergoing the process of anaerobic respiration,
3:22
AKA fermentation; breaking down the sugars in grains
3:26
like malted barley and converting them
3:29
into alcohol, carbon dioxide,
3:30
and the range of flavors that we associate with beer.
3:34
Along the way, Pasteur also discovered that beer
3:36
was often contaminated by other bacteria and fungi.
3:38
The growth of these beer-spoiling microbes, he found,
3:41
could be thwarted for up to 90 days
3:43
by keeping the beer between 55 and 60 degrees Celcius
3:46
for a short period of time.
3:47
Today, we call that heating process pasteurization
3:51
and it's used in everything from milk
3:53
to canned foods to syrups to wines.
3:56
For our purposes, the thing to hold onto here is
3:58
Pasteur discovered that yeast decomposed sugars to get energy.
4:02
It turns out most fungi spend most of their time
4:05
decomposing all kinds of organic matter.
4:07
Often the matter is dead when fungi get to it,
4:10
but not always.
4:11
When a tree or a person or a deer keels over,
4:14
fungi move in and start the work of decomposition.
4:16
Same goes for that orange you forgot
4:18
at the bottom of the fruit bowl.
4:19
If it weren't for this fungal function,
4:21
plants and the animals that eat them couldn't exist
4:23
because the elements that they take from the soil
4:26
would never return.
4:27
Thankfully, the decomposition performed by fungi
4:29
recycles the nutrients for the enjoyment
4:31
of plants and animals, as well as for other fungi.
4:34
All of this points to one of the main traits
4:35
that all fungi have in common.
4:37
From single-celled yeast to giant multi-cellular mushrooms,
4:40
fungi, like us, are heterotrophs, but instead of eating,
4:44
they absorb nutrition from their surroundings.
4:47
They do this mostly be secreting powerful enzymes
4:49
that break down complex molecules into
4:50
smaller organic compounds, which they use
4:53
to feed, grow and reproduce.
4:55
Most multi-cellular fungi contain networks
4:57
of tiny tubular filaments called hyphae,
4:59
then grow through and within whatever they're feasting on.
5:02
Unlike plant cell walls, which are made of cellulose,
5:04
the cell walls of fungi are strengthened
5:06
by the nitrogenous carbohydrate, chitin,
5:08
the same material found in the exoskeletons
5:10
of insects, spiders and other arthropods.
5:12
The interwoven mass of hyphae
5:14
that grows into the food source is called they mycelium.
5:16
It's structured to maximize its surface area,
5:19
which as we've learned in both plants and animals,
5:21
is the name of the game when it comes to absorbing stuff.
5:23
Mycelia are so densely packed that one cubic centimeter
5:26
of rich soil can contain enough hyphae
5:29
to stretch out one kilometer if you laid them end-to-end.
5:32
As hyphae secrete the digestive enzymes,
5:34
fungi use the food to synthesize more proteins
5:37
and the hyphae continued to grow, allowing the fungi
5:39
to conquer new territory and grow even more.
5:42
As a result, fungi can get crazy big; record-holding big.
5:46
A single honey mushroom in the Blue Mountains of Oregon
5:49
is thought to occupy some 2,386 acres.
5:53
By area, the largest organism on the planet.
5:56
There all kinds of crazy ways that fungi are classified,
5:58
but probably the easiest and most useful
5:59
is organizing them by how they interact with other organisms.
6:02
The straight up decomposers that break down dead stuff,
6:05
the mutualists which form beneficial relationships
6:07
with other organisms, especially plants,
6:09
and then there are the predators and the parasites.
6:12
Decomposer fungi secrete enzymes that break down
6:15
and absorb nutrients from non-living organic material
6:17
such as that tree that nobody heard fall in the forest.
6:20
In fact, the ability of fungi to break down lignin,
6:22
which is like what makes wood woody,
6:24
and break it into glucose and other simple sugars,
6:26
is crucial for this cycle of life.
6:28
They're pretty much the only organism that can do that.
6:30
They can even decompose proteins
6:32
into component amino acids.
6:33
Basically all the black bits in the soil
6:36
in your backyard are tiny fragments
6:38
of former plants digested by fungi.
6:40
Mutualist fungi are a smaller group.
6:42
Many have specialized hyphae called haustoria
6:44
that tangle themselves with plant roots
6:46
for the benefit of both organisms.
6:47
These guys help plants absorb nutrients,
6:49
especially phosphates,
6:51
by breaking them down more efficiently
6:52
than the roots can themselves.
6:54
In turn, the fungi send out their hyphae
6:56
into the plant's root tissue
6:57
and withdraws like a finder's fee, basically,
7:00
in the form of energy-rich sugars.
7:01
These mutualistic relationships
7:03
are known as mycorrhizae, from the Greek words
7:05
mykos, or fungus, and rhiza, or root.
7:08
Mycorrhizae are enormously important
7:10
in natural ecosystems, as well as in agriculture.
7:12
Almost all vascular plants, in fact,
7:14
have fungi attached to their roots
7:16
and rely on them for essential nutrients.
7:18
Growers of barley, the main ingredient in beer,
7:20
will even inoculate barley seed beds
7:22
with specific mycorrhizal fungi to help promote growth.
7:25
Other fungi aren't nearly so kind to their hosts.
7:27
Predatory fungi actively capture prey with their hyphae.
7:31
The soil fungus arthrobotrys uses
7:32
modified hoops on its filaments
7:34
to snare nematodes and absorb their inner tissue.
7:37
Then there are the parasites,
7:38
those fungi that feed on living organisms
7:40
without killing them, at least for a while.
7:42
Take one of my personal favorites,
7:44
the zombie ant fungus, or ophiocordyceps.
7:46
It shoots spores into an ant
7:48
where their hyphae grow into its body
7:50
and absorb nutrients from nonessential ant organs.
7:53
When the fungus is ready to reproduce,
7:55
it invades the ant's brain
7:56
and directs it to march to a cool, moist location
7:59
in the forest where it's so-called fruiting spores
8:02
erupt through the ant's head to spread even more spores.
8:06
Just to prove that even fungi have superheroes,
8:08
in 2012 scientists discovered
8:11
that these zombie spores have themselves
8:13
been targeted by another parasitic fungus.
8:16
Not a lot is known about this ant-saving fungus,
8:18
other than it sterilizes many of the zombie spores
8:21
through a process likened to chemical castration.
8:24
That is so messed up!
8:25
Weird!
8:26
All right now, since I brought that up
8:28
we should talk briefly about fungus sex.
8:29
Fungi reproduce any way they can,
8:32
either sexually or asexually.
8:34
Some species even do it both ways.
8:36
Whichever way they choose, most propagate themselves
8:38
by producing enormous numbers of spores,
8:41
much like we saw in non-vascular plants
8:43
and the simplest vascular plants, the ferns.
8:46
But, and this a big but, sexual reproduction
8:48
in fungi isn't like sex in any other organism
8:51
we've studied so far.
8:52
The concepts of male and female don't apply here at all.
8:56
Some fungi reproduce on their own,
8:58
others can reproduce with any other
9:00
individual that happens to be around,
9:02
and still others can only mate
9:04
with a member of a different so-called ""mating type.""
9:06
They're not different sexes,
9:08
they just have different molecular mechanisms
9:10
that either make them compatible or not.
9:12
Sometimes these types are called plus and minus,
9:14
and other times one and two.
9:16
In any case, it's still considered sexual reproduction
9:18
because each parent contributes genetic information
9:20
when they make with the spore-making.
9:22
It all starts with this beautiful chemical mating dance.
9:25
The mycelium from one fungus sends out pheromones
9:28
that are picked up and bound to receptors
9:30
by another willing and able partner.
9:32
This binding compels each mycelium
9:34
to send its hyphae toward the other.
9:36
When they meet, they fuse the cytoplasm of their cells;
9:39
the stage of reproduction called plasmogamy.
9:41
Sometime between hours and centuries later,
9:43
yes, it can literally take hundreds of years
9:46
for fungi to have sex,
9:47
this union leads to the production of spores
9:50
that each fungus is then able to disperse.
9:53
Certain types of fungi, including the tasty morel,
9:55
produce spores in a sac-like asci
9:57
contained in fruiting bodies known as ascocarps.
10:00
That is that part that you pick
10:01
when you're wandering through the forest.
10:03
Some fungi shoot their spores off into the breeze,
10:04
other spores float away on the water.
10:07
More enterprising spores will hitch a ride
10:09
on passing critters,
10:10
hopefully, to be dropped off somewhere
10:12
where there's plenty of nutrients to absorb
10:13
so they, too, can grow, send out sexual pheromones
10:16
when their time comes,
10:18
and let their hyphae do the tango.
10:20
Finally, for some fungi sexual reproduction
10:22
just isn't all it's cracked up to be.
10:24
They'd rather just get on with it themselves.
10:26
Some of these grow filamented structures
10:28
that produce spores by mitosis.
10:30
These structures are visible and they're called molds.
10:33
This stuff on the orange in the bottom of the fruit bowl
10:35
or on the heel of the piece of bread
10:37
that you left for a roommate
10:38
who decided to leave it for the other roommate
10:40
who thought that you'd rather have it.
10:41
In the unicellular yeast, the asexual reproduction
10:44
occurs by old fashioned cell division
10:46
or the formation of buds that get pinched off
10:48
into separate organisms.
10:49
Since some species of yeast,
10:51
like our beer-making friend Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
10:53
convert sugars into alcohol, brewers create conditions
10:56
that encourage high rates of yeast production,
10:59
like giving them lots of sugar and oxygen
11:01
since more yeast means more alcohol.
11:03
So, yeah, fungi.
11:04
They feast on death and they can make us go insane
11:06
and turn ants into unholy zombies of the night,
11:09
but because of their hard work, in strange ways,
11:12
they make possible stuff like agriculture
11:14
and beer and everything else worth living for.",how many cells does a fungi have?

In most topics you have to get pretty advanced before you
0:03
start addressing the philosophically interesting
0:05
things, but in chemistry it just starts right from the
0:08
get-go with what's arguably the most philosophically
0:11
interesting part of the whole topic, and that's the atom.
0:15
And the idea of the atom, as philosophers long ago, and you
0:18
could look it up on the different philosophers who
0:21
first philosophized about it, they said, hey, you know, if I
0:23
started off with, I don't know, if I started off with an
0:28
apple, and I just kept cutting the apple -- let me draw a
0:32
nice looking apple just so it doesn't look just
0:34
like a heart .
0:36
There you go.
0:36
You have a nice looking apple, And you just kept cutting it,
0:38
smaller and smaller pieces.
0:40
So eventually, you get a piece so small, so tiny, that you
0:44
can't cut it anymore.
0:46
And I'm sure some of these philosophers went out there
0:48
with a knife and tried to do it and they just felt that,
0:50
oh, if I could just get my knife a little bit sharper, I
0:52
could cut it again and again.
0:53
So it's a completely philosophical construct, which
0:56
frankly, in a lot of ways, isn't too different to how the
0:59
atom is today.
1:00
It's really just a mental abstraction that allows us to
1:04
describe a lot of observations we see in the universe.
1:07
But anyway, these philosophers said, well, at some point we
1:10
think that there's going to be some little part of an apple
1:15
that they won't be able to divide anymore.
1:16
And they called that an atom.
1:18
And it doesn't just have to just be for an apple they said
1:19
this is true for any substance or any element to that you
1:23
encounter in the universe.
1:25
And so the word atom is really Greek for uncuttable.
1:29
Uncuttable or indivisible.
1:34
Now we know that it actually is cuttable and even though it
1:37
is not a trivial thing, it's not the smallest form of
1:42
matter we know.
1:43
We now know that an atom is made up of other more
1:47
fundamental particles.
1:48
And let me write that.
1:50
So the we have the neutron.
1:55
And I'll draw in a second how they all fit together and the
1:59
structure of an atom.
2:00
We have a neutron.
2:02
We have a proton.
2:05
And we have electrons.
2:09
Electrons.
2:11
And you might already be familiar with this if you look
2:13
at old videos about atomic projects, you'll see a drawing
2:18
that looks something like this.
2:20
Let me see if I can draw one.
2:21
So you'll have something like that.
2:24
And you'll have these things spinning around
2:27
that look like this.
2:28
They have orbits that look like that.
2:30
And maybe something that looks like that.
2:33
And the general notion behind these kind of nuclear drawings
2:36
-- and I'm sure that they still show up at some
2:39
government defense labs or something like that -- is that
2:41
you have a nucleus at the center of an atom.
2:46
You have a nucleus at the center of an atom.
2:48
And we know that a nucleus has neutrons and protons.
2:52
Neutrons and protons.
2:53
And we'll talk a little bit more about which elements have
2:56
how many neutrons and how many protons.
2:59
And then orbiting, and I'm going to use the word orbit
3:02
right now, although we'll learn in about two minutes
3:05
that the word orbit is actually the incorrect or even
3:08
the mentally incorrect way of visualizing what
3:10
an electron is doing.
3:11
But the old idea was that you have these electrons that are
3:14
orbiting around the nucleus very similar to the way the
3:17
Earth orbits around the Sun or the moon
3:19
orbits around the Earth.
3:21
And it's been shown that that's actually
3:23
a very wrong way.
3:26
And when we cover quantum mechanics we'll learn why this
3:30
doesn't work, what are the contradictions that emerge
3:34
when you try to model an electron like a planet going
3:38
around the Sun.
3:40
But this was kind of the original idea, and frankly I
3:41
think this is kind of the idea that is the most mainstream
3:45
way of viewing an atom.
3:50
Now, I said an atom is philosophically interesting.
3:52
Why is it philosophically interesting?
3:53
Because what we now view as the accepted way of viewing an
3:58
atom really starts to blur the line between our physical
4:04
reality and everything in the world is just information, and
4:09
there really isn't any such thing as true matter or true
4:12
particles as the way we define them in our everyday life.
4:15
You know, for me a particle, oh, it looks
4:16
like a grain of sand.
4:17
I can pick it up, touch it.
4:19
While a wave, that could be like a soundwave. It could be
4:21
just this change in energy over time.
4:23
But we'll learn, especially when we do quantum mechanics,
4:25
that it all gets jumbled up as we start approaching the
4:29
scales or the size of an atom.
4:31
Anyway, I said this was an incorrect way of doing it.
4:34
What's the correct way?
4:37
So it turns out-- this is a picture, not a picture really,
4:40
this is also a depiction.
4:42
So it's an interesting question, what I just said.
4:44
How can you have a picture of an atom?
4:47
Because is actually turns out that most wavelengths of
4:49
light, especially the visible wavelengths of light, are much
4:52
larger than the size of an atom.
4:56
Everything else we quote-unquote, observe in
4:58
life, it's by reflected light.
5:00
But all of a sudden when you're dealing with an atom,
5:02
reflected light you could almost view it as too big, or
5:06
too blunt of an instrument with which to observe an atom.
5:09
Anyway, this is a depiction of a helium atom.
5:14
A helium atom has two protons and two neutrons.
5:18
Or at least this helium atom has two
5:19
protons and two neutrons.
5:21
And the way they depict it here in the nucleus, right
5:24
there, maybe these are the two-- I'm assuming they're
5:26
using red for proton and purple for neutron.
5:32
Purple seems like more of a neutral color.
5:34
And they're sitting at the center of this atom.
5:39
And then this whole haze around there, those are the
5:42
two electrons that helium has, or that at least
5:45
this helium atom has.
5:47
Maybe you could gain or lose an electron.
5:49
But these are the two electrons.
5:50
And you say, hey, Sal, how can two electrons be this blur
5:55
that's kind of smeared around this atom.
5:58
And that's where it gets philosophically interesting.
6:01
So you cannot describe an electron's path around a
6:09
nucleus with the traditional orbit idea that we've
6:12
encountered when we look at planets or if we just imagine
6:16
things at kind of a larger scale.
6:18
It turns out that an electron, you cannot know exactly its
6:24
momentum and location at any given point in time.
6:28
All you can know is a probability distribution of
6:31
where it is likely to be.
6:33
And the way they depicted this, black is a higher
6:36
probability, so you're much more likely to find the
6:39
electron here than you are here.
6:42
But the electron really could be anywhere.
6:43
It could even to be here, even though it's completely white
6:46
there, with some very, very, very, very, very low
6:49
probability.
6:50
And so this function of where an electron is, this is called
6:55
an orbital.
6:56
Orbital.
6:57
Not to be confused with orbit.
7:00
Orbital.
7:02
Remember, an orbit was something like this.
7:05
It's like Venus going around the Sun.
7:08
So it's very physically easy for us to imagine.
7:12
While an orbital is actually a mathematical probability
7:16
function that tells us where we're
7:17
likely to find an electron.
7:18
We'll deal a lot more with that when we cover quantum
7:21
mechanics, but that's not going to be in the scope of
7:23
this kind of introductory set of chemistry lectures.
7:26
But it's interesting, right?
7:28
An electron's behavior is so bizarre at that scale that you
7:32
can't-- I mean, to call it a particle is almost misleading.
7:35
It is called a particle, but it's not a particle in the
7:38
sense that we're used to in our everyday life.
7:40
It's this thing that you can't even say exactly where it is.
7:45
It can be anywhere in this haze.
7:47
And we'll learn later that there are different shapes of
7:49
the hazes is as we add more and more electrons to an atom.
7:53
But to me, it starts to address philosophical issues
7:57
of what matter even is, or do the things we look at, how
8:01
real are they?
8:02
Or how real are they, at least as we've defined reality?
8:04
Anyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.
8:07
But the whole notion of electrons, protons, they're
8:12
all kind of predicated on this notion of charge.
8:15
And we've talked about it before when we learned about
8:17
Coulomb's law.
8:18
You could review Coulomb's laws videos in the physics
8:22
playlist. But the idea is that an electron
8:27
has a negative charge.
8:29
A proton, sometimes written like that,
8:31
has a positive charge.
8:33
And a neutron has no charge.
8:37
And so that's what was tempting about the original
8:39
model of an electron.
8:42
If they say, OK, if this thing has positive charges, right?
8:45
So let's say this is two neutrons and two protons.
8:47
Let's say it's a helium atom.
8:48
Then we'll have some positive charges here.
8:51
We have some negative charges out here.
8:54
Opposite charges attract.
8:56
And so if these things had some velocity, enough
9:03
velocity, they would orbit around this, just the way a
9:08
planet will orbit around the Sun.
9:10
But now we learn, even though this is partially true, that
9:15
the further away an electron is from the nucleus, it does
9:23
have more, it's true, potential energy.
9:27
In that it will want to move towards the nucleus, but
9:31
because of all the mechanics at the quantum level, it won't
9:34
just do something simple like move in a path like that, like
9:37
a comet would do around the Sun, it actually has this kind
9:41
of wave-like behavior, where it just has this probability
9:43
function that describes it.
9:45
But the further away an orbital, it
9:48
does have more potential.
9:50
We're going to go a lot more into that in future videos.
9:53
But anyway, how do you recognize what an element is?
9:56
I've talked a lot about the philosophy and all of that,
9:58
but how do I know that this is helium?
10:00
Is it by the number of neutrons it has?
10:03
Is it by the number of protons it has?
10:05
Is it by the number of electrons?
10:07
Well the answer is, it's by the number of protons.
10:09
So if you know the number of protons in an element, you
10:13
know what that element is.
10:14
And the number of protons, this is defined
10:21
as the atomic number.
10:26
Now, so let's say I said something has four protons.
10:33
How do we know what it is?
10:34
Well if we haven't memorized it, we could look it up on the
10:37
periodic table of elements, which we'll be dealing with a
10:39
lot in this playlist. And you'd say, oh, four protons,
10:43
that is beryllium.
10:45
Right there.
10:46
And the atomic number is the number that you see up there.
10:50
And that' s literally the number of protons.
10:52
And that is what differentiates
10:55
one atom from another.
10:56
If you have fifteen protons, you're dealing with
10:59
phosphorus.
11:00
And all of a sudden, if you have seven protons, you're
11:06
dealing with nitrogen.
11:07
If you have eight, you're dealing with oxygen.
11:09
That is what defines the element.
11:11
Now, we'll talk in the future about what happens with charge
11:15
and all of that.
11:17
Or what happens when you gain or lose electrons.
11:19
But that does not change what element you're dealing with.
11:21
And likewise, when you change the number of neutrons, that
11:26
also does not change the element you're dealing with.
11:30
But that leads to an obvious question of, well, how many
11:32
neutrons and electrons do you have?
11:35
Well, if an atom is charge-neutral, that means it
11:43
has the same number of electrons.
11:46
So let's say that I have carbon.
11:52
Its atomic number is six.
11:53
And let's say its mass number is twelve.
12:00
Now what does this mean?
12:01
And let me say further that this is a neutral particle.
12:05
This is a neutral atom.
12:07
So the atomic number for carbon is six.
12:10
That tells us exactly how many protons it has.
12:13
So if I were to draw a little model here, and this is in no
12:16
way an accurate model.
12:17
I'll draw six-- two, three, four, five, six
12:21
protons in the center.
12:23
And the weight of these protons, each proton is one
12:26
atomic mass unit, and we'll talk more about how that
12:28
relates to kilograms. It's a very small
12:31
fraction of a kilogram.
12:32
Roughly I think it's 1.6 times 10 to the
12:36
minus 27th of a kilogram.
12:38
So let's say each of these are one atomic mass unit, and
12:45
that's approximately equal to, I think, 1.67 times 10 to the
12:48
minus 27 kilograms. This is a very small number.
12:53
It's actually almost impossible to visualize.
12:57
At least it is for me.
12:58
This tells me the mass of the entire carbon atom, of this
13:03
particular carbon atom.
13:04
And this can actually change from carbon
13:05
atom to carbon atom.
13:07
And this is essentially the mass of all of the protons
13:10
plus all of the neutrons.
13:12
And each proton has an atomic mass of one, in atomic mass
13:17
units, and each neutron has an atomic mass of
13:20
one atomic mass unit.
13:22
So this is really the number of protons plus
13:28
the number of neutrons.
13:33
So in this case we have six protons, so we must also have
13:37
six neutrons.
13:39
Six neutrons plus six protons.
13:42
Now, where are the electrons?
13:44
Well, I said it's neutral, so the proton has an equal
13:49
positive charge as the electron's negative charge.
13:51
So this is a neutral atom, and it has six protons, so it also
13:55
has six electrons.
13:56
Let me draw that.
13:57
So we said it has six neutrons in here.
13:59
One, two, three, four, five, six.
14:01
So that's the nucleus right there.
14:04
And then if we were to draw the electons-- well, I could
14:09
draw it as a smear, but if we want to kind of visualize it a
14:12
little better, we could say, OK, there's going to be six
14:13
electrons orbiting.
14:15
One, two, three, four, five, six.
14:18
And they're going to be moving around in this unpredictable
14:21
way that we would have to describe with
14:22
a probability function.
14:24
And so the interesting thing about it is, most of the mass
14:30
of an atom is sitting right in here.
14:32
I mean, you might notice that when people care about the
14:34
mass, when they care about the atomic mass number of an atom,
14:40
they ignore the electrons.
14:41
And that's because the mass of a proton, one proton
14:47
mass-wise, is equal to 1,836 electons.
14:52
So for thinking about the mass of an atom, for all basic
14:58
purposes, you can ignore the mass of an electron.
15:01
It's really the mass of the nucleus that counts as the
15:08
mass of the atom.
15:10
Now, you might see this periodic table here, and you
15:12
say, OK, they gave us the atomic number up there.
15:15
The atomic number of oxygen is eight.
15:18
It means it has eight protons.
15:20
The atomic number of silicon is 14.
15:22
It has 14 protons.
15:24
Now what is this right here?
15:27
Let's see, in carbon.
15:28
In carbon they have this 12.0107.
15:34
That is the atomic weight of carbon.
15:36
Let me write this.
15:41
Atomic weight of carbon.
15:47
The atomic weight of carbon is 12.0107.
15:56
Now, what does that mean?
15:57
Does that mean that carbon has six protons and then the
16:03
remainder, the remaining 6.0107 neutrons, it has kind
16:09
of this fraction of a neutron?
16:11
No.
16:12
It means if you were to average all the different
16:16
versions of carbon you find on the planet and you were to
16:19
average the number of neutrons based on the quantity of the
16:25
different types of carbon, this is the
16:27
average you would get.
16:28
So it turns out that carbon, the two major forms, the main
16:32
one you'll find is carbon-12.
16:35
So that's like this.
16:36
So that has six protons and six neutrons.
16:39
And then another isotope of carbon.
16:42
Now an isotope is the same element with a different
16:45
number of neutrons.
16:46
Another isotope of carbon is carbon-14, which is much more
16:50
scarce on the planet.
16:52
We don't know how much in the universe, but on the planet.
16:55
Now, if you were to average these, not just a straight-up
16:58
average, then you would get carbon-13 and then the atomic
17:01
weight would be 13, but you weight this one much higher
17:04
because this exists in much larger quantities on Earth.
17:07
I mean, this is pretty much all of the
17:08
carbon that you see.
17:09
But there's a little bit of this.
17:10
So if you weight them appropriately, the average
17:13
becomes this.
17:14
So most of the carbon you'll find-- if you just found
17:17
carbon someplace, on average its weight in atomic mass
17:22
units is going to be 12.0107.
17:27
But that idea of an isotope is an interesting one.
17:29
Remember, when you change the neutrons, you're not changing
17:32
the actual, fundamental element.
17:33
You're just getting a different isotope, a different
17:36
version, of the element.
17:37
So these two versions of carbon are both isotopes.
17:41
Now, I want to leave this video with what I think is
17:43
kind of the neatest idea behind atoms. And it's the
17:46
most philosophically interesting things about them.
17:49
It's that the relative size-- so, we have these electrons,
17:54
which represent very little of the mass of an atom.
17:58
It's 1/2000 of the mass of an atom are the electrons.
18:01
And even those, it's hard to even describe them as
18:04
particles, because you can't even tell me exactly where and
18:08
how fast one of these particles is moving.
18:11
They just have a probability function.
18:12
So most of the atom is sitting inside the nucleus.
18:16
And this is the interesting thing.
18:17
If you look at an atom on average, if you
18:21
say this is my atom.
18:23
Let's say I had two atoms that are bonded to each other.
18:26
And I were to say, how much of this is actual stuff?
18:29
And when I say stuff, that's a very abstract concept, because
18:32
we're talking about the nucleus, right?
18:33
Because the nucleus is where all the
18:34
mass is, all the stuff.
18:36
It turns out that it's actually an infinitesimally
18:39
small fraction of the volume of the atom where-- the volume
18:44
of the atom is hard to define, because the electron can
18:45
pretty much be anywhere, but if you view the volume as
18:48
where you're most likely to find the electron, or with 90%
18:52
probability you're likely to find the electron, then the
18:55
nucleus is, in a lot of cases and the way I think about it,
18:59
it's about 1/10,000 of the volume.
19:01
So if you think about it, when you look at something, if you
19:03
look at your hand or if you look at the wall or if you
19:06
look at your computer, 99.999% of it is free space.
19:14
It's nothing.
19:15
It's vacuum.
19:18
If you had ultra-small-- I guess we could call them
19:20
particles or something-- most of them would pass straight
19:23
through whatever you look at.
19:24
So it already starts to kind of
19:26
question our hold on reality.
19:28
What is there when, if-- and this is fact, this isn't
19:32
theory right here-- that if you take anything down to the
19:35
building blocks, down to the atomic level, most of the
19:39
space of that kind of, quote-unquote object, is free
19:43
vacuum space.
19:44
You could go straight through it if you could get down to
19:46
that scale.
19:47
This image of a helium atom, they say right here this is
19:50
one femtometer.
19:52
Right?
19:52
One femtometer.
19:57
This is the scale of the nucleus of a
20:00
helium atom, right?
20:01
One femtometer.
20:03
This is one angstrom, right?
20:04
And they say that equals 100,000 femtometers.
20:06
And just to get a sense of scale, one angstrom is 1 times
20:10
10 to the negative 10 meters, right?
20:13
So the atom is roughly on the scale of an angstrom.
20:15
In the case of helium, the nucleus is
20:17
even a smaller fraction.
20:18
It's 1/100,000.
20:20
So if you had-- let's say you had liquid helium, which you'd
20:23
have to get very cold to get.
20:25
If you're looking at that, most of it is free space.
20:27
If you're looking at an iron bar, the great, great, great,
20:30
great, great, great majority of it is free space.
20:33
And we're not even talking about, maybe there's some free
20:35
space inside the nucleus that we could talk
20:37
about in the future.
20:38
But to me, that just blows my mind that most things we look
20:41
at are not really solid.
20:44
They're really just empty space, but they look solid
20:47
because of the way light reflects on them or the forces
20:50
that repel us.
20:51
But there really isn't something to touch there.
20:55
That most of this right here is all free space.
20:57
I think I've said the word free space now, and I think
21:00
I'll leave further
21:02
mind-blowing to the next video.",What is the difference between Atomic Weight and Atomic mass of an element?
khan_video_1xSQlwWGT8M_172755,Science,MCQ,"•
0:00
In most topics you have to get pretty advanced before you
0:03
start addressing the philosophically interesting
0:05
things, but in chemistry it just starts right from the
0:08
get-go with what's arguably the most philosophically
0:11
interesting part of the whole topic, and that's the atom.
0:15
And the idea of the atom, as philosophers long ago, and you
0:18
could look it up on the different philosophers who
0:21
first philosophized about it, they said, hey, you know, if I
0:23
started off with, I don't know, if I started off with an
0:28
apple, and I just kept cutting the apple -- let me draw a
0:32
nice looking apple just so it doesn't look just
0:34
like a heart .
0:36
There you go.
0:36
You have a nice looking apple, And you just kept cutting it,
0:38
smaller and smaller pieces.
0:40
So eventually, you get a piece so small, so tiny, that you
0:44
can't cut it anymore.
0:46
And I'm sure some of these philosophers went out there
0:48
with a knife and tried to do it and they just felt that,
0:50
oh, if I could just get my knife a little bit sharper, I
0:52
could cut it again and again.
0:53
So it's a completely philosophical construct, which
0:56
frankly, in a lot of ways, isn't too different to how the
0:59
atom is today.
1:00
It's really just a mental abstraction that allows us to
1:04
describe a lot of observations we see in the universe.
1:07
But anyway, these philosophers said, well, at some point we
1:10
think that there's going to be some little part of an apple
1:15
that they won't be able to divide anymore.
1:16
And they called that an atom.
1:18
And it doesn't just have to just be for an apple they said
1:19
this is true for any substance or any element to that you
1:23
encounter in the universe.
1:25
And so the word atom is really Greek for uncuttable.
1:29
Uncuttable or indivisible.
1:34
Now we know that it actually is cuttable and even though it
1:37
is not a trivial thing, it's not the smallest form of
1:42
matter we know.
1:43
We now know that an atom is made up of other more
1:47
fundamental particles.
1:48
And let me write that.
1:50
So the we have the neutron.
1:55
And I'll draw in a second how they all fit together and the
1:59
structure of an atom.
2:00
We have a neutron.
2:02
We have a proton.
2:05
And we have electrons.
2:09
Electrons.
2:11
And you might already be familiar with this if you look
2:13
at old videos about atomic projects, you'll see a drawing
2:18
that looks something like this.
2:20
Let me see if I can draw one.
2:21
So you'll have something like that.
2:24
And you'll have these things spinning around
2:27
that look like this.
2:28
They have orbits that look like that.
2:30
And maybe something that looks like that.
2:33
And the general notion behind these kind of nuclear drawings
2:36
-- and I'm sure that they still show up at some
2:39
government defense labs or something like that -- is that
2:41
you have a nucleus at the center of an atom.
2:46
You have a nucleus at the center of an atom.
2:48
And we know that a nucleus has neutrons and protons.
2:52
Neutrons and protons.
2:53
And we'll talk a little bit more about which elements have
2:56
how many neutrons and how many protons.
2:59
And then orbiting, and I'm going to use the word orbit
3:02
right now, although we'll learn in about two minutes
3:05
that the word orbit is actually the incorrect or even
3:08
the mentally incorrect way of visualizing what
3:10
an electron is doing.
3:11
But the old idea was that you have these electrons that are
3:14
orbiting around the nucleus very similar to the way the
3:17
Earth orbits around the Sun or the moon
3:19
orbits around the Earth.
3:21
And it's been shown that that's actually
3:23
a very wrong way.
3:26
And when we cover quantum mechanics we'll learn why this
3:30
doesn't work, what are the contradictions that emerge
3:34
when you try to model an electron like a planet going
3:38
around the Sun.
3:40
But this was kind of the original idea, and frankly I
3:41
think this is kind of the idea that is the most mainstream
3:45
way of viewing an atom.
3:50
Now, I said an atom is philosophically interesting.
3:52
Why is it philosophically interesting?
3:53
Because what we now view as the accepted way of viewing an
3:58
atom really starts to blur the line between our physical
4:04
reality and everything in the world is just information, and
4:09
there really isn't any such thing as true matter or true
4:12
particles as the way we define them in our everyday life.
4:15
You know, for me a particle, oh, it looks
4:16
like a grain of sand.
4:17
I can pick it up, touch it.
4:19
While a wave, that could be like a soundwave. It could be
4:21
just this change in energy over time.
4:23
But we'll learn, especially when we do quantum mechanics,
4:25
that it all gets jumbled up as we start approaching the
4:29
scales or the size of an atom.
4:31
Anyway, I said this was an incorrect way of doing it.
4:34
What's the correct way?
4:37
So it turns out-- this is a picture, not a picture really,
4:40
this is also a depiction.
4:42
So it's an interesting question, what I just said.
4:44
How can you have a picture of an atom?
4:47
Because is actually turns out that most wavelengths of
4:49
light, especially the visible wavelengths of light, are much
4:52
larger than the size of an atom.
4:56
Everything else we quote-unquote, observe in
4:58
life, it's by reflected light.
5:00
But all of a sudden when you're dealing with an atom,
5:02
reflected light you could almost view it as too big, or
5:06
too blunt of an instrument with which to observe an atom.
5:09
Anyway, this is a depiction of a helium atom.
5:14
A helium atom has two protons and two neutrons.
5:18
Or at least this helium atom has two
5:19
protons and two neutrons.
5:21
And the way they depict it here in the nucleus, right
5:24
there, maybe these are the two-- I'm assuming they're
5:26
using red for proton and purple for neutron.
5:32
Purple seems like more of a neutral color.
5:34
And they're sitting at the center of this atom.
5:39
And then this whole haze around there, those are the
5:42
two electrons that helium has, or that at least
5:45
this helium atom has.
5:47
Maybe you could gain or lose an electron.
5:49
But these are the two electrons.
5:50
And you say, hey, Sal, how can two electrons be this blur
5:55
that's kind of smeared around this atom.
5:58
And that's where it gets philosophically interesting.
6:01
So you cannot describe an electron's path around a
6:09
nucleus with the traditional orbit idea that we've
6:12
encountered when we look at planets or if we just imagine
6:16
things at kind of a larger scale.
6:18
It turns out that an electron, you cannot know exactly its
6:24
momentum and location at any given point in time.
6:28
All you can know is a probability distribution of
6:31
where it is likely to be.
6:33
And the way they depicted this, black is a higher
6:36
probability, so you're much more likely to find the
6:39
electron here than you are here.
6:42
But the electron really could be anywhere.
6:43
It could even to be here, even though it's completely white
6:46
there, with some very, very, very, very, very low
6:49
probability.
6:50
And so this function of where an electron is, this is called
6:55
an orbital.
6:56
Orbital.
6:57
Not to be confused with orbit.
7:00
Orbital.
7:02
Remember, an orbit was something like this.
7:05
It's like Venus going around the Sun.
7:08
So it's very physically easy for us to imagine.
7:12
While an orbital is actually a mathematical probability
7:16
function that tells us where we're
7:17
likely to find an electron.
7:18
We'll deal a lot more with that when we cover quantum
7:21
mechanics, but that's not going to be in the scope of
7:23
this kind of introductory set of chemistry lectures.
7:26
But it's interesting, right?
7:28
An electron's behavior is so bizarre at that scale that you
7:32
can't-- I mean, to call it a particle is almost misleading.
7:35
It is called a particle, but it's not a particle in the
7:38
sense that we're used to in our everyday life.
7:40
It's this thing that you can't even say exactly where it is.
7:45
It can be anywhere in this haze.
7:47
And we'll learn later that there are different shapes of
7:49
the hazes is as we add more and more electrons to an atom.
7:53
But to me, it starts to address philosophical issues
7:57
of what matter even is, or do the things we look at, how
8:01
real are they?
8:02
Or how real are they, at least as we've defined reality?
8:04
Anyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.
8:07
But the whole notion of electrons, protons, they're
8:12
all kind of predicated on this notion of charge.
8:15
And we've talked about it before when we learned about
8:17
Coulomb's law.
8:18
You could review Coulomb's laws videos in the physics
8:22
playlist. But the idea is that an electron
8:27
has a negative charge.
8:29
A proton, sometimes written like that,
8:31
has a positive charge.
8:33
And a neutron has no charge.
8:37
And so that's what was tempting about the original
8:39
model of an electron.
8:42
If they say, OK, if this thing has positive charges, right?
8:45
So let's say this is two neutrons and two protons.
8:47
Let's say it's a helium atom.
8:48
Then we'll have some positive charges here.
8:51
We have some negative charges out here.
8:54
Opposite charges attract.
8:56
And so if these things had some velocity, enough
9:03
velocity, they would orbit around this, just the way a
9:08
planet will orbit around the Sun.
9:10
But now we learn, even though this is partially true, that
9:15
the further away an electron is from the nucleus, it does
9:23
have more, it's true, potential energy.
9:27
In that it will want to move towards the nucleus, but
9:31
because of all the mechanics at the quantum level, it won't
9:34
just do something simple like move in a path like that, like
9:37
a comet would do around the Sun, it actually has this kind
9:41
of wave-like behavior, where it just has this probability
9:43
function that describes it.
9:45
But the further away an orbital, it
9:48
does have more potential.
9:50
We're going to go a lot more into that in future videos.
9:53
But anyway, how do you recognize what an element is?
9:56
I've talked a lot about the philosophy and all of that,
9:58
but how do I know that this is helium?
10:00
Is it by the number of neutrons it has?
10:03
Is it by the number of protons it has?
10:05
Is it by the number of electrons?
10:07
Well the answer is, it's by the number of protons.
10:09
So if you know the number of protons in an element, you
10:13
know what that element is.
10:14
And the number of protons, this is defined
10:21
as the atomic number.
10:26
Now, so let's say I said something has four protons.
10:33
How do we know what it is?
10:34
Well if we haven't memorized it, we could look it up on the
10:37
periodic table of elements, which we'll be dealing with a
10:39
lot in this playlist. And you'd say, oh, four protons,
10:43
that is beryllium.
10:45
Right there.
10:46
And the atomic number is the number that you see up there.
10:50
And that' s literally the number of protons.
10:52
And that is what differentiates
10:55
one atom from another.
10:56
If you have fifteen protons, you're dealing with
10:59
phosphorus.
11:00
And all of a sudden, if you have seven protons, you're
11:06
dealing with nitrogen.
11:07
If you have eight, you're dealing with oxygen.
11:09
That is what defines the element.
11:11
Now, we'll talk in the future about what happens with charge
11:15
and all of that.
11:17
Or what happens when you gain or lose electrons.
11:19
But that does not change what element you're dealing with.
11:21
And likewise, when you change the number of neutrons, that
11:26
also does not change the element you're dealing with.
11:30
But that leads to an obvious question of, well, how many
11:32
neutrons and electrons do you have?
11:35
Well, if an atom is charge-neutral, that means it
11:43
has the same number of electrons.
11:46
So let's say that I have carbon.
11:52
Its atomic number is six.
11:53
And let's say its mass number is twelve.
12:00
Now what does this mean?
12:01
And let me say further that this is a neutral particle.
12:05
This is a neutral atom.
12:07
So the atomic number for carbon is six.
12:10
That tells us exactly how many protons it has.
12:13
So if I were to draw a little model here, and this is in no
12:16
way an accurate model.
12:17
I'll draw six-- two, three, four, five, six
12:21
protons in the center.
12:23
And the weight of these protons, each proton is one
12:26
atomic mass unit, and we'll talk more about how that
12:28
relates to kilograms. It's a very small
12:31
fraction of a kilogram.
12:32
Roughly I think it's 1.6 times 10 to the
12:36
minus 27th of a kilogram.
12:38
So let's say each of these are one atomic mass unit, and
12:45
that's approximately equal to, I think, 1.67 times 10 to the
12:48
minus 27 kilograms. This is a very small number.
12:53
It's actually almost impossible to visualize.
12:57
At least it is for me.
12:58
This tells me the mass of the entire carbon atom, of this
13:03
particular carbon atom.
13:04
And this can actually change from carbon
13:05
atom to carbon atom.
13:07
And this is essentially the mass of all of the protons
13:10
plus all of the neutrons.
13:12
And each proton has an atomic mass of one, in atomic mass
13:17
units, and each neutron has an atomic mass of
13:20
one atomic mass unit.
13:22
So this is really the number of protons plus
13:28
the number of neutrons.
13:33
So in this case we have six protons, so we must also have
13:37
six neutrons.
13:39
Six neutrons plus six protons.
13:42
Now, where are the electrons?
13:44
Well, I said it's neutral, so the proton has an equal
13:49
positive charge as the electron's negative charge.
13:51
So this is a neutral atom, and it has six protons, so it also
13:55
has six electrons.
13:56
Let me draw that.
13:57
So we said it has six neutrons in here.
13:59
One, two, three, four, five, six.
14:01
So that's the nucleus right there.
14:04
And then if we were to draw the electons-- well, I could
14:09
draw it as a smear, but if we want to kind of visualize it a
14:12
little better, we could say, OK, there's going to be six
14:13
electrons orbiting.
14:15
One, two, three, four, five, six.
14:18
And they're going to be moving around in this unpredictable
14:21
way that we would have to describe with
14:22
a probability function.
14:24
And so the interesting thing about it is, most of the mass
14:30
of an atom is sitting right in here.
14:32
I mean, you might notice that when people care about the
14:34
mass, when they care about the atomic mass number of an atom,
14:40
they ignore the electrons.
14:41
And that's because the mass of a proton, one proton
14:47
mass-wise, is equal to 1,836 electons.
14:52
So for thinking about the mass of an atom, for all basic
14:58
purposes, you can ignore the mass of an electron.
15:01
It's really the mass of the nucleus that counts as the
15:08
mass of the atom.
15:10
Now, you might see this periodic table here, and you
15:12
say, OK, they gave us the atomic number up there.
15:15
The atomic number of oxygen is eight.
15:18
It means it has eight protons.
15:20
The atomic number of silicon is 14.
15:22
It has 14 protons.
15:24
Now what is this right here?
15:27
Let's see, in carbon.
15:28
In carbon they have this 12.0107.
15:34
That is the atomic weight of carbon.
15:36
Let me write this.
15:41
Atomic weight of carbon.
15:47
The atomic weight of carbon is 12.0107.
15:56
Now, what does that mean?
15:57
Does that mean that carbon has six protons and then the
16:03
remainder, the remaining 6.0107 neutrons, it has kind
16:09
of this fraction of a neutron?
16:11
No.
16:12
It means if you were to average all the different
16:16
versions of carbon you find on the planet and you were to
16:19
average the number of neutrons based on the quantity of the
16:25
different types of carbon, this is the
16:27
average you would get.
16:28
So it turns out that carbon, the two major forms, the main
16:32
one you'll find is carbon-12.
16:35
So that's like this.
16:36
So that has six protons and six neutrons.
16:39
And then another isotope of carbon.
16:42
Now an isotope is the same element with a different
16:45
number of neutrons.
16:46
Another isotope of carbon is carbon-14, which is much more
16:50
scarce on the planet.
16:52
We don't know how much in the universe, but on the planet.
16:55
Now, if you were to average these, not just a straight-up
16:58
average, then you would get carbon-13 and then the atomic
17:01
weight would be 13, but you weight this one much higher
17:04
because this exists in much larger quantities on Earth.
17:07
I mean, this is pretty much all of the
17:08
carbon that you see.
17:09
But there's a little bit of this.
17:10
So if you weight them appropriately, the average
17:13
becomes this.
17:14
So most of the carbon you'll find-- if you just found
17:17
carbon someplace, on average its weight in atomic mass
17:22
units is going to be 12.0107.
17:27
But that idea of an isotope is an interesting one.
17:29
Remember, when you change the neutrons, you're not changing
17:32
the actual, fundamental element.
17:33
You're just getting a different isotope, a different
17:36
version, of the element.
17:37
So these two versions of carbon are both isotopes.
17:41
Now, I want to leave this video with what I think is
17:43
kind of the neatest idea behind atoms. And it's the
17:46
most philosophically interesting things about them.
17:49
It's that the relative size-- so, we have these electrons,
17:54
which represent very little of the mass of an atom.
17:58
It's 1/2000 of the mass of an atom are the electrons.
18:01
And even those, it's hard to even describe them as
18:04
particles, because you can't even tell me exactly where and
18:08
how fast one of these particles is moving.
18:11
They just have a probability function.
18:12
So most of the atom is sitting inside the nucleus.
18:16
And this is the interesting thing.
18:17
If you look at an atom on average, if you
18:21
say this is my atom.
18:23
Let's say I had two atoms that are bonded to each other.
18:26
And I were to say, how much of this is actual stuff?
18:29
And when I say stuff, that's a very abstract concept, because
18:32
we're talking about the nucleus, right?
18:33
Because the nucleus is where all the
18:34
mass is, all the stuff.
18:36
It turns out that it's actually an infinitesimally
18:39
small fraction of the volume of the atom where-- the volume
18:44
of the atom is hard to define, because the electron can
18:45
pretty much be anywhere, but if you view the volume as
18:48
where you're most likely to find the electron, or with 90%
18:52
probability you're likely to find the electron, then the
18:55
nucleus is, in a lot of cases and the way I think about it,
18:59
it's about 1/10,000 of the volume.
19:01
So if you think about it, when you look at something, if you
19:03
look at your hand or if you look at the wall or if you
19:06
look at your computer, 99.999% of it is free space.
19:14
It's nothing.
19:15
It's vacuum.
19:18
If you had ultra-small-- I guess we could call them
19:20
particles or something-- most of them would pass straight
19:23
through whatever you look at.
19:24
So it already starts to kind of
19:26
question our hold on reality.
19:28
What is there when, if-- and this is fact, this isn't
19:32
theory right here-- that if you take anything down to the
19:35
building blocks, down to the atomic level, most of the
19:39
space of that kind of, quote-unquote object, is free
19:43
vacuum space.
19:44
You could go straight through it if you could get down to
19:46
that scale.
19:47
This image of a helium atom, they say right here this is
19:50
one femtometer.
19:52
Right?
19:52
One femtometer.
19:57
This is the scale of the nucleus of a
20:00
helium atom, right?
20:01
One femtometer.
20:03
This is one angstrom, right?
20:04
And they say that equals 100,000 femtometers.
20:06
And just to get a sense of scale, one angstrom is 1 times
20:10
10 to the negative 10 meters, right?
20:13
So the atom is roughly on the scale of an angstrom.
20:15
In the case of helium, the nucleus is
20:17
even a smaller fraction.
20:18
It's 1/100,000.
20:20
So if you had-- let's say you had liquid helium, which you'd
20:23
have to get very cold to get.
20:25
If you're looking at that, most of it is free space.
20:27
If you're looking at an iron bar, the great, great, great,
20:30
great, great, great majority of it is free space.
20:33
And we're not even talking about, maybe there's some free
20:35
space inside the nucleus that we could talk
20:37
about in the future.
20:38
But to me, that just blows my mind that most things we look
20:41
at are not really solid.
20:44
They're really just empty space, but they look solid
20:47
because of the way light reflects on them or the forces
20:50
that repel us.
20:51
But there really isn't something to touch there.
20:55
That most of this right here is all free space.
20:57
I think I've said the word free space now, and I think
21:00
I'll leave further
21:02
mind-blowing to the next video.",what is the atomic wheight?
khan_video_3uYb-RhM7lU_168792,Math,MCQ,"•
0:00
I've been doing a ton of videos on the mechanics of
0:03
taking the Laplace Transform, but you've been sitting
0:06
through them always wondering, what am I learning this for?
0:09
And now I'll show you, at least in the context of
0:12
differential equations.
0:13
And I've gotten a bunch of letters
0:16
on the Laplace Transform.
0:17
What does it really mean?
0:18
And and all that.
0:19
And those are excellent questions and you should
0:21
strive for that.
0:22
It's hard to really have an intuition of the Laplace
0:25
Transform in the differential equations context, other than
0:28
it being a very useful tool that converts differential or
0:32
integral problems into algebra problems. But I'll give you a
0:36
hint, and if you want a path to learn it in, you should
0:39
learn about Fourier series and Fourier Transforms, which are
0:42
very similar to Laplace Transforms. And that'll
0:44
actually build up the intuition on what the
0:48
frequency domain is all about.
0:50
Well anyway, let's actually use the Laplace Transform to
0:53
solve a differential equation.
0:54
And this is one we've seen before.
0:56
So let me see.
0:59
So let's say the differential equation is y prime prime,
1:03
plus 5, times the first derivative, plus
1:07
6y, is equal to 0.
1:09
And you know how to solve this one, but I just want to show
1:10
you, with a fairly straightforward differential
1:13
equation, that you could solve it with the Laplace Transform.
1:15
And actually, you end up having a
1:17
characteristic equation.
1:19
And the initial conditions are y of 0 is equal to 2, and y
1:27
prime of 0 is equal to 3.
1:32
Now, to use the Laplace Transform here, we essentially
1:36
just take the Laplace Transform of both sides of
1:38
this equation.
1:40
Let me use a more vibrant color.
1:42
So we get the Laplace Transform of y the second
1:47
derivative, plus-- well we could say the Laplace
1:51
Transform of 5 times y prime, but that's the same thing as 5
1:53
times the Laplace Transform-- y prime.
1:59
y prime plus 6 times the Laplace Transform of y.
2:06
And let me ask you a question.
2:06
What's the Laplace Transform of 0?
2:09
Let me do that.
2:11
So the Laplace Transform of 0 would be be the integral from
2:12
0 to infinity, of 0 times e to the minus stdt.
2:19
So this is a 0 in here.
2:20
So this is equal to 0.
2:21
So the Laplace Transform of 0 is 0.
2:23
And that's good, because I didn't have space to do
2:25
another curly L.
2:28
So what are the Laplace Transforms of these things?
2:30
Well this is where we break out one of the useful
2:33
properties that we learned.
2:36
Let me write it over here.
2:37
I think that's going to need as much
2:40
real estate as possible.
2:42
Let me erase this.
2:48
So we learned that the Laplace Transform-- I'll do it here.
2:52
Actually, I'll do it down here.
2:54
The Laplace Transform of f prime, or we could even say y
3:01
prime, is equal to s times the Laplace Transform of
3:08
y, minus y of 0.
3:13
We proved that to you.
3:15
And this is extremely important to know.
3:19
So let's see if we can apply that.
3:20
So the Laplace Transform of y prime prime, if we apply that,
3:23
that's equal to s times the Laplace Transform of-- well if
3:33
we go from y prime to y, you're just taking the
3:35
anti-derivative, so if you're taking the anti-derivative of
3:37
y, of the second derivative, we just end up with the first
3:40
derivative-- minus the first derivative at 0.
3:45
Notice, we're already using our initial conditions.
3:48
I won't substitute it just yet.
3:51
And then we end up with plus 5, times-- I'll write it every
3:56
time-- so plus 5 times the Laplace Transform of y prime,
4:07
plus 6 times the Laplace Transform of y.
4:12
All of that is equal to 0.
4:13
So just to be clear, all I did is I expanded this into this
4:20
using this.
4:22
So how can we rewrite the Laplace Transform of y prime?
4:25
Well, we could use this once again, so let's do that.
4:27
So this over here-- I'll do it in magenta-- this is equal to
4:31
s times what?
4:34
s times the Laplace Transform of y prime.
4:38
Well that's s times the Laplace Transform of y, minus
4:48
y of 0, right?
4:52
I took this part and replaced it with what I have in
4:55
parentheses.
4:56
So minus y prime of 0-- and now I'll switch colors-- plus
5:05
5 times-- once again the Laplace Transform of y prime.
5:09
Well we can use this again.
5:10
So 5 times s times Laplace Transform of y, minus y of 0,
5:24
plus 6 times the Laplace Transform-- oh I ran out of
5:27
space, I'll do it in another line-- plus 6 times the
5:31
Laplace Transform of y.
5:34
All of that is equal to 0.
5:35
I know this looks really confusing but we'll
5:36
simplify right now.
5:37
And we could get rid of this right here, because we've used
5:39
it as much as we need to.
5:42
So now we just simplify.
5:45
And notice, using the Laplace Transform, we didn't have to
5:46
guess at a general solution or anything like that.
5:49
Even when we did a characteristic equation, we
5:50
guessed what the original general solution was.
5:53
Now we're just taking Laplace Transforms, and let's see
5:54
where this gets us.
5:57
And actually I just want to make clear, because I know
5:59
it's very confusing, so I rewrote this part as this.
6:09
And I rewrote this thing as this.
6:14
And everything else is the same.
6:15
But now let's simplify the math.
6:17
So we get s squared, times the Laplace Transform of y-- I'm
6:23
going to write smaller, I've learned my lesson-- minus s
6:28
times y of 0.
6:32
Let's substitute y of 0 here. y of 0 is 2, so s times y of 0
6:35
is 2 times s, so 2s, distribute that s, minus y
6:41
prime of 0.
6:42
Y prime of 0 is 3.
6:44
So minus 3, plus-- so we have 5 times s times the Laplace
6:52
Transform of y, so plus 5s times the Laplace Transform of
6:58
y, minus 5 times y of 0. y of 0 is 2, so minus 10.
7:07
Minus 10, right?
7:08
5 times-- this is 2 right here-- so 5 times 2, plus 6
7:14
times the Laplace Transform of y.
7:18
All of that is equal to 0.
7:22
Now, let's group our Laplace Transform of y terms and our
7:26
constant terms, and we should be hopefully
7:28
getting some place.
7:30
So let's see, my Laplace Transform of y terms, I have
7:33
this one, I have this one, and I have that one.
7:39
So what am I left with?
7:40
Well let me factor out the Laplace Transform of y part.
7:43
So I get the Laplace Transform of y-- and that's good because
7:47
it's a pain to keep writing it over and over-- times s
7:50
squared plus 5s plus 6.
8:02
So those are all my Laplace Transform terms. And then I
8:05
have my constant terms. So let's see, I have 1s, so minus
8:09
2s, minus 3, minus 10, is equal to 0.
8:20
And what can we do here?
8:21
Well, this is interesting, first of all.
8:23
Notice that the coefficients on the Laplace Transform of y
8:28
terms, that those are that characteristic equation that
8:31
we dealt with so much, and that is hopefully, to some
8:33
degree, second nature to you.
8:34
So that's a little bit of a clue, and if you want some
8:38
very tenuous connections, well that makes a lot of sense.
8:40
Because the characteristic equation to get that, we
8:43
substituted e to the rt, and the Laplace Transform involves
8:47
very similar function.
8:48
But anyway, let's go back to the problem.
8:49
So how do we solve this?
8:51
And actually, let me just give you the big picture here,
8:53
because this is a good point.
8:54
What I'm going to do is I'm going to solve this.
8:56
I'm going to say the Laplace Transform of
8:58
y is equal to something.
9:00
And then I'm going to say, boy, what functions the
9:03
Laplace Transform is at something?
9:05
And then I'll have the solution.
9:06
If that confuses you, just wait and hopefully it'll make
9:09
some sense.
9:09
From here until that point it's just some
9:11
fairly hairy algebra.
9:13
So let's scroll down a little bit, just so we have some
9:16
breathing room.
9:17
And so I get the Laplace Transform of y, times s
9:23
squared, plus 5s, plus 6, is equal to-- let's add these
9:29
terms to both sides of this equation-- is equal to 2s plus
9:34
3 plus 10-- oh, that's silly-- plus 13.
9:40
This is minus 13 here.
9:42
A phone call.
9:44
Who's calling?
9:45
I think it's some kind of marketing phone call.
9:48
Anyway, 2s plus 13, and now what can I do?
9:51
Well.
9:51
Let's divide both sides by this s squared plus 5s plus 6.
9:55
So I get the Laplace Transform of y is equal to 2s plus 13,
10:08
over s squared plus 5s plus 6.
10:13
Now we're almost done.
10:15
Everything here is just a little bit of algebra.
10:17
So now we're almost done.
10:19
We haven't solved for y yet, but we know that the Laplace
10:21
Transform of y is equal to this.
10:23
Now, if we just had this in our table of our Laplace
10:27
Transforms, we would immediately know what y was,
10:29
but I don't see something, or I don't remember anything we
10:31
did in our table that looks like this expression of s.
10:35
I'm essentially out of time, so the next video we're going
10:39
to figure out what functions Laplace Transform is this.
10:42
And it actually turns out it's a sum of things we already
10:45
know, and we just have to manipulate this a little bit
10:47
algebraically.
10:48

Let's think about how or what 1/2 times 5 represents.
0:07
So one way to think about it is that this could be five 1/2's
0:11
added together.
0:12
So you could view this as 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2
0:17
plus 1/2 plus 1/2, which is the same thing as 1 plus 1 plus 1
0:22
plus 1 plus 1, over 2, which is equal to 5/2.
0:32
The other way to think about this
0:34
is that you start with 5 things.
0:41
So let's say, that's 1 thing.
0:42
Let me copy and paste that so they all look the same.
0:47
So then let me paste it.
0:48
So that's 2 things.
0:51
That's 3 things.
0:53
That's 4 things.
0:56
And that's 5 things.
0:58
So the other way to think about it is you start with 5 things,
1:01
and you take 1/2 of them.
1:03
So what would be 1/2 of this?
1:06
Well, let's see.
1:07
You have 5 things, so you would get-- 5 divided by 2
1:11
would be 2 and 1/2.
1:13
So you would get this far.
1:16
Let me make it like this.
1:18
So you would get this one.
1:20
You would get this one.
1:22
And you would get this one.
1:24
Now, is this the same thing as 5/2?
1:27
Well, what happens if we divide each of these wholes
1:29
into halves?
1:30
So let's do that.
1:32
So if we just multiplied-- so we just divide each of these
1:36
into 2.
1:37
So instead of having 5 wholes, we now have 10 halves.
1:44
How many of those halves have we filled in?
1:47
Well, we have filled in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
1:52
So this is also equal to 5/2.
2:02
So far we just did it thinking about what
2:04
multiplication actually means.
2:06
But if you said, well, how did I compute this?
2:09
Well, the way you could think about it,
2:11
and multiplying fractions is actually
2:13
straightforward from that point of view,
2:15
is as long as you can express both of them as fractions,
2:19
and 5 we already know is the same thing as 5 ones,
2:24
so this we can just multiply times 5/1.
2:32
So now that I've expressed both of them as fractions,
2:35
I can just multiply the numerator.
2:37
So 1 times 5 over 2 times 1.
2:51
And what's that going to be equal to?
2:53
Well, 1 times 5 is 5.
2:57
2 times 1 is 2.
3:03
So once again, we get 5/2.",How do you multiply negative mixed numbers?

We know the US is running a relatively large trade
0:03
deficit relative to China in 2009.
0:06
We imported $260 billion more than we exported to China.
0:13
And we know from the last few videos
0:15
that the way that China is keeping their currency
0:18
from appreciating because of this trade imbalance
0:20
is that they're going out there, printing money, and using
0:23
that yuan to buy dollar assets.
0:27
And we see over here in 2006, 2007, 2008,
0:31
major increases in US assets.
0:34
But what's a little bit more interesting
0:36
is that, in 2009, we didn't have a huge increase.
0:39
It's pretty large by any standard, but not large enough
0:42
to offset the actual trade imbalance.
0:44
So how did China keep its currency peg?
0:47
Even better, let's actually look at-- because this isn't just
0:50
the Chinese government.
0:51
These are just ownership of US assets by Chinese nationals.
0:56
But we can actually look at the major foreign holders
0:59
of treasury securities.
1:01
This actually comes from the Treasury's own website.
1:04
And it tells us how much different central banks,
1:08
how many the treasury securities they are actually holding.
1:12
And you can see China is the biggest holder.
1:16
If you go to November of 2009, it has $929 billion.
1:21
This is the People's Bank of China.
1:23
It has $929 billion worth of US treasuries.
1:29
But what's interesting here, it is the largest holder,
1:31
but as we go from November of 2009 to November of 2010
1:35
their holdings actually went down.
1:38
Not by a ton.
1:39
They're still right around $900 billion.
1:41
But they went down.
1:43
So given the fact that we have this trade deficit, given
1:45
the fact that they want to peg their currency,
1:48
and that they want to print money, and go
1:49
buy other people's assets, how did this happen?
1:52
How did the number of treasuries actually go down?
1:56
And actually how were they able to reduce the amount of all US
2:00
assets that they bought?
2:03
Now, the treasury answer is they don't
2:05
have to just buy treasuries.
2:06
They could by other US assets, but even over here we
2:09
saw that they didn't buy a ton of other US assets.
2:12
And a clue to what's happening here,
2:15
and this isn't exactly what's necessarily happening,
2:17
it's far more complicated than I could explain in one video,
2:20
is that we do see other countries whose US Treasury
2:23
holdings are increasing dramatically
2:25
over the course of 2010.
2:27
In particular, you see the United Kingdom.
2:31
Their holdings have grown from $155 billion to $500 billion
2:36
over the course of 2010.
2:38
And this is relative.
2:39
The United Kingdom does not have a significant trade imbalance
2:43
one way or the other with the United States.
2:45
And we actually see we actually see that it's currency really
2:49
didn't change much over the course of 2010.
2:52
It's been about the same.
2:54
And this looks more dramatic than it really is.
2:57
So the answer, and it could be much more complicated
3:00
than this, is that China has decided to somewhat diversify
3:03
from buying US treasuries, and in particular US assets.
3:07
And maybe they're diversifying to the pound sterling,
3:10
maybe they're diversifying to the Euro.
3:12
And so they will start buying, say, British assets.
3:17
But the British don't want their currency
3:19
to appreciate too much because then they'll
3:21
suffer trade consequences.
3:23
Their goods will be too expensive.
3:25
And so the British Central Bank would then
3:27
want to maybe, so that their currency does not
3:29
appreciate relative to the dollar,
3:31
they'll want to go and buy American assets.
3:35
And that's what it looks like is actually happening.
3:37
And maybe one other small point is that the Chinese government
3:40
has slowly allowed its currency to appreciate.
3:43
But the appreciation isn't as dramatic
3:46
as this chart makes it look.
3:47
This is 6.8 yuan to the dollar at the beginning of 2010
3:53
to about 6.6.
3:55
And we're not getting close to 0 here.
3:57
This is just from 6.8 to 6.6.
3:59
But over the last several years they
4:01
have slowly been allowing their currency to appreciate.
4:04
But what's really happening is that they're diversifying away
4:07
from dollar assets.
4:08
But when they buy those other currencies
4:10
those people are going to want to buy dollar assets to keep
4:12
their currency from moving too much.","I checked the government web page, looks like now United kingdom data are different, instead of 511 bn i see now 242,5 bn, why?"

- [Voiceover] Hello, my name is Jennifer Riley,
0:02
and I'm a cognitive scientist who studies
0:04
text comprehension and reasoning.
0:07
The goal of this video is to help you
0:08
better understand the new section of the MCAT,
0:11
called the critical analysis and reasoning skills section.
0:16
Its main purpose is to figure out how well
0:18
you can understand and reason about the things you read.
0:22
In this part of the test, you'll read nine passages.
0:26
Each one is about 500 to 600 words long,
0:29
and you'll usually be asked between
0:30
five to seven questions about each passage.
0:34
In total, you'll go through 53 questions in 90 minutes.
0:37
That means you have about 10 minutes per passage,
0:40
on average.
0:43
In terms of the topics that you'll be reading about,
0:45
approximately half of these passages
0:46
will come from the humanities,
0:49
such as literature, philosophy or ethics.
0:52
The other half will come from social sciences,
0:55
such as psychology, sociology or economics.
0:59
For example, one of the passages
1:01
that's in the Khan Academy MCAT collection
1:04
discusses how people negotiate deals with one another,
1:07
and when they believe they are getting a fair deal.
1:10
Another passage is about how computers,
1:12
rather than just being tools used by humans,
1:15
might actually be changing the way that humans think.
1:18
The passages come from a lot of different areas,
1:20
and are meant to stretch your mind a bit.
1:23
You'll probably find that the topics
1:24
of these passages will be unfamiliar.
1:26
You're not expected to already
1:28
know about any of these topics.
1:30
Sometimes the writing styles will be complicated.
1:33
Some words may be new to you,
1:34
and some passages may be tough to understand.
1:37
Just remember, everything that you need to know
1:39
to answer the questions will be in the passages.
1:43
You're not expected to know any background information.
1:45
In fact, to do well, you really need to just focus on
1:49
the passage, and not information that you already know
1:52
from elsewhere.
1:53
There are three types of questions you'll be asked
1:55
to answer in this section.
1:58
The first type is called foundations of comprehension.
2:01
These questions mainly ask you to answer
2:03
questions about the author's intended message.
2:07
They'll ask you about the overall idea,
2:10
or about why the author used specific words or phrases,
2:14
or why the author organized the passage in a specific way.
2:18
The second category is called reasoning within the text,
2:22
and these questions mainly ask you to think
2:24
about the reasoning within an author's argument,
2:27
such as, what claim is an author trying to support
2:31
with a piece of evidence?
2:32
Or, is an argument flawed?
2:35
The third category is called reasoning beyond the text.
2:38
Questions in this category ask you to apply
2:41
ideas from the passage to new situations,
2:43
or to think about how the author's main message
2:47
would change if there were new information to consider.
2:50
This new information will be given to you in the question.
2:54
About a third of the questions will come from each category.
2:57
You should expect about 30%
2:59
foundations of comprehension questions,
3:01
30% reasoning within the text questions,
3:05
and 40% reasoning beyond the text questions.
3:09
People often wonder how the skills that are tested
3:12
by the critical analysis and reasoning skills section
3:15
will ever be useful for a future physician.
3:18
These questions are on the MCAT
3:20
because doctors need to be able to reason
3:22
through a lot of clinical information.
3:25
For example, these skills are needed
3:27
when you need to analyze information
3:29
to come up with a treatment plan that makes sense
3:31
for a patient, and also so that you can explain
3:34
your reasoning to others, including the patient,
3:37
family members, or other members of your medical team.
3:41
For more information on this section of the test,
3:44
and on each of the question types,
3:45
be sure to see the other videos in this section,
3:48
which I hope will help you, too.","I don't understand how American colleges work i am not in US but i am study now in my third year in collage at my country studying industrial microbiology and applied chemistry and i want to prepare for mid test in US should i learn mcat to enter mid school if not what should i learn to be ready to enter mid school in US, and please give me very explained info, also should i take TOEFL or IETLS exam and should i take SAT or ACT exam or not ?"

In this video we're going to talk about another way of
0:03
visualizing data called the histogram, which is a very
0:09
fancy word for a not so fancy thing.
0:14
I think it's probably fair to say that the histogram is the
0:18
most used way of representing statistical data.
0:22
Let me just show you how to figure out a histogram for
0:25
some data, and I think you're going to get the
0:26
point pretty easily.
0:28
So I have some data here and I want to
0:30
represent it with a histogram.
0:33
What we're going to see is how frequent are
0:35
each of these numbers.
0:37
And in order to figure that out, let me just write the
0:39
numbers down, let me just categorize them in their
0:41
respective buckets.
0:43
So I have a 1 here.
0:48
I have a 4, so I want to leave space for the 2, the 3, and
0:54
put a 4 there.
0:55
I have a 2.
0:57
I have a 1.
0:59
Let me put that 1 on a stack right above that 1.
1:02
I have a 0-- let me put the 0 to the left of the 1.
1:06
I want to put them in order.
1:08
I have a 2, another 2.
1:10
Let me stack that above my first 2.
1:12
I have another 1.
1:14
Let me stack that above my other two 1's.
1:16
I have another 0.
1:17
Let me stack it there.
1:20
I have another 1.
1:24
Then I have another 2.
1:27
Another 1.
1:29
I have two more 0's.
1:32
0, 0.
1:33
I have two more 2's.
1:37
I have a 3.
1:41
I have two more 1's.
1:44
Another 3.
1:46
And then I have a 6.
1:49
So no 5's, and then I have a 6.
1:52
And that space right there was unnecessary.
1:54
But right here I've listed-- I've just rewritten those
1:56
numbers and I've essentially categorized them.
1:58
Now what I want to do is calculate how many of each of
2:01
these numbers we have. So let me go down here.
2:06
So I want to look at the frequency of
2:08
each of these numbers.
2:12
So I have one, two, three, four 0's.
2:16
I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven 1's.
2:20
I have one, two, three, four, five 2's.
2:24
I have one, two 3's.
2:26
I have one 4, and one 6.
2:31
So we could write it this way.
2:32
We could write the number, and then we
2:37
can have the frequency.
2:43
So I have the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4-- we could even throw 5
2:49
in there, although 5 has a frequency of 0.
2:52
And we have a 6.
2:53
So the 0 showed up four times in this data set.
2:57
1 showed up seven times in this data set.
3:01
2 showed up five times, 3 showed up to two times, 4
3:08
showed up one time, 5 didn't show up, and 6
3:12
showed up one time.
3:13
All I did is I counted this data set, and I did this
3:16
first. But you could say how many times do I see a 0?
3:18
I see it one, two, three, four times.
3:21
How many times do I see a 1?
3:22
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven times.
3:27
That's what we mean by frequency.
3:29
Now a histogram is really just a plot, kind of a bar graph,
3:34
plotting the frequency of each of these numbers.
3:36
It's going to look a lot like this original
3:38
thing that I drew.
3:40
So let me draw some axes here.
3:44
So the different buckets here are the numbers.
3:46
And that worked out because we're dealing with very clean
3:47
integers that tend to repeat.
3:49
If you're dealing with things that the exact number doesn't
3:54
repeat, oftentimes people will put the numbers
3:56
into buckets or ranges.
3:58
But here they fit into nice little buckets.
4:00
You have the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
4:08
This is the actual numbers.
4:09
And then on the vertical axis we're
4:11
going to plot the frequency.
4:15
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
4:20
So that's 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
4:25
So 0 shows up four times.
4:28
So we'll draw a little bar graph here.
4:29
0 shows up four times.
4:31
Draw it just like that.
4:34
0 shows up four times.
4:36
That is that information right there.
4:40
1 shows up seven times.
4:44
So I'll do a little bar graph.
4:45
1 shows up seven times.
4:48
Just like that.
4:50
I want to make it a little bit straighter than that-- 1 shows
4:53
up seven times.
4:58
2-- I'll do it in a different color-- 2 shows up five times.
5:06
Do a bar graph, go all the way up to five.
5:10
2 shows up five times.
5:12
3 shows up two times.
5:20
We have one 3, two 3's.
5:24
4 shows up one time here.
5:31
5 doesn't show up at all.
5:33
So it doesn't even get any height there.
5:37
And then finally, 6 shows up one time.
5:44
So I'll do 6 showing up one time.
5:47
What I just plotted here, this is a histogram.
5:51
This right here is a histogram.
5:53
Very fancy word, but I think you will agree it's a fairly
5:56
simple idea.
5:58
Figure out the frequency of each of these numbers and then
6:01
plot the frequency of each of these numbers and you get
6:04
yourself a histogram.","For example, if you had a data set that [Key: __:___= number:frequency] had 1:6 3:8 21:6, would you have to put 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19, 20, and 21?"

0:00
Once upon a time, there was a small world.
0:03
It was a flat world.
0:05
And it wasn't very wide.
0:06
In fact, it was so thin that if you weren't careful,
0:09
you might fall right off the edge.
0:11
In this world was a house.
0:14
And in this house lived a triangle.
0:16
Her name was wind.
0:18
Wind lived all alone, and was sometimes sad about that.
0:22
But she wasn't too lonely because she
0:24
had a friend who lived just one house over.
0:26
His name was Mr. Ug.
0:29
Wind often went to visit Mr. Ug.
0:31
She'd walked past the big rock, and the pine log, and the Beet
0:35
Peel store, though she'd never seen it open,
0:37
until she got to Mr. Ug's little yellow house.
0:41
The problem with Mr. Ug was that he never seemed to be home.
0:46
So Wind did what she always did, and left him a message so
0:49
that he'd know that she'd been there.
0:51
Hi Mr. Ug, she wrote.
0:54
She hung around a little longer hoping he might come home soon,
0:57
but eventually she gave up and walked back home.
0:59
Past the Beet Peel store, the pine log, and the big rock,
1:03
to her own little house.
1:05
When she got back, she saw that someone had left her a message.
1:08
It said, Hi Wind.
1:10
Mr. Ug must have come by to see her
1:12
while she was out trying to see him.
1:14
She kicked herself for waiting around so long at his house,
1:16
maybe if she'd gotten back sooner,
1:18
she could've caught him while he was still there.
1:20
She erased the message and decided to go back to his place
1:22
since he was obviously heading back there as well.
1:25
Their timing always seemed to be wrong.
1:28
Whenever she went to see him, he seemed to be out visiting her.
1:31
In fact, she never actually met Mr. Ug,
1:33
but she felt like she knew him very well,
1:34
because of the messages they were always leaving each other.
1:37
When she got to his place, she saw
1:39
that he had already read her message,
1:41
erased it, and left again.
1:43
But Wind was used to this kind of coincidence,
1:45
so she simply continued their conversation
1:47
by leaving another message.
1:49
How are you right now, she asked, and turned around
1:51
to go home.
1:53
Her grammar and spelling weren't so good,
1:55
because, after all, there was no school in her little world.
1:58
Mr. Ug didn't always have perfect spelling either,
2:01
but Wind thought that he had a lovely way with words.
2:04
For example, when she got home, she
2:05
found that Mr. Ug had already written a reply to her
2:08
how are you.
2:09
He said, Nomin' life, nom.
2:12
She thought this was a beautiful metaphor,
2:14
and felt lucky to have a neighbor who never answered how
2:17
are you, with something boring like, fine thank you.
2:20
But what she really wanted, more than anything,
2:23
was to actually meet him.
2:25
See his face for the first time.
2:27
She decided to try another tactic.
2:29
She erased his note and left one saying, back soon.
2:32
This way, if Mr. Ug came to visit while she was out,
2:35
he'd know to stay around for a while until she got back.
2:39
The prospect of finally meeting him
2:41
made Wind feel nervous and self conscious about how
2:43
boring her messages always were compared to his.
2:46
So she decided to get artistic and illustrated it
2:48
by drawing a foot with wings on the hill.
2:51
She then rushed back to Mr. Ug's house
2:53
with all the swiftness of Hermes,
2:54
to find that, indeed, he was, once again, not there.
2:57
Though it seemed he had taken up a new project as there
3:00
was a sign up for a Buck Zoo, complete
3:02
with a picture of a fully antlered buck.
3:05
Maybe he was out collecting deer for his zoo,
3:08
but maybe, just maybe, he had gone to visit her
3:10
and saw her sign, and decided to wait until she got back.
3:14
So she dashed out a quick, hello, leaving.
3:16
And then rushed back to her house
3:18
with all the swiftness of Mercury.
3:21
She approached her house, anticipating finally
3:23
saying hello to Mr. Ug in real life, for the first time.
3:26
But found only a message that said, revalue hello.
3:30
It was an interesting message, and gave her something
3:32
to ponder.
3:33
Maybe she was spending too much time trying to greet and talk
3:36
to Mr. Ug, and not enough time on her own projects.
3:39
She thought about how often they seem to cross paths,
3:43
and yet, she'd never actually passed him
3:44
on the path between their houses.
3:46
Maybe there was another path he used.
3:48
Wind had never explored the world to the left of her house,
3:51
but maybe it was about time she stopped obsessing over Mr. Ug
3:54
and went on an adventure.
3:56
Maybe, while Mr. Ug worked on his Buck Zoo,
3:59
she could have a project of her own
4:01
and work on exploring the world.
4:03
So she went left, and discovered a few new places.
4:06
There was a store which sold beef and beer,
4:09
though unfortunately it seemed to have closed long ago.
4:12
And a blue rod, and a lock pie, which didn't sound
4:15
too appetizing to her.
4:17
Before long, however, she found herself somewhere familiar.
4:20
She was back at Mr. Ug's house, and as usual, he was not home.
4:25
But now she knew why they kept missing each other.
4:28
Their little world was a loop, and they
4:30
were taking different paths from one side to the other.
4:33
Wind was very excited by this discovery
4:35
because now she understood her world a little better.
4:38
Best of all, in such a small world, her and Mr. Ug
4:40
were bound to meet eventually.
4:43
So she went home and decided to start another project.
4:46
Sometimes she worried that one of them
4:47
would accidentally fall off the edge of the world,
4:49
and she would never get to meet Mr. Ug.
4:52
After all, she herself had fallen off
4:54
the flat land where she grew up, which
4:56
was how she'd gotten here.
4:57
She'd thought about building a fence along the edge,
5:00
but it had always seemed like too big a project.
5:02
Now that she knew that her world was a loop,
5:04
she realized she could actually finish this project
5:07
and build a fence around the entire world.
5:10
She started with the side below her house,
5:12
and started around towards Mr. Ug's.
5:15
She passed the big rock, and the pine log,
5:17
and the beet peel store, until she
5:19
got to Mr. Ug's little yellow house, her heart fluttering
5:22
at the hope that he might be home this time.
5:24
But she saw to her surprise that Mr. Ug
5:26
was building a fence of his own on the other edge of the world.
5:29
Maybe he had gone to visit her, and saw the beginnings
5:31
of her fence, and decided to help out.
5:33
Wind continued building her fence,
5:35
thinking how sweet it was that Mr. Ug was
5:37
helping with her project.
5:39
She passed the lock pie, and the blue rod,
5:42
and the beef and beer store.
5:44
And when she got back to her home,
5:45
she was pleased to see that her entire world was safe
5:49
and she only had to build a fence along one edge of it.
5:52
Secure in the knowledge that Mr. Ug wasn't going anywhere,
5:55
Wind started pursuing other projects in the following days.
5:58
For example, she got a pet dog which
6:00
helped her feel a bit less lonely,
6:02
and built it a dog house.
6:04
She still wandered over to Mr. Ug's place
6:06
on occasion, just to see how he was doing.
6:08
It seemed that recently he'd gotten religious,
6:10
because he built what appeared to be a small church.
6:13
One day, Wind was out walking her dog
6:15
when the ground started to shake.
6:17
Suddenly, the ground began to split.
6:20
It was an earthquake so powerful that it
6:22
was ripping her world apart.
6:24
Wind quickly got away from the dangerous new edge that
6:27
was being torn through her world,
6:28
but her dog was still on the other side.
6:31
She ran trying to get past the crack,
6:32
but the world was splitting right down the center,
6:34
all the way around.
6:36
She could still hear her dog barking,
6:37
but the sound faded as the two sides of her worlds separated
6:41
and drifted apart.
6:42
Would she ever see her dog again?
6:45
And what about Mr. Ug?
6:47
I hate to end on a cliffhanger, but luckily for you, you
6:50
can figure out the ending to this story yourself.
6:52
Wind lives on not just any loop, but a Mobius strip,
6:55
which you can make easily out of paper.
6:57
Just cut out a strip, and instead of taping it
6:59
into a normal loop, give it a half twist first.
7:01
If you use a marker that bleeds through the paper,
7:03
you can draw Wind's house and see it from the other side.
7:06
But all that's essential here is that you draw wind and her dog.
7:09
Cut a line down the center of the paper, all the way around,
7:12
and you tell me how it ends.",Is wind mr.ug in backwards?

Welcome back.
0:01
We just finished this problem with the pulleys and the
0:03
inclined plane.
0:04
And I just wanted to do one final thing on this problem
0:06
just because I think it's interesting.
0:08
And then we can move onto what seems like
0:11
a pretty fun problem.
0:12
So the last thing I want to figure out is, we figured out
0:14
that this 20 kilo-- actually, the whole system will
0:17
accelerate up and to the right at 4.13
0:20
meters per second squared.
0:22
And then the second part of this question is, what is the
0:24
tension in this rope or this wire?
0:28
And at first you might say, this is complicated.
0:30
You know, this thing isn't static anymore.
0:32
The thing is actually accelerating.
0:34
How do I do it?
0:35
Well this is how you think about it.
0:36
Just pick one part of the system.
0:39
Let's say that all we could see was this 20 kilogram mass.
0:43
So let's say all we could see was this 20 kilogram mass.
0:48
And we know it's suspended from a wire.
0:50
And we also know that this 20 kilogram mass is not
0:54
accelerating as fast as it would if
0:56
the wire wasn't there.
0:57
It's accelerating only at 4.13 meters per second.
1:01
If the wire wasn't there, it'd be accelerating at 9.8 meters
1:04
per second, the acceleration of gravity.
1:06
So the wire must be exerting some upward
1:09
force on the object.
1:10
And that is the force of tension.
1:13
That is what's slowing-- that's what's moderating its
1:17
acceleration from being 9.8 meters per second squared to
1:21
being 4.13 meters per second squared.
1:24
So essentially, what is the net force on this object?
1:27
On just this object?
1:29
Well the net force is-- and you can ignore what I said
1:32
before about the net force in all the other places.
1:36
But we know that the object is accelerating downwards.
1:42
Well, we know it's 20 kilograms. So that's its mass.
1:44
And we know that it's accelerating downwards at 4.13
1:46
meters per second squared.
1:51
So the net force, 20 times-- see, times 20 is 82-- let's
2:00
just say 83 Newtons.
2:03
83 Newtons down.
2:05
We know that the net force is 83 Newtons down.
2:08
We also know that the tension force plus the force of
2:16
gravity-- and what's the force of gravity?
2:18
The force of gravity is just the weight of the object.
2:20
So the force of tension, which goes up, plus the weight of --
2:24
the force of gravity is equal to the net force.
2:29
And the way I set this up, tension's going to be a
2:31
negative number.
2:33
Just because I'm saying positive numbers are
2:36
downwards, so a negative number would be upwards.
2:39
So tension will be what is 83 minus 196?
2:46
Minus 196 is equal to minus 113 Newtons.
2:54
And the only reason why I got a negative number is because I
2:57
used positive numbers for downwards.
2:59
So minus 113 Newtons downwards, which is the same
3:02
thing as 113 Newtons upwards.
3:06
And so that is the tension in the rope.
3:09
And you could have done the same thing on this side of the
3:11
problem, although it would have been-- well, yeah.
3:14
You could have done the exact same thing on
3:15
this side of the problem.
3:16
You would've said, well what would it have accelerated
3:17
naturally if there wasn't some force of tension on this rope
3:20
going backwards?
3:22
And then you're saying, oh, well, we know it would have
3:24
gone in this direction at some acceleration, but instead it's
3:26
going in the other direction.
3:27
So you use that.
3:29
You figure out the net force, and then you say the tension
3:31
plus all of these forces have to equal the net force.
3:33
And then you should solve for the tension.
3:36
And it would be the same tension.
3:38
Now we will do a fun and somewhat simple, but maybe
3:44
instructive problem.
3:46
So I have a pie.
3:49
This is the pie.
3:54
This is parallel.
3:55
And I have my hand.
3:58
You can tell that my destiny was really to be a great
4:02
artist. This is my hand.
4:04
And I'm holding a pie, and I'm looking to smash this pie into
4:10
this individual's face.
4:19
I actually was a, I was the newspaper cartoonist in high
4:24
school, so I have some minor-- but anyway.
4:28
Let's make it a bald man.
4:30
Well anyway, I shouldn't be focusing on the drawing.
4:36
He has a moustache.
4:41
Anyway, I'm looking to throw this pie into this guy's face.
4:45
And the problem is, I need to figure out how fast do I need
4:49
to accelerate this pie for it to not fall down?
4:52
Right?
4:52
Because what's happening?
4:53
Well there's the force of gravity on this pie.
4:56
There's a force of gravity on this pie and if I don't
4:58
accelerate it fast enough, it's just going to slide down.
5:01
And I'll never be able to, It'll never
5:03
reach the guy's face.
5:04
So I don't want this pie to slide down at all.
5:06
How fast do I have to push on it?
5:09
Well, we know that the coefficient of friction-- you
5:11
don't know this, but I know that the coefficient of
5:13
friction between my hand and the pie, the coefficient of
5:17
friction is equal to 0.8.
5:23
So given that, how fast do I have to accelerate it?
5:26
Well let's see what's happening.
5:28
So we have the force of gravity pulling down.
5:30
So let's say that the mass of the pie is m.
5:35
m equals mass.
5:38
So what is the force of gravity
5:40
pulling down on the pie?
5:41
Well the force of gravity is just equal to m times 9.8.
5:47
Right?
5:48
The force of gravity is equal to m times 9.8.
5:51
In order for this pie to not move down, what do we know
5:55
about the net forces on that pie?
5:57
Well we know the net forces on that pie have to be 0.
6:02
So what would be the offsetting force?
6:04
Well, it would be the force of friction.
6:05
So we would have a force of friction acting upwards.
6:08
Right?
6:08
Because the force of friction always acts opposite to the
6:11
direction that the thing would move otherwise.
6:14
So essentially, our force of friction has to be greater
6:20
than, roughly, greater than or equal to.
6:23
Because if it's greater than, it's not like the pie is going
6:24
to move up.
6:25
Friction by itself will never move something, it'll just
6:28
keep something from being moved.
6:29
But let's just figure out the minimum.
6:31
I won't do the whole inequalities.
6:33
The force of friction has to be equal similarly, to 9.8
6:37
times the mass of the pie.
6:42
So if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, what is the
6:46
force that I have to apply?
6:50
Well, the force I have to apply in this case is going to
6:52
be the normal force, right?
6:53
That's normal to the bottom of the pie.
6:58
Right?
7:00
My hand is now like the surface of the ramp.
7:03
So this is the normal force.
7:05
And we know that the force of friction is equal to the
7:09
coefficient of friction times the normal force.
7:11
I'm going to switch colors because this is getting
7:12
monotonous.
7:15
And the force of friction, we know has to be
7:17
9.8 times the mass.
7:20
So 9.8 meters per second times the mass.
7:23
9.8m is the force of friction.
7:25
And that has to equal to coefficient of friction times
7:27
the normal force.
7:28
And remember, the normal force is essentially the force that
7:31
I'm pushing the pie with.
7:33
And we know this is 0.8, so we have 9.8 times the mass--
7:38
that's not meters, that's the mass-- is equal to 0.8 times
7:43
the normal force.
7:45
So you have the normal force is equal to 9.8 times the mass
7:51
divided by 0.8.
7:54
What's 9.8 divided by 0.8?
7:56
9.8 divided by 0.8 is equal to 12.25.
8:05
So the normal force that I have to apply is
8:08
12.25 times the mass.
8:12
So that's the force I'm applying.
8:14
It's time the mass.
8:15
We don't know the mass of the pie.
8:17
So how fast am I accelerating the pie?
8:19
Well, force is equal to mass times acceleration.
8:22
This is the force, 12.25m-- that's the force-- is equal to
8:29
the mass times the
8:31
acceleration of the pie, right?
8:32
And it's the same pie that we're dealing with the whole
8:34
time, so it's still m.
8:35
And you can take out m from both sides of the equation.
8:39
So the acceleration, the rate at which I have to change the
8:42
velocity, or the acceleration that I have to apply to the
8:45
pie is 12.25 meters per second squared.
8:53
And so actually, I have to apply more than 1g, right?
8:58
Because g is the force of gravity.
9:01
And gravity accelerates something at 9.8 seconds-- 9.8
9:05
meters per second squared.
9:06
So I have to do something at 12-- I have to push and
9:09
accelerate the pie at 12.25 meters per second squared.
9:13
So it's something a little over 1g in order for that pie
9:16
to not fall and in order for my normal force to provide a
9:19
force of friction so that the pie can reach
9:22
this bald man's face.

In this video, I'm going to do several examples of quadratic
0:03
equations that are really of a special form, and it's really
0:06
a bit of warm-up for the next video that we're going to do
0:10
on completing the square.
0:11
So let me show you what I'm talking about.
0:13
So let's say I have 4x plus 1 squared, minus
0:20
8 is equal to 0.
0:24
Now, based on everything we've done so far, you might be
0:26
tempted to multiply this out, then subtract 8 from the
0:29
constant you get out here, and then try to factor it.
0:33
And then you're going to have x minus something, times x
0:37
minus something else is equal to 0.
0:43
And you're going to say, oh, one of these must be equal to
0:45
0, so x could be that or that.
0:47
We're not going to do that this time, because you might
0:50
see something interesting here.
0:52
We can solve this without factoring it.
0:56
And how do we do that?
0:57
Well, what happens if we add 8 to both
0:59
sides of this equation?
1:02
Then the left-hand side of the equation becomes 4x plus 1
1:06
squared, and these 8's cancel out.
1:09
The right-hand becomes just a positive 8.
1:13
Now, what can we do to both sides of this equation?
1:15
And this is just kind of straight, vanilla
1:18
equation-solving.
1:19
This isn't any kind of fancy factoring.
1:21
We can take the square root of both sides of this equation.
1:28
We could take the square root.
1:29
So 4x plus 1-- I'm just taking the square root of both sides.
1:34
You take the square root of both sides, and, of course,
1:36
you want to take the positive and the negative square root,
1:39
because 4x plus 1 could be the positive square root of 8, or
1:43
it could be the negative square root of 8.
1:45
So 4x plus 1 is equal to the positive or negative
1:50
square root of 8.
1:51
Instead of 8, let me write 8 as 4 times 2.
1:55
We all know that's what 8 is, and obviously the square root
1:58
of 4x plus 1 squared is 4x plus 1.
2:02
So we get 4x plus 1 is equal to-- we can factor out the 4,
2:09
or the square root of 4, which is 2-- is equal to the plus or
2:12
minus times 2 times the square root of 2, right?
2:17
Square root of 4 times square root of 2 is the same thing as
2:19
square root of 4 times the square root of 2, plus or
2:23
minus the square root of 4 is that 2 right there.
2:26
Now, it might look like a really bizarro equation, with
2:29
this plus or minus 2 times the square of 2,
2:32
but it really isn't.
2:34
These are actually two numbers here, and we're actually
2:36
simultaneously solving two equations.
2:38
We could write this as 4x plus 1 is equal to the positive 2,
2:43
square root of 2, or 4x plus 1 is equal to negative 2 times
2:52
the square root of 2.
2:53
This one statement is equivalent to this right here,
2:56
because we have this plus or minus here, this or statement.
2:59
Let me solve all of these simultaneously.
3:01
So if I subtract 1 from both sides of this
3:05
equation, what do I have?
3:07
On the left-hand side, I'm just left with 4x.
3:10
On the right-hand side, I have-- you can't really
3:13
mathematically, I mean, you could do them if you had a
3:15
calculator, but I'll just leave it as negative 1 plus or
3:19
minus the square root, or 2 times the square root of 2.
3:23
That's what 4x is equal to.
3:25
If we did it here, as two separate equations, same idea.
3:28
Subtract 1 from both sides of this equation, you get 4x is
3:32
equal to negative 1 plus 2, times the square root of 2.
3:36
This equation, subtract 1 from both sides.
3:39
4x is equal to negative 1 minus 2, times the
3:44
square root of 2.
3:45
This statement right here is completely equivalent to these
3:52
two statements.
3:53
Now, last step, we just have to divide both sides by 4, so
3:57
you divide both sides by 4, and you get x is equal to
4:02
negative 1 plus or minus 2, times the square
4:06
root of 2, over 4.
4:09
Now, this statement is completely equivalent to
4:11
dividing each of these by 4, and you get x is equal to
4:16
negative 1 plus 2, times the square root 2, over 4.
4:21
This is one solution.
4:22
And then the other solution is x is equal to negative 1 minus
4:27
2 roots of 2, all of that over 4.
4:31
That statement and these two statements are equivalent.
4:35
And if you want, I encourage you to-- let's substitute one
4:38
of these back in, just so you feel confident that something
4:41
as bizarro as one of these expressions can be a solution
4:45
to a nice, vanilla-looking equation like this.
4:48
So let's substitute it back in.
4:50
4 times x, or 4 times negative 1, plus 2 root 2, over 4, plus
4:58
1 squared, minus 8 is equal to 0.
5:03
Now, these 4's cancel out, so you're left with negative 1
5:07
plus 2 roots 2, plus 1, squared, minus
5:12
8 is equal to 0.
5:14
This negative 1 and this positive 1 cancel out, so
5:17
you're left with 2 roots of 2 squared, minus
5:21
8 is equal to 0.
5:24
And then what are you going to have here?
5:28
So when you square this, you get 4 times 2, minus 8 is
5:33
equal to 0, which is true.
5:38
8 minus 8 is equal to 0.
5:40
And if you try this one out, you're going to get the exact
5:42
same answer.
5:44
Let's do another one like this.
5:45
And remember, these are special forms where we have
5:46
squares of binomials in our expression.
5:51
And we're going to see that the entire quadratic formula
5:53
is actually derived from a notion like this, because you
5:55
can actually turn any, you can turn any, quadratic equation
6:00
into a perfect square equalling something else.
6:05
We'll see that two videos from now.
6:06
But let's get a little warmed up just seeing
6:08
this type of thing.
6:09
So let's say you have x squared minus 10x, plus 25 is
6:16
equal to 9.
6:18
Now, once again your temptation-- and it's not a
6:20
bad temptation-- would be to subtract 9 from both sides, so
6:23
you get a 0 on the right-hand side, but before you do that,
6:27
just inspect this really fast. And say, hey, is this just
6:31
maybe a perfect square of a binomial?
6:34
And you see-- well, what two numbers when I multiply them I
6:38
get positive 25, and when I add them I get negative 10?
6:41
And hopefully negative 5 jumps out at you.
6:44
So this expression right here is x minus 5, times x minus 5.
6:52
So this left-hand side can be written as x minus 5 squared,
6:56
and the right-hand side is still 9.
6:59
And I want to really emphasize.
7:01
I don't want this to ruin all of the training you've gotten
7:03
on factoring so far.
7:05
We can only do this when this is a perfect square.
7:08
If you got, like, x minus 3, times x plus 4, and that would
7:12
be equal to 9, that would be a dead end.
7:15
You wouldn't be able to really do anything
7:16
constructive with that.
7:17
Only because this is a perfect square, can we now say x minus
7:21
5 squared is equal to 9, and now we can take the square
7:23
root of both sides.
7:25
So we could say that x minus 5 is equal to plus or minus 3.
7:31
Add 5 to both sides of this equation, you get x is equal
7:36
to 5 plus or minus 3, or x is equal to-- what's 5 plus 3?
7:43
Well, x could be 8 or x could be equal to 5 minus 3, or x is
7:49
equal to 2.
7:51
Now, we could have done this equation, this quadratic
7:54
equation, the traditional way, the way you were
7:58
tempted to do it.
7:59
What happens if you subtract 9 from both
8:01
sides of this equation?
8:03
You'll get x squared minus 10x.
8:07
And what's 25 minus 9?
8:09
25 minus 9 is 16, and that would be equal to 0.
8:16
And here, this would be just a traditional factoring problem,
8:18
the type that we've seen in the last few videos.
8:21
What two numbers, when you take their product, you get
8:23
positive 16, and when you sum them you get negative 10?
8:29
And maybe negative 8 and negative 2
8:31
jump into your brain.
8:33
So we get x minus 8, times x minus 2 is equal to 0.
8:38
And so x could be equal to 8 or x could be equal to 2.
8:43
That's the fun thing about algebra: you can do things in
8:46
two completely different ways, but as long as you do them in
8:49
algebraically-valid ways, you're not going to get
8:52
different answers.
8:55
And on some level, if you recognize this, this is easier
8:57
because you didn't have to do that little game in your head,
8:58
in terms of, oh, what two numbers, when you multiply
9:01
them you get 16, and when you add them you get negative 10?
9:02
Here, you just said, OK, this is x minus 5-- oh, I guess you
9:05
did have to do it.
9:06
You had to say, oh, 5 times 5 is 25, and negative 10 is
9:10
negative 5 plus negative 5.
9:11
So I take that back, you still have to do that little
9:14
game in your head.
9:15
So let's do another one.
9:18
Let's do one more of these, just to really get ourselves
9:22
nice and warmed up here.
9:25
So, let's say we have x squared plus 18x, plus 81 is
9:38
equal to 1.
9:41
So once again, we can do it in two ways.
9:42
We could subtract 1 from both sides, or we could recognize
9:46
that this is x plus 9, times x plus 9.
9:53
This right here, 9 times 9 is 81, 9 plus 9 is 18.
9:58
So we can write our equation as x plus 9
10:01
squared is equal to 1.
10:03
Take the square root of both sides, you get x plus 9 is
10:06
equal to plus or minus the square root of 1,
10:09
which is just 1.
10:10
So x is equal to-- subtract 9 from both sides-- negative 9
10:15
plus or minus 1.
10:16
And that means that x could be equal to-- negative 9 plus 1
10:21
is negative 8, or x could be equal to-- negative 9 minus 1,
10:26
which is negative 10.
10:28
And once again, you could have done this the traditional way.
10:31
You could have subtracted 1 from both sides and you would
10:33
have gotten x squared plus 18x, plus 80 is equal to 0.
10:41
And you'd say, hey, gee, 8 times 10 is 80, 8 plus 10 is
10:44
18, so you get x plus 8, times x plus 10 is equal to 0.
10:50
And then you'd get x could be equal to negative 8, or x
10:54
could be equal to negative 10.
10:57
That was good warm up.
10:58
Now, I think we're ready to tackle completing the square.",what law allows sal to plus or minus 2 sq 2 from -1?
khan_video_5FEjrStgcF8_107,Science,MCQ,"•
0:00
The purpose of this video is to just begin
0:03
to appreciate how vast and enormous the universe is.
0:06
And frankly, our brains really can't grasp it.
0:09
What we'll see in this video is that we can't even
0:11
grasp things that are actually super small compared
0:13
to the size of the universe.
0:14
And we actually don't even know what
0:16
the entire size of the universe is.
0:17
But with that said, let's actually
0:19
just try to appreciate how small we are.
0:21
So this is me right over here.
0:24
I am 5 foot 9 inches, depending on whether I'm wearing shoes--
0:28
maybe 5 foot 10 with shoes.
0:30
But for the sake of this video, let's just roughly
0:32
approximate around 6 feet, or around roughly--
0:35
I'm not to go into the details of the math-- around 2 meters.
0:40
Now, if I were to lie down 10 times in a row,
0:43
you'd get about the length of an 18-wheeler.
0:46
That's about 60 feet long.
0:48
So this is times 10.
0:49
Now, if you were to put an 18-wheeler-- if you were
0:53
to make it tall, as opposed to long-- somehow stand it up--
0:56
and you were to do that 10 times in a row,
0:58
you'll get to the height of roughly a 60-story skyscraper.
1:03
So once again, if you took me and you piled me up 100 times,
1:07
you'll get about a 60-story skyscraper.
1:09
Now, if you took that skyscraper and if you
1:12
were to lie it down 10 times in a row,
1:15
you'd get something of the length of the Golden Gate
1:18
Bridge.
1:19
And once again, I'm not giving you the exact numbers.
1:21
It's not always going to be exactly 10.
1:23
But we're now getting to about something that's
1:25
a little on the order of a mile long.
1:28
So the Golden Gate Bridge is actually longer than a mile.
1:30
But if you go within the twin spans, it's roughly about
1:33
a mile.
1:33
It's actually a little longer than that.
1:35
But that gives you a sense of a mile.
1:37
Now, if you multiply that by 10, you
1:40
get to the size of a large city.
1:43
And this right here is a satellite photograph
1:45
of San Francisco.
1:47
This is the actual Golden Gate Bridge here.
1:49
And when I copy and pasted this picture,
1:51
I tried to make it roughly 10 miles by 10 miles
1:54
just so you appreciate the scale.
1:56
And what's interesting here-- and this picture's interesting.
1:58
Because this is the first time we can relate to cities.
2:02
But when you look at a city on this scale,
2:04
it's starting to get larger than what
2:06
we're used to processing on a daily basis.
2:09
A bridge-- we've been on a bridge.
2:11
We know what a bridge looks like.
2:12
We know that a bridge is huge.
2:14
But it doesn't feel like something
2:15
that we can't comprehend.
2:17
Already, a city is something that we
2:19
can't comprehend all at once.
2:20
We can drive across a city.
2:21
We can look at satellite imagery.
2:23
But if I were to show a human on this,
2:26
it would be unbelievably, unbelievably small.
2:28
You wouldn't actually be able to see it.
2:30
It would be less than a pixel on this image.
2:32
A house is less than a pixel on this image.
2:35
But let's keep multiplying by 10.
2:38
If you multiply by 10 again, you get to something
2:41
roughly the size of the San Francisco Bay Area.
2:44
This whole square over here is roughly that square right
2:47
over there.
2:48
Let's multiply by 10 again.
2:52
So this square is about 100 miles by 100 miles.
2:55
So this one would be about 1,000 miles by 1,000 miles.
2:57
And now you're including a big part of the Western United
3:00
States.
3:01
You have California here.
3:03
You Nevada here.
3:04
You have Arizona and New Mexico--
3:06
so a big chunk of a big continent we're
3:08
already including.
3:09
And frankly, this is beyond the scale
3:11
that we're used to operating.
3:13
We've seen maps, so maybe we're a little used to it.
3:15
But if you ever had to walk across this type of distance,
3:18
it would take you a while.
3:19
To some degree, the fact that planes goes so fast-- almost
3:22
unimaginably fast for us-- that it's
3:25
made it feel like things like continents aren't as big.
3:28
Because you can fly across them in five or six hours.
3:30
But these are already huge, huge, huge distances.
3:33
But once again, you take this square
3:35
that's about 1,000 miles by 1,000 miles,
3:38
and you multiply that by 10.
3:40
And you get pretty close-- a little bit
3:42
over-- the diameter of the Earth-- a little bit
3:46
over the diameter of the Earth.
3:47
But once again, we're on the Earth.
3:49
We kind of relate to the Earth.
3:52
If you look carefully at the horizon,
3:54
you might see a little bit of a curvature,
3:56
especially if you were to get into the plane.
3:58
So even though this is, frankly, larger
4:01
than my brain can really grasp, we
4:03
can kind of relate to the Earth.
4:06
Now you multiply the diameter of Earth times 10.
4:10
And you get to the diameter of Jupiter.
4:13
And so if you were to sit Earth right next to Jupiter--
4:17
obviously, they're nowhere near that close.
4:19
That would destroy both of the planets.
4:21
Actually, it would definitely destroy Earth.
4:23
It would probably just be merged into Jupiter.
4:26
So if you put Earth next to Jupiter,
4:30
it would look something like that right over there.
4:34
So I would say that Jupiter is definitely-- on this diagram
4:38
that I'm drawing here-- is definitely
4:39
the first thing that I have I can't comprehend.
4:43
The Earth, itself, is so vastly huge.
4:45
Jupiter is-- it's 10 times bigger in diameter.
4:49
It's much larger in terms of mass, and volume,
4:52
and all the rest.
4:53
But just in terms of diameter, it is 10 times bigger.
4:56
But let's keep going.
4:57
10 times Jupiter gets us to the sun.
5:02
This is times 10.
5:04
So if this is the Sun-- and if I were to draw Jupiter,
5:07
it would look something like-- I'll
5:08
do Jupiter in pink-- Jupiter would be around that big.
5:13
And then the Earth would be around that big
5:17
if you were to put them all next to each other.
5:19
So the Sun, once again, is huge.
5:21
Even though we see it almost every day,
5:24
it is unimaginably huge.
5:26
Even the Earth is unimaginably huge.
5:28
And the Sun is 100 times more unimaginably bigger.
5:33
Now we're going to start getting really, really, really wacky.
5:36
You multiply the diameter of the Sun, which is already
5:40
100 times the diameter of the Earth-- you
5:43
multiply that times 100.
5:44
And that is the distance from the Earth to the Sun.
5:47
So I've drawn the Sun here as a little pixel.
5:52
And I didn't even draw the Earth as a pixel.
5:53
Because a pixel would be way too large.
5:55
It would have to be a hundredth of a pixel
5:57
in order to draw the Earth properly.
5:59
So this is a unbelievable distance
6:02
between the Earth and the Sun.
6:04
It's 100 times the distance of the diameter of the Sun itself.
6:10
So it's massive, massive.
6:11
But once again, these things are relatively close
6:15
compared to where we're about to go.
6:17
Because if we want to get to the nearest star-- so remember,
6:21
the Sun is 100 times the diameter of the Earth.
6:24
The distance between the Sun and the Earth is 100 times that.
6:29
Or you could say it's 10,000 times the diameter
6:32
of the Earth.
6:33
So these are unimaginable distances.
6:35
But to get to the nearest star, which is 4.2 light years away,
6:40
it's 200,000 times-- and once again, unimaginable.
6:45
It's 200,000 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
6:51
And to give you a rough sense of how far apart these things are,
6:59
if the Sun was roughly the size of a basketball--
7:02
if the average star was about the size of a basketball--
7:04
in our part of the galaxy in a volume the size of the Earth--
7:09
so if you had a big volume the size of the Earth,
7:13
if the stars were the sizes of basketballs,
7:16
in our part of the galaxy, you would only
7:18
have a handful of basketballs per that volume.
7:22
So unbelievably sparse.
7:26
Even though, when you look at the galaxy--
7:28
and this is just an artist's depiction of it--
7:30
it looks like something that has the spray of stars,
7:33
and it looks reasonably dense, there
7:35
is actually a huge amount of space
7:37
that the great, great, great, great, great majority
7:40
of the volume in the galaxy is just empty, empty space.
7:46
There's no stars, no planets, no nothing.
7:49
I mean, this is a huge jump that I'm talking about.
7:52
And then if you really want to realize
7:55
how large a galaxy, itself, can be,
7:57
you take this distance between the Sun,
8:00
or between our solar system and the nearest star--
8:02
so that's 200,000 times the distance between the Earth
8:07
and the Sun-- and you multiply that distance by 25,000.
8:10
So if the Sun is right here, our nearest star
8:16
will be in that same pixel.
8:18
They'll actually be within-- you'd actually
8:20
get a ton of stars within that one pixel,
8:22
even though they're so far apart.
8:24
And then this whole thing is 100,000 light years.
8:28
It's 25,000 times the distance than the distance
8:33
between the Sun and the nearest star.
8:35
So we're talking about unimaginable, unfathomable
8:39
distances, just for a galaxy.
8:42
And now we're going to get our-- frankly,
8:44
my brain is already well beyond anything
8:48
that it can really process.
8:49
At this point, it almost just becomes abstract thinking.
8:52
It just becomes playing with numbers and mathematics.
8:55
But to get a sense of the universe, itself,
8:58
the observable universe-- and we have to be clear.
9:00
Because we can only observe light
9:02
that started leaving from its source 13.7 billion years ago.
9:06
Because that's how old the universe is.
9:08
The observable universe is about 93 billion light years across.
9:13
And the reason why it's larger than 13.7 billion
9:16
is that the points in space that emitted
9:20
light 13.7 billion years ago, those
9:22
have been going away from us.
9:24
So now they're on the order of 40 billion light years away.
9:27
But this isn't about cosmology.
9:29
This is just about scale and appreciating
9:31
how huge the universe is.
9:33
Just in the part of the universe that we can theoretically
9:36
observe, you have to get-- and that we can observe,
9:43
just because we're getting electromagnetic radiation
9:47
from those parts of the universe--
9:50
you would have to multiply this number.
9:52
So let me make this clear.
9:53
100,000 light years-- that's the diameter of the Milky Way.
10:01
You would have to multiply not by 1,000.
10:04
1,000 would get you to 100 million light years.
10:10
This is 100,000 times 1,000 is 100 million.
10:13
You have to multiply by 1,000 again
10:18
to get to 100 billion light years.
10:21
And the universe, for all we know,
10:22
might be much, much, much, much, larger.
10:24
It might even be infinite.
10:26
Who knows?
10:27
But to get from just the diameter of the Milky Way
10:32
to the observable universe, you have to multiply by a million.
10:35
And already, this is an unfathomable distance.
10:38
So in the whole scheme of things,
10:42
not only are we pretty small, and not only are the things
10:46
we build pretty small, and not only is our planet ultra small,
10:51
and not only is our Sun ultra small,
10:54
and our solar system ultra small,
10:56
but our galaxy is really nothing compared
10:59
to the vastness of the universe.",How many galaxies are suspected to be in the universe?

- Hi, my name is Lou Hamou-Lhadj.
0:01
I'm a Character TD here at Pixar.
0:03
- Hi, I'm Jacob Speirs, I'm also a Character TD at Pixar.
0:07
- [Lou] We started here at Pixar on WALL-E as interns
0:10
and our task was to make a huge cast of background robots.
0:12
- Today's lesson is going to be about how to create
0:15
a huge crowd of robots using only a few simple parts.
0:18
(mechanical clicks)
0:21
- I wanna take WALL-E from a world
0:22
where there's no robots anymore
0:23
and it's just him to a world where there's tons of them.
0:26
I just like that contrast and suddenly making him feel
0:28
like he was alone in a crowd.
0:31
- We're trying to create a world where robots do every task
0:34
that you would want done.
0:36
What we did first was to look at cruise ships.
0:39
We got a list of every single job on a cruise ship
0:41
and then went through and tried to think of
0:43
the robotic equivalent of that job
0:46
and it became apparent quickly that that was more robots
0:49
than we would ever be able to build in one lifetime.
0:51
- So as interns, Jacob and I had the task of making this
0:54
huge cast of robots, but we didn't want to design each
0:57
individual one specifically.
0:58
- Right, so luckily there was an animator, Angus,
1:01
and he had a great idea about how to approach the process.
1:05
- I'm a huge Lego fan and I really wanted
1:07
the background characters to be the best they could be
1:09
and I figured if we designed a modular system
1:12
that would allow for us to add and subtract different parts
1:15
onto the character for the background characters
1:17
then we could kinda make whatever we needed
1:20
and it would all feel like the same world.
1:22
- [Lou] Doing it this way, modularly,
1:23
meant we could build 10 heads, 10 arms, and 10 bodies
1:26
and though we'd only built 30 pieces
1:27
we could make a thousand different combinations.
1:30
- Yeah, and there's actually a branch of mathematics
1:32
about that sort of thing, counting and combinations
1:35
and it's called combinatorics.
1:37
(mechanical noises)
1:39
- Combinatorics is actually what your lesson today
1:40
is gonna be about.
1:41
We're gonna start with a few small pieces

and build a huge cast of robots just like we did.",So do combinatorics require being excellent in maths generally?

Use the associative law of multiplication to write-- and
0:04
here they have 12 times 3 in parentheses, and then they
0:07
want us to multiply that times 10-- in a different way.
0:11
Simplify both expressions to show they
0:13
have identical results.
0:16
So the way that they wrote it is-- let me just rewrite it.
0:19
So they have 12 times 3 in parentheses, and then they
0:24
multiply that times 10.
0:26
Now whenever something is in parentheses, that means do
0:28
that first. So this literally says let's do the 12 times 3
0:33
first. Now, what is 12 times 3?
0:35
It's 36.
0:37
So this evaluates to 36, and then we still have that times
0:40
10 over there.
0:44
And we know the trick.
0:44
Whenever we multiply something times a power of ten, we just
0:48
add the number of zeroes that we have at the back of it, so
0:51
this is going to be 360.
0:54
This is going to be equal to 360.
0:59
Now, the associative law of multiplication, once again, it
1:03
sounds like a very fancy thing.
1:04
All that means is it doesn't matter how we associate the
1:08
multiplication or it doesn't matter how we put the
1:11
parentheses, we're going to get the same answer, so let me
1:14
write it down again.
1:15
If we were to do 12 times 3 times 10, if we just wrote it
1:22
like this without parentheses, if we just went left to right,
1:24
that would essentially be exactly what we just did here
1:27
on the left.
1:27
But the associative law of multiplication
1:29
says, you know what?
1:30
We can multiply the 3 times 10 first and then multiply the
1:34
12, and we're going to get the exact same answer as if we
1:38
multiplied the 12 times the 3 and then the 10.
1:40
So let's just verify it for ourselves.
1:43
So 3 times 10 is 30, and we still want to multiply the 12
1:50
times that.
1:51
Now, what's 12 times 30?
1:53
And we've seen this several times before.
1:55
You can view it as a 12 times 3, which is 36, but we still
1:59
have this 0 here.
2:00
So that is also equal to 360.
2:03
So it didn't matter how we associated the multiplication.
2:06
You can do the 12 times 3 first or you can do the 3
2:09
times 10 first. Either way, they both evaluated to 360.",Aren't The commutative and associative laws kind of the same ?

In the last video we looked at a function
0:02
and tried to draw its derivative.
0:04
Now in this video, we're going to look at a function
0:06
and try to draw its antiderivative.
0:10
Which sounds like a very fancy word,
0:12
but it's just saying the antiderivative of a function
0:16
is a function whose derivative is that function.
0:19
So for example, if we have f of x,
0:22
and let's say that the antiderivative of f of x
0:33
is capital F of x.
0:35
And this tends to be the notation, when you're
0:37
talking about an antiderivative.
0:39
This just means that the derivative
0:45
of capital F of x, which is equal to, you could say capital
0:49
f prime of x, is equal to f of x.
0:54
So we're going to try to do here is, we have our f of x.
0:57
And we're going to try to think about what's
0:59
a possible function that this could be the derivative of?
1:01
And you're going to study this in much more depth
1:04
when you start looking at integral calculus.
1:06
But there's actually many possible functions
1:09
that this could be the derivative of.
1:11
And our goal in this video is just
1:12
to draw a reasonable possibility.
1:14
So let's think about it a little bit.
1:16
So let's, over here on the top, draw
1:18
y is equal to capital F of x.
1:22
So what we're going to try to draw
1:23
is a function where its derivative
1:26
could look like this.
1:28
So what we're essentially doing is,
1:31
when we go from what we're draw up here to this,
1:33
we're taking the derivative.
1:34
So let's think about what this function could look like.
1:37
So when we look at this derivative,
1:39
it says over this interval over this first interval right
1:42
over here, let me do this in purple,
1:44
it says over this interval from x
1:46
is equal to 0 all the way to whatever value of x,
1:50
this right over here, it says that the slope is
1:53
a constant positive 1.
1:56
So let me draw a line with a slope of a constant positive 1.
2:00
And I could shift that line up and down.
2:02
Once again, there's many possible antiderivatives.
2:05
I will just pick a reasonable one.
2:08
So I could have a line that looks something like this.
2:16
I want to draw a slope of positive 1 as best as I can.
2:21
So let's say it looks something like this.
2:24
And I could make the function defined here or undefined here.
2:27
The derivative is undefined at this point.
2:30
I could make the function defined or undefined
2:32
as I see fit.
2:34
This will probably be a point of discontinuity
2:36
on the original function.
2:37
It doesn't have to be, but I'm just
2:39
trying to draw a possible function.
2:41
So let's actually just say it actually
2:42
is defined at that point right over there.
2:44
But since this is going to be discontinuous,
2:46
the derivative is going to be undefined at that point.
2:49
So that's that first interval.
2:51
Now let's look at the second interval.
2:52
The second interval, from where that first interval ended,
2:55
all the way to right over here.
2:59
The derivative is a constant negative 2.
3:03
So that means over here, I'm going
3:04
to have a line of constant negative slope,
3:08
or constant negative 2 slope.
3:10
So it's going to be twice as steep as this one right
3:13
over here.
3:14
So I actually could just draw it.
3:16
I could make it a continuous function,
3:17
I could just make a negative 2 slope, just like this.
3:21
And it looks like this interval is about half as long
3:23
as this interval.
3:24
So it maybe gets to the exact same point.
3:25
So it could look something-- let me
3:29
draw it a little bit neater-- like this.
3:39
The slope right over here is equal to 1,
3:45
we see that right over there in the derivative.
3:47
And then the slope right over here is equal to negative 2.
3:53
We see that in the derivative.
3:56
Now things get interesting.
3:57
Once again, I could have shifted this blue line up and down.
4:00
I did not have to construct a continuous function like this.
4:02
But I'm doing it just for fun.
4:04
There's many possible antiderivatives
4:06
of this function.
4:08
Now what's going on over the next interval?
4:14
And I'll do it do it in orange.
4:16
The slope starts off at a very high value.
4:20
It starts off at positive 2.
4:22
Then it keeps decreasing, and it gets to 0, right over here.
4:26
The slope gets to 0 right over there.
4:29
And then it starts becoming more and more and more
4:32
and more negative.
4:33
So I'll just try to make this a continuous function, just
4:36
for fun.
4:36
Once again, it does not have to be.
4:38
So over here the slope is very positive.
4:40
It's a positive 2.
4:41
So our slope is going to be like, this is negative 2,
4:44
so it's going to be a positive 2.
4:46
And then it gets more and more and more negative up to this,
4:49
or, it becomes less and less and less positive I should say.
4:52
Even here the slope is positive.
4:54
And it gets to 0 right over there.
4:56
So maybe it gets to 0 maybe right over here.
5:02
And so what we have, we could have some type of a parabola.
5:05
So the downward facing parabola.
5:08
So notice, the slope is a very positive value.
5:11
It's a positive 2 right over here,
5:13
then it becomes less and less and less and less positive,
5:17
all the way to 0 right over there.
5:19
And then the slope starts turning negative.
5:25
And so our function could look something
5:28
like that over the interval.
5:29
Let me draw it a little bit neater.
5:33
This is symmetric.
5:35
How ever positive our slope was here,
5:36
it's equally negative here.
5:38
So our curve should probably be symmetric as well.
5:41
So let me draw it like this over that interval.
5:45
It could look like that.
5:47
And then finally, over this last interval,
5:51
or I guess we could say, it keeps going, our slope is 0.
5:56
And once again I don't have to draw a continuous function.
5:59
But when the slope is 0, that just
6:01
means that I have a line with slope 0.
6:04
I have a horizontal line.
6:05
And I could draw that horizontal line up here, in which case
6:09
I'd have to say its discontinuous.
6:11
Or I could draw that horizontal line right over here,
6:17
and try to make my antiderivative
6:19
a continuous function.
6:20
So once again, I could have shifted any of these segments
6:23
up or down, and gotten the exact same derivative.
6:25
But then I would not have gotten a continuous function
6:28
like this.
6:29
But we have been able to construct
6:31
a possible antiderivative for f of x.
6:34
And just as a reminder, that's just saying this f of x is--
6:37
the antiderivative is a function that f of x
6:41
could be the derivative of.","At around 5:20, Sal mentions how anti derivative is starting at 2, but I see that it is below the x- axis, so isn't he starting at -2?"

Let's do a few more examples with the ideal gas equation.
0:04
So we have pressure times volume is equal to the number
0:08
of molecules we have in moles times the ideal gas constant
0:13
times temperature in Kelvin.
0:15
And I just got a comment on one of the videos saying
0:17
it made sense except for the fact that
0:20
R seems kind of like this mysterious thing in here.
0:24
And the way you think about R
0:25
-- let me rearrange this a little bit.
0:27
Let me write it as pressure times volume
0:28
is equal to R times nT.
0:33
So we've established, or hopefully we've established,
0:35
the intuition that the pressure times the volume
0:37
should be proportional to essentially
0:40
the total energy we have in the system.
0:42
Temperature is average energy, or energy per molecule,
0:47
and this is the total number molecules we had.
0:49
What R is, the ideal gas constant is,
0:52
when you multiply moles times Kelvin, you get mole Kelvin.
0:58
And with pressure times volume,
1:00
it's force per area times the volume.
1:03
You get force times distance,
1:04
or force times one dimension of distance,
1:07
which is joules, so this is in joules.
1:11
So what the ideal gas constant essentially does is it converts
1:14
-- we know that this is proportional to this,
1:17
but it sets the exact constant of proportionality
1:21
and it also makes sure we get the units right,
1:23
so that's all it is.
1:24
It just helps us translate from a world dealing
1:27
with moles and Kelvins to a world of dealing with,
1:30
well, in this case, atmospheres and liters,
1:33
or bars and meters cubed,
1:37
or kilopascals and meters cubed.
1:39
But no matter what the units
1:40
of the pressure and the volume are,
1:41
the whole unit of pressure
1:43
times volume is going to be joules.
1:44
So it's just a translation between the two
1:46
and we know that they're proportional.
1:48
Now, with that said, let's do some more problems.
1:50
So let's say we want to know how many grams of oxygen.
1:56
So we want to know grams of O2. O2 in grams.
2:02
So how many grams of O2 are in a 300-milliliter container
2:09
that has a pressure of 12 atmospheres
2:14
and the temperature is 10 degrees Celsius.
2:20
Well, we've already broken out our ideal gas equation.
2:25
Let's see, pressure is 12 atmospheres.
2:28
So we can say 12.
2:30
I'll keep the units there.
2:32
12 atmospheres times the volume.
2:35
The volume should be in liters, so this is 300 milliliters,
2:39
or 300 thousandths or 3 tenths.
2:43
So that's 0.3 liters.
2:48
300 one thousandths of a liter is 0.3 liters.
2:52
And that is equal to the number of moles we have of this,
2:57
and that's what we need to figure out.
2:58
If we know the number of moles, we know the number of grams.
3:00
So this is equal to n times R.
3:04
Now which R should we use?
3:06
We're dealing with liters and atmospheres.
3:08
We'll deal with this one.
3:13
Times 0.082.
3:16
And what's our temperature?
3:17
It's 10 degrees Celsius.
3:19
We always have to do everything in Kelvin.
3:20
So it's 283 degrees Kelvin.
3:25
So all we have to solve for is n.
3:28
We just have to divide both sides
3:29
of this equation by this right here,
3:31
and so we have n is equal to 12 atmospheres
3:37
-- I'm just swapping the sides
3:38
-- times 0.3 liters divided by 0.082 times 283 degrees.
3:47
Our answer will be in moles.
3:50
And if you want to verify that,
3:52
you can plug in all the units
3:54
and use units for the ideal gas constant.
3:57
The number of moles we're dealing with,
4:01
so it's 12 times 0.3 divided by 0.082 divided by 283
4:11
is equal to 0.155 moles. It's equal to 0.155 moles.
4:22
Now how many grams are in one mole of an oxygen molecule?
4:31
So one mole of O2, well, we know oxygen's atomic mass.
4:39
It's 16.
4:40
One molecule of oxygen, of gaseous oxygen,
4:44
has two atoms in it, so it has an atomic mass of 32.
4:51
So it's molar mass, it's mass per mole,
4:56
is going to be 32 grams.
4:58
Now we don't have one mole.
4:59
We have 0.155 moles.
5:02
So to figure out how many grams we have,
5:04
we multiply 32 grams per mole times 0.155 moles,
5:21
and we'll get our answer.
5:23
So let's do that.
5:24
So we have 32 times 0.155 is equal to 4.96 grams,
5:35
or roughly 5 grams.
5:37
So we have approximately 5 grams of molecular oxygen.","4:09, why is ideal gas law in kelvin?"

So first of all, it's a good idea
0:25
to just understand where the word Yugoslavia comes from.
0:30
It's literally referring to the southern Slavic states.
0:34
So Yugo- is referring to southern.
0:36
And -slavia, we're talking about the Slavic states.
0:38
And when people talk about Slavic languages,
0:40
they're talking about the languages that
0:42
are spoken in this region, but also much of Eastern Europe,
0:45
and in what is now Russia.
0:49
Now, what we have here in blue is,
0:52
we have shaded in where Serbo-Croatian
0:56
is spoken, which is the dominant Slavic language in this region.
1:05
And there are multiple dialects.
1:07
Some people will say, oh, it's Croatian or Montenegrin
1:10
or Serbian or whatever it might be.
1:12
But mostly, linguists say, well, they're
1:13
pretty close to each other.
1:15
And you can categorize them as one language as Serbo-Croatian.
1:20
And you see that it's now spoken in modern day Croatia, Bosnia
1:24
and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro.
1:28
And that is the commonality here,
1:31
the thing that ties together this region.
1:33
Now on top of that, the Slovenian language
1:36
is also Slavic language that is closely related
1:39
to Serbo-Croatian.
1:40
In Macedonia, they also speak a Slavic language.
1:43
It's closer to Bulgarian.
1:44
But it has some close ties.
1:46
It's not completely different than Serbo-Croatian.
1:48
So you have this linguistic connection
1:51
throughout this area.
1:53
Now, what divides this area is really religion and history.
1:57
So this area, if you look, go back hundreds of years,
2:01
it was under the control of various empires,
2:03
the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire.
2:06
Different-- the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
2:08
you're dealing with the Roman Catholic Empire.
2:10
When you're talking about the Ottomans,
2:11
you're dealing with the Muslim Empire.
2:13
And they held in different parts of this territory
2:16
for hundreds of years.
2:18
And so what you end up, is really a mix of religions.
2:22
And that often gets tied to people's-- what they perceive
2:26
as also their ethnicities.
2:28
And so what I have here is a break down,
2:31
the religious breakdown of the state,
2:34
the former state of Yugoslavia.
2:36
So in this pinkish color right over here,
2:38
I have the areas that are predominately Roman Catholic.
2:41
And I say, predominantly, because it really is all mixed
2:44
together.
2:44
So Slovenia, Croatia, primarily Roman Catholic.
2:48
If you look at Serbia and Montenegro,
2:51
primarily Eastern Orthodox.
2:54
Kosovo, you have a strong Muslim majority right over there.
3:00
And it really gets-- and Kosovo, before its break up,
3:04
was kind of part of Serbia and Montenegro.
3:07
Despite it having this very different religious makeup.
3:10
And then, Bosnia and Herzegovina is
3:12
where things get really, really mixed up.
3:14
Roughly half of the population, and it's
3:16
been moving over the centuries.
3:19
But the dominant religion there is Islam.
3:23
And in general, and this is where it can be confusing,
3:25
when people talk about a Bosniak,
3:28
when they're talking about a Bosniak,
3:30
they're talking about a Bosnian Muslim.
3:36
But Bosnia and Herzegovina also has significant fractions
3:40
of Serbs who are Eastern Orthodox.
3:44
So that's why I put the brown here as well.
3:45
It's about a third of the population.
3:47
And it also has a pretty sizable Roman Catholic population.
3:50
Or we could say Bosnian Croats.
3:53
So just to be clear here, it can be very confusing.
3:55
Even when you when you hear history of it
3:56
or when you've heard it on the news.
3:58
I remember the '90s hearing this on the news
4:00
and getting very confused.
4:02
If someone's referring to a Bosnian Muslim or Bosniak,
4:04
that's a Muslim living in Bosnia.
4:06
That's they tend to be referring to.
4:09
If they say a Bosnian Croats, this
4:16
would be an ethnically Croat who is living in Bosnia.
4:20
And they are-- it would tend to be Roman Catholic.
4:24
And then if you have a Bosnian Serb,
4:29
this is someone who ethnically identifies themselves
4:32
as a Serbian or as a Serb who lives
4:35
in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
4:38
But is probably going to be Eastern Orthodox.
4:42
So you can imagine, you have the strong linguistic and even
4:46
ethnic ties.
4:48
But at some point, because of the religion and dialect
4:52
changes, there's also significant amount
4:54
of differences here.
4:55
Especially when things got ugly, as you
4:57
have the fall of Communism.
4:58
So hopefully, this lays the groundwork
5:00
of the commonalities and the differences here.
5:03
And it'll help us understand what got us into World War I,
5:06
or at least what triggered World War I. And also some
5:08
of the ugliness that was seen in the early '90s.
5:12
And just to finish up with a little bit of context,
5:15
this was not a unified state until-- World War
5:19
I, to some degree, was precipitated by a desire
5:21
to make this a unified state.
5:24
This ethnic grouping, this linguistic grouping
5:28
tended to be broken up with the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
5:31
the Ottoman Empire.
5:32
Entering into a World War I, you started
5:34
to have the decline of the Ottoman Empire
5:35
which started to allow these people to start
5:39
to have more energy behind their desire to form a unified state.
5:43
World War I was essentially the catalyst
5:45
that allowed the state of Yugoslavia to unify.
5:49
And in different forms, it stayed
5:51
unified until the fall of Communism.
5:54
And even though it was a socialist state,
5:56
a communist state during the Cold War,
5:59
it actually always had a strange and distant relationship
6:03
with the Soviet Union.
6:04
But after the fall of Communism, that
6:06
was kind of holding it together, these, especially
6:09
these religious differences, frankly,
6:11
and these ethnic and religious differences broke it apart.",what caused the ottoman empire to decline?

- [Instructor] Before we get into electron affinity,
0:04
let's really quickly review ionization energy.
0:07
And let's start with a neutral lithium atom,
0:10
with an electron configuration of one s two, two s one.
0:13
A lithium atom has three protons in the nucleus,
0:16
so a positive three charge.
0:18
Two electrons in the one s orbital,
0:21
so here are the two electrons in the one s orbital,
0:24
or our core electrons,
0:26
and one electron in a two s orbital.
0:28
This is our outermost electron, our valence electron.
0:32
The valence electron is shielded
0:35
from the full positive three charge of the nucleus
0:37
by the presence of the core electrons.
0:40
So like charges repel,
0:41
and these core electrons repel this outer electron,
0:45
and shield it from the full positive three charge.
0:48
But there still is an attractive force
0:50
between the positively charged nucleus
0:52
and this outermost electron.
0:54
So opposite charges attract, and our outermost electron
0:58
still feels a pull from the nucleus.
1:01
Therefore, since the outer electron is attracted
1:04
to the nucleus, it takes energy
1:06
to completely pull away this valence electron
1:08
from the neutral atom.
1:10
So if we pull away the outermost electron,
1:13
we lose our valence electron,
1:15
and we're left with a lithium ion, with a positive charge.
1:19
Positive one charge, because we still have three protons,
1:22
but only two electrons now,
1:24
so overall a plus one charge.
1:26
Since this ionization takes energy to rip away the electron,
1:30
the energy, the ionization energy, is positive,
1:34
and is measured in kiloJoules per mol.
1:36
Let's compare that with electron affinity.
1:39
So, in electron affinity, let's say we're starting
1:42
with our neutral lithium atom again,
1:44
but this time, instead of taking an electron away,
1:47
we are adding an electron.
1:50
So, we would add an electron to the two s orbital.
1:54
So we started off with three electrons
1:55
in the neutral lithium atom, and we're adding one more.
1:59
So the electron configuration for the lithium ion
2:02
would be one s two, two s two.
2:06
So still three positive charges in the nucleus,
2:09
two electrons in the one s orbital,
2:12
but now we've added an electron,
2:13
so we have four electrons total,
2:16
two in the two s orbital.
2:19
So let me highlight the electron that we added in magenta.
2:22
So this is the electron that we added
2:24
to a neutral lithium atom.
2:27
And this electron, we know, is shielded
2:30
from the full positive three charge of the nucleus
2:32
by our two core electrons in here, right?
2:35
So like charges repel.
2:37
It's also going to be repelled a little bit
2:39
by this electron, that's also in the two s orbital.
2:43
So this electron's going to repel this one as well.
2:47
But, there is an attractive force
2:49
between our positively charged nucleus
2:51
and our negative charge on the electron.
2:55
So this electron that we added
2:57
still feels an attractive force that's pulling on it
3:00
from the nucleus.
3:03
And so, if you add this fourth electron,
3:06
energy is given off.
3:08
And since energy is given off, this is going to have
3:11
a negative value for the electron affinity.
3:14
For adding an electron to a neutral lithium atom,
3:17
it turns out to be -60 kiloJoules per mol.
3:22
So energy is released when an electron is added,
3:26
and that is because the electron that we added
3:29
is still able to be attracted to the charged nucleus.
3:33
So if the nucleus has an attraction for the added electron,
3:36
you're going to get a negative value
3:38
for the electron affinity.
3:40
Or that's one way to measure electron affinity.
3:43
Note that the lithium anion is larger
3:46
than the neutral lithium atom.
3:48
It's just hard to represent it here with those diagrams.
3:51
So as long as the added electron
3:53
feels an attractive force from the nucleus,
3:55
energy is given off.
3:58
Let's look at one more comparison
4:00
between ionization energy and electron affinity.
4:03
In ionization energy, since the outer electron here
4:06
is attracted to the nucleus, we have to work hard
4:10
to pull that electron away.
4:12
It takes energy for us to rip away that electron.
4:15
And since it takes us energy, we have to do work,
4:18
and the energy is positive, in terms of ionization energy.
4:22
But for electron affinity, since the electron
4:25
that we're adding is attracted
4:26
to the positive charge of the nucleus,
4:28
we don't have to force this,
4:30
we don't have to do any work.
4:31
Energy is given off in this process, and that's why
4:34
it's a negative value for the electron affinity.
4:38
Electron affinities don't have to be negative.
4:41
For some atoms, there's actually no attraction
4:43
for an extra electron.
4:45
Let's take neon, for example.
4:47
Neon has an electron configuration
4:49
of one s two, two s two, and two p six.
4:54
So there's a total of two plus two plus six,
4:57
or 10 electrons, and a positive 10 charge in the nucleus
5:00
for a neutral neon atom.
5:03
So let's say this is our nucleus here,
5:05
with a positive 10 charge, 10 protons.
5:07
And then we have our 10 electrons here,
5:10
surrounding our nucleus.
5:13
So this is our neutral neon atom.
5:16
If we try to add an electron,
5:18
so here let's add an electron.
5:20
So we still have our 10 protons in the nucleus.
5:23
We still have our 10 electrons,
5:25
which would now be our core electrons.
5:27
To add a new electron, this would be the neon anion here,
5:32
so one s two, two s two, two p six.
5:36
We've filled the second energy level.
5:38
To add an electron, we must go to a new energy level.
5:42
So it would be the third energy level,
5:44
it would be an s orbital,
5:46
and there would be one electron in that orbital.
5:48
So, here is, let's say this is the electron
5:51
that we just added.
5:52
So we have to try to add an electron to our neon atom.
5:57
But if you think about the effective nuclear charge
6:01
that this electron in magenta feels,
6:04
alright, so the effective nuclear charge,
6:06
that's equal to the atomic number, or the number of protons,
6:09
and from that, you subtract
6:11
the number of shielding electrons.
6:13
Since we have 10 protons in the nucleus, this would be 10.
6:17
And our shielding electrons would be 10, as well.
6:20
So those 10 electrons shield this added electron
6:23
from the full positive 10 charge of the nucleus.
6:28
And for a quick calculation, this tells us
6:30
that the effective nuclear charge is zero.
6:34
And this is, you know, simplifying things
6:36
a little bit, but you can think
6:37
about this outer electron that we tried to add,
6:40
of not having any attraction for the nucleus.
6:43
These 10 electrons shield it completely
6:45
from the positive 10 charge.
6:47
And since there's no attraction for this electron,
6:50
energy is not given off in this process.
6:53
Actually, it would take energy
6:55
to force an electron onto neon.
6:58
So if you wrote something out here,
7:00
and if we said, alright, I'm trying to go from,
7:02
I'm trying to add an electron to neon,
7:04
to turn it into an anion.
7:06
Instead of giving off energy,
7:08
this process would take energy.
7:10
So we would have to force,
7:12
we would have to try to force this to occur.
7:15
So it takes energy to force an electron
7:17
on a neutral atom of neon.
7:19
And we say that neon has no affinity for an electron.
7:24
So it's unreactive, it's a noble gas, and this is one way
7:28
to explain why noble gases are unreactive.
7:31
This anion that we intended
7:33
isn't going to stay around for long.
7:35
So it takes energy to force this onto our neutral neon atom.
7:39
So you could say that the electron affinity
7:41
is positive here, it takes energy.
7:44
But usually, you don't see positive values
7:46
for electron affinity, for this sort of situation.
7:49
At least, most textbooks I've looked at would just say
7:51
the electron affinity of neon is zero,
7:54
since I believe it is hard to measure
7:57
the actual value of this.
7:59
Here we have the elements in the second period
8:01
on the periodic table, and let's look
8:02
at their electron affinities.
8:04
We've already seen that adding an electron
8:06
to a neutral atom of lithium
8:08
gives off 60 kiloJoules per mol.
8:12
Next, we have beryllium, with a zero value
8:14
for the electron affinity.
8:16
That means it actually takes energy.
8:18
So this number is actually positive,
8:20
and it takes energy to add an electron
8:23
to a neutral atom of beryllium.
8:25
So if you think about going from a neutral atom of beryllium
8:28
to form the beryllium anion,
8:30
when we look at electron configurations,
8:33
neutral atom of beryllium is one s two, two s two,
8:36
and so, to form the negatively charged beryllium anion,
8:39
it would be one s two, two s two,
8:42
and to add the extra electron, it must go
8:45
into a two p orbital, which is of higher energy.
8:50
And so, this is actually the same thing, or very similar,
8:53
to neon, which we just discussed.
8:56
For neon, the electron configuration was one s two,
8:59
two s two, two p six, and to add an extra electron,
9:04
we had to go to the third energy level.
9:06
We had to open up a new shell.
9:08
And the electron that we added was effectively screened
9:11
from the full nuclear charge by these other electrons.
9:15
And a similar thing happens here for the beryllium anion.
9:18
To add this extra electron, we have to open up
9:21
a higher energy p orbital.
9:23
This electron is, on average, further away from the nucleus,
9:26
and is effectively shielded from the full positive
9:29
charge of the nucleus, and therefore, there's no affinity
9:33
for this added electron.
9:35
So there's no affinity for this electron,
9:37
so it takes energy to form the beryllium anion.
9:41
And that's why we see this zero value here for beryllium.
9:44
Beryllium has no value for electron affinity,
9:47
or, it's actually a very positive value,
9:49
and we just say it has a zero value.
9:51
Next, let's look at boron here.
9:53
So this gives off -27 kiloJoules per mol.
9:56
And we can see a little bit of a trend here,
9:59
as we go from boron to carbon to oxygen to fluorine.
10:04
So as we go across the period on the periodic table,
10:10
more energy is given off, and therefore,
10:13
fluorine has the most affinity for an electron.
10:17
So as we go across a period, we get an increase
10:20
in the electron affinity.
10:22
So the negative sign just means that energy is given off,
10:25
so we're really just looking at the magnitude.
10:27
More energy is given off when you add
10:29
an electron to a neutral atom of fluorine,
10:32
than if you add an electron to a neutral atom of oxygen.
10:37
And we can explain this general trend
10:39
in terms of effective nuclear charge.
10:41
As we go across our period, we also have an increase
10:45
in the effective nuclear charge.
10:48
And if the added electron is feeling more of a pull
10:51
from the nucleus, which is what we mean here
10:54
by increased effective nuclear charge,
10:57
more energy will be given off when we add that electron.
11:01
So this idea explains the general trend
11:04
we see for electron affinity, as you go across a period,
11:08
we get an increase in the electron affinity.
11:11
We've already talked about beryllium as an exception,
11:14
neon as an exception, but what about nitrogen in here?
11:18
We can see that nitrogen doesn't really have
11:21
an affinity for an electron, and you'll see
11:24
many different values for this one,
11:25
depending on which textbook you're looking in.
11:28
But if we look at some electron configurations
11:30
really quickly, we can try to explain this.
11:33
So, for nitrogen, the electron configuration
11:37
is one s two, two s two, and then two p three.
11:42
So if we draw out our orbitals,
11:44
let's just say this is the two s orbital,
11:46
and then these are the three two p orbitals.
11:49
So we'll just do these electrons here.
11:51
Two electrons in the two s orbital,
11:53
and then we have three electrons in the p orbital.
11:56
So let's draw those in there.
11:58
If we try to add an electron to a neutral nitrogen atom,
12:02
we're adding an electron to one of these orbitals,
12:05
which already has an electron in it.
12:08
So adding an electron to one of these orbitals, right,
12:12
the added electron would be repelled
12:14
by the electron that was in there to start with.
12:16
And this is the reason that you usually see in textbooks
12:19
for the fact that this does not follow the trend.
12:22
Nitrogen doesn't have an affinity for one added electron.
12:27
So after going through all of that,
12:28
it's obvious that electron affinity
12:30
is a little more complicated than ionization energy.
12:34
In ionization energy, we had a pretty clear trend,
12:36
and it was a little easier to explain why.
12:39
For electron affinity, going across a period
12:42
on the periodic table, we see a little bit of a trend,
12:45
but there are many exceptions to this,
12:47
and perhaps our explanations are a little bit too simplistic
12:51
to explain actually what's going on.
12:54
But across a period, you do see a little bit of a trend.
12:57
Going down a group is much harder.
12:59
You see more inconsistencies, and it's not really even worth
13:02
going over a general trend for that.",Does each atom gives of fluorine gives 328 KJ?

And Mintaka.
1:25
So let's say this is Mintaka right over here.
1:28
Mintaka.
1:31
And we know a few things.
1:32
We know that this distance between her home
1:35
and Alnitak is 736 light years.
1:40
So this distance right over here.
1:42
So that right over there.
1:44
Everything we'll do is in light years.
1:45
That's 736.
1:47
And the distance between
1:48
her house and Mintaka is 915 light years.
1:54
So it would take light 915 years
1:57
to get from her house to Mintaka,
1:58
or from Mintaka to her house.
2:01
So this is 915 light years.
2:04
And what we wanna do is figure out
2:05
the width of Orion's belt,
2:07
which is the distance between Alnitak and Mintaka.
2:11
So we need to figure out this distance
2:15
right over here.
2:17
And the one thing that they did give us
2:21
is this angle.
2:23
They did give us that angle right over there.
2:26
They said that the angle between
2:28
these stars in the sky is three degrees.
2:30
So this is three degrees right over there.
2:33
So how can we figure out the distance
2:36
between Alnitak and Mintaka?
2:38
Let's just say that this is equal to X.
2:40
This is equal to X.
2:42
How do we do that?
2:43
Well if we have two sides
2:45
and an angle between them,
2:47
we could use the law of cosines
2:50
to figure out the third side.
2:55
So the law of cosines,
2:56
so let's just apply it.
2:58
So the law of cosines tells us
3:02
that X squared is going to be equal
3:05
to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
3:09
So it's going to be equal to 736 squared,
3:14
plus 915 squared, minus two times 736,
3:28
times 915, times the cosine of this angle.
3:37
Times the cosine of three degrees.
3:41
So once again,
3:43
we're trying to find the length of
3:44
the side opposite the three degrees.
3:46
We know the other two sides,
3:48
so the law of cosines, it essentially...
3:51
Sorry, I just had to cough off camera
3:54
because I had some peanuts and my throat was dry.
3:56
Where was I?
3:56
Oh, I was saying,
3:58
if we know the angle and we know the two sides
4:00
on either side of the angle,
4:01
we can figure out the length of the side opposite
4:03
by the law of cosines.
4:04
Where it essentially starts off not too
4:06
different than the Pythagorean theorem,
4:08
but then we give an adjustment
4:09
because this is not an actual right triangle.
4:12
And the adjustment...
4:13
So we have the 736 squared, plus 915 squared,
4:16
minus two times the product of these sides,
4:19
times the cosine of this angle.
4:21
Or another way we could say, think about it is,
4:23
X, let me write that,
4:28
X is to equal to the square root of all
4:31
of this stuff.
4:33
So, I can just copy and paste that.
4:37
Copy and paste.
4:40
X is going to be equal to the square root of that.
4:44
And so let's get our calculator to calculate it.
4:48
And let me verify that I'm in degree mode.
4:51
Yes, I am indeed in degree mode.
4:53
And so let's exit that.
4:55
And so I wanna calculate the square root of
4:58
736 squared, plus 915 squared,
5:06
minus two times 736, times 915,
5:15
times cosine of three degrees.
5:19
And we deserve a drum roll now.
5:22
X is 100, if we round...
5:24
Let's see, what did they want us to do?
5:25
Round your answer to the nearest light years.
5:27
So to the nearest light year
5:28
is going to be 184 light years.
5:31
So X is approximately equal to 184 light years.
5:40
So it would take light 184 years
5:43
to get from Mintaka to Alnitak.
5:47
And so hopefully this actually shows you
5:49

5:54

Identify the x and y-intercepts of the line
0:03
y is equal to 3x minus 9.
0:06
Then graph the line.
0:09
So the x-intercept, I'll just abbreviate it
0:11
as x-int, that is where the line intersects the x-axis.
0:15
So where it intersects the x-axis.
0:17
Remember, this horizontal axis is the x-axis.
0:20
So when something intersects the x-axis,
0:22
what do we know about its coordinate?
0:24
Its x-value could be anything, but we know it's y-value is 0.
0:28
If we're intersecting, if we're sitting
0:29
on the x-axis someplace, that means
0:32
that we haven't moved in the y-direction.
0:34
That means that y is 0.
0:36
So this means, literally, that y is 0.
0:39
So we need to find the x-value defined
0:42
by this relationship when y is equal to 0.
0:45
Similarly, when we talk about the y-intercept,
0:47
I'll do it down here-- when we talk
0:49
about the y-intercept, what does that mean?
0:52
Well, y-intercept means-- so this
0:53
is the y-axis right over here running up and down.
0:56
The y-intercept is the point at which
0:58
the line intercepts the y-axis.
1:01
So what's going on?
1:02
If we're at the y-axis, our y-value
1:04
could be anything depending on where we intersect the y-axis.
1:07
But we know that we haven't moved to the right or the left.
1:10
We know that our x-value is 0 at the y-intercept.
1:14
So over here, our x-value is going to be 0.
1:17
And to find the actual point, we just
1:19
have to find the corresponding y-value defined
1:21
by this relationship or this equation.
1:24
So let's do the first one first.
1:25
The x-intercept is when y is equal to 0.
1:28
So we set y is equal to 0, and then we'll solve for x.
1:31
So we get 0 is equal to 3x minus 9.
1:34
We can add 9 to both sides of this equation
1:37
to isolate the x-term.
1:39
So we get 9 is equal to 3x.
1:42
These cancel out.
1:43
We could divide both sides by 3.
1:46
Divide both sides by 3.
1:48
We get 3 is equal to x or x is equal to 3.
1:52
So the point y is equal to 0, x is equal to 3 is on this line.
1:56
And let me put it in order.
1:58
x-coordinate always goes first.
1:59
So it's 3 comma 0.
2:02
So this is the origin.
2:03
1, 2, 3 is right over here.
2:06
That is 3 comma 0.
2:08
This right here is the x-intercept.
2:12
And remember, notice that point lies on the x-axis,
2:15
but the y-value is 0.
2:17
We haven't moved up or down.
2:18
When you think x-intercept, you say, OK,
2:20
that means my y-value is 0.
2:22
So I have to solve for the x-value.
2:24
Now we do the opposite for the y-intercept.
2:26
And the y-intercept, we're sitting on this line,
2:29
x-value must be 0.
2:30
So let's figure out what y is equal to when x is equal to 0.
2:34
So y is equal to-- I want to do it in that pink color.
2:37
y is equal to-- y is equal to 3 times-- x is 0 now.
2:42
3 times 0 minus 9.
2:44
Well, 3 times 0 is just 0.
2:46
So 0 minus 9.
2:47
Well that's, just equal to negative 9.
2:49
So we have the point 0 comma negative 9.
2:52
So when x is 0, we go down 9 for y.
2:57
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
3:04
So right there is the point 0 comma negative 9.
3:08
Notice, it sits on the y-axis.
3:10
That's why it's the y-intercept.
3:12
And the x-value is 0.
3:13
We haven't moved to the left or right.
3:15
All you need is two points for a line,
3:17
so we're now ready to graph.
3:18
We essentially just have to connect the dots.
3:20
So it's going to look something like this.
3:22
It's going to look something-- our line.
3:25
I don't have a good line tool, so I'm
3:27
going to try my best to draw it nicely--

is going to look something like that.
3:33
And you just keep going.
3:34
You just keep going.
3:36
You want to do a straight line.
3:37
So it just keeps going on and on and on like that.
3:41
It just keeps going.
3:45
And I could keep going all the way in that direction,
3:47
and then-- but then my line doesn't look as straight all
3:50
of a sudden.
3:50
I think you get the general idea.
3:52
I can keep going like that, and then keep going like that.
3:54
I don't have a nice ruler to do it with.

Ever since the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 to 1871,
0:04
the Germans recognized that they were
0:06
likely to face another war with France.
0:08
That was the war that allowed Germany to unify.
0:10
They humiliated France.
0:12
They were able to capture some very valuable territory
0:15
from France, in particular Alsace and Lorraine,
0:17
which is very mineral rich.
0:19
And so the Germans were plotting too, well,
0:21
what are we going to do if we get into another war with them?
0:23
At the same time, once France and Russia had this alliance,
0:26
Germany fully recognized if there is a war with France,
0:29
it's likely to not be just with France.
0:31
It's likely to be a two front war.
0:33
On the Western Front, they'll be in conflict with France.
0:37
And on the Eastern Front, they'll
0:38
be in conflict with Russia.
0:40
And so to deal with this eventuality--
0:42
this is all the scheming that Germany
0:43
did in the decades going up to World War
0:46
I-- they came up with the Schlieffen Plan.
0:49
And I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it.
0:57
Named for Alfred von Schlieffen, he
0:59
was chief of the German Empire's general staff
1:02
from 1891 to 1905.
1:05
And it was based on how do you deal with a two front war?
1:09
And the general ides here were that Russia
1:13
had a large and almost inexhaustible army.
1:15
But because it was so large it would take a long time for it
1:18
to mobilize.
1:23
And the Germans are actually able to approximate it
1:25
correctly because this is how long it
1:27
did take the Russians to mobilize
1:28
at the beginning of World War I. They estimated that it would
1:31
take them about six weeks.
1:34
So the Schlieffen Plan called for enough German troops
1:38
on the Eastern Front, initially, in order
1:40
to keep the Russians at bay.
1:43
But then the main fighting force of the Germans,
1:45
while the Russians are mobilizing,
1:48
is to go after France and try to essentially knock France out
1:51
of commission, so that they're not facing a two front
1:53
war anymore.
1:55
And then have those troops go back
1:56
to fight against the Russians.
1:58
And the way that they wanted to do it
2:00
is by rolling through Belgium in a wheel like pattern like this.
2:04
And the reason why they wanted to do this wheel like pattern
2:07
is that they correctly predicted that the French were
2:10
very eager to get this territory right over here.
2:13
And the French actually had a plan--
2:14
they called it Plan 17- for going
2:16
after Alsace and Lorraine.
2:17
It was an offensive plan.
2:19
And the view is if the French army is
2:20
going in that direction, if the German army
2:23
rolls through Belgium and is able to get them from the rear,
2:25
they could put the French army out of commission.
2:28
So in early August 1914, the Germans,
2:32
once they declared war on France and on Russia,
2:35
the Germans tried to put the Schlieffen Plan into action.
2:39
And they frankly, almost succeeded.
2:42
So through August and early September,
2:46
the Germans were able to essentially roll
2:49
through Belgium and keep the combined, mainly French forces,
2:56
but there was also some assistance from British,
2:59
to keep them on their heels.
3:01
And this happened all the way until early September
3:04
when they get near the Marne, or a little bit
3:06
past the Marne River in France.
3:10
And it was here that the Sixth French Army--
3:13
and when we talk about armies we're
3:16
talking about huge numbers of troops.
3:17
The Sixth French Army had over 200,000 troops in it.
3:21
When we're talking about the Battle of the Marne--
3:23
which I'm about to talk to you.
3:24
We're talking about the first Battle of the Marne.
3:27
We're talking about a battle that
3:29
involves two million troops.
3:32
So these are battles that are occurring on an epic scale.
3:35
Just each of these armies-- this army
3:37
or this one, or even the German armies-- we're
3:41
talking about tens to hundreds of thousands of troops.
3:44
In general, an army characterize you're
3:47
talking about over 50,000, 60,000 troops.
3:51
So what happens as you go to early September, especially
3:54
September 5, 1914, the Sixth French Army
3:59
recognizes a mistake that the First German Army made.
4:04
By trying to roll around like this,
4:07
they exposed their right flank.
4:09
So right over here would be the right flank of the German army.
4:13
And just as most mammals, our flanks
4:17
are our weak spot, that area between your ribs
4:21
and your hips, the same thing is true for armies.
4:24
The front of the army tends to be
4:26
where you have the strongest forces.
4:28
And then you have your supply routes going back.
4:31
So if you can outflank an army-- and that's
4:33
what a lot of military strategy is designed around--
4:36
you can hit an army in its weaker points.
4:38
So by September 5, the First German Army recognized this,
4:43
but it was too late.
4:44
By September 6, they were essentially
4:48
being confronted by the Sixth French Army.
4:51
And by essentially turning to meet them
4:57
they created an opening between them and the Second German
5:00
Army.
5:00
And that opening was able-- the French and the British
5:04
were able to take advantage of that to essentially put
5:06
the Germans on their heels after a month of advancing.
5:10
And so right over here, you have the various French armies.
5:16
And they were assisted by the British expeditionary force.
5:22
And so from the Battle of the Marne, which
5:25
was essentially, most historians would say, between September 6,
5:28
or September 5, September 6 and September 12,
5:31
they were able to put the Germans on the retreat.
5:35
The Germans retreated past the Aisne River.
5:37
And then once you get into November
5:39
and the end of the year of 1914, the Germans essentially
5:43
entrenched themselves.
5:44
They were literally building deep trenches
5:48
in northern France and a little bit of western Belgium.
5:51
And what I have right over here-- let
5:53
me see if I can draw it.
5:54
What I have right over here, what the boundaries are
5:57
eventually happened after the Germans
6:00
suffered, essentially, their first big defeat.
6:03
They had to retreat and they had to literally retrench.
6:06
And this is what the borders would then be like.
6:10
And these were literally trenches getting dug here.
6:14
This first stage of the war was hugely dynamic.
6:17
You had armies moving fairly rapidly
6:19
over a period of weeks and months.
6:22
But then once the Germans retrenched,
6:23
you have roughly this position being static for the next three
6:27
years and the famous trench warfare of the Western front
6:30
that you might have seen movies on.
6:33
And I want to emphasize this was a big deal.
6:35
The first Battle of the Marne-- sometimes
6:37
it's called the Miracle of the Marne--
6:41
if the French, with British help,
6:43
were not able to push the Germans back,
6:45
they might have accomplished the Schlieffen Plan
6:47
and actually maybe would have won World War I,
6:50
or at least been able to win the Western front fairly quickly.
6:53
And then been able to deal with the Russians
6:55
a little bit better.
6:56
But because of the Miracle at the Marne--
6:59
which was hugely bloody.
7:00
We're talking about 500,000 casualties on both sides.
7:03
We're talking 100,000 to 200,000 dead on both sides.
7:07
But because of that, that was able to hold off the Germans.
7:10
But it got the Western front into this ugly three year
7:13
long trench warfare.","Also, if the Americans did NOT join the war then wouldn't that mean that Germany would have probably won with minor casualties and Hitler would have not been angered at the loss of WW1 and started WW2?"

0:00
So I have two 2-dimensional vectors
0:02
right over here, vector a and vector b.
0:05
And what I want to think about is how can we define
0:08
or what would be a reasonable way
0:09
to define the sum of vector a plus vector b?
0:15
Well, one thing that might jump at your mind
0:16
is, look, well, each of these are two dimensional.
0:19
They both have two components.
0:20
Why don't we just add the corresponding components?
0:23
So for the sum, why don't we make the first component
0:27
of the sum just a sum of the first two components
0:30
of these two vectors.
0:31
So why don't we just make it 6 plus negative 4?
0:35
Well, 6 plus negative 4 is equal to 2.
0:38
And why don't we just make the second component
0:41
the sum of the two second components?
0:43
So negative 2 plus 4 is also equal to 2.
0:48
So we start with two 2-dimensional vectors.
0:50
You add them together, you get another two
0:52
2-dimensional vectors.
0:53
If you think about it in terms of real coordinates bases,
0:56
both of these are members of R2--
0:59
I'll write this down here just so we get used to the notation.
1:02
So vector a and vector b are both members of R2,
1:14
which is just another way of saying
1:15
that these are both two tuples.
1:16
They are both two-dimensional vectors right over here.
1:21
Now, this might make sense just looking at how we represented
1:23
it, but how does this actually make
1:25
visual or conceptual sense?
1:27
And to do that, let's actually plot these vectors.
1:29
Let's try to represent these vectors in some way.
1:32
Let's try to visualize them.
1:33
So vector a, we could visualize, this tells us
1:37
how far this vector moves in each
1:39
of these directions-- horizontal direction
1:42
and vertical direction.
1:44
So if we put the, I guess you could
1:45
say the tail of the vector at the origin-- remember,
1:48
we don't have to put the tail at the origin,
1:49
but that might make it a little bit easier for us to draw it.
1:52
We'll go 6 in the horizontal direction.
1:53
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
1:56
And then negative 2 in the vertical.
1:58
So negative 2.
1:59
So vector a could look like this.
2:05
Vector a looks like that.
2:09
And once again, the important thing
2:11
is the magnitude and the direction.
2:12
The magnitude is represented by the length of this vector.
2:15
And the direction is the direction
2:17
that it is pointed in.
2:19
And also just to emphasize, I could have drawn vector a
2:21
like that or I could have put it over here.
2:26
These are all equivalent vectors.
2:30
These are all equal to vector a.
2:32
All I really care about is the magnitude and the direction.
2:37
So with that in mind, let's also draw vector b.
2:40
Vector b in the horizontal direction goes negative 4-- 1,
2:44
2, 3, 4, and in the vertical direction goes 4-- 1, 2, 3, 4.
2:50
So its tail if we start at the origin,
2:52
if its tail is at the origin, its head
2:55
would be at negative 4, 4.
2:59
So let me draw that just like that.
3:03
So that right over here is vector b.
3:07
And once again, vector b we could draw it like that
3:10
or we could draw it-- let me copy and let me paste it--
3:15
so this would also be another way to draw vector b.
3:21
Once again, what I really care about
3:23
is its magnitude and its direction.
3:25
All of these green vectors have the same magnitude.
3:27
They all have the same length and they all
3:29
have the same direction.
3:31
So how does the way that I drew vector a and b
3:33
gel with what its sum is?
3:36
So let me draw its sum like this.
3:38
Let me draw its sum in this blue color.
3:41
So the sum based on this definition we just used,
3:44
the vector addition would be 2, 2.
3:47
So 2, 2.
3:48
So it would look something like this.
3:53
So how does this make sense that the sum,
3:55
that this purple vector plus this green vector
4:00
is somehow going to be equal to this blue vector?
4:02
I encourage you to pause the video
4:03
and think about if that even makes sense.
4:07
Well, one way to think about it is this first purple vector,
4:10
it shifts us this much.
4:12
It takes us from this point to that point.
4:14
And so if we were to add it, let's start at this point
4:16
and put the green vector's tail right there
4:18
and see where it ends up putting us.
4:22
So the green vector, we already have a version.
4:25
So once again, we start the origin.
4:28
Vector a takes us there.
4:30
Now, let's start over there with the green vector
4:32
and see where green vector takes us.
4:34
And this makes sense.
4:35
Vector a plus vector b.
4:38
Put the tail of vector b at the head of vector a.
4:41
So if you were to start at the origin,
4:43
vector a takes you there then if you
4:45
add on what vector b takes you, it takes you right over there.
4:48
So relative to the origin, how much did you--
4:52
I guess you could say-- shift?
4:53
And once again, vectors don't only
4:55
apply to things like displacement.
4:56
It can apply to velocity.
4:57
It can apply to actual acceleration.
4:58
It can apply to a whole series of things,
5:01
but when you visualize it this way,
5:03
you see that it does make complete sense.
5:05
This blue vector, the sum of the two,
5:08
is what results where you start with vector a.
5:11
At that point right over there, vector a takes you there,
5:15
then you take vector b's tail, start over there
5:17
and it takes you to the tip of the sum.
5:21
Now, one question you might be having is well,
5:23
vector a plus vector b is this, but what
5:25
is vector b plus vector a?
5:31
Does this still work?
5:33
Well, based on the definition we had
5:35
where you add the corresponding components,
5:37
you're still going to get the same sum vector.
5:39
So it should come out the same.
5:40
So this will just be negative 4 plus 6 is 2.
5:43
4 plus negative 2 is 2.
5:46
But does that make visual sense?
5:48
So if we start with vector b.
5:49
So let's say you start right over here.
5:51
Vector b takes you right over there.
5:54
And then if you were to go there and you
5:56
were to start with vector a-- so let's do that.
5:59
So actually, let me make this a little bit-- actually, let me
6:02
start with a new vector b.
6:06
So let's say that that's our vector b right over there.
6:11
And then-- actually, let me give this
6:13
a place where I'll have some space to work with.
6:15
So let's say that's my vector b right over there.
6:18
And then let me get a copy of the vector a.
6:22
That's a good one.
6:23
So copy and let me paste it.
6:26
So I could put vector a's tail at the tip of vector b,
6:31
and then it'll take me right over there.
6:35
So if I start right over here, vector b takes me there.
6:42
And now I'm adding to that vector a, which starting here
6:45
will take me there.
6:47
And so from my original starting position, I have gone this far.
6:52
Now, what is this vector?
6:53
Well, this is exactly the vector 2, 2.
6:57
Or another way of thinking about it,
6:58
this vector shifts you 2 in the horizontal direction and 2
7:02
in the vertical direction.
7:04
So either way, you're going to get the same result,
7:06
and that should, hopefully, make visual or conceptual sense
7:09
as well.",How would you name that vector?

0:00
We've learned a little bit about gravity.
0:02
We've learned a little bit about electrostatic.
0:05
So, time to learn about a new fundamental
0:09
force of the universe.
0:10
And this one is probably second most familiar to us,
0:13
next to gravity.
0:13
And that's magnetism.
0:17
Where does the word come from?
0:18
Well, I think several civilizations-- I'm no
0:21
historian-- found these lodestones, these objects that
0:29
would attract other objects like it, other magnets.
0:33
Or would even attract metallic objects like iron.
0:37
Ferrous objects.
0:39
And they're called lodestones.
0:41
That's, I guess, the Western term for it.
0:43
And the reason why they're called magnets is because
0:45
they're named after lodestones that were found near the Greek
0:50
province of Magnesia.
0:56
And I actually think the people who lived there were
0:58
called Magnetes.
1:00
But anyway, you could Wikipedia that and learn more
1:03
about it than I know.
1:05
But anyway let's focus on what magnetism is.
1:08
And I think most of us have at least a working knowledge of
1:12
what it is; we've all played with magnets and we've dealt
1:15
with compasses.
1:16
But I'll tell you this right now, what it really is, is
1:20
pretty deep.
1:22
And I think it's fairly-- I don't think anyone has-- we
1:25
can mathematically understand it and manipulate it and see
1:28
how it relates to electricity.
1:31
We actually will show you the electrostatic force and the
1:33
magnetic force are actually the same thing, just viewed
1:37
from different frames of reference.
1:39
I know that all of that sounds very
1:40
complicated and all of that.
1:41
But in our classical Newtonian world we treat them as two
1:45
different forces.
1:46
But what I'm saying is although we're kind of used to
1:48
a magnet just like we're used to gravity, just like gravity
1:52
is also fairly mysterious when you really think about what it
1:54
is, so is magnetism.
1:56
So with that said, let's at least try to get some working
1:59
knowledge of how we can deal with magnetism.
2:02
So we're all familiar with a magnet.
2:07
I didn't want it to be yellow.
2:10
I could make the boundary yellow.
2:12
No, I didn't want it to be like that either.
2:16
So if this is a magnet, we know that a magnet
2:21
always has two poles.
2:24
It has a north pole and a south pole.
2:28
And these were just labeled by convention.
2:30
Because when people first discovered these lodestones,
2:33
or they took a lodestone and they magnetized a needle with
2:37
that lodestone, and then that needle they put on a cork in a
2:40
bucket of water, and that needle would point to the
2:44
Earth's north pole.
2:46
They said, oh, well the side of the needle that is pointing
2:48
to the Earth's north, let's call that the north pole.
2:50
And the point of the needle that's pointing to the south
2:52
pole-- sorry, the point of the needle that's pointing to the
2:57
Earth's geographic south, we'll call
2:59
that the south pole.
3:00
Or another way to put it, if we have a magnet, the
3:03
direction of the magnet or the side of the magnet that
3:05
orients itself-- if it's allowed to orient freely
3:07
without friction-- towards our geographic north, we call that
3:11
the north pole.
3:12
And the other side is the south pole.
3:14
And this is actually a little bit-- obviously we call the
3:23
top of the Earth the north pole.
3:26
You know, this is the north pole.
3:30
And we call this the south pole.
3:34
And there's another notion of magnetic north.
3:38
And that's where-- I guess, you could kind of say-- that
3:42
is where a compass, the north point of a
3:47
compass, will point to.
3:48
And actually, magnetic north moves around because we have
3:51
all of this moving fluid inside of the earth.
3:54
And a bunch of other interactions.
3:55
It's a very complex interaction.
3:56
But magnetic north is actually roughly in northern Canada.
4:01
So magnetic north might be here.
4:04
So that might be magnetic north.
4:05
And magnetic south, I don't know exactly where that is.
4:07
But it can kind of move around a little bit.
4:09
It's not in the same place.
4:10
So it's a little bit off the axis of the geographic north
4:14
pole and the south pole.
4:16
And this is another slightly confusing thing.
4:19
Magnetic north is the geographic location, where the
4:23
north pole of a magnet will point to.
4:26
But that would actually be the south pole, if you viewed the
4:31
Earth as a magnet.
4:35
So if the Earth was a big magnet, you would actually
4:38
view that as a south pole of the magnet.
4:40
And the geographic south pole is the
4:43
north pole of the magnet.
4:44
You could read more about that on Wikipedia, I know it's a
4:46
little bit confusing.
4:47
But in general, when most people refer to magnetic
4:49
north, or the north pole, they're talking about the
4:51
geographic north area.
4:53
And the south pole is the geographic south area.
4:56
But the reason why I make this distinction is because we know
5:00
when we deal with magnets, just like electricity, or
5:03
electrostatics-- but I'll show a key difference very
5:06
shortly-- is that opposite poles attract.
5:10
So if this side of my magnet is attracted to Earth's north
5:14
pole then Earth's north pole-- or Earth's magnetic north--
5:19
actually must be the south pole of that magnet.
5:22
And vice versa.
5:23
The south pole of my magnet here is going to be attracted
5:26
to Earth's magnetic south.
5:28
Which is actually the north pole of the
5:29
magnet we call Earth.
5:31
Anyway, I'll take Earth out of the equation because it gets a
5:34
little bit confusing.
5:35
And we'll just stick to bars because that tends to be a
5:37
little bit more consistent.
5:40
Let me erase this.
5:44
There you go.
5:45
I'll erase my Magnesia.
5:49
I wonder if the element magnesium was first discovered
5:52
in Magnesia, as well.
5:53
Probably.
5:55
And I actually looked up Milk of
5:57
Magnesia, which is a laxative.
5:58
And it was not discovered in Magnesia, but it has
6:02
magnesium in it.
6:04
So I guess its roots could be in Magnesia if magnesium was
6:08
discovered in Magnesia.
6:09
Anyway, enough about Magnesia.
6:11
Back to the magnets.
6:13
So if this is a magnet, and let me draw another magnet.
6:18
Actually, let me erase all of this.
6:23
All right.
6:24
So let me draw two more magnets.
6:32
We know from experimentation when we were all kids, this is
6:36
the north pole, this is the south pole.
6:38
That the north pole is going to be attracted to the south
6:43
pole of another magnet.
6:45
And that if I were to flip this magnet around, it would
6:48
actually repel north-- two north facing magnets would
6:52
repel each other.
6:54
And so we have this notion, just like we had in
6:56
electrostatics, that a magnet generates a field.
7:01
It generates these vectors around it, that if you put
7:05
something in that field that can be affected by it, it'll
7:09
be some net force acting on it.
7:15
So actually, before I go into magnetic field, I actually
7:17
want to make one huge distinction between magnetism
7:24
and electrostatics.
7:25
Magnetism always comes in the form of a dipole.
7:30
What does a dipole mean?
7:30
It means that we have two poles.
7:32
A north and a south.
7:34
In electrostatics, you do have two charges.
7:40
You have a positive charge and a negative charge.
7:43
So you do have two charges.
7:44
But they could be by themselves.
7:46
You could just have a proton.
7:48
You don't have to have an electron there
7:49
right next to it.
7:50
You could just have a proton and it would create a positive
7:54
electrostatic field.
7:56
And our field lines are what a positive point
7:57
charge would do.
7:59
And it would be repelled.
8:00
So you don't always have to have a negative charge there.
8:05
Similarly you could just have an electron.
8:07
And you don't have to have a proton there.
8:08
So you could have monopoles.
8:10
These are called monopoles, when you just have one charge
8:12
when you're talking about electrostatics.
8:14
But with magnetism you always have a dipole.
8:17
If I were to take this magnet, this one right here, and if I
8:20
were to cut it in half, somehow miraculously each of
8:28
those halves of that magnet will turn
8:30
into two more magnets.
8:31
Where this will be the south, this'll be the north, this'll
8:34
be the south, this will be the north.
8:36
And actually, theoretically, I've read-- my own abilities
8:41
don't go this far-- there could be such a thing as a
8:44
magnetic monopole, although it has not been
8:46
observed yet in nature.
8:48
So everything we've seen in nature has been a dipole.
8:51
So you could just keep cutting this up, all the way down to
8:54
if it's just one electron left.
8:56
And it actually turns out that even one electron is still a
8:59
magnetic dipole.
9:00
It still is generating, it still has a north pole and a
9:04
south pole.
9:05
And actually it turns out, all magnets, the magnetic field is
9:08
actually generated by the electrons within it.
9:12
By the spin of electrons and that-- you know, when we talk
9:14
about electron spin we imagine some little
9:16
ball of charge spinning.
9:18
But electrons are-- you know, it's hard to--
9:20
they do have mass.
9:21
But it starts to get fuzzy whether they
9:23
are energy or mass.
9:24
And then how does a ball of energy spin?
9:26
Et cetera, et cetera.
9:27
So it gets very almost metaphysical.
9:31
So I don't want to go too far into it.
9:33
And frankly, I don't think you really can get an intuition.
9:35
It is almost-- it is a realm that we don't
9:38
normally operate in.
9:39
But even these large magnets you deal with, the magnetic
9:43
field is generated by the electron spins inside of it
9:47
and by the actual magnetic fields generated by the
9:51
electron motion around the protons.
9:53
Well, I hope I'm not overwhelming you.
9:56
And you might say, well, how come sometimes a metal bar can
9:58
be magnetized and sometimes it won't be?
10:00
Well, when all of the electrons are doing random
10:02
different things in a metal bar, then it's not magnetized.
10:06
Because the magnetic spins, or the magnetism created by the
10:10
electrons are all canceling each other out,
10:11
because it's random.
10:12
But if you align the spins of the electrons, and if you
10:16
align their rotations, then you will have a magnetically
10:20
charged bar.
10:21
But anyway, I'm past the ten-minute mark, but hopefully
10:23
that gives you a little bit of a working knowledge of
10:26
what a magnet is.
10:27
And in the next video, I will show what the effect is.
10:31
Well, one, I'll explain how we think about a magnetic field.
10:34
And then what the effect of a magnetic
10:36
field is on an electron.
10:38
Or not an electron, on a moving charge.
10:41

0:03
Let's talk about hypertension.
0:05
And the first thing we have to do
0:08
is understand the two main categories, or types,
0:12
of hypertension that are out there.
0:14
So there are two types, primary--
0:20
and this is actually also called essential hypertension.
0:23
You might hear that word, essential.
0:25
And secondary.
0:27
And I'll write that as a two.
0:29
And so the way that this is divided up
0:32
is that primary hypertension is caused by something indirect.
0:40
OK, so what does that mean exactly?
0:43
So I'll give you some examples of what
0:44
the indirect cause could be.
0:46
It could be something like smoking,
0:48
or it could be that someone has obesity or is obese.
0:53
Or it could be that they have hyperlipidemia,
0:57
meaning that they have lots of fats floating around
1:00
in the blood.
1:02
Or let's say they have diabetes.
1:04
That would be another cause, or indirect cause,
1:08
of hypertension.
1:09
And these are all risk factors, right?
1:11
That's another way of thinking about these things.
1:13
These are general risk factors for having hypertension.
1:16
And the other category would be something direct.
1:20
And once I write this down, you'll
1:22
start seeing the difference.
1:23
This would be something like kidney disease.
1:26
So let's say that I have a problem with my kidneys.
1:30
And they, for some reason-- these
1:32
are my kidneys-- they are holding on
1:34
to far too much fluid than they should.
1:36
And that's because they're diseased.
1:38
And so they're holding onto too much fluid.
1:40
And they're causing my volume of blood to go up.
1:43
There causing the volume to go up,
1:45
and the stroke volume is going up as well.
1:48
And if the stroke volume goes up,
1:49
you know that stroke volume is going to cause a higher blood
1:55
pressure, because they're directly related
1:56
to each other-- very direct.
1:58
That would be one example.
2:00
Another example could be-- let's say
2:01
I have what's called an ""aortic coarctation.""
2:07
So this is a very specific problem.
2:11
This would be-- if I have my-- let's say the heart is here.
2:15
And I have the aorta coming off here.
2:18
Normally, it should be nice and open, the way I've drawn it.
2:21
But if you have a coarctation, then you
2:24
might have a pinching in of the vessel.
2:27
So it would start looking like this.
2:29
It would look like that, like a pinch.
2:33
And if you have a pinching in right there, then
2:36
you have increased resistance.
2:41
And if you have increased resistance,
2:42
you know, again, resistance is going
2:44
to relate back to pressure.
2:46
So if you have more resistance, you have higher pressure.
2:49
So these are direct causes of hypertension,
2:54
which is slightly different than the indirect causes
2:56
I wrote above-- the smoking, obesity--
2:58
because there's no clear direct mechanism in any
3:01
of those things.
3:01
They're just more general risk factors.
3:03
So this is how we kind of divvy up the two groups.
3:05
And we say, OK, if you have one or the other,
3:08
then you're in the primary or secondary group.
3:11
So let's figure out, of the two, which is more prevalent.
3:19
And this basically means, which is
3:22
going to affect more people at any point in time.
3:26
So if I was to poll all people with hypertension--
3:29
ask them, hey, what group are you in, primary or secondary--
3:33
most people would say primary, because most of these people
3:38
are going to be smokers or obese or diabetics or people that
3:43
have hyperlipidemia, some of these risk factors
3:46
that we just laid out.
3:47
In fact over, 90% of the people have primary hypertension.
3:55
And only a few people, I would say less than 10%,
3:59
are going to say, nope, I'm actually
4:00
in the secondary group.
4:01
I have a very specific reason for having hypertension.
4:05
So this is actually a very easy way
4:06
of figuring out if people are having hypertension
4:10
from an indirect cause or a direct cause.
4:13
All right.
4:13
So now, let's assume that you follow
4:16
one person over time, one individual.
4:19
And that person used to have normal blood pressure.
4:24
Let's say this is blood pressure over here.
4:26
And I'm going to write it out as Mean Arterial Pressure, MAP.
4:30
Mean Arterial Pressure.
4:32
And we want to maintain a Mean Arterial Pressure, a MAP,
4:37
of a certain number.
4:38
So this would be like a normal blood pressure range, right?
4:40
Something below this dashed line.
4:43
So this is normal.
4:46
But of course, many people have something higher than normal.
4:49
They, over time, might develop higher blood pressure.
4:54
So maybe they start out here and here in the normal range.
4:58
And then they start having high blood pressure.
5:01
And it kind of goes up and down, and up and then down
5:04
and stops there.
5:06
So in this person-- I'm going to connect
5:10
the dots-- they, if you asked them,
5:13
would not have any symptoms for most of the time.
5:16
They would actually say, you know, I feel fine.
5:19
I don't have any symptoms at all.
5:20
In fact, up until this point in time,
5:25
they would say they have no symptoms.
5:29
And the vast majority of people are actually in this group.
5:32
So most people with hypertension,
5:34
if you ask them if they have symptoms from it,
5:36
they would say no, they don't have any symptoms.
5:38
But at some point, they can develop symptoms.
5:41
Not everybody, but you can develop symptoms.
5:44
And when you do, it's usually quite significant.
5:47
So you might have problems with your heart.
5:50
Maybe your heart is having to work harder than it ever
5:53
had to, and you're having some heart failure.
5:55
Or you might have problems with your large vessels
5:59
or medium vessels.
6:01
And primarily, these are the arteries,
6:03
because the arteries are the vessels that
6:05
are seeing those high pressures.
6:06
And those arteries might be getting very stiff.
6:10
Or you might have problems with tiny vessels.
6:12
These are the little arteries, the smallest ones,
6:15
or the arterioles.
6:17
And remember, the smallest arteries and arterioles,
6:19
they're not sitting there naked in your body.
6:23
They're usually within an organ, right?
6:26
So they're usually within the kidney,
6:28
or they could be within the eye.
6:30
So I'll just draw these two.
6:32
So they're usually within some other organ.
6:35
And if you have problems with the smallest arterioles-- let's
6:38
say they're breaking-- then really, what you're saying
6:42
is you're going to have kidney problems or eye problems.
6:45
So these are the kind of problems you can get.
6:48
And because most people are having
6:50
no symptoms-- most people are over here--
6:52
you really want to catch them before they cross over
6:56
from no symptoms to having symptoms.
6:58
And you want to take care of the blood pressure problem
7:01
so that they never develop any symptoms.
7:02
That's the goal.
7:04
Now, unfortunately, some people develop
7:07
what's called ""malignant hypertension.""
7:10
And I'm going to write out for you
7:11
what malignant hypertension means.
7:16
It's a few things.
7:18
And we can actually even draw it on our figure.
7:20
Maybe I'll do that.
7:21
So you have people with malignant hypertension
7:24
that have a rapid rise in their blood pressure.
7:30
And it causes damage to the heart and vessels.
7:41
And finally, the range that we're talking about,
7:45
it's a rapid rise to a really high blood pressure.
7:48
Sometimes we think of these pressures
7:50
being around 240 over 120-- really high blood pressures.
7:54
So on our graph, this could be the person
7:56
that-- unlike the person in white,
7:58
this person maybe had a very quick rise in pressure.
8:04
And then it got very high, maybe got up to 240 over 120.
8:10
And so this would be the third point.
8:13
The rapid rise is the first point.
8:16
And the fact that they're having symptoms is point number two.
8:19
So you can see now how someone with malignant hypertension
8:23
could look on this sort of a graph.",Why do some ethnic groups have a higher propensity toward having hypertension?

Welcome back.
0:01
So I was trying to rush and finish a problem in the last
0:05
two minutes of the video, and I realize that's just bad
0:08
teaching, because I end up rushing.
0:09
So this is the problem we were going to work on, and you'll
0:11
see a lot of these.
0:12
They just want you to become familiar with the variables in
0:17
Newton's law of gravitation.
0:19
So I said that there's two planets, one is Earth.
0:23
Now I have time to draw things, so that's Earth.
0:27
And then there's Small Earth.
0:28
And Small Earth-- well, maybe I'll just call it the small
0:32
planet, so we don't get confused.
0:34
It's green, showing that there's probably
0:37
life on that planet.
0:40
Let's say it has 1/2 the radius, and 1/2 the mass.
0:45
So if you think about it, it's probably a
0:46
lot denser than Earth.
0:48
That's a good problem to think about.
0:49
How much denser is it, right?
0:51
Because if you have 1/2 the radius, your volume is much
0:55
less than 1/2.
0:56
I don't want to go into that now, but that's something for
0:58
you to think about.
0:58
But my question is what fraction, if I'm standing on
1:01
the surface of this-- so the same person, so Sal, if I'm on
1:06
Earth, what fraction is the pull when I'm on this small
1:13
green planet?
1:15
So what is the pull on me on Earth?
1:18
Well, it's just going to be-- my weight on Earth, the force
1:23
on Earth, is going to be equal to the gravitational constant
1:28
times my mass, mass of me.
1:35
So m sub m times the mass of Earth divided by what?
1:41
We learned in the last video, divided by the distance
1:44
between me and the center of the mass of Earth.
1:45
Really, my center of mass and the center of mass of Earth.
1:49
But this is between the surface of the Earth, and I'd
1:52
like to think that I'm not short, but it's negligible
1:56
between my center of mass and the surface, so we'll just
1:58
consider the radius of the Earth.
2:00
So we divide it by the radius of the Earth squared.
2:08
Using these same variables, what's going to be the force
2:11
on this other planet?
2:13
So the force on the other planet, this green planet--
2:16
I'll do it in green-- and we're calling it the small
2:20
planet, it equals what?
2:23
It equals the gravitational constant again.
2:26
And my mass doesn't change when I go from one planet to
2:29
another, right?
2:31
Its mass now is what?
2:33
We would write it m sub s here, right?
2:37
This is the small planet.
2:39
And we wrote right here that it's 1/2 the mass of Earth, so
2:41
I'll just write that.
2:42
So it's 1/2 the mass of Earth.
2:48
And what's its radius?
2:49
What's the radius now?
2:51
I could just write the radius of the small planet squared,
2:54
but I'll say, well, we know.
2:54
It's 1/2 the radius of Earth, so let's put that in there.
2:57
So 1/2 radius of Earth.
3:00
We have to square it.
3:02
Let's see what this simplifies to.
3:04
This equals-- so we can take this 1/2 here-- 1/2G mass of
3:12
me times mass of Earth over-- what's 1/2 squared?
3:18
It's 1/4.
3:19
Over 1/4 radius of Earth squared.
3:26
And what's 1/2 divided by 1/4?
3:30
1/4 goes into 1/2 two times, right?
3:32
Or another way you can think about it is if you have a
3:33
fraction in the denominator, when you put it in the
3:35
numerator, you flip it and it becomes 4.
3:38
So 4 times 1/2 is 2.
3:39
Either way, it's just math.
3:41
So the force on the small planet is going to be equal to
3:45
1/2 divided by 1/4 is 2 times G, mass of me, times mass of
3:53
Earth, divided by the radius of Earth squared.
3:56
And if we look up here, this is the same
4:01
thing as this, right?
4:05
It's identical.
4:07
So we know that the force that applied to me when I'm on the
4:10
surface of the small planet is actually two times the force
4:15
applied on Earth, when I go to Earth.
4:19
And that's something interesting to think about,
4:20
because you might have said initially, wow, you know, the
4:24
mass of the object matters a lot in gravity.
4:27
The more massive the object, the more it's
4:29
going to pull on me.
4:31
But what we see here is that actually, no.
4:33
When I'm on the surface of this smaller planet, it's
4:36
pulling even harder on me.
4:37
And why is that?
4:38
Well, because I'm actually closer to its center of mass.
4:41
And as we talked about earlier in this video, this object is
4:45
probably a lot denser.
4:46
You could say it's only 1/2 the mass, but it's much less
4:50
than 1/2 of the volume, right?
4:51
Because the volume is the cube of the radius and all of that.
4:55
I don't want to confuse you, but this is just something to
4:56
think about.
4:57
So not only does the mass matter, but the
4:59
radius matters a lot.
5:01
And the radius is actually the square, so it actually
5:03
matters even more.
5:06
So that's something that's pretty
5:09
interesting to think about.
5:10
And these are actually very common problems when they just
5:14
want to tell you, oh, you go to a planet that is two times
5:16
the mass of another planet, et cetera, et cetera, what is the
5:21
difference in force between the two?
5:23
And one thing I want you to realize, actually, before I
5:25
finish this video since I do have some extra time, when we
5:29
think about gravity, especially with planets and
5:30
all of that, you always feel like, oh, it's
5:33
Earth pulling on me.
5:36
Let's say that this is the Earth, and the Earth is huge,
5:41
and this is a tiny spaceship right here.
5:45
It's traveling.
5:48
You always think that Earth is pulling on
5:50
the spaceship, right?
5:51
The gravitational force of Earth.
5:53
But it actually turns out, when we looked at the formula,
5:57
the formula is symmetric.
5:57
It's not really saying one is pulling on the other.
5:59
They're actually saying this is the force
6:01
between the two objects.
6:03
They're attracted to each other.
6:04
So if the Earth is pulling on me with the force of 500
6:13
Newtons, it actually turns out that I am pulling on the Earth
6:16
with an equal and opposite force of 5 Newtons.
6:18
We're pulling towards each other.
6:20
It just feels like the Earth is, at least from my point of
6:23
view, that the Earth is pulling to me.
6:25
And we're actually both being pulled towards the combined
6:29
center of mass.
6:30
So in this situation, let's say the Earth is pulling on
6:33
the spaceship with the force of-- I don't know.
6:37
I'm making up numbers now, but let's say
6:40
it's 1 million Newtons.
6:43
It actually turns out that the spaceship will be pulling on
6:46
the Earth with the same force of 1 million Newtons.
6:51
And they're both going to be moved to the combined system's
6:55
center of mass.
6:56
And the combined system's center of mass since the Earth
7:00
is so much more massive is going to be very close to
7:02
Earth's center of mass.
7:03
It's probably going to be very close to
7:05
Earth's center of mass.
7:06
It's going to be like right there, right?
7:07
So in this situation, Earth won't be doing a lot of
7:12
moving, but it will be pulled in the direction of the
7:15
spaceship, and the spaceship will try to go to Earth's
7:18
center of mass, but at some point, probably the
7:20
atmosphere, or the rock that it runs into, it won't be able
7:24
to go much further and it might crash
7:27
right around there.
7:28
Anyway, I wanted just to give you the sense that it's not
7:31
necessarily one object just pulling on the other.
7:33
They're pulling towards each other to their
7:35
combined center of masses.
7:36
It would make a lot more sense if they had just two people
7:40
floating in space, they actually would have some
7:42
gravity towards each other.
7:43
It's almost a little romantic.
7:47
They would float to each other.
7:48
And actually, you could figure it out.
7:52
I don't have the time to do it, but you could use this
7:55
formula and use the constant, and you could figure out,
7:58
well, what is the gravitational attraction
8:00
between two people?
8:01
And what you'll see is that between two people floating in
8:04
space, there are other forms of attraction that are
8:06
probably stronger than their
8:09
gravitational attraction, anyway.
8:11
I'll let you ponder that and I will see
8:13
you in the next video.",doesn't the gravitation have a reaction force as said in newton's 3rd law?

Welcome back.
0:01
So I was trying to rush and finish a problem in the last
0:05
two minutes of the video, and I realize that's just bad
0:08

0:09
So this is the problem we were going to work on, and you'll

0:12
They just want you to become familiar with the variables in

0:19
So I said that there's two planets, one is Earth.
0:23
Now I have time to draw things, so that's Earth.
0:27
And then there's Small Earth.
0:28
And Small Earth-- well, maybe I'll just call it the small
0:32

0:34
It's green, showing that there's probably
0:37
life on that planet.
0:40
Let's say it has 1/2 the radius, and 1/2 the mass.
0:45
So if you think about it, it's probably a
0:46
lot denser than Earth.
0:48
That's a good problem to think about.
0:49
How much denser is it, right?
0:51
Because if you have 1/2 the radius, your volume is much
0:55
less than 1/2.
0:56
I don't want to go into that now, but that's something for
0:58
you to think about.
0:58
But my question is what fraction, if I'm standing on
1:01
the surface of this-- so the same person, so Sal, if I'm on
1:06
Earth, what fraction is the pull when I'm on this small
1:13
green planet?
1:15
So what is the pull on me on Earth?
1:18
Well, it's just going to be-- my weight on Earth, the force
1:23
on Earth, is going to be equal to the gravitational constant
1:28
times my mass, mass of me.
1:35
So m sub m times the mass of Earth divided by what?
1:41
We learned in the last video, divided by the distance
1:44
between me and the center of the mass of Earth.
1:45
Really, my center of mass and the center of mass of Earth.
1:49
But this is between the surface of the Earth, and I'd
1:52
like to think that I'm not short, but it's negligible
1:56
between my center of mass and the surface, so we'll just
1:58
consider the radius of the Earth.
2:00
So we divide it by the radius of the Earth squared.
2:08
Using these same variables, what's going to be the force
2:11
on this other planet?
2:13
So the force on the other planet, this green planet--
2:16
I'll do it in green-- and we're calling it the small
2:20
planet, it equals what?
2:23
It equals the gravitational constant again.
2:26
And my mass doesn't change when I go from one planet to
2:29
another, right?
2:31
Its mass now is what?
2:33
We would write it m sub s here, right?
2:37
This is the small planet.
2:39
And we wrote right here that it's 1/2 the mass of Earth, so
2:41
I'll just write that.
2:42
So it's 1/2 the mass of Earth.
2:48
And what's its radius?
2:49
What's the radius now?
2:51
I could just write the radius of the small planet squared,
2:54
but I'll say, well, we know.
2:54
It's 1/2 the radius of Earth, so let's put that in there.
2:57
So 1/2 radius of Earth.
3:00
We have to square it.
3:02
Let's see what this simplifies to.
3:04
This equals-- so we can take this 1/2 here-- 1/2G mass of
3:12
me times mass of Earth over-- what's 1/2 squared?
3:18
It's 1/4.
3:19
Over 1/4 radius of Earth squared.
3:26
And what's 1/2 divided by 1/4?
3:30
1/4 goes into 1/2 two times, right?
3:32
Or another way you can think about it is if you have a
3:33
fraction in the denominator, when you put it in the
3:35
numerator, you flip it and it becomes 4.
3:38
So 4 times 1/2 is 2.
3:39
Either way, it's just math.
3:41
So the force on the small planet is going to be equal to
3:45
1/2 divided by 1/4 is 2 times G, mass of me, times mass of
3:53
Earth, divided by the radius of Earth squared.
3:56
And if we look up here, this is the same
4:01
thing as this, right?
4:05
It's identical.
4:07
So we know that the force that applied to me when I'm on the
4:10
surface of the small planet is actually two times the force
4:15

4:19
And that's something interesting to think about,
4:20
because you might have said initially, wow, you know, the

4:27
The more massive the object, the more it's

4:31
But what we see here is that actually, no.
4:33
When I'm on the surface of this smaller planet, it's
4:36
pulling even harder on me.
4:37
And why is that?
4:38
Well, because I'm actually closer to its center of mass.
4:41
And as we talked about earlier in this video, this object is
4:45
probably a lot denser.
4:46
You could say it's only 1/2 the mass, but it's much less

5:53
But it actually turns out, when we looked at the formula,

the formula is symmetric.

It's not really saying one is pulling on the other.
5:59
They're actually saying this is the force
6:01

6:03
They're attracted to each other.
6:04
So if the Earth is pulling on me with the force of 500
6:13
Newtons, it actually turns out that I am pulling on the Earth
6:16
with an equal and opposite force of 5 Newtons.
6:18
We're pulling towards each other.
6:20
It just feels like the Earth is, at least from my point of
6:23

6:37
I'm making up numbers now, but let's say
6:40
it's 1 million Newtons.
6:43
It actually turns out that the spaceship will be pulling on
6:46
the Earth with the same force of 1 million Newtons.
6:51
And they're both going to be moved to the combined system's
6:55
center of mass.
6:56
And the combined system's center of mass since the Earth
7:00
is so much more massive is going to be very close to
7:02
Earth's center of mass.
7:03
It's probably going to be very close to
7:05
Earth's center of mass.
7:06
It's going to be like right there, right?
7:07
So in this situation, Earth won't be doing a lot of
7:12
moving, but it will be pulled in the direction of the
7:15
spaceship, and the spaceship will try to go to Earth's
7:18

7:20

So I've got four empty cells here.
0:04
Let's imagine these are four cells in someone's body.
0:07
And the inside of the cells are the same,
0:09
and the outside of the cells are the same.
0:12
So they're really completely the same except for one thing.
0:15
And that one thing is that, let's say
0:17
that these cells, each of them, is only permeable to one ion.
0:21
And I'm going to write the ion that they're
0:23
permeable to underneath them.
0:25
So each of them can only let in or let out one ion.
0:30
So in the first cell, you know that there's
0:32
a lot of potassium that wants to get out,
0:34
so it's going to have potassium leaving.
0:37
In the second cell, you know that we generally
0:39
have more sodium on the outside that wants to get in.
0:44
And the same is true for chloride that wants to get in.
0:47
And the same is true for calcium that wants to get in.
0:49
So this is how the four cells are
0:52
going to have a movement of ions,
0:53
and these are the concentration gradients.
0:56
And so then, of course, if you want
0:58
to figure out what the membrane potentials are,
1:00
you have to think, OK, well, if it's a positive ion leaving,
1:04
then it's going to make the membrane potential negative.
1:08
In fact, we even calculated it to be negative 92 millivolts.
1:12
And for sodium, it turns out to be positive 67 millivolts.
1:17
And these are estimates based on rough concentrations.
1:21
Of course, concentrations aren't exact everywhere.
1:23
Different cell types have different concentrations.
1:26
But these are kind of rough approximations.
1:28
And chloride would be somewhere around,
1:31
let's say, negative 86 millivolts.
1:36
And you know it's negative because a negative ion is
1:38
entering.
1:40
And finally, calcium is going to be positive 123 millivolts.
1:44
And just to remind us, the reason
1:47
that calcium isn't simply sodium times two--
1:50
because you might think that because calcium
1:52
has two positive charges.
1:53
The reason it's not just sodium's number times two
1:57
is that these numbers are actually
1:58
based on concentration gradients,
2:00
and the concentration gradient for calcium
2:02
might be very different.
2:03
In fact, it is very different than it is for sodium.
2:05
So that's how these numbers are made, using that Nernst
2:09
equation that we went over previously.
2:13
So now we know that these are the resting potentials
2:16
for each individual ion.
2:18
But what is the potential for a cell, a real cell?
2:21
And you know we're not actually using a real cell
2:24
as an example, because real cells are
2:26
permeable to multiple ions.
2:28
And so let me actually give you an example
2:30
of what a real cell might look like.
2:33
Of course, it looks slightly different than that
2:38
because you actually have potassium leaving.
2:40
And at the same time, you might have sodium entering,
2:45
you might have chloride entering,
2:47
and you might have calcium entering.
2:50
So this is what a real cell would look like.
2:52
And let's figure out, maybe using an example,
2:55
how to actually work through calculating
2:58
the membrane potential for a real cell like that.
3:01
So I'm going to write out the four ions
3:02
and make it really clear so that we
3:05
don't get confused about the four.
3:08
We're talking about, again, potassium, sodium, chloride,
3:13
and calcium.
3:13
And the reason I chose these four--
3:15
I could have chosen others as well--
3:17
but that these four probably contribute the majority
3:21
to the resting potential.
3:24
In particular, I would say potassium,
3:28
but you'll see that all of them have
3:29
a tiny little role in contributing to it.
3:32
So let's first get to the idea of permeability.
3:35
So until now, we've been assuming
3:38
that each cell is, in the first example,
3:41
only permeable to one ion.
3:43
And now the whole difference is that now we
3:44
have cells that have permeability to multiple ions.
3:48
So here's how you think about it.
3:49
Think about the fact that all ions crossing back and forth
3:54
along the membrane make up permeability.
3:57
So permeability is all ions crossing back and forth.
4:01
Permeability is all ions crossing--
4:08
and I'll just write crossing, and you
4:10
get the idea-- crossing back and forth along the border.
4:14
So what percentage is going to be from potassium?
4:19
What percentage from sodium, chloride, and calcium?
4:23
And of course, the total permeability
4:25
has to be 100% right?
4:27
We have to add up to 100%.
4:28
And let's assume right now that we only
4:30
have four ions going back and forth.
4:33
So I'm just going to make up some quick numbers.
4:35
So let's say that of the 100%, potassium is 95%,
4:42
meaning that 95% of all border crossings--
4:46
if we think about our cell border or cell membrane,
4:48
95% of the crossings are with the ion potassium.
4:53
And that means that only 5% of the crossings
4:56
are with the other three ions.
4:58
So let's say that it's 1% from sodium, and 2% from chloride,
5:04
and 2% from calcium.
5:06
So really, in terms of dominating the permeability,
5:10
in this case, I've set it up so that potassium
5:12
is dominating the permeability, right?
5:14
And actually, in most cells that's about right.
5:18
Potassium is the dominant ion in most cells.
5:22
In fact, sometimes even more than 95%.
5:24
So how do you actually calculate the membrane potential
5:28
based on this?
5:29
So we've started with good information.
5:31
We've got the permeability.
5:34
And now we need to multiply it by potassium's ideal membrane
5:39
potential.
5:40
What would potassium like it to be?
5:41
It would like it to be negative 92 millivolts, right?
5:46
And sodium would like it to be positive 67 millivolts.
5:51
And chloride would like the membrane potential
5:54
to be negative 86 millivolts.
5:58
And calcium would like it to be positive 123.
6:02
I mean, that's ideally where those ions would like to be.
6:05
But again, 95% of the voting, in a sense, for what the cell is
6:11
going to agree upon comes from one ion.
6:14
It comes from potassium.
6:16
And so we just have to add all of this up and get a total.
6:19
So this part right here, 95% of the ions being permeable,
6:25
multiplied by the membrane potential for potassium.
6:29
95% times negative 92-- I'm just going to quickly do
6:32
the math on a calculator-- works out
6:35
to negative 87.4 millivolts.
6:41
And this bit right here, 1% of the 67, well, that's easy.
6:44
That's 0.7 millivolts.
6:47
That's just 1%.
6:49
And then this bit, 2% times negative 86 millivolts, that
6:55
works out to about negative 1.7 millivolts.
6:59
And finally, this part right here for the calcium
7:03
ends up being positive 2.5 millivolts.
7:08
So if you add up all the stuff, what do you get?
7:11
You get a total of negative 85.9 millivolts.
7:20
So this would be the membrane potential
7:24
for a cell that ended up having 95% permeability to potassium,
7:30
and only 1% and 2% to the other three ions.
7:35
So if it's going to be dominated by potassium,
7:38
you can see that this final number
7:40
is going to be really close to what potassium would like
7:43
it to be, that negative 92, because 95% of it
7:47
came from there.
7:49
Now that would be one way of doing it.
7:51
Let me do it one more time, and you'll
7:53
see how it can actually change.
7:56
So just as before, let's say that in the second case-- so
8:00
again, this is case one.
8:04
And let's say case two, now I make
8:08
potassium not very permeable at all.
8:10
Let's say I drop it all the way down to 16%.
8:19
And I raise sodium all the way up to 80%.
8:24
So now, all of a sudden, our same cell
8:27
as before is very permeable to sodium.
8:30
And you might think, well, how would that be the case?
8:33
Let's imagine that sodium channels get put into the cell
8:38
membrane so that sodium can just go right
8:40
through those channels, so something like that.
8:42
But let's say that the other two ions stay about the same.
8:45
2% and 2%.
8:47
So you've got a similar setup as before,
8:50
and this time you've got-- let me do the math.
8:55
So we've got negative 92 millivolts.
8:58
And again, the permeability-- this is actually
9:00
an important point-- adds up to 100% again, right?
9:02
Because you've got 16 plus 80 plus 2 plus 2.
9:05
So overall, we're still talking about 100%
9:07
permeability, but in this case, most of that
9:10
permeability is going to sodium.
9:13
So negative 92 millivolts for the potassium,
9:18
you've got positive 67 for the sodium, negative 86 over here,
9:24
and you've got positive 123 over here.
9:28
So I'm going to do the last two first,
9:30
because those are going to be the same as before, right?
9:32
And then we add them all together.
9:34
So here, of course, as before, I have negative 1.7.
9:38
That doesn't change.
9:39
And as before, I have positive 2.5.
9:42
That doesn't change.
9:44
So some of it's going to be the same.
9:46
But some of it's going to be different.
9:48
So these two numbers-- let me just
9:49
check out what my math works out to be-- this is negative
9:54
14.7 millivolts, so a lot less than the negative 87.
10:00
And now this is going to be a huge number compared
10:03
to that measly 0.7 that we had before.
10:06
Now we have 53.6 coming from sodium.
10:11
So now sodium is playing a much bigger role
10:13
than it was last time.
10:14
And if I was to add these four numbers,
10:17
my overall permeability was 100%,
10:21
and my overall membrane potential as a result of that
10:25
is going to be 39.7.
10:27
So let me just-- and that's positive 39.7.
10:31
So we went from negative 85.9 to positive 39.7.
10:39
And here, the dominant thing was this.
10:45
So you can see how it's starting to approach positive 67, simply
10:49
because we just had so much of the permeability coming
10:53
from sodium.
10:54
So in a way, the permeability becomes almost like a vote.
10:58
Like the more permeable one of the ions
11:01
is relative to the other ones, the more votes
11:03
it gets in terms of what the final membrane
11:05
potential is going to be.
11:06
And in this case, the more an ion votes,
11:11
the more it's going to be close-- the final membrane
11:13
potential will be close-- to what it wants,
11:16
which is its resting potential.
11:19
So we have these two membrane potentials.
11:21
And finally, I'm just going to show you
11:23
on a little graph what this might look like.
11:26
So let's say you've got a little graph here.
11:30
And I'm going to draw a positive and negative.
11:32
So this is positive, this is negative,
11:35
and this is millivolts.
11:37
And what I'm drawing for you is the cell's membrane potential
11:48
in millivolts.
11:50
So at time point 1-- let's say time point one was right here,
11:55
and time point 2 is right here.
11:57
At time point 1, we had a very negative-- I forget the number.
12:02
I think it was like negative 80 something.
12:04
I'll just say it was negative 86 or something down here.
12:08
And then at time point 2, we had a number up here.
12:13
This is our 39.7.
12:17
And actually let me just double check the number,
12:19
I don't want to get it wrong here.
12:20
Yup, negative 86.
12:23
This is negative 86, or 85.9.
12:28
So really, what you had is, in just a matter
12:31
of switching the permeabilities, you
12:34
can actually change the membrane potential from something
12:37
very low to something very high.
12:39
So let's stop there and we'll pick up.",At 12:16 how does the permeability of the cell change?

- As a little bit of a review, we know that
0:01
if we have some function, let's call it ""f"".
0:04
We don't have to call it ""f"", but ""f"" is the letter
0:06
most typically used for functions,
0:08
that if I give it an input, a valid input,
0:11
if I give it a valid input, and I use the variable ""x""
0:14
for that valid input, it is going to map that to an output.
0:19
It is going to map that, or produce,
0:21
given this x, it's going to product an output
0:24
that we would call ""f(x).""
0:26
And we've already talked a little bit
0:28
about the notion of a domain.
0:29
A domain is the set of all of the inputs
0:32
over which the function is defined.
0:35
So if this the domain here, if this is the domain here,
0:39
and I take a value here, and I put that in for x,
0:42
then the function is going to output an f(x).
0:45
If I take something that's outside of the domain,
0:47
let me do that in a different color...
0:49
If I take something that is outside of the domain
0:52
and try to input it into this function,
0:55
the function will say, ""hey, wait wait,""
0:56
""I'm not defined for that thing""
0:57
""that's outside of the domain.""
1:00
Now another interesting thing to think about,
1:04
and that's actually what the focus of this video is,
1:06
okay, we know the set of all of the valid inputs,
1:08
that's called the domain, but what about all,
1:10
the set of all of the outputs that the function
1:13
could actually produce?
1:14
And we have a name for that.
1:16
That is called the range of the function.
1:19
So the range.
1:21
The range, and the most typical,
1:23
there's actually a couple of definitions for range,
1:25
but the most typical definition for range
1:27
is ""the set of all possible outputs.""
1:30
So you give me, you input something from the domain,
1:32
it's going to output something, and by definition,
1:34
because we have outputted it from this function,
1:36
that thing is going to be in the range,
1:39
and if we take the set of all of the things
1:40
that the function could output,
1:42
that is going to make up the range.
1:44
So this right over here is the set of all possible,
1:49
all possible outputs.
1:53
All possible outputs.
1:55
So let's make that a little bit more concrete,
1:57
with an example.
1:58
So let's say that I have the function f(x)
2:02
defined as, so once again, I'm gonna input x's,
2:06
and I have my function f, and I'm gonna output f(x).
2:10
And let's say this def...
2:12
The function definition here, the thing that tries to
2:13
figure out, ""okay, given an x, what f(x) do I produce?"",
2:16
the definition says ""f(x) is going to be equal""
2:20
""to whatever my input is, squared.""
2:23
Well, just as a little bit of review,
2:24
we know what the domain here is going to be.
2:26
The domain is the set of all valid inputs.
2:30
So what are the valid inputs here?
2:33
Well, I could take any real number
2:34
and input into this, and I could take any real number
2:37
and I can square it, there's nothing wrong with that,
2:39
and so the domain is all real numbers.
2:42
All, all real, all real numbers.
2:48
But what's the range?
2:49
Maybe I'll do that in a different color
2:50
just to highlight it.
2:52
What is going to be the range here,
2:54
what is the set of all possible outputs?
2:58
Well if you think about, actually,
2:59
to help us think about, let me actually draw a graph here.
3:02
Of what this looks like.
3:04
What this looks like.
3:06
So the graph of ""f(x) is equal to x squared""
3:08
is going to look something like this.
3:10
So, it's gonna look, it's going to look something like this.
3:15
I'm obviously hand-drawing it, so it's not perfect.
3:17
It's gonna be a parabola with a,
3:19
with a vertex right here at the origin.
3:22
So this is the graph, this is the graph,
3:24
""y is equal to f(x),"" this of course is the x-axis,
3:28
this of course is the y-axis.
3:31
So let's think about it, what is the set
3:33
of all possible outputs?
3:35
Well in this case, the set of all possible outputs
3:36
is the set of all possible y's here.
3:38
Well, we see, y can take on any non-negative value.
3:43
y could be zero, y could one, y could be pi, y could be e,
3:47
but y cannot be negative.
3:51
So the range here is, the range...
3:54
We could, well we could say it a couple of ways,
3:56
we could say, ""f(x)"", let me write it this way.
3:59
""f(x) is a member of the real numbers""
4:03
""such that, is such that f(x) is greater than""
4:09
""or equal to zero.""
4:11
We could write it that way, if we wanted to
4:13
write it in a less mathy notation,
4:15
we could say that ""f(x) is going to be""
4:19
""greater than or equal to zero.""
4:21
f(x) is not going to be negative,
4:24
so any non-negative number, the set of all
4:27
non-negative numbers, that is our range.
4:31
Let's do another example of this,
4:33
just to make it a little bit, just to make it a little bit,
4:35
a little bit clearer.
4:37
Let's say that I had, let's say that I had g(x),
4:42
let's say I have g(x), I'll do this in white,
4:45
let's say it's equal to ""x squared over x.""
4:49
So we could try to simplify g(x) a little bit,
4:52
we could say, ""look, if I have x squared""
4:53
""and I divide it by x, that's gonna,""
4:55
""that's the same thing as g(x) being equal to x.""
4:59
""x squared over x"" is x, but we have to be careful.
5:02
Because right over here, we have to,
5:04
in our domain, x cannot be equal to zero.
5:08
If x is equal to zero, we get zero over zero,
5:10
we get indeterminate form.
5:11
So in order for this function to be the exact same function,
5:14
we have to put that, 'cause it's not obvious now
5:16
from the definition, we have to say,
5:21
""x cannot be equal to zero.""
5:23
So g(x) is equal to x for any x
5:25
as long as x is not equal to zero.
5:28
Now these two function definitions are equivalent.
5:31
And we could even graph it.
5:33
We could graph it, it's going to look,
5:35
I'm gonna do a quick and dirty version of this graph.
5:38
It's gonna look something like, this.
5:40
It's gonna have a slope of one,
5:43
but it's gonna have a hole right at zero,
5:44
'cause it's not defined at zero.
5:47
So it's gonna look like this.
5:48
So the domain here, the domain of g
5:53
is going to be, ""x is a member of the real numbers""
5:57
""such that x does not equal zero,""
6:00
and the range is actually going to be the same thing.
6:03
The range here is going to be,
6:06
we could say ""f(x) is a member of the real numbers""
6:10
""such that f(x) does not equal zero.""
6:14
""f(x) does not equal zero.""
6:17
So the domain is all real numbers except for zero,
6:19
the range is all real numbers except for zero.
6:24
So the big takeaway here is the range is all the pos...
6:28
The set of all possible outputs of your function.
6:32
The domain is the set of all valid inputs
6:35
into your function.",how will the graph be?

- [Instructor] In other videos,
0:01
we talk about how 10 to 15,000 years ago.
0:04
You have the emergence of agriculture
0:07
primarily around river valleys,
0:10
and it's no surprise that agriculture
0:12
first came about around river valleys
0:14
because the rivers would flood,
0:17
making the soil around them fertile.
0:19
They would provide fresh water for crops
0:22
and for the people who would live near them.
0:24
Later on, the rivers could be useful for
0:26
transporting things like crops,
0:29
and so it's not surprising that our
0:31
first significant civilizations also emerged
0:33
where the first agriculture emerged.
0:37
And our first civilizations we'll see
0:38
in ancient Egypt along the Nile.
0:41
We will see it in the Indus Valley along the Indus River.
0:45
We'll see it in China along the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers,
0:49
and we'll also see it in Mesopotamia
0:51
along the Tigress and Euphrates Rivers.
0:56
And what we're gonna focus on in
0:58
this video in particular is Mesopotamia.
1:03
Now, the word Mesopotamia literally come from
1:05
meso, between, and potamos.
1:07
I'm probably not pronouncing it right, rivers.
1:10
So it's the area between rivers is literally
1:13
what Mesopotamia is referring to.
1:15
And it's primarily modern day Iraq.
1:19
Now the reason why this is particularly interesting
1:21
and it's called the cradle of civilization,
1:24
is not only is it one of or perhaps
1:27
the first place that agriculture developed,
1:29
it was at the crossroads of many other early civilizations.
1:33
Notice it's right in between
1:35
the Indus Valley civilization here,
1:37
and then the ancient Egyptians,
1:39
and other civilizations that were emerging in the area.
1:42
And so it's not surprising that this was
1:44
a geography that had significant developments
1:47
in terms of technology, in terms of architecture,
1:50
in terms of religion, in terms of writing.
1:54
And the first civilization we believe
1:57
that emerged in Mesopotamia are the Sumerians.
2:01
Sumerians.
2:04
And Sumeria and Sumerians, it's most associated with
2:07
this region right over here of, let me circle it,
2:12
this region right over here of southern Mesopotamia.
2:17
And we currently think that this civilization
2:19
started to emerge around 4000 BCE.
2:22
You can see it on this timeline here in orange,
2:25
and they developed things as basic as the wheel.
2:30
The first wheel that was ever discovered
2:31
was 3500 BCE in Sumeria.
2:35
They're famous for their architectural structures.
2:37
This is a picture here of a ziggurat,
2:39
which was at the center of many of
2:41
these Sumerian and as we'll see Mesopotamian cities.
2:44
This would require an incredible amount of labor to produce,
2:47
and at the top of these they had temples to their Gods
2:50
and their Gods, they had a polytheistic religion,
2:53
and their Gods took human form.
2:58
Also amongst the Sumerians is where we think
3:02
one of the first written languages developed.
3:05
It wasn't the first.
3:06
You also have the Egyptian hieroglyphics
3:07
and written language emerged amongst
3:09
the Harappans and the Indus Valley civilization
3:12
and amongst the Chinese,
3:14
but it was one of the first languages.
3:16
This right over here is an example of a cuneiform tablet.
3:20
This is a cuneiform tablet written in the script.
3:24
Cuneiform developed by these ancient Sumerians.
3:30
Now, when you talk about Mesopotamia,
3:32
you'll talk about Sumerians,
3:33
but we'll also talk about other civilizations that emerge.
3:36
In particular, let me write them all down.
3:38
You have the Sumerians.
3:39
You'll also hear something called Akkadian,
3:41
and as we'll see, Akkadian is both a language
3:45
and an empire that will emerge.
3:48
In Mesopotamia over the roughly 3,000 years BCE,
3:54
the two primary languages are Akkadian,
3:58
which is considered a Semitic language.
4:01
It's related to modern Semitic languages,
4:03
like Arabic and Hebrew,
4:06
and the reason why they're called Semitic is
4:08
because they're spoken or they're reported to be spoken
4:10
by the descendants of Shem, who was Noah's son,
4:14
in the Hebrew bible.
4:16
So, you have the language Akkadian, which is Semitic,
4:19
and then you have the other language, which is Sumerian.
4:21
And as we get into the third millennium BCE,
4:26
the Sumerians start to have a lot of
4:28
interaction with Akkadian speaking people,
4:31
and Akkadian speaking people are initially associated
4:33
primarily with northern Mesopotamia,
4:37
and we believe the first empire, true empire,
4:41
perhaps the first empire in the world emerged from Acadia,
4:45
and it was called the Akkadian Empire.
4:47
And if we scroll down over here,
4:52
we can see how the Akkadian Empire spread.
4:56
We believe that the town of Akkad,
4:58
which the Akkadian Empire is named for,
5:00
some place in this region right over here,
5:03
and the first significant ruler
5:04
who really spread that empire was Sargon,
5:07
often referred to as Sargon the Great.
5:10
And you can see, you can see that
5:13
that would have been established around
5:15
the middle of the 23rd, or actually the 24th century BCE.
5:21
So around 2350, you have Sargon establishing
5:24
what might be the first Dynastic empire in the world,
5:27
the Akkadian Empire,
5:29
and he was able to take control of
5:31
both northern and southern Mesopotamia,
5:33
so even the Sumerians were under
5:35
the control of the Akkadians.
5:37
As we'll see over time,
5:38
you have a lot of mixing between the Akkadian language,
5:41
the Sumerian language.
5:42
Akkadian gets written in the Cuneiform script,
5:46
and starting at around this period,
5:47
Sumerian starts to die as a spoken language
5:50
and Akkadian really becomes dominant.
5:52
Now, the Akkadians rule for a little over 100 years,
5:57
and then you have several other empires.
6:00
It can get confusing.
6:01
The way I have structured this timeline is
6:03
this top line right over here is southern Mesopotamia
6:05
and this bottom line right over here is northern Mesopotamia
6:09
so this orange shows you where the Sumerians were reigning.
6:12
Some people think that they might
6:14
have been the first empire.
6:15
This bottom line here, you can see the Akkadian speakers,
6:17
but they were fragmented until you have Sargon the great
6:20
establishing the Akkadian Empire.
6:22
Now, you briefly then have a short-term neo-Sumerian empire,
6:28
but the next significant empire that's often talked about
6:31
when associated with Mesopotamia is the Babylonian Empire.
6:36
So Babylon, the Babylonian Empire
6:38
was centered at Babylon, right over here,
6:40
and it really became a significant empire
6:44
under the ruler Hammurabi.
6:47
And Hammurabi is perhaps most known,
6:49
you can see how he was able to spread the empire.
6:52
The dark brown is what he had with
6:55
this empire when he took rule,
6:57
and the light brown is what he was able to spread it to,
7:00
so once again, both north and south,
7:01
and he's perhaps most famous for
7:03
his famous code of Hammurabi, which is depicted here,
7:07
and it wasn't the first written code,
7:09
but it was one of the earliest,
7:11
and you could view it as almost a proto-constitution,
7:14
and it was based on things that the Sumerians had before,
7:17
but they've even influenced things like biblical laws,
7:20
things that come down to modern codes of law today.
7:24
Now, after the Babylonians,
7:26
the other significant empire that would have control over
7:30
significant portions of Mesopotamia is the Assyrian Empire.
7:34
And the Assyrian Empire is named for their,
7:37
I guess you could say their home base, the town of Assur.
7:41
You can see it in this map here,
7:43
where we showed the Akkadian Empire.
7:45
And both the Babylonians and the Assyrians
7:47
were Akkadian speaking, so at this point now,
7:49
and as we get into the later Assyrian period,
7:52
we'll start to have Aramaic be a more significant language,
7:54
another Semitic language, but as you can see here,
7:57
the Assyrian Empire at its peak controlled
7:59
much of the modern day Middle East.
8:03
Now, the Assyrian Empire would eventually collapse
8:06
in the seventh century BCE,
8:09
and it would be taken over by the Neobabylonian Empire.
8:12
I have a map of that right over here,
8:16
which also controlled much of the modern middle east.
8:19
Probably the most famous ruler of the Neobabylonian Empire
8:22
was Nebuchadnezzar II from the Hebrew bible famous for
8:26
taking the early Jewish people captive,
8:31
the famous Babylonian captivity,
8:33
but eventually they would be overthrown,
8:35
and they would be overthrown in the sixth century BCE
8:39
by the Persians and Cyrus the Great,
8:43
and that'll actually be the end of
8:44
the Babylonian captivity according to biblical accounts.
8:48
But the big picture is that Mesopotamia is called
8:50
the cradle of civilization for a good reason.
8:54
Not only do we have these technological
8:56
and architectural advancements,
8:58
their religion, their writing has influenced civilization
9:01
since, for the last five, six, 7,000 years.
9:08
Well, I'd say definitely the last 5,000 years,
9:11
and a lot of these ideas that came out of Mesopotamia,
9:14
like written codes of law and the technologies
9:17
and all the rest follow with us today.",Wouldn't floods also be a disadvantage to agriculture?

You have reached the first checkpoint
0:02
in the 'Journey to cryptography'-series.
0:04
And now I want to talk about what's next,
0:07
because I'm working on a new series.
0:09
However, this one won't end here.
0:11
If anything, we are kind of at the beginning still.
0:14
So I'm going to do 3 different checkpoint videos.
0:17
This one is on 'Advanced Lessons'.
0:20
However, I also want to eventually talk about Tests and Challenges,
0:24
and what we can do with more interactive explorations
0:27
and computer science lessons as it applies to cryptography.
0:31
But for now, let's talk about Advanced Lessons.
0:33
When I say 'Advanced', I don't necessarily mean 'harder lessons',
0:37
I mean 'more detailed'.
0:39
Let me give you a conceptual idea
0:41
for what I think this series could be and future series.
0:45
I like to think of each series as the trunk of a tree,
0:48
where I took you from prehistoric times
0:51
to around the 20th century, which is here,
0:53
with a few different threads.
0:55
And these ideas kind of branch apart.
0:59
Once you get to the 20th and 21st centuries,
1:01
they start getting highly specific.
1:04
And way down here on the leaves are current research questions,
1:09
which over here might be
1:11
problems related to prime number distribution
1:13
and over here some very specific work being done
1:18
on randomized algorithms or hash functions,
1:21
and way up here we might have new public key protocols
1:27
- because RSA was just the first -
1:29
or we also have encryption standards such as DES and AES.
1:33
We would have a whole new branch on quantum cryptography.
1:37
So as you can see, there are so many different things
1:40
that branch out of this series
1:41
and I couldn't possibly do justice to them all.
1:44
So I think of this video as living right here.
1:46
At kind of a junction point.
1:49
Now I can branch off with help of the community
1:52
and possibly other video creators
1:54
to fill out this tree gradually over time.
1:58
Specifically with the help of the community.
2:01
I am really excited about the Q&A community
2:04
and the work being done to improve
2:06
how people can help people on Khan Academy.
2:09
So, for example,
2:11
in terms of where one of these branches can go,
2:15
I've noticed clusters of questions
2:17
kind of leading into a common branch.
2:20
For example, under 'the pseudo-random number generator',
2:23
I have two questions here: one by Sonny and one by Drakain.
2:26
Drakain's question is:
2:27
""Why has he suggested that time in milliseconds...
2:31
...is a suitable random seed?...
2:33
This is a huge no-no in security. ...
2:35
The time it is on your machine...
2:38
...is the time it is on my machine,...
2:40
...give or take 100 milliseconds...
2:42
(which can be brute-force attacked)""
2:44
And again, this is a great question too
2:46
because it speaks to the need that
2:48
I didn't present a cryptographically secure pseudo-random generator.
2:53
So the middle square's method is back here
2:56
in early 20th century, but up until today,
2:59
we are not using the middle square's method
3:02
and that's a whole interesting branch.
3:05
It is these sorts of questions which cluster together
3:08
and really drive new content.
3:12
I want to show you a really interesting example
3:14
of how this has happened already.
3:16
This is a question Samuel asked on the 'One time pad'-video
3:20
he said: ""wouldn't a computer be able to test all the possibilities very fast?""
3:24
and Chuck Patrol basically asked the same question.
3:28
I see this happening a lot.
3:30
Similar questions all speak to the need of a new video.
3:33
So I went and created a video on 'perfect secrecy'
3:37
which really nails down
3:39
how you can't beat randomness in the world of encryption.
3:43
Out of this video, Dawn made a really great comment.
3:48
What they did, was basically summarise my video in two sentences.
3:52
So, this is what I want to try to do more of
3:55
in filling out these branches:
3:56
take questions, make new content,
3:58
and have this feed-back loop and see what we can do.
4:03
Now what I would really love,
4:05
is for you to ask questions below this video
4:08
which arise after watching the entire series.
4:12
Not specific details about certain video's,
4:14
- those can go with the videos -
4:16
but new questions, which are opening new can of worms.
4:19
And what I think will be fun to do, is:
4:22
Your question will lead to answers,
4:26
by both me and the rest of the community,
4:30
so we'll have multiple answers.
4:32
And what I can do is take this body of answers,
4:35
and out of this draft up a rough script
4:40
for more advanced videos on specific topics
4:43
that sub-sets of the community care about
4:47
So hopefully, out of the discussion below,
4:49
over time we can grow a bunch of new videos!
4:53
I want to be clear: this is an ongoing process.
4:56
This will not happen tomorrow or next week.
4:59
I hope it can happen months, even years from now.
5:02
We can still be building out new videos after the series
5:05
and these videos can be a collaborative effort
5:08
between myself and the community
5:10
and perhaps other video creators down the road.
5:13
So, let me know what you think below,
5:15
and let's get started!","He has a books where he utilizes cryptography a lot, including one called the Cryptonomicon even
I wanted to point that out becuase he explores futuristic use of cryptography, mostly in computers, and i am very interested in how cryptography is used in computers and computer code, as well as different military cryptographies

khan_video_AA6RfgP-AHU_18,Math,ESSAY,"•
0:00
In this video we're going to get introduced to the
0:03
Pythagorean theorem, which is fun on its own.
0:14
But you'll see as you learn more and more mathematics it's
0:16
one of those cornerstone theorems of really all of math.
0:21
It's useful in geometry, it's kind of the backbone
0:24
of trigonometry.
0:26
You're also going to use it to calculate distances
0:29
between points.
0:30
So it's a good thing to really make sure we know well.
0:33
So enough talk on my end.
0:35
Let me tell you what the Pythagorean theorem is.
0:38
So if we have a triangle, and the triangle has to be a right
0:43
triangle, which means that one of the three angles in the
0:49
triangle have to be 90 degrees.
0:51
And you specify that it's 90 degrees by drawing that
0:54
little box right there.
0:55
So that right there is-- let me do this in a different
0:58
color-- a 90 degree angle.
1:05
Or, we could call it a right angle.
1:09
And a triangle that has a right angle in it is
1:13
called a right triangle.
1:15
So this is called a right triangle.
1:21
Now, with the Pythagorean theorem, if we know two sides
1:25
of a right triangle we can always figure out
1:28
the third side.
1:30
And before I show you how to do that, let me give you one
1:34
more piece of terminology.
1:36
The longest side of a right triangle is the side opposite
1:43
the 90 degree angle-- or opposite the right angle.
1:46
So in this case it is this side right here.
1:49
This is the longest side.
1:51
And the way to figure out where that right triangle is, and
1:55
kind of it opens into that longest side.
1:58
That longest side is called the hypotenuse.
2:03
And it's good to know, because we'll keep referring to it.
2:05
And just so we always are good at identifying the hypotenuse,
2:09
let me draw a couple of more right triangles.
2:12
So let's say I have a triangle that looks like that.
2:17
Let me draw it a little bit nicer.
2:19
So let's say I have a triangle that looks like that.
2:22
And I were to tell you that this angle right
2:24
here is 90 degrees.
2:25
In this situation this is the hypotenuse, because it is
2:29
opposite the 90 degree angle.
2:33
It is the longest side.
2:34
Let me do one more, just so that we're good at
2:36
recognizing the hypotenuse.
2:39
So let's say that that is my triangle, and this is the 90
2:44
degree angle right there.
2:45
And I think you know how to do this already.
2:47
You go right what it opens into.
2:49
That is the hypotenuse.
2:51
That is the longest side.
2:57
So once you have identified the hypotenuse-- and let's say
3:00
that that has length C.
3:02
And now we're going to learn what the Pythagorean
3:03
theorem tells us.
3:05
So let's say that C is equal to the length of the hypotenuse.
3:08
So let's call this C-- that side is C.
3:11
Let's call this side right over here A.
3:17
And let's call this side over here B.
3:21
So the Pythagorean theorem tells us that A squared-- so
3:28
the length of one of the shorter sides squared-- plus
3:32
the length of the other shorter side squared is going to
3:36
be equal to the length of the hypotenuse squared.
3:41
Now let's do that with an actual problem, and you'll see
3:43
that it's actually not so bad.
3:45
So let's say that I have a triangle that looks like this.
3:49
Let me draw it.
3:51
Let's say this is my triangle.
3:54
It looks something like this.
3:57
And let's say that they tell us that this is the right angle.
4:00
That this length right here-- let me do this in different
4:02
colors-- this length right here is 3, and that this
4:06
length right here is 4.
4:09
And they want us to figure out that length right there.
4:14
Now the first thing you want to do, before you even apply the
4:17
Pythagorean theorem, is to make sure you have your
4:19
hypotenuse straight.
4:20
You make sure you know what you're solving for.
4:23
And in this circumstance we're solving for the hypotenuse.
4:26
And we know that because this side over here, it is the side
4:30
opposite the right angle.
4:33
If we look at the Pythagorean theorem, this is C.
4:36
This is the longest side.
4:38
So now we're ready to apply the Pythagorean theorem.
4:41
It tells us that 4 squared-- one of the shorter sides-- plus
4:48
3 squared-- the square of another of the shorter sides--
4:53
is going to be equal to this longer side squared-- the
4:56
hypotenuse squared-- is going to be equal to C squared.
5:00
And then you just solve for C.
5:02
So 4 squared is the same thing as 4 times 4.
5:06
That is 16.
5:08
And 3 squared is the same thing as 3 times 3.
5:11
So that is 9.
5:13
And that is going to be equal to C squared.
5:18
Now what is 16 plus 9?
5:20
It's 25.
5:22
So 25 is equal to C squared.
5:25
And we could take the positive square root of both sides.
5:29
I guess, just if you look at it mathematically, it could
5:30
be negative 5 as well.
5:33
But we're dealing with distances, so we only care
5:34
about the positive roots.
5:37
So you take the principal root of both sides and
5:41
you get 5 is equal to C.
5:44
Or, the length of the longest side is equal to 5.
5:50
Now, you can use the Pythagorean theorem, if we give
5:52
you two of the sides, to figure out the third side no matter
5:54
what the third side is.
5:55
So let's do another one right over here.
5:59
Let's say that our triangle looks like this.
6:10
And that is our right angle.
6:12
Let's say this side over here has length 12, and let's say
6:17
that this side over here has length 6.
6:21
And we want to figure out this length right over there.
6:27
Now, like I said, the first thing you want to do is
6:29
identify the hypotenuse.
6:31
And that's going to be the side opposite the right angle.
6:34
We have the right angle here.
6:35
You go opposite the right angle.
6:37
The longest side, the hypotenuse, is right there.
6:41
So if we think about the Pythagorean theorem-- that A
6:46
squared plus B squared is equal to C squared-- 12
6:50
you could view as C.
6:52
This is the hypotenuse.
6:54
The C squared is the hypotenuse squared.
6:56
So you could say 12 is equal to C.
6:59
And then we could say that these sides, it doesn't matter
7:00
whether you call one of them A or one of them B.
7:02
So let's just call this side right here.
7:04
Let's say A is equal to 6.
7:06
And then we say B-- this colored B-- is equal
7:11
to question mark.
7:12
And now we can apply the Pythagorean theorem.
7:15
A squared, which is 6 squared, plus the unknown B squared is
7:25
equal to the hypotenuse squared-- is equal
7:28
to C squared.
7:29
Is equal to 12 squared.
7:33
And now we can solve for B.
7:35
And notice the difference here.
7:36
Now we're not solving for the hypotenuse.
7:38
We're solving for one of the shorter sides.
7:40
In the last example we solved for the hypotenuse.
7:42
We solved for C.
7:43
So that's why it's always important to recognize that A
7:46
squared plus B squared plus C squared, C is the length
7:49
of the hypotenuse.
7:49
So let's just solve for B here.
7:51
So we get 6 squared is 36, plus B squared, is equal
7:59
to 12 squared-- this 12 times 12-- is 144.
8:04
Now we can subtract 36 from both sides of this equation.
8:11
Those cancel out.
8:13
On the left-hand side we're left with just a B squared
8:17
is equal to-- now 144 minus 36 is what?
8:23
144 minus 30 is 114.
8:27
And then you subtract 6, is 108.
8:30
So this is going to be 108.
8:33
So that's what B squared is, and now we want to take the
8:36
principal root, or the positive root, of both sides.
8:40
And you get B is equal to the square root, the
8:44
principal root, of 108.
8:48
Now let's see if we can simplify this a little bit.
8:50
The square root of 108.
8:53
And what we could do is we could take the prime
8:54
factorization of 108 and see how we can
8:56
simplify this radical.
8:58
So 108 is the same thing as 2 times 54, which is the same
9:07
thing as 2 times 27, which is the same thing as 3 times 9.
9:15
So we have the square root of 108 is the same thing as the
9:19
square root of 2 times 2 times-- well actually,
9:24
I'm not done.
9:25
9 can be factorized into 3 times 3.
9:28
So it's 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 times 3.
9:34
And so, we have a couple of perfect squares in here.
9:36
Let me rewrite it a little bit neater.
9:38
And this is all an exercise in simplifying radicals that you
9:41
will bump into a lot while doing the Pythagorean theorem,
9:44
so it doesn't hurt to do it right here.
9:46
So this is the same thing as the square root of 2 times 2
9:55
times 3 times 3 times the square root of that last
10:00
3 right over there.
10:02
And this is the same thing.
10:04
And, you know, you wouldn't have to do all of
10:05
this on paper.
10:07
You could do it in your head.
10:08
What is this?
10:09
2 times 2 is 4.
10:11
4 times 9, this is 36.
10:14
So this is the square root of 36 times the square root of 3.
10:18
The principal root of 36 is 6.
10:20
So this simplifies to 6 square roots of 3.
10:25
So the length of B, you could write it as the square root of
10:28
108, or you could say it's equal to 6 times the
10:34
square root of 3.
10:35
This is 12, this is 6.
10:37
And the square root of 3, well this is going to be a 1
10:40
point something something.
10:41
So it's going to be a little bit larger than 6.","Is 3,4,5 and its multiples the only numbers that make the Pythagorean Theorem work?"

We now know a little bit about inflation and deflation.
0:03
And now I want to introduce you to hyperinflation.
0:07
And as the word implies, it's inflation gone wild.
0:13
How hyperinflation, or at least the cases
0:15
that we've seen in modern times, how they've happened is you
0:18
have some type of a government just going wild
0:21
with the printing press.
0:22
They're just printing a ton of money.
0:24
So the general cycle is they print money,
0:30
they print like mad, usually because they
0:34
don't have any other way of getting revenue.
0:37
They print like mad.
0:39
That leads to prices going up.
0:44
And then because prices go up, they
0:46
have to print more in order for them
0:48
to be able to get the same goods and services
0:50
or pay the government workers what they wanted
0:52
to pay the government workers, or pay the soldiers what
0:55
they wanted to pay the soldiers.
0:57
This by itself would probably drive the hyperinflation
1:00
in and of itself.
1:02
But on top of this, we're used to thinking high inflation is
1:06
5% or 10%, but you could imagine what
1:09
happens when inflation is 5% or 10% per hour.
1:12
Because then there's no incentive
1:14
to be actually holding currency.
1:16
Every second that you hold currency it
1:18
becomes worth less and less and less.
1:21
And so what happens in a scenario like this is people
1:23
want to hoard hard assets.
1:25
So if the price of bread is going up by the minute
1:28
or by the hour, or the price of shoes
1:30
are going up by the minute or by the hour,
1:33
the increase in prices is going to make people hoard things.
1:40
Hoarding goes through the roof.
1:43
And you can imagine if hoarding goes through the roof,
1:45
if the shoe seller doesn't want to sell his shoes anymore,
1:48
or he wants the hold them a little bit longer,
1:50
then the supply of shoes are going to go down,
1:52
and the prices are going to go up even higher.
1:54
So hoarding leads even to higher prices.
1:58
When people go to the bread market,
1:59
and there's five loaves of bread, they buy all of them.
2:02
And then the next person can't buy any
2:03
because they know that the price of bread
2:04
is going through the roof.
2:06
So it just keeps getting worse and worse.
2:09
And it's all started by the government just
2:11
going nuts with the printing press.
2:14
Now, the three most famous examples
2:17
of this happening-- probably the most famous one
2:19
is what happened in Weimar Germany
2:22
after World War I. They had huge reparations to pay.
2:26
That's what the Weimar government
2:28
would have argued was their main cause.
2:30
But they just printed money like crazy.
2:32
Some people said that they were almost
2:34
trying to destroy the economy so that they wouldn't have
2:36
to pay reparations for what they did in World War I.
2:40
But this just gives you a sense of how crazy it was.
2:43
Here's the end of World War I. And they just
2:46
printed money like mad.
2:50
And isn't the rate of inflation.
2:52
This is how much it was relative to a gold mark.
2:56
So this is one gold mark over here.
2:58
So only after about 2 and a half years it was over tenfold.
3:02
And this is a logarithmic scale.
3:04
Each slash year, this is a factor of 10.
3:07
So after by the end of 1923, you're
3:09
looking at-- This is what?
3:10
Not 100,000, not a million, not a billion.
3:15
This is a trillion.
3:16
It had gone up a trillion fold in the span of one, two, three,
3:20
four, five, six years.
3:23
The other famous examples of this,
3:26
Zimbabwe from 1980 until 2009.
3:29
Once again, printing money like mad.
3:31
And some of their productive capacity went away.
3:34
This right here is a 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollar.
3:39
And this shows you the Zimbabwean dollar
3:43
relative to the US dollar.
3:44
And once again, is a logarithmic scale.
3:46
This is 10 to the 30th power.
3:48
And then the largest or the most extreme hyperinflation
3:52
ever was Hungary after World War II.
3:55
And this right here is a 10 million
3:57
pengo note, just to give you an idea of what people
3:59
were carrying around in their pockets.","So in the case of hyperinflation, it is reasonable to predict that an economy would regress back to bartering?"

We're first exposed to the idea of a slope of a line early on
0:05
in our algebra careers, but I figure it never hurts
0:07
to review it a bit.
0:08
So let me draw some axes.
0:10
That is my y-axis.
0:12
Maybe I should call it my f of x-axis.
0:15
y is equal to f of x.
0:17
Let me draw my x-axis, just like that, that is my x-axis.
0:23
And let me draw a line, let me draw a line like this.
0:28
And what we want to do is remind ourselves, how do we
0:31
find the slope of that line?
0:36
And what we do is, we take two points on the line,
0:42
so let's say we take this point, right here.
0:45
Let's say that that is the point x is equal to a.
0:48
And then what would this be?
0:49
This would be the point f of a, where the function is
0:53
going to be some line.
0:54
We could write f of x is going to be equal to mx plus b.
0:59
We don't know what m and b are, but this is all
1:01
a little bit of review.
1:02
So this is a.
1:04
And then the y-value is what happens to the function when
1:06
you evaluated it at a, so that's that point right there.
1:09
And then we could take another point on this line.
1:11
Let's say we take point b, right there.
1:14
And then this coordinate up here is going to be
1:17
the point b, f of b.
1:22
Right?
1:22
Because this is just the point when you evaluate
1:23
the function at b.
1:24
You put b in here, you're going to get that point right there.
1:27
So let me just draw a little line right there.
1:29
So that is f of b, right there.
1:32
Actually, let me make it clear that this coordinate right
1:35
is the point a, f of a.
1:38
So how do we find the slope between these 2 points, or more
1:42
generally, of this entire line?
1:43
Because whole the slope is consistent the
1:46
whole way through it.
1:48
And we know that once we find the slope, that's
1:50
actually going to be the value of this m.
1:51
That's all a review of your algebra, but how do we do it?
1:54
Well, a couple of ways to think about it.
1:56
Slope is equal to rise over run.
2:05
You might have seen that when you first learned algebra.
2:07
Or another way of writing it, it's change in
2:09
y over change in x.
2:13
So let's figure out what the change in why over the change
2:16
in x is for this particular case.
2:18
So the change in y is equal to what?
2:22
Well, let's just take, you can take this guy as being the
2:25
first point, or that guy as being the first point.
2:26
But since this guy has a larger x and a larger y,
2:29
let's start with him.
2:30
The change in y between that guy and that guy is this
2:33
distance, right here.
2:35
So let me draw a little triangle.
2:36
That distance right there is a change in y.
2:39
Or I could just transfer it to the y-axis.
2:42
This is the change in y.
2:44
That is your change in y, that distance.
2:46
So what is that distance?
2:47
It's f of b minus f of a.
2:51
So it equals f of b minus f of a.
2:57
That is your change in y.
3:01
Now what is your change in x The slope is change
3:05
in y over change in x.
3:09
So what our change in x?
3:10
What's this distance?
3:11
Remember, we're taking this to be the first point,
3:13
so we took its y minus the other point's y.
3:16
So to be consistent, we're going to have to take this
3:17
point x minus this point x.
3:20
So this point's x-coordinate is b.
3:23
So it's going to be b minus a.
3:29
And just like that, if you knew the equation of this line, or
3:31
if you had the coordinates of these 2 points, you would just
3:34
plug them in right here and you would get your slope.
3:39
That straightforward.
3:40
And that comes straight out of your Algebra 1 class.
3:43
And let me just, just to make sure it's concrete for you, if
3:46
this was the point 2, 3, and let's say that this, up here,
3:55
was the point 5, 7, then if we wanted to find the slope of
4:00
this line, we would do 7 minus 3, that would be our change in
4:06
y, this would be 7 and this would be 3, and then we
4:10
do that over 5 minus 2.
4:14
Because this would be a 5, and this would be a 2, and so this
4:18
would be your change in x.
4:19
5 minus 2.
4:20
So 7 minus 3 is 4, and 5 minus 2 is 3. so your
4:24
slope would be 4/3.
4:30
Now let's see if we can generalize this.
4:33
And this is what the new concept that we're going
4:35
to be learning as we delve into calculus.
4:38
Let's see if we can generalize this somehow to a curve.
4:41
So let's say I have a curve.
4:44
We have to have a curve before we can generalize
4:46
it to a curve.
4:47
Let me scroll down a little.
4:47
Well, actually, I want to leave this up here, show
4:49
you the similarity.
4:51
Let's say I have, I'll keep it pretty general right now.
4:56
Let's say I have a curve.
4:58
I'll make it a familiar-looking curve.
5:01
Let's say it's the curve y is equal to x squared, which
5:03
looks something like that.
5:06
And I want to find the slope.
5:10
Let's say I want to find the slope at some point.
5:13
And actually, before even talking about it, let's even
5:15
think about what it means to find the slope of a curve.
5:18
Here, the slope was the same the whole time, right?
5:22
But on a curve your slope is changing.
5:24
And just to get an intuition for that means, is, what's
5:27
the slope over here?
5:28
Your slope over here is the slope of the tangent line.
5:31
The line just barely touches it.
5:33
That's the slope over there.
5:34
It's a negative slope.
5:35
Then over here, your slope is still negative, but it's a
5:37
little bit less negative.
5:39
It goes like that.
5:40
I don't know if I did that, drew that.
5:41
Let me do it in a different color.
5:43
Let me do it in purple.
5:45
So over here, your slope is slightly less negative.
5:48
It's a slightly less downward-sloping line.
5:51
And then when you go over here, at the 0 point, right here,
5:56
your slope is pretty much flat, because the horizontal line, y
6:00
equals 0, is tangent to this curve.
6:02
And then as you go to more positive x's, then your
6:05
slope starts increasing.
6:08
I'm trying to draw a tangent line.
6:10
And here it's increasing even more, it's increased even more.
6:14
So your slope is changing the entire time, and this is kind
6:17
of the big change that happens when you go from a
6:19
line to a curve.
6:21
A line, your slope is the same the entire time.
6:24
You could take any two points of a line, take the change in y
6:27
over the change in x, and you get the slope for
6:29
the entire line.
6:30
But as you can see already, it's going to be a little
6:32
bit more nuanced when we do it for a curve.
6:35
Because it depends what point we're talking about.
6:37
We can't just say, what is the slope for this curve?
6:40
The slope is different at every point along the curve.
6:43
It changes.
6:44
If we go up here, it's going to be even steeper.
6:46
It's going to look something like that.
6:50
So let's try a bit of an experiment.
6:54
And I know how this experiment turns out, so it won't
6:57
be too much of a risk.
6:59
Let me draw better than that.
7:02
So that is my y-axis, and that's my x-axis.
7:11
Let's call this, we can call this y, or we can call
7:13
this the f of x axis.
7:15
Either way.
7:16
And let me draw my curve again.
7:20
And I'll just draw it in the positive coordinate, like that.
7:24
That's my curve.
7:26
And what if I want to find the slope right there?
7:33
What can I do?
7:34
Well, based on our definition of a slope, we need 2 points
7:38
to find a slope, right?
7:39
Here, I don't know how to find the slope with 1 point.
7:41
So let's just call this point right here,
7:49
that's going to be x.
7:50
We're going to be general.
7:51
This is going to be our point x.
7:53
But to find our slope, according to our traditional
7:55
algebra 1 definition of a slope, we need 2 points.
7:58
So let's get another point in here.
8:02
Let's just take a slightly larger version of this x.
8:05
So let's say, we want to take, actually, let's do it even
8:10
further out, just because it's going to get messy otherwise.
8:13
So let's say we have this point right here.
8:15
And the difference, it's just h bigger than x.
8:18
Or actually, instead of saying h bigger, let's just, well
8:20
let me just say h bigger.
8:22
So this is x plus h.
8:25
That's what that point is right there.
8:27
So what going to be their corresponding y-coordinates
8:30
on the curve?
8:31
Well, this is the curve of y is equal to f of x.
8:35
So this point right here is going to be f of our
8:39
particular x right here.
8:41
And maybe to show you that I'm taking a particular x, maybe
8:43
I'll do a little 0 here.
8:45
This is x naught, this is x naught plus h.
8:48
This is f of x naught.
8:51
And then what is this going to be up here, this point up
8:56
here, that point up here?
8:59
Its y-coordinate is going to be f of f of this x-coordinate,
9:04
which I shifted over a little bit.
9:05
It's right there. f of this x-coordinate, which is
9:08
f of x naught plus h.
9:10
That's its y-coordinate.
9:12
So what is a slope going to be between these two points that
9:15
are relatively close to each other?
9:17
Remember, this isn't going to be the slope
9:18
just at this point.
9:20
This is the slope of the line between these two points.
9:23
And if I were to actually draw it out, it would actually be a
9:27
secant line between, to the curve.
9:29
So it would intersect the curve twice, once at this point,
9:31
once at this point.
9:32
You can't see it.
9:34
If I blew it up a little bit, it would look
9:35
something like this.
9:41
This is our coordinate x naught f of x naught, and up here
9:47
is our coordinate for this point, which would be, the
9:51
x-coordinate would be x naught plus h, and the y-coordinate
9:56
would be f of x naught plus h.
9:59
Just whatever this function is, we're evaluating it at this
10:02
x-coordinate That's all it is.
10:03
So these are the 2 points.
10:05
So maybe a good start is to just say, hey, what is the
10:07
slope of this secant line?
10:10
And just like we did in the previous example, you find the
10:12
change in y, and you divide that by your change in x.
10:22
Let me draw it here.
10:23
Your change in y would be that right here, change in y, and
10:26
then your change in x would be that right there.
10:29
So what is the slope going to be of the secant line?
10:33
The slope is going to be equal to, let's start with this
10:37
point up here, just because it seems to be larger.
10:39
So we want a change in y. so this value right here, this
10:43
y-value, is f of x naught plus h.
10:46
I just evaluated this guy up here.
10:47
Looks like a fancy term, but all it means is, look.
10:49
The slightly larger x evaluate its y-coordinate.
10:52
Where the curve is at that value of x.
10:57
So that is going to be, so the change in y is going to be
11:00
a f of x naught plus h.
11:03
That's just the y-coordinate up here.
11:05
Minus this y-coordinate over here.
11:08
So minus f of x naught.
11:13
So that equals our change in y.
11:16
And you want to divide that by your change in x.
11:21
So what is this?
11:21
This is the larger x-value.
11:23
We started with this coordinate, so we start
11:25
with its x-coordinate.
11:26
So it's x naught plus h, x naught plus h.
11:30
Minus this x-coordinate.
11:32
Well, we just picked a general number.
11:33
It's x naught.
11:36
So that is over your change in x.
11:39
Just like that.
11:39
So this is the slope of the secant line.
11:41
We still haven't answered what the slope is right at that
11:43
point, but maybe this will help us get there.
11:47
If we simplify this, so let me write it down like this.
11:51
The slope of the secant, let me write that properly.
11:57
The slope of the secant line is equal to the value of the
12:03
function at this point, f of x naught plus h, minus the value
12:08
of the function here, mine f of x naught.
12:12
So that just tells us the change in y.
12:14
It's the exact same definition of slope we've always used.
12:18
Over the change in x.
12:19
And we can simplify this.
12:20
We have x naught plus h minus x naught.
12:23
So x naught minus x naught cancel out, so you
12:26
have that over h.
12:27
So this is equal to our change in y over change in x.
12:32
Fair enough.
12:33
But I started off saying, I want to find the slope of
12:36
the line at that point, at this point, right here.
12:38
This is the zoomed-out version of it.
12:40
So what can I do?
12:42
Well, I defined second point here as just the first
12:45
point plus some h.
12:49
And we have something in our toolkit called a limit.
12:52
This h is just a general number.
12:55
It could be 10, it could be 2, it could be 0.02, it could be 1
12:59
times 10 to the negative 100.
13:01
It could be an arbitrarily small number.
13:03
So what happens, what would happen, at least theoretically,
13:07
if I were take the limit as h approaches 0?
13:09
So, you know, first, maybe h is this fairly large number over
13:13
here, and then if I take h a little bit smaller, then I'd be
13:15
finding the slope of this secant line.
13:17
If I took h to be even a little bit smaller, I'd be finding the
13:20
slope of that secant line.
13:21
If h is a little bit smaller, I'd be finding
13:23
the slope of that line.
13:24
So as h approaches 0, I'll be getting closer and closer to
13:28
finding the slope of the line right at my point in question.
13:34
Obviously, if h is a large number, my secant line is going
13:36
to be way off from the slope at exactly that point right there.
13:41
But if h is 0.0000001, if it's an infinitesimally small
13:45
number, then I'm going to get pretty close.
13:47
So what happens if I take the limit as h
13:51
approaches zero of this?
13:53
So the limit as h approaches 0 of my secant slope.
14:00
Of, let me switch to green.
14:03
f of x naught plus h minus f of x naught, that was my change in
14:08
y, over h, which is my change in x.
14:15
And now just to clarify something, and sometimes you'll
14:17
see it in different calculus books, sometimes instead of an
14:20
h, they'll write a delta x here.
14:22
Where this second point would have been defined as x naught
14:25
plus delta x, and then, this would have simplified to just
14:28
delta x over there, and we'd be taking the limit as
14:30
delta x approaches 0.
14:31
The exact same thing.
14:33
h, delta x, doesn't matter.
14:34
We're taking h as the difference between one x point
14:37
and then the higher x point, and then we're just going to
14:39
take the limit as that approaches zero.
14:40
We could have called that delta x just as easily.
14:44
But I'm going to call this thing, which equals the slope
14:52
of the tangent line, and it does equal the slope of the
14:54
tangent line, I'm going to call this the derivative of f.
14:58
Let me write that down.
15:05
And I'm going to say that this is equal to f prime of x.
15:10
And this is going to be another function.
15:12
Because remember, the slope changes at every x-value.
15:16
No matter what x-value you pick, the slope is
15:18
going to be different.
15:19
Doesn't have to be, but the way I drew this curve,
15:20
it is different.
15:21
It can be different.
15:22
So now, you give me an x-value in here, I'll apply this
15:27
formula over here, and then I can tell you the
15:30
slope at that point.
15:31
And it all seems very confusing and maybe
15:34
abstract at this point.
15:35
In the next video, I'll actually do an example of
15:38
calculating a slope, and it'll make it everything a
15:40
little bit more concrete.","What is the relationship between the slope of a curve, tangent(line) to a curve, and the derivative?"

we're at the National Museum for African art and we're looking at a mask made by
0:09
the Chokwe people in the democratic Republic of Congo and this mask would
0:13
have been dance by a male dancer
0:16
even though we're looking at a mask that represents an ideal woman the masker
0:20
who's a man and the carver who's a man would have made this to honor women
0:26
particularly women who were young and fertile and had successfully given birth
0:30
because there was an honor in Chokwe society given to those women and this is
0:35
also a culture that is matrilineal that is the family line is passed down
0:39
through the mother and one of the reasons to dances mask was not only to
0:43
honor women who were at this stage in life but also to recognize the founding
0:48
female ancestor of the Chokwe lineage it's made of wood that's very thin and
0:53
difficult to carve receive fiber and this elaborate hairstyle we have to
0:59
imagine the rest of the costume that would have been here when the mask was
1:03
dance and this would have been a tight-fitted bodystocking covered in
1:08
raffia cloth the dancers groin area would be covered in a loincloth and he'd
1:12
be wearing wooden breasts and we're using the word dance but from the descriptions
1:19
the dancer walked in a very graceful and stately way and Chokwe women actually
1:24
do dance like that that's very graceful and fluid and slow and respectful and
1:30
when we say he's wearing a woman's face and he's wearing women's breasts he's
1:34
not impersonating a woman he's really not to honor women who have courageously
1:40
gone through childbirth and retain this inner wisdom and beauty so beautifully
1:45
articulated in the facial features and we see that sense of calm in the face
1:49
and the fact that her eyes are closed her mouth is closed suggest is turning
1:55
inward she's not talking
1:57
she doesn't need to talk at this point in life she deserves respect and she
2:01
doesn't have to open her eyes wide she's already knowing the mask itself is a
2:06
deep dark red which is probably created through a mixture of
2:10
red earth and oil but there's white kalyan or white powder around her eyes
2:16
and this whiteness is connected to the spiritual realm in fact her eyes are the
2:21
most important part of the face their abstractly big and it draws attention to
2:26
the fact that she has the spiritual ability almost of second sight that her
2:30
power comes from being able to give birth
2:34
the face is very symmetrical the kin comes to have narrower . the broadest
2:41
part of the faces by the eyes and ears this wide forehead that is accentuated
2:47
by the hairstyle and we have these constant circles that are bisected by
2:52
the lines of the mouth of the eyes and then we also have the circle of the
2:56
earring in the ear with this mass was obviously really lo ved in fact we can
3:01
see a repair on one side of the face so that they could continue to use it
3:06
we also have pounded dots around the eyes which further emphasizes their
3:12
cynical nature but also suggests women's tattoo patterns women wore a whole host
3:17
of different tattoo designs that had special references in special meaning to
3:23
the trackway people were little known until the earlier part of the 20th
3:26
century by Europeans Europeans in particular Portuguese didn't begin
3:30
trading with the Chokwe until the early nineteen hundreds and so they weren't
3:35
documented and such in the way that other groups were however the chalk way
3:39
had been part of a larger kingdom from which they broke away they had trading
3:43
relations with many groups throughout Africa and so they certainly didn't
3:48
exist in isolation and there are about a million today in the democratic republic
3:52
of congo and as this mask shows us the ideal woman and ideal virtues her
3:59
hairstyle would have been fashionable at the time so they could really see
4:03
themselves in the mask when it was being performed for them so this is an ideal
4:07
of womanhood in so many ways","In this society, do women only gain wisdom (symbolized in the eyes in mouth) after giving birth?"

Let's talk about a concept that probably
0:03
confuses chemistry students the most on some level.
0:06
But on some level it's also one of the simplest concepts.
0:09
And that's the idea of a mole,
0:12
which in chemistry is different
0:13
that the thing digging up your backyard,
0:15
or the thing you want to get removed from your left eye.
0:19
A mole in chemistry is just a number.
0:21
It's just a number,
0:23
and the number is 6.02 times 10 to the 23.
0:28
So it's a very huge number.
0:29
And this is also called Avogadro's number.
0:31
Maybe I will do a video on Avogadro.
0:35
Avogadro's number
0:39
But that's all you need to know.
0:41
A mole is just a number.
0:43
There are kind of more Byzantine definitions of a mole.
0:47
This actually is not
0:49
-- actually, let me copy and paste it from Wikipedia.
0:51
This is Wikipedia's definition of a mole.
0:55
And you hopefully at the end of this video
0:58
you'll see that they're equivalent.
0:59
But if you're just getting exposed to the concept,
1:01
this to me, it's just not an easy concept.
1:07
Basically, ""a mole is defined as the amount of substance
1:10
of a system that contains as many elemental entities
1:16
as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon 12.""
1:19
Well, I just told you that a mole is 6.02 times 10 to the 23.
1:24
So if you just take the last part,
1:26
atoms in 12 grams of carbon 12.
1:30
So that means that there are 1 mole of carbon 12
1:39
-- let me write it like that -- carbon 12.
1:42
There are 1 mole of carbon 12 atoms in 12 grams of carbon.
1:57
And so that's why a mole is useful.
1:59
So I could have just instead of writing 1 mole,
2:02
I could have replaced this as there's 6.02 times 10
2:06
to the 23 carbon atoms, carbon 12 atoms in 12 grams of carbon.
2:12
How do you figure that out?
2:13
Or I guess, what else does this mean?
2:15
I mean, we just added in carbon,
2:17
they said it's the amount of substance of any molecule,
2:19
if you convert between atomic mass units and grams.
2:22
This I find very confusing.
2:24
How can we apply this in other places?
2:26
So the first thing to realize is a mole is just a way
2:29
of translating between grams and atomic mass units.
2:32
One carbon 12 atom is what?
2:35
What's its mass number?
2:37
It's 12.
2:39
That's why it's called carbon 12 instead of carbon 14.
2:41
So its mass is 12 atomic mass units.
2:46
So if you have something that has a mass of 12 atomic mass units
2:50
and you have a mole of them,
2:52
or you have 6.02 times 10 to the 23 of them,
2:55
all of those atoms combined will have a mass of 12 grams.
3:01
So another way to think about it is
3:04
1 gram is equal to 1 mole of atomic mass units.
3:13
I'll write amu's like that.
3:16
Or you can write 1 gram is equal to 6.02
3:22
times 10 to the 23 atomic mass units.
3:26
And the reason why this is useful
3:28
-- and it's kind of addressed in this Wikipedia definition there
3:30
-- is it helps us translate between the atomic world
3:33
-- where we deal with atomic mass units and we deal with,
3:36
oh, we've got an extra neutron now,
3:37
let's add one to our atomic mass number
3:41
-- and translating between that atomic world
3:43
and our everyday world where we deal in grams.
3:45
And just so you know, a gram is still
3:47
a pretty small amount of mass.
3:50
It's 1/1,000 of a kilogram.
3:52
A kilogram is about 2 pounds.
3:54
So this is about 1/500 of a pound.
3:56
So this is not much.
3:58
So there's a ton of atoms in a very small amount of
4:02
-- in 1 gram of carbon, or at least in 12 grams of carbon,
4:06
you have a ton of atoms. You have 6.02 times 10 to the 23.
4:10
And just to hit the point home,
4:12
I probably should have talked about this in the atom.
4:13
This is a huge number.
4:15
To maybe visualize it, if you think of -- I was told that
4:22
in the diameter of a hair, if this is a hair
4:25
and this is diameter of the hair,
4:27
if you go this way there 1 million carbon atoms.
4:32
1 million carbon atoms that way.
4:35
Or if you were to take an apple
4:41
and you were to try to figure out what fraction,
4:45
if you were to make one of the atoms of an apple
4:48
-- and obviously,
4:50
an apple has a bunch of different types of atoms in it
4:52
-- but if you were to take one of the atoms
4:53
and make it the size of the apple,
4:55
then the apple would be the size of the earth.
4:58
So an apple atom is to an apple
5:00
as an apple is to the earth.
5:03
So these are obviously-- it's hard for us
5:06
to even process things of this size.
5:08
When you just have one gram of
5:12
-- well, let's say you have 1 gram of hydrogen.
5:14
1 gram of hydrogen. 1 gram of hydrogen.
5:22
If you have 1 gram of hydrogen,
5:24
that means you have 1 mole of hydrogen.
5:29
How do I know that?
5:31
Because hydrogen's atomic mass number is 1.
5:34
So in general, if you just take any element
5:39
-- so what is the mass of,
5:41
let me just pick, 1 mole of aluminum?
5:45
So if I were to take 6.02 times 10 to the 23 aluminum atoms,
5:54
what is the mass of that collection?
5:56
Well, each of them have an atomic mass number of 13.
6:00
So it's 13 amu's-- I don't have to put the s there
6:08
-- times six point
6:11
-- well, I won't write that way, actually.
6:14
That'll probably just confuse you.
6:15
The easy way to think about is if you have a mole of an atom,
6:18
you take its mass-- I was taking its atomic number,
6:21
that's not good-- you take its mass number.
6:23
In this case let's say it's 27.
6:26
So we're dealing with aluminum 27.
6:30
You take its mass number, and if you have 1 mole of it,
6:34
then the mass of that will be 27 grams.
6:41
So that literally, when you have one mole of an atom
6:44
it's a direct translation between its mass number and grams.
6:48
1 mole of iron, let's say iron 56--
6:53
there's obviously many isotopes or iron
6:55
-- let's say we're dealing with iron 56.
6:58
You normally don't hear it like that,
6:59
but let's say we're dealing with the isotope of iron
7:02
that has a mass number of 56.
7:04
So if I have 1 mole of this, 1 mole of this atom right here,
7:11
that's going to have a mass of
7:15
-- the math isn't difficult here
7:16
-- 56 grams. Right? And if you think about it,
7:23
how many atomic mass units is this?
7:24
Well, this is 56 atomic mass units per atom.
7:30
Then you have a mole of those, so you have
7:32
6.02 times 10 to the 23 times 56 atomic mass units.
7:37
And then you divide it
7:39
by the number of atomic mass units per gram.
7:41
And you end up with 56 grams.
7:43
But the easy way to think about it is
7:44
you just take whatever the mass number is.
7:46
If you have silicon, if you have a mole of silicon,
7:49
a mole of silicon will have a mass
7:52
-- I don't want to say weight
7:53
because this should apply to any planet
7:54
-- of 28 grams.
7:56
What about 2 moles of silicon? 2 moles of silicon.
8:04
And I'll write its mass number.
8:05
Let's say silicon has a mass number of 28.
8:10
Two moles of silicon.
8:12
Well, 1 more would have a mass of 28 grams,
8:15
so 2 moles is going to have a mass of 56 grams.
8:23
If I were to say, let's say I had 4 moles of oxygen,
8:29
which has a mass number of 16.
8:32
What is the mass of that?
8:34
This is a huge number of oxygen atoms
8:37
-- what would be the mass of that?
8:38
Well, it would be 4 times-- 1 mole of oxygen
8:44
would have a mass of 16 grams,
8:47
so 4 moles has 64 grams.
8:52
It's confusing because we're not used to using a word
8:55
like moles as a number, but all it is, is a number.
8:58
And the easy way to think about is that it lets us
9:00
translate between this atomic mass unit number and grams.
9:06
And you say, well, how do I get that many grams?
9:08
Well, I have to have 6.02 times 10 to the 23 carbon atoms
9:12
for that collection of carbon to have a mass of 12 grams.
9:16
That's all that mole means.
9:18
It's just a number.
9:19
And I encourage you to kind of play around
9:21
with a lot of what we talked about.
9:22
Because it's super important
9:24
to have the intuition behind moles,
9:25
otherwise, you'll get confused later on
9:27
when we start getting into energies
9:29
in terms of it requires kilojoules per mole,
9:31
and what is the energy of this reaction
9:34
and all that type of stuff.
9:35
So just really try to make sure
9:37
you digest this as well as possible.
9:38
And let me know if you don't
9:40
and I'll maybe make another video on this
9:42
because it's so important.",7.2*10^24 molecules of oxygen must react to produce what mass of water?

5:31
Because hydrogen's atomic mass number is 1.
5:34
So in general, if you just take any element
5:39
-- so what is the mass of,
5:41
let me just pick, 1 mole of aluminum?
5:45
So if I were to take 6.02 times 10 to the 23 aluminum atoms,
5:54
what is the mass of that collection?
5:56
Well, each of them have an atomic mass number of 13.
6:00
So it's 13 amu's-- I don't have to put the s there
6:08
-- times six point
6:11
-- well, I won't write that way, actually.
6:14
That'll probably just confuse you.
6:15
The easy way to think about is if you have a mole of an atom,
6:18
you take its mass-- I was taking its atomic number,
6:21
that's not good-- you take its mass number.
6:23
In this case let's say it's 27.
6:26
So we're dealing with aluminum 27.
6:30
You take its mass number, and if you have 1 mole of it,
6:34
then the mass of that will be 27 grams.
6:41
So that literally, when you have one mole of an atom
6:44
it's a direct translation between its mass number and grams.
6:48
1 mole of iron, let's say iron 56--
6:53
there's obviously many isotopes or iron
6:55
-- let's say we're dealing with iron 56.
6:58
You normally don't hear it like that,
6:59
but let's say we're dealing with the isotope of iron
7:02
that has a mass number of 56.
7:04
So if I have 1 mole of this, 1 mole of this atom right here,
7:11
that's going to have a mass of
7:15
-- the math isn't difficult here
7:16
-- 56 grams. Right? And if you think about it,
7:23
how many atomic mass units is this?
7:24
Well, this is 56 atomic mass units per atom.
7:30
Then you have a mole of those, so you have
7:32
6.02 times 10 to the 23 times 56 atomic mass units.
7:37
And then you divide it
7:39
by the number of atomic mass units per gram.
7:41
And you end up with 56 grams.
7:43
But the easy way to think about it is
7:44
you just take whatever the mass number is.
7:46
If you have silicon, if you have a mole of silicon,
7:49
a mole of silicon will have a mass
7:52
-- I don't want to say weight
7:53
because this should apply to any planet
7:54
-- of 28 grams.
7:56
What about 2 moles of silicon? 2 moles of silicon.
8:04
And I'll write its mass number.
8:05
Let's say silicon has a mass number of 28.
8:10
Two moles of silicon.
8:12
Well, 1 more would have a mass of 28 grams,
8:15
so 2 moles is going to have a mass of 56 grams.
8:23
If I were to say, let's say I had 4 moles of oxygen,
8:29
which has a mass number of 16.
8:32
What is the mass of that?
8:34
This is a huge number of oxygen atoms
8:37
-- what would be the mass of that?
8:38
Well, it would be 4 times-- 1 mole of oxygen
8:44
would have a mass of 16 grams,
8:47
so 4 moles has 64 grams.
8:52
It's confusing because we're not used to using a word
8:55
like moles as a number, but all it is, is a number.
8:58
And the easy way to think about is that it lets us
9:00
translate between this atomic mass unit number and grams.
9:06
And you say, well, how do I get that many grams?
9:08
Well, I have to have 6.02 times 10 to the 23 carbon atoms
9:12
for that collection of carbon to have a mass of 12 grams.
9:16
That's all that mole means.
9:18
It's just a number.
9:19
And I encourage you to kind of play around
9:21
with a lot of what we talked about.
9:22
Because it's super important
9:24
to have the intuition behind moles,
9:25
otherwise, you'll get confused later on
9:27
when we start getting into energies
9:29
in terms of it requires kilojoules per mole,
9:31
and what is the energy of this reaction
9:34
and all that type of stuff.
9:35
So just really try to make sure
9:37
you digest this as well as possible.
9:38
And let me know if you don't
9:40
and I'll maybe make another video on this
9:42
because it's so important.",58.45 gr NaCl has 6.02*10^23 ions of sodium and 6.02*10^23 ions chloride but at a whole of 2*6.02*10^23 atoms?

What I've done here is listed a bunch
0:02
of events that might occur in a given period.
0:05
And what I want to think about in this video
0:07
is how, if at all, they might be accounted for in GDP,
0:11
especially in this expenditure view of GDP.
0:13
And I encourage you to pause this video
0:16
and try it out yourself.
0:17
See how, if each of these events happen in the period
0:20
for which we are trying to calculate GDP,
0:23
how would they be accounted for, according to the buckets
0:26
we thought about, the composition of the expenditure
0:28
view of GDP.
0:30
So now I'm assuming that you have unpaused,
0:31
you've tried it yourself, and so let's try to go through it.
0:34
So Khan Academy is a firm.
0:36
It's a not-for-profit firm.
0:37
No one really owns Khan Academy.
0:39
I guess society owns Khan Academy, but it is a firm.
0:43
So Khan Academy employs a software engineer
0:45
and pays them $100,000.
0:47
Well, this is a firm making the expenditure.
0:50
And arguably and even conceptually,
0:52
this also is an investment.
0:53
Because this $100,000 is going to be used to develop code
0:57
that has future benefit.
0:58
So this is going to be the investment category.
1:02
Let me do it in that same color.
1:04
So I, investment, is going to get plus $100,000.
1:11
In general, the spending by firms goes into investment.
1:15
Now, let's look at the second scenario.
1:17
Accenture, which is another firm, and this
1:19
is a for-profit firm, earns $10 million-- or maybe I should say
1:23
gets $10 million in revenue, just
1:28
to be clear what we're talking about-- by building
1:33
a new IT system for California.
1:35
And the important thing to think about, you might say,
1:38
oh, OK, wait, this is OK, Accenture is a firm,
1:40
but California is clearly the government.
1:44
So how do you account for this?
1:46
And it's the expenditure view of GDP.
1:48
So in this situation, California is spending $10 million
1:53
in the period for a new IT system.
1:57
So this is going to be government.
1:59
The government category is going to be increased by $10 million,
2:03
because of this expenditure.
2:06
Now next one.
2:07
My mother sells her house in New Orleans
2:09
to a Swedish woman for $200,000.
2:11
Once again, a house is being sold
2:14
from someone in the country to someone who was foreign,
2:17
what do we do?
2:18
But the important thing to realize
2:20
is that this is not a new house.
2:22
This is a transfer of an existing house.
2:24
Nothing was produced here.
2:26
So this has no contribution to GDP.
2:30
It doesn't matter it's a Swedish woman or anything like that.
2:32
The house existed before.
2:34
It just changed hands.
2:35
A new house did not get produced.
2:37
So nothing happens to GDP here.
2:40
Next one.
2:41
I-- and I'm assuming that I am here,
2:43
sitting here in Mountain View, California,
2:45
American citizen-- I buy a Japanese made
2:47
lawn mower for $200.
2:50
Now this one is interesting.
2:53
Because if you think about it theoretically,
2:55
nothing was produced in the United States,
2:57
so nothing should be added to GDP on a net-net basis.
3:00
And we'll see that that is actually the case.
3:01
But it's going to show up by adding to consumption
3:04
and then taking away from net exports.
3:07
So two things are going to happen here.
3:08
We'll say, OK, Sal is an American consumer.
3:12
If we just look at how much more he spent,
3:14
he spent $200 more, so it's going to be added there.
3:17
But then we're going to take it out of net exports.
3:21
So net exports-- let me do it in that same green color-- net
3:27
exports.
3:28
Everything else is neutral.
3:30
So in this thing right over here,
3:31
there was no foreign purchases.
3:33
But there is me buying a foreign product.
3:36
And let me subtract that out.
3:38
So I'm going to subtract out $200 right over there.
3:41
So net exports will be lower by $200,
3:45
because essentially this was a $200 import.
3:47
And that completely cancels out the $200
3:49
increase in consumption.
3:51
And so this will have zero net effect on GDP.
3:54
These two terms will cancel out.
3:57
Now I buy a new home in California for $500,000.
4:03
Now household spending for the most part
4:05
is considered C, except when you are buying a new home.
4:10
So even though I am not a firm, because I
4:14
am buying a house, a new house, this will go into investment.
4:19
So investment will go up by $500,000.
4:24
And then finally American Airlines buys a new Airbus jet,
4:28
and Airbus jets are made in Europe.
4:30
So what's going to happen here?
4:32
So once again, net-net, nothing was
4:35
produced in the United States.
4:36
So on a net basis, this should not contribute to GDP.
4:40
And we'll see that on net basis, it will break out,
4:42
it will be neutral, but it will be like this situation.
4:46
There's an American firm that made a purchase--
4:48
and actually, I didn't put the amount here.
4:49
So let's say it was $100 million.
4:52
I think that's actually about what a passenger plane might
4:54
actually cost, for $100 million.
4:57
So the way we would account for it,
4:59
investment would go up by $100 million.
5:03
You have an American firm making a purchase, $100 million.
5:08
Conceptually, it makes sense.
5:09
It's going to provide future goods and services,
5:11
going to give transportation to people.
5:13
But it's going to be netted out, because you have a net import.
5:20
So what this is going to do to net exports,
5:23
on this side of it, you're going to have $100 million,
5:25
because this was an import.
5:26
So you're going to have negative $100 million,
5:28
when you think of it from an export point of view.
5:30
And you had no corresponding positive export.
5:34
So you're going to have net exports-- net exports is
5:37
going to go down $100 million.
5:40
This was a net import of $100 million,
5:42
so it makes sense that net exports would go down.
5:44
It would be negative net exports.
5:46
And these two, once again, are going
5:48
to cancel out with each other, so that you
5:50
have no net GDP, which makes sense,
5:53
because this plane was not produced in the United States.",Is there a situation where import is not cancelled by investment or consumption?

Entering into World War I, the British
0:02
had the world's dominant navy.
0:04
And they use it immediately to their advantage.
0:06
You might remember from previous videos,
0:09
Britain declared war on Germany because of their invasion
0:12
into Belgium in early August of 1914.
0:15
And it was in November of 1914 that the British declared
0:23
the entire North Sea area a war zone.
0:31
Which essentially is telling any ship, come here
0:34
at your own risk.
0:34
You might be destroyed, and especially you're
0:36
not allowed to carry any contraband.
0:38
But they included food as a contraband.
0:41
So this essentially began the blockade
0:43
of Germany and Austria-Hungary.
0:45
So this is the blockade of the Central Powers.
0:53
And this had major implications for the war.
0:56
It continued throughout the entire war.
0:59
It essentially caused the Germans, or the Central Powers,
1:01
especially the Germans and the Austrians
1:04
to have to ration food.
1:05
We're talking about 1,000 calories a day.
1:08
You could look at the number of calories in your average Big
1:11
Mac and think about how little food that was.
1:13
And there's many estimates of what that caused.
1:15
That obviously made it hard for the Central Powers
1:18
to get war munitions and things like that.
1:20
But it also made it very difficult for them to get food.
1:22
And there are estimates that this rationing, this inability
1:26
to get food, lead to malnutrition, even led
1:29
to starvation.
1:30
And there's estimates that this might
1:32
have led to in excess of 400,000 civilian deaths
1:39
either directly or indirectly due to malnutrition
1:41
or starvation amongst the Central Powers.
1:48
So this was a pretty serious tactic that was undertaken.
1:52
Now, the Germans did not have as dominant of a Navy.
1:56
Most of their Navy was actually focused right off
1:58
of the coast of Germany, right around there, in the North Sea.
2:02
But they also wanted to disrupt trade with the British.
2:05
They recognized the British Isles, they're islands.
2:08
They're dependent on trade for food and for supplies.
2:12
So in 1915 in February, the Germans declared the seas
2:19
around the British Isles, they declared this whole area,
2:22
a war zone.
2:32
Similarly, they declared that a war zone as well.
2:38
And because their surface fleet was concentrated
2:40
right over here, the way that they
2:41
would enforce that, they would essentially
2:43
try to keep people from trading with the British Isles
2:48
is through submarine warfare.
2:50
And World War I is the first time
2:52
that submarine warfare becomes a significant factor.
2:54
We're talking about very primitive submarines.
2:56
But we are talking about these vessels that
2:58
could go underwater and essentially
3:00
send torpedoes into boats.
3:02
Now, thinking about that as a backdrop,
3:06
we now forward to May of 1915.
3:09
So let's go to May of 1915.
3:14
You have the passenger liner, the RMS Lusitania.
3:18
And RMS literally stands for Royal Mail Ship
3:20
because it carried some mail.
3:22
It's a big ship.
3:23
If you've ever seen the movie Titanic,
3:24
think of a ship like that.
3:26
And it was setting sail from New York to Liverpool, England.
3:32
And it was apparently a passenger ship,
3:35
but it was also carrying cargo.
3:37
But the Germans, they said, look,
3:39
this could be fair game for us, especially if it's
3:41
carrying munitions, especially if it's a British ship.
3:44
And in the advertisement that was
3:46
in New York for the Lusitania that
3:48
was going to leave on May 1, 1915,
3:58
the German embassy actually placed an advertisement.
4:01
And this is worth reading.
4:03
They wrote, ""Notice, travelers intending
4:06
to embark on the Atlantic voyage are
4:08
reminded that a state of war exists
4:10
between Germany and her allies and Great
4:14
Britain and her allies.
4:15
That the zone of war includes the water
4:18
adjacent to the British Isles.
4:20
That in accordance with formal notice given
4:23
by the Imperial German government, vessels flying
4:26
the flag of Great Britain, or any of her allies,
4:30
are liable to destruction in those waters.
4:34
And that travelers sailing in the war zone
4:36
on ships of Great Britain or her allies do so at their own risk.
4:41
From the Imperial German embassy.""
4:43
And this is dated April 1915.
4:47
So that's the backdrop.
4:49
The Lusitania sets sail May 1, 1915.
4:56
On May 7, 1915-- the number 15 keeps
4:59
jumping into my brain-- on May 7, 1915,
5:06
it's almost reached its destination of Liverpool.
5:09
That's Liverpool right over here.
5:13
It's around 10 or 15 miles off the coast of Ireland.
5:17
And right there it encounters a German U boat.
5:21
So this right over here is a German U boat.
5:24
And that German U boat sends a torpedo into the Lusitania.
5:29
Now the torpedo, as you could imagine, rams into the ship.
5:32
And then shortly after the torpedo hits,
5:34
you have this huge explosion.
5:35
And the huge explosion is actually
5:37
one of those question marks of history.
5:40
Now, the ship goes down, taking down with it
5:43
most of its passengers.
5:45
So there were 1,959 total passengers and crew.
5:55
And 1,195 of them actually died.
5:59
Now there were other ships that went down due to German U
6:03
boats, but what was famous about this one,
6:06
at least from an American history point of view,
6:08
is that there were 128 Americans who also died on board.
6:15
And so you could imagine, this led to a lot of people
6:20
were concerned on the American side.
6:22
Why did this happen?
6:23
These were American civilians.
6:25
And it essentially led to a harsh reprimand
6:28
from Woodrow Wilson.
6:30
And just as a little bit of context, once war broke out--
6:33
and war had broken not even a year
6:35
before the sinking of the Lusitania--
6:37
the Americans' position was to be neutral.
6:40
It did not want to enter into this European conflict.
6:43
With that said, the Americans were disproportionately
6:47
trading with the Allies not the Central Power.
6:50
They were providing supplies, at a minimum, at a trading level.
6:56
And they were providing monetary support.
6:58
They were providing loans to the Allies disproportional
7:02
to the Central Powers.
7:03
So even though there was this formal neutrality,
7:09
there was more implicit connection to the Allies.
7:13
So Woodrow Wilson, he still wants to keep America out
7:16
of the war at this point.
7:18
So we're talking about May 1915.
7:20
And so he essentially just sends a stern warning
7:23
to the German empire.
7:25
Says, you must apologize.
7:27
You must take action to prevent this type of thing
7:30
happening in the future.
7:32
And the German empire actually complies.
7:34
On September 9-- let me write this on the timeline.
7:40
So right over here.
7:41
So in May, you have the Lusitania sunk.
7:48
And then in September, the Germans
7:54
agree to not attack passenger ships.
8:08
And so even though the sinking of the Lusitania,
8:11
especially in a lot of American history classes,
8:13
is often given as a trigger for America entrance into war,
8:17
this whole thing happened and America stayed neutral
8:20
throughout this entire period.
8:21
And America wouldn't actually enter the war until April 1917.
8:26
So the Lusitania was just one of many things
8:28
that happened in the years running up to the war.
8:31
And if we fast forward a little bit,
8:32
in 1916 the next presidential election where Wilson
8:36
won re-election, he ran on a platform of,
8:39
he kept us out of war.
8:48
So the sinking of the Lusitania was a significant event.
8:51
One could argue because the Germans did not
8:54
want the US to enter on the side of the Allies,
8:57
it was why the Germans agreed to loosen up,
8:59
at least for a couple of years, on their U boat campaigns.
9:03
As we'll see, once we get into 1917, the Germans,
9:06
out of desperation, start to become
9:07
more aggressive on their U boat attacks
9:09
again, which is one of the catalysts
9:11
that the US claims drove them into World War I.
9:18
But with that said, just as a little bit
9:20
of context-- and oftentimes when we look back at history,
9:23
it seems very cut and dry.
9:25
It seems obvious.
9:25
Oh yes, we had to go to war, et cetera, et cetera.
9:29
I have a few quotes here from William Jennings Bryan,
9:34
who was Woodrow Wilson's secretary of state.
9:36
And a few of these are pretty telling.
9:40
So this first one is September 1914.
9:42
This was before any of the stuff happened with Lusitania,
9:44
but war had broken out in Europe.
9:47
And he had this message that he wrote
9:49
to Woodrow Wilson to essentially advocate
9:51
why we should stay out of the war
9:53
and why there should be some type of mediation
9:55
to try to get the war to end as opposed
9:57
to just letting it run its course.
9:58
And he wrote to Wilson, ""it is not likely
10:01
that either side will win so complete a victory as
10:04
to be able to dictate terms.
10:06
And if either""-- and this is interesting and strangely
10:11
foreshadowing-- ""and if either side does win such a victory,
10:16
it'll probably mean preparation for another war.
10:19
It would seem better to look for a more rational basis
10:24
for peace.""
10:25
Now, the other quotes here-- and this is the question mark
10:29
around that second explosion-- William Jennings Bryan wrote,
10:34
""ships carrying contraband should be prohibited
10:36
from carrying passengers.
10:37
It would be like putting women and children
10:39
in front of an army.""
10:41
And so this is one of those big questions of history.
10:43
It was known that the Lusitania was carrying light ammunition.
10:49
So it was carrying a light munitions.
10:54
Now, the Germans claimed that it was actually
10:56
carrying heavy munitions.
10:57
And to some degree, that second explosion
10:59
tends to back that up.
11:00
And there was all sorts of shady things about a lot of the cargo
11:03
that the Lusitania was carrying, even though they claimed
11:06
that it was these perishable goods.
11:07
It wasn't being stored in a refrigerated part of the ship.
11:11
And so there was reason to believe
11:13
that it was carrying actually heavy munitions.
11:16
And that second explosion seems to point in that direction
11:21
as well.
11:21
And then even after World War I, the British Navy actually
11:25
spent multiple times trying to destroy
11:27
the wreck of the Lusitania.
11:29
And some people say in order to maybe get rid of some evidence
11:33
that it was actually carrying far more munitions
11:35
and maybe was, from the Germans' point of view,
11:38
a fairer target than was actually made out.
11:43
So regardless, it's a very interesting incident,
11:45
not necessarily directly tied to America's entrance
11:50
into World War I. But it is one of many events.
11:53
And this whole idea of blockades and German U boats
11:56
against civilians, this was something
11:58
that was a cause of repeated concern for the Americans.",Isn't a war zone illegal?

We have the function f of x is equal to x minus
0:03
1 squared minus 2.
0:06
And they've constrained the domain to x being less
0:09
than or equal to 1.
0:10
So we have the left half of a parabola right here.
0:14
They've constrained so that it's not a full U parabola.
0:17
And I'll let you think about why that would make finding
0:20
the inverse difficult.
0:21
But let's try to find the inverse here.
0:23
And a good place to start -- let's just set y
0:25
being equal to f of x.
0:26
You could say y is equal to f of x or we could just
0:29
write that y is equal to x minus 1 squared minus 2.
0:35
We know it's 4.
0:37
x is less than or equal to 1.
0:39
But right now we have y solved for in terms of x.
0:45
Or we've solved for y, to find the inverse we're going to want
0:47
to solve for x in terms of y.
0:51
And we're going to constrain y similarly.
0:54
We could look at the graph and we could say, well, in this
0:56
graph right here, this is defined for y being greater
1:00
than or equal to negative 2.
1:02
So we can maybe put in parentheses y being greater
1:05
than or equal to negative 2.
1:07
Because this is going to be -- right now this is our range.
1:10
But when we swap the x's and y's, this is going
1:12
to be our domain.
1:13
So let's just keep that in parentheses right there.
1:16
So let's solve for x.
1:18
So that's all you have to do, to find the inverse.
1:20
Solve for x and make sure you keep track of the
1:22
domains and the ranges.
1:23
So, let's see.
1:24
We could add 2 to both sides of this equation.
1:26
We get y plus 2 is equal to x minus 1 squared.
1:32
Minus 2, plus 2, so those cancel out.
1:34
And then, I'm just going to switch to the y constraint.
1:37
Because now it's not clear what we're -- whether x is
1:41
the domain or the range.
1:42
But we know by the end of this problem, y is
1:43
going to be the domain.
1:44
So let's just swap this here.
1:46
So, 4 for y is greater than or equal to negative 2.
1:50
And we could also say, in parentheses, x is less than 1.
1:53
This is -- we haven't solved it explicitly for either one, so
1:55
we'll keep both of them around right now.
1:58
Now, to solve for x, you might be tempted to just take the
2:02
square root of both sides here.
2:04
And you wouldn't be completely wrong.
2:05
But we have to be very, very, very careful here.
2:07
And this might not be something that you've ever seen before.
2:11
So this is an interesting point here.
2:13
We want the right side to just be x minus 1.
2:19
That's our goal here, in taking the square root of both sides.
2:21
We want to just have an x minus 1 over there.
2:25
Now, is x minus 1 a positive or a negative number?
2:31
Well, we've constrained our x's to being less than 1.
2:35
So we're dealing only in a situation where x is
2:37
less than or equal to 1.
2:38
So if x is less than or equal to 1, this is negative.
2:44
This is negative.
2:48
So we want to take the negative square root.
2:50
Let me just be very clear here.
2:51
If I take negative 3 -- I take negative 3 and I were to square
2:56
it, that is equal to 9.
2:58
Now, if we take the square root of 9 -- if we take the square
3:02
root -- let's say we take the square root of both
3:04
sides of this equation.
3:05
And our goal is to get back to negative 3.
3:08
If we take the positive square root.
3:11
If we just take the principle root of both sides of that, we
3:16
would get 3 is equal to 3.
3:18
But that's not our goal.
3:19
We want to get back to negative 3.
3:21
So we want to take the negative square root of our square.
3:28
So because this expression is negative and we want to get
3:30
back to this expression, we want to get back to this x
3:33
minus 1, we need to take the negative square root
3:36
of both sides.
3:37
You can always -- every perfect square has a
3:39
positive or a negative root.
3:42
The principle root is a positive root.
3:44
But here we want to take the negative root because this
3:45
expression right here is going to be negative.
3:48
And that's what we want to solve for.
3:50
So let's take the negative root of both sides.
3:53
So you get the negative square root of y plus 2 is equal to
3:58
-- and I'll just write this extra step here, just so you
4:01
realize what we're doing.
4:02
Is equal to the negative square root, the negative square
4:06
root of x minus 1 squared.
4:11
For y is greater than or equal to negative 2.
4:15
And x is less than or equal to 1.
4:17
That's why the whole reason we're going to take the
4:18
negative square there.
4:20
And then this expression right here -- so let me
4:22
just write the left again.
4:24
Negative square root of y plus 2 is equal to the negative
4:29
square root of x minus 1 squared is just going
4:32
to be x minus 1.
4:34
It's just going to be x minus one.
4:36
x minus 1 squared is some positive quantity.
4:39
The negative root is the negative number that you
4:41
have to square to get it.
4:43
To get x minus 1 squared.
4:44
So that just becomes x minus 1.
4:46
Hopefully that doesn't confuse you too much.
4:48
We just want to get rid of this squared sign.
4:50
We want to make sure we get the negative version.
4:52
We don't want the positive version, which would
4:53
have been 1 minus x.
4:54
Don't want to confuse you.
4:56
So here, we now just have to solve for x.
4:58
Add 1.
4:58
And let me write the 4.
5:00
y is greater than or equal to negative 2.
5:04
Add 1 to both sides.
5:06
You get negative square root of y plus 2 plus 1 is equal to x
5:13
for y is greater than or equal to negative 2.
5:17
Or, if we want to rewrite it, we could say that x is equal to
5:21
the negative square root of y plus 2 plus 1 for y is greater
5:28
than or equal to negative 2.
5:29
Or if we want to write it in terms, as an inverse function
5:31
of y, we could say -- so we could say that f inverse of y
5:36
is equal to this, or f inverse of y is equal to the negative
5:42
square root of y plus 2 plus 1, for y is greater than
5:48
or equal to negative 2.
5:49
And now, if we wanted this in terms of x.
5:52
If we just want to rename y as x we just replace
5:55
the y's with x's.
5:56
So we could write f inverse of x -- I'm just
6:02
renaming the y here.
6:03
Is equal to the negative square root of x plus 2 plus 1 for,
6:09
I'm just renaming the y, for x is greater than or
6:12
equal to negative 2.
6:13
And if we were to graph this, let's see.
6:16
If we started at x is equal to negative 2, this is 0.
6:18
So the point negative 2, 1 is going to be on our graph.
6:22
So negative 2, 1 is going to be on our graph.
6:25
Let's see, if we go to negative 1, negative 1 this will
6:30
become a negative 1.
6:31
Negative 1 is 0 on our graph.
6:34
Negative 1, 0 is on our graph.
6:37
And then, let's see.
6:38
If we were to do, if we were to put x is equal to 2 here.
6:42
So x is equal to 2 is 4.
6:46
4 square root, principle root is 2.
6:48
It becomes a negative 2 So it becomes 2, negative 1.
6:52
So that's on our graph right there.
6:54
So the graph is going to look something like
6:55
this, of f inverse.
6:57
It's going to look something like that right there.
7:02
As you can see, it is a reflection of our original
7:05
f of x along the line y is equal to x.
7:08
Along the line y is equal to x.
7:13
Because we've essentially just swapped the x and the y.
7:16
This is about as hard of an inverse problem that
7:18
I expect you to see.
7:19
Especially in a precalculus class because it really is
7:22
tricky to realize that you have to take the negative
7:24
square root here.
7:25
Because the way our domain was constrained, this value right
7:28
here is going to be negative.
7:30
So to solve for it, you want to have the negative square root.","when sal takes the negative square root in 4:30, is it possible to take the positive square root and multiply both sides of the equation by -1?"

Hello.
0:19
My name is Bill Harrington and I'm
0:21
a graduate student at the Massachusetts
0:22
Institute of Technology.
0:24
We're in the Course Six Modern Optics Project Laboratory,
0:27
and this is Young's Double Slit Experiment,
0:28
an important experiment from around 1800.
0:32
We have a laser shining light onto a pair of identical slits.
0:35
These are rectangular openings in a transparency.
0:39
After shining through slits, light propagates some distance
0:41
to a screen where we can observe the resulting pattern.
0:44
We have a webcam set up so you can see
0:46
what's happening on the screen.
0:48
Right now, we have blocked one of the two slits.
0:50
So light is propagating through a single slit,
0:53
and this is the pattern that results.
0:56
Let's see what happens when we open the second slit.
1:01
The pattern changes significantly.
1:03
You should be asking yourself why has the pattern changed
1:06
and why is this experiment important?
1:08
The answers to those two questions are related.
1:11
To understand why this experiment is important
1:13
and what we are observing, you have
1:15
to go back to the days of Sir Isaac Newton.
1:18
At that time, people were debating
1:19
the basic nature of light.
1:21
One group of people held that light
1:23
was a particle traveling like a projectile from a source
1:26
to an observer.
1:28
Another group of people held that light propagate more
1:30
like a wave, sort of like the waves
1:32
you see moving along the surface of the body of water.
1:35
Based on his own experiments and extensive observations,
1:38
Sir Isaac Newton decided that light was most like a particle.
1:42
Newton was quite brilliant in advanced science
1:44
in a number of fields.
1:45
So for many people, because Newton says so,
1:48
was solid evidence that light was a particle,
1:50
and Newton's corpuscular theory of light was widely accepted.
1:55
About seven years after Newton's death,
1:57
another scientist, Thomas Young, was working with light
2:00
and he came to believe that light behaved like a wave.
2:03
Young's double slit experiment attempts
2:05
to address the nature of light by looking
2:07
at what happens when light passes through a pair of slits.
2:10
If light behaved like a particle,
2:12
for the double slit experiment, we
2:14
would expect to see two overlapping copies
2:16
of the single slit pattern.
2:18
This did not match our own observation.
2:21
On the other hand, if light behaves like a wave,
2:23
we expect to see the two waves interfere,
2:26
adding together in some directions
2:28
and canceling each other in others.
2:30
If we make some assumptions about how light propagates,
2:33
we can predict that the intensity
2:34
pattern on a screen placed far from the slits
2:37
will be a proportional product of a sinc-squared term
2:40
due to the width of a single slit,
2:42
and a cosine-squared term due do the separation
2:44
of the two slits.
2:46
This is an excellent match for what we observe in lab,
2:48
and is good evidence that light behaves like a wave.
2:51
So the pattern that we observed was
2:53
due to the interference of light that passed through one slit
2:55
with light that was passing through the other slit,
2:57
and it looks as though light is propagating as a wave.
3:00
Does that mean that we could shine any light
3:02
through this system and expect to see an interference pattern?
3:04
For instance, can we shine the light from this flashlight
3:06
through the double slit and see an interference pattern?
3:09
It turns out the answer is no and it's
3:10
a problem of spatial coherence, which
3:12
is the ability of light from one point on a wave front
3:15
to interfere with light from another point on the wave
3:17
front.
3:18
This laser has a lot of spatial coherence,
3:20
but a flashlight and most other sources have very little.
3:23
So how did Thomas Young do his experiment?
3:25
After all, they didn't have lasers in the 1800s.
3:28
Well, it turns out it is possible to get
3:30
these interference patterns to form even when
3:32
using a source normally considered incoherent,
3:34
it just takes a little planning and some more work.
3:38
Thomas Young recognized that not just any light
3:40
could be used to see interference effects.
3:42
In this quote from his lecture on the nature of light
3:45
and colors, he lays out the conditions
3:47
on the interfering portions of light
3:49
as deriving from the same origin,
3:51
arriving at the same point in different paths,
3:54
and traveling in similar directions.
3:57
This suggests two possible approaches to the experiment.
4:00
One approach is to mask your source down to a point.
4:03
This is probably the technique that Young
4:05
used as he mentions using a pinhole and a shuttered window
4:08
in his other publications.
4:10
It has the advantage of being simple with the disadvantage
4:13
of wasting much of the source light.
4:16
Another approach is to simply place a source
4:18
far away from double slits.
4:20
This approach allows astronomers to perform
4:22
stellar interferometry experiments,
4:24
and will allow you to view interference patterns
4:26
using street lights at night as a light source.
4:30
A double pinhole system is quite easy to construct at home,
4:33
and can produce striking interference patterns
4:35
using street lights as a light source.
4:38
To build the system, you'll need a piece of pipe, some cardboard
4:42
to block most of one end of the pipe,
4:44
and the pair of pinholes in a piece of opaque material.
4:47
For my system, I used a piece of stainless steel shim stock,
4:50
but good results can be had with the material from a soda can.
4:54
To make the pinholes, the basic technique
4:56
is to dimple the material with a pen,
4:58
and then sand away the protruding material
5:00
on the other side until you have two nice pinholes.
5:03
More detailed instructions can be
5:05
found online from the do-it-yourself pinhole camera
5:07
crowd.
5:09
Keep in mind that you want your pinholes
5:10
to be small and close together.
5:12
Aim for 1/4 to 1/2 millimeter separation
5:15
and a similar pinhole diameter.
5:17
Smaller would be better.
5:20
The assembly of the system is straightforward.
5:22
Start by mounting the panels to the cardboard so the hole's
5:25
unobstructed, then mount the cardboard in the tube,
5:28
and finally, tape everything together.
5:30
One trick that I found helpful was
5:32
to use aluminum foil to make the joint between the cardboard
5:35
and the tube light tight.
5:36
To use the system, stand somewhere safe,
5:40
hold the open end of the tube close to one eye,
5:42
and look at a street light or stoplight
5:44
at least 10 to 20 meters away.
5:47
This is a picture I took of a car
5:48
at a stoplight using the double pinhole
5:50
system pictured earlier.
5:52
Notice the strong dark bands in the stoplights and the car
5:55
headlights.
5:56
The pattern is even more impressive in person.
5:59
Warning-- do not use this system to observe
6:02
laser light or the sun.
6:03
You may damage your eyesight.
6:06
OK, so the experiment shows interference
6:07
and we can even build one of these widgets
6:09
if we want to see it for ourselves at home.
6:12
But does light always behave like a wave?
6:14
What about Einstein and photons?
6:16
We know that at least in some circumstances,
6:18
light has to behave like a particle.
6:20
Well, it turns out something interesting
6:22
would happen if you did this experiment one
6:24
photon at a time.
6:25
We don't have the equipment to do it for you,
6:27
but we can show you a simulation of what you would see.
6:30
Right now, you are watching an animation
6:32
showing what we would expect to see
6:34
if we could do the double slit experiment with only
6:36
a small number of photons in a system at a time.
6:39
The top half of the screen showing the photon impacts
6:41
at each stage, and the bottom half
6:43
is showing the accumulated pattern
6:45
that we would get if we were exposing
6:46
the photographic plate.
6:48
For this animation, we are also assuming very narrow and very
6:51
short slits.
6:52
So the expected pattern is a cosine-squared variation
6:55
in the horizontal direction, and uniform
6:57
in the vertical direction.
6:59
This animation is based on the results
7:01
of two historic double slit experiments--
7:03
a 1909 experiment which used very low, but not quite single
7:06
photon levels of light, and a 1973 experiment showing
7:11
double slit interference in a system launching
7:13
single electrons.
7:15
While we wait for the pattern to finish building,
7:17
I want to thank you for watching and encourage
7:19
you to investigate further if you
7:20
have found the material presented here interesting.",Is mastering calculus basics a prerequisite for higher-level physics?

0:00
In this video, I want to talk a little bit
0:02
about Newton's First Law of Motion.
0:06
And this is a translation from Newton's Principia from Latin
0:09
into English.
0:10
So the First Law, ""Every body persists
0:13
in a state of being at rest, or moving uniformly
0:20
straightforward, except insofar as it is compelled
0:24
to change its state by force impressed.""
0:27
So another way to rephrase what they're saying
0:30
is, that if there's something-- every body persists--
0:33
so everything will stay at rest, or
0:35
moving with a constant velocity, unless it
0:39
is compelled to change its state by force.
0:42
Unless it's acted on by a force, especially an unbalanced force.
0:45
and I'll explain that in a second.
0:47
So if I have something that's at rest, so completely at rest.
0:50
So I have-- and this is something
0:53
that we've seen before.
0:56
Let's say that I have a rock.
0:59
Let's say that I have a rock someplace
1:03
and it's laying on a field of grass,
1:08
I can keep observing that rock.
1:10
And it is unlikely to move, assuming
1:11
that nothing happens to it.
1:13
If there's no force applied to that rock,
1:15
that rock will just stay there.
1:17
So the first part is pretty obvious.
1:20
So, ""Every body persists in a state of being at rest""--
1:23
I'm not going to do the second part--
1:25
""except insofar as there's some force being applied to it.""
1:28
So clearly a rock will be at rest,
1:30
unless there's some force applied to it, unless someone
1:33
here tries to push it or roll it or do something to it.
1:37
What's less intuitive about the first law is the second part.
1:41
""Every body persists in,"" either, ""being in a state
1:44
of rest or moving uniformly straight forward,
1:48
except insofar as it is compelled
1:50
to change its state by force impressed.""
1:52
So this Newton's first law-- and I
1:55
think I should do a little aside here,
1:56
because, this right here is Newton.
2:00
And if this is Newton's first law,
2:01
why do I have this huge picture of this guy over here?
2:04
Well, the reason is is because Newton's first law is really
2:07
just a restatement of this guy's law of inertia.
2:10
And this guy, another titan of civilization
2:14
really, this is Galileo Galilei.
2:19
And he is the first person to formulate the law of inertia.
2:22
And Newton just rephrased it a little bit and packaged it
2:25
with his other laws.
2:26
But he did many, many, many other things.
2:28
So you really have to give Galileo
2:30
credit for Newton's first law.
2:32
So that's why I made him bigger than here.
2:34
But I was in the midst of a thought.
2:36
So we understand if something is at rest,
2:38
it's going to stay at rest, unless there's
2:39
some force that acts on it.
2:41
And in some definitions, you'll see
2:42
unless there's some unbalanced force.
2:44
And the reason why they say unbalanced
2:46
is, because you could have two forces that act on something
2:49
and they might balance out.
2:50
For example, I could push on this side of the rock
2:53
with a certain amount of force.
2:55
And if you push on this side of the rock
2:56
with the exact same amount of force, the rock won't move.
3:00
And the only way that it would move if there's a lot more
3:03
force on one side than on the other side,
3:05
so if you have an unbalanced force.
3:07
So if you have a ton of-- and maybe the rock
3:09
is a bad analogy.
3:10
Let's take ice, because ice is easier to move, or ice on ice.
3:14
So there's ice right here.
3:16
And then, I have another block of ice
3:17
sitting on top of that ice.
3:19
So once again, we're familiar with the idea,
3:21
if there's no force acting on it that ice won't move.
3:25
But what happens if I'm pushing on the ice
3:29
with a certain amount of force on that side,
3:31
and you're pushing on the ice on that side
3:32
with the same amount of force?
3:34
The ice will still not move.
3:36
So this right here, this would be a balanced force.
3:41
So the only way for the ice to change its condition, to change
3:47
its restful condition is if the force is unbalanced.
3:50
So if we add a little bit of force on this side,
3:53
so it more than compensates the force pushing it this way,
3:57
then you're going to see the ice block start to move,
4:00
start to really accelerate in that direction.
4:04
But I think this part is obvious.
4:05
This, you know, something that's at rest
4:07
will stay at rest, unless it's being acted on
4:09
by an unbalanced force.
4:11
What's less obvious is the idea that something
4:14
moving uniformly straightforward, which
4:16
is another way of saying something
4:18
having a constant velocity.
4:22
What he's saying is, is that something
4:24
that has a constant velocity will continue
4:26
to have that constant velocity indefinitely,
4:29
unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force.
4:33
And that's less intuitive.
4:34
Because everything in our human experience--
4:37
even if I were to push this block of ice,
4:41
eventually it'll stop.
4:42
It won't just keep going forever, even
4:44
assuming that this ice field is infinitely long, that ice
4:47
will eventually stop.
4:48
Or if I throw a tennis ball.
4:54
That tennis ball will eventually stop.
4:59
It'll eventually grind to a halt.
5:01
Or if I roll a bowling ball, or if I, anything.
5:04
We've never seen, at least in our human experience,
5:06
it looks like everything will eventually stop.
5:09
So this is a very unintuitive thing to say,
5:11
that something in motion will just
5:12
keep going in motion indefinitely.
5:14
Everything in human intuition says if you want something
5:17
to keep going in motion, you have to keep
5:19
putting more force, keep putting more energy into it
5:22
for it to keep going.
5:23
Your car won't go forever, unless you keep,
5:25
unless the engine keeps burning fuel to drive and consuming
5:29
energy.
5:30
So what are they talking about?
5:31
Well, in all of these examples-- and I
5:33
think this is actually a pretty brilliant insight from all
5:36
of these fellows is that-- all of these things
5:39
would have gone on forever.
5:41
The ball would keep going forever.
5:42
This ice block would be going on forever,
5:44
except for the fact that there are unbalanced
5:47
forces acting on them to stop them.
5:50
So in the case of ice, even though ice on ice
5:52
doesn't have a lot of friction, there
5:54
is some friction between these two.
5:56
And so you have, in this situation,
5:58
the force of friction is going to be
6:00
acting against the direction of the movement of the ice.
6:03
And friction really comes from, at an atomic level--
6:06
so if you have the actual water molecules in a lattice
6:10
structure in the ice cube, and then here are
6:12
the water molecules in a lattice structure on the ice,
6:17
on the actual kind of sea of ice that it's traveling on--
6:20
they do kind of bump and grind into each other.
6:22
Although they're both smooth, there are imperfections here.
6:25
They bump and grind.
6:26
They generate a little bit of heat.
6:28
And they'll, essentially, be working against the movement.
6:32
So there's a force of friction that's being applied to here.
6:34
And that's why it's stopping.
6:35
Not only a force of friction, you also
6:37
have some air resistance.
6:38
The ice block is going to be bumping
6:40
into all sorts of air particles.
6:42
It might not be noticeable at first,
6:44
but it's definitely going to keep it from going on forever.
6:47
Same thing with the ball being tossed to the air.
6:49
Obviously, at some point, it hits
6:51
the ground because of gravity.
6:52
So that's one force acting on it.
6:54
But even once it hits the ground,
6:55
it doesn't keep rolling forever, once again,
6:57
because of the friction, especially if there's grass
7:01
here.
7:02
The grass is going to stop it from going.
7:04
And even while it's in the air, it's going to slow down.
7:06
It's not going to have a constant velocity.
7:08
Because you have all of these air particles
7:10
that are going to bump into it and exert
7:15
force to slow it down.
7:17
So what was really brilliant about these guys
7:19
is that they could imagine a reality where
7:22
you didn't have gravity, where you did not
7:24
have air slowing things down.
7:27
And they could imagine that in that reality,
7:30
something would just keep persisting in its motion.
7:33
And the reason why Galileo, frankly, was probably good
7:36
at thinking about that is that he
7:37
studied the orbits of planets.
7:41
And he could, or at least he's probably
7:43
theorized that, hey, maybe there's no air out there.
7:45
And that maybe that's why these planets can just
7:47
keep going round and round in orbit.
7:49
And I should say their speed, because their direction is
7:54
changing, but their speed never slows down,
7:56
because there's nothing in the space
7:58
to actually slow down those planets.
8:01
So anyway, hopefully you found that as fascinating as I do.
8:04
Because on some level, it's super-duper obvious.
8:06
But on a whole other level, it's completely not obvious,
8:08
especially this moving uniformly straightforward.
8:10
And just to make the point clear,
8:12
if gravity disappeared, and you had no air,
8:16
and you threw a ball, that ball literally
8:18
would keep going in that direction
8:20
forever, unless some other unbalanced force acted
8:24
to stop it.
8:26
And another way to think about it-- and this
8:28
is an example that you might see in everyday life-- is,
8:32
if I'm in an airplane that's going at a completely
8:38
constant velocity and there's absolutely
8:40
no turbulence in the airplane.
8:42
So if I'm sitting in the airplane right over here.
8:45
And it's going at a constant velocity, completely smooth,
8:51
no turbulence.
8:52
There's really no way for me to tell whether that airplane is
8:55
moving without looking out the window.
8:57
Let's assume that there's no windows in that airplane.
8:59
It's going at a constant velocity.
9:01
And there's no turbulence.
9:02
And let's say, I can't hear anything.
9:06
So I can't even hear the engines.
9:07
There's no way for me to sense that the plane is moving.
9:10
Because from my frame of reference,
9:12
it looks completely identical to if I
9:15
was in that same plane that was resting on the ground.
9:18
And that's another way to think about it.
9:20
That it's actually very intuitive
9:22
that they're similar states, moving at a constant velocity
9:25
or being at rest.
9:27
And you really can't tell whether you
9:29
are one or the other.","According to Newton's First Law of Motion, what does ""except insofar"" and ""force impressed"", want's to reflect his Doctrine?"

We already know that an angle is formed
0:02
when two rays share a common endpoint.
0:04
So, for example, let's say that this is one ray right
0:06
over here, and then this is one another ray right over here,
0:11
and then they would form an angle.
0:13
And at this point right over here,
0:14
their common endpoint is called the vertex of that angle.
0:18
Now, we also know that not all angles seem the same.
0:21
For example, this is one angle here,
0:23
and then we could have another angle
0:26
that looks something like this.
0:34
And viewed this way, it looks like this one
0:36
is much more open.
0:39
So I'll say more open.
0:43
And this one right over here seems less open.
0:46
So to avoid having to just say, oh, more open and less open
0:50
and actually becoming a little bit more exact about it,
0:52
we'd actually want to measure how open an angle is,
0:55
or we'd want to have a measure of the angle.
0:59
Now, the most typical way that angles are measured,
1:01
there's actually two major ways of that they're measured.
1:04
The most typical unit is in degrees,
1:07
but later on in high school, you'll
1:09
also see the unit of radians being used, especially when you
1:13
learn trigonometry.
1:15
But the degrees convention really comes from a circle.
1:18
So let's draw ourselves a circle right over here,
1:20
so that's a circle.
1:22
And the convention is that-- when I say convention,
1:26
it's just kind of what everyone has been doing.
1:29
The convention is that you have 360 degrees in a circle.
1:33
So let me explain that.
1:34
So if that's the center of the circle,
1:36
and if we make this ray our starting point or one side
1:43
of our angle, if you go all the way around the circle,
1:48
that represents 360 degrees.
1:54
And the notation is 360, and then this little superscript
1:57
circle represents degrees.
1:59
This could be read as 360 degrees.
2:03
Now, you might be saying, where did this 360 number come from?
2:07
And no one knows for sure, but there's hints in history,
2:11
and there's hints in just the way that the universe works,
2:15
or at least the Earth's rotation around the sun.
2:17
You might recognize or you might already
2:19
realize that there are 365 days in a non-leap year, 366
2:25
in a leap year.
2:26
And so you can imagine ancient astronomers might have said,
2:29
well, you know, that's pretty close to 360.
2:38
And in fact, several ancient calendars,
2:40
including the Persians and the Mayans,
2:43
had 360 days in their year.
2:46
And 360 is also a much neater number than 365.
2:49
It has many, many more factors.
2:52
It's another way of saying it's divisible by a bunch of things.
2:55
But anyway, this has just been the convention, once again,
2:58
what history has handed us, that a circle is
3:00
viewed to have 360 degrees.
3:03
And so one way we could measure an angle
3:06
is you could put one of the rays of an angle right over here
3:09
at this part of the circle, and then the other ray of the angle
3:14
will look something like this.
3:17
And then the fraction of the circle circumference
3:24
that is intersected by these two rays, the measure of this angle
3:28
would be that fraction of degrees.
3:31
So, for example, let's say that this length right over here
3:38
is 1/6 of the circle's circumference.
3:49
So it's 1/6 of the way around the circle.
3:52
Then this angle right over here is
3:54
going to be 1/6 of 360 degrees.
3:58
So in this case, this would be 60 degrees.
4:01
I could do another example.
4:02
So let's say I had a circle like this, and I'll draw an angle.
4:07
I'll put the vertex at the center of the angle.
4:10
I'll put one of the rays right over here.
4:12
You could consider that to be 0 degrees.
4:15
Or if the other ray was also here, it would be 0 degrees.
4:19
And then I'll make the other ray of this angle,
4:23
let's say it went straight up.
4:25
Let's say it went straight up like this.
4:29
Well, in this situation, the arc that
4:33
connects these two endpoints just like this,
4:37
this represents 1/4 of the circumference of the circle.
4:40
This is, right over here, 1/4 of the circumference.
4:49
So this angle right over here is going to be 1/4 of 360 degrees.
4:55
360 degrees divided by 4 is going to be 90 degrees.
5:00
At an angle like this, one where one ray is straight up and down
5:03
and the other one goes to the right/left direction,
5:07
we would say these two rays are perpendicular,
5:11
or we would call this a right angle.
5:13
And the way that we oftentimes will denote that
5:16
is by a symbol like this.
5:19
But this literally means a 90-degree angle.
5:22
Let's do one more example.
5:24
Let's do one more example of this, just
5:25
to make sure that we understand what's going on.
5:28
Actually, at least one more example.
5:30
Maybe one more if we have time.
5:32
So let's say that we have an angle that looks like this.
5:35
Once more, I'm going to put its vertex
5:38
at the center of the circle.
5:40
That's one ray of the angle.
5:42
And let's say that this is the other ray.
5:45
This right over here is the other ray of the angle.
5:48
I encourage you to pause this video
5:50
and try to figure out what the measure of this angle
5:55
right over here is.
5:57
Well, let's think about where the rays intersect the circle.
6:00
They intersect there and there.
6:02
The arc that connects them on the circle
6:04
is that arc right over there.
6:06
That is literally half of the circumference of the circle.
6:09
That is half of the circumference, half of the way
6:13
around of the circle, circumference of the circle.
6:18
So this angle is going to be half of 360 degrees.
6:21
And half of 360 is 180 degrees.
6:26
And when you view it this way, these two rays
6:27
share a common endpoint.
6:28
And together, they're really forming a line here.
6:32
And let's just do one more example,
6:34
because I said I would.
6:36
Let me paste another circle.
6:39
Let me draw another angle.
6:42
Let me draw another angle.
6:44
So let's say that's one ray of the angle,
6:46
and this is the other ray.
6:49
This is the other ray of the angle right over here.
6:52
And we care.
6:53
There's actually two angles that are formed.
6:55
There's actually two angles formed in all of these.
6:57
There's one angle that's formed right over here,
6:59
and you might recognize that to be a 90-degree angle.
7:01
But what we really care about in this example
7:04
is this angle right over here.
7:07
So once again, where does it intersect the circle?
7:10
We care about this arc right over here,
7:13
because that's the arc that corresponds
7:17
to this angle right over here.
7:19
And it looks like we've gone 3/4 around the circle.
7:22
So this angle is going to be 3/4 of 360 degrees.
7:28
1/4 of 360 degrees is 90, so three of those
7:32
is going to be 270 degrees.","At 8:47, why can't the circle's circumference be 365 degrees instead of 360 degrees?"

Let's say that you're a watermelon farmer,
0:03
and you want to study how dense the seeds are
0:06
in your watermelon.
0:06
Perhaps you want to do this because over time, you're
0:09
trying to breed watermelons that have fewer seeds,
0:11
and you should see whether you are actually making progress.
0:15
And you don't want to cut open every watermelon
0:17
in your watermelon farm or patch or whatever
0:21
it might be called, because you want to sell most of them.
0:23
You just want to sample a few watermelons,
0:25
and then take samples of those watermelons
0:28
to figure out how dense the seeds are, and hope that you
0:33
can calculate statistics on those samples that
0:36
are decent estimates of the parameters for the population.
0:40
So let's start doing that.
0:42
So let's say that you take these little cubic inch chunks out
0:45
of a random sample of your watermelons.
0:48
And then you count the number of seeds in them.
0:50
And you have 8 samples like this.
0:54
So in one of them, you found 4 seeds.
0:57
In the next, you found 3, 5, 7, 2, 9, 11, and 7.
1:06
So this is a sample, just to make
1:08
sure we're visualizing it right.
1:10
If this is the population of all of the chunks--
1:15
I guess we could view this as a cubic inch--
1:17
the cubic inch chunks in my entire watermelon farm,
1:21
I'm sampling a very small sample of them.
1:26
Maybe I could have had a million over here.
1:29
A million chunks of watermelon could
1:30
have been produced from my farm, but I'm only
1:33
sampling-- so capital N would be 1 million,
1:36
lowercase n is equal to 8.
1:39
And once again, you might want to have more samples,
1:41
but this'll make our math easy.
1:43
Now, let's think about what statistics we can measure.
1:47
Well, the first one that we often do
1:49
is a measure of central tendency.
1:51
And that's the arithmetic mean.
1:53
But here, we're trying to estimate the population mean
1:56
by coming up with the sample mean.
2:00
So what is the sample mean going to be?
2:04
Well, all we have to do is add up these points,
2:08
add up these measurements, and then divide
2:10
by the number of measurements we have.
2:12
So let's get our calculator out for that.
2:15
Actually, maybe I don't need my calculator.
2:17
Let's see.
2:18
So 4 plus 3 is 7.
2:20
7 plus 5 is 12.
2:21
12 plus 7 is 19.
2:24
19 plus 2 is 21, plus 9 is 30, plus 11 is 41, plus 7 is 48.
2:33
So I'm going to get 48 over 8 data points.
2:36
So this worked out quite well.
2:38
48 divided by 8 is equal to 6.
2:41
So our sample mean is 6.
2:43
It's our estimate of what the population mean might be.
2:47
But we also want to think about how much in our population
2:50
we want to estimate, how much spread is there,
2:56
or how much do our measurements vary from this mean.
3:01
So there, we say, well, we can try to estimate the population
3:05
variance by calculating the sample variance.
3:08
And we're going to calculate the unbiased sample variance.
3:13
Hopefully, we're fairly convinced at this point
3:15
why we divide by n minus 1.
3:16
So we're going to calculate the unbiased sample variance.
3:20
And if we do that, what do we get?
3:24
I'll do this in a different color.
3:25
It's going to be 4 minus 6 squared plus 3 minus 6 squared
3:32
plus 5 minus 6 squared plus 7 minus 6 squared
3:38
plus 2 minus 6 squared plus 9 minus 6 squared
3:44
plus 11 minus 6 squared plus 7 minus 6 squared, all of that
3:51
divided by-- not by 8.
3:54
Remember, we want the unbiased sample variance.
3:57
We're going to divide it by 8 minus 1.
4:00
So we're going to divide by 7.
4:03
Let me give myself a little bit more real estate.
4:05
The unbiased sample variance-- and I could even
4:07
denote it by this to make it clear that we're
4:09
dividing by lowercase n minus 1-- is going
4:13
to be equal to-- let's see, 4 minus 6 is negative 2.
4:18
That squared is positive 4.
4:20
So I did that one.
4:21
3 minus 6 is negative 3.
4:23
That squared is going to be 9.
4:25
5 minus 6 squared is 1 squared, which is 1.
4:29
7 minus 6 is once again 1 squared, which is 1.
4:33
2 minus 6, negative 4 squared is 16.
4:40
9 minus 6 squared, well, that's going to be 9.
4:43
11 minus 6 squared, that is 25.
4:48
And then finally, 7 minus 6 squared, that's another 1.
4:52
And we're going to divide it by 7.
4:56
Let's see if we can add this up in our heads.
4:58
4 plus 9 is 13, plus 1 is 14, 15, 31, 40, 65, 66.
5:10
So this is going to be equal to 66 over 7.
5:15
And we could either divide-- we get that's 9 and 3/7.
5:20
We could write that as 9 and 3/7.
5:23
Or if we want to write that as a decimal,
5:25
I could just take 66 divided by 7
5:30
gives us 9 point-- I'll just round it.
5:33
So it's approximately 9.43.
5:43
Now, that gave us our unbiased sample variance.
5:48
Well, how could we calculate a sample standard deviation?
5:51
We want to somehow get added estimate of what the population
5:55
standard deviation might be.
5:57
Well, the logic, I guess, is reasonable to say, well,
6:01
this is our unbiased sample variance.
6:03
It's our best estimate of what the true population
6:07
variance is.
6:08
When we think about population parameters
6:10
to get the population standard deviation,
6:15
we just take the square root of the population variance.
6:19
So if we want to get an estimate of the sample standard
6:23
deviation, why don't we just take
6:25
the square root of the unbiased sample variance?
6:32
So that's what we'll do.
6:33
So we'll define it that way.
6:34
We'll call it the sample standard deviation.
6:36
We're going to define it to be equal to the square root
6:40
of the unbiased sample variance.
6:42
It's going to be the square root of this quantity,
6:45
and we can take our calculator out.
6:47
It's going to be the square root of what I just typed in.
6:50
I can do 2nd answer.
6:51
It'll be the last entry here.
6:52
So the square root of that is-- and I'll just round.
6:54
It's approximately equal to 3.07.
7:01
Now, I'm going to tell you something
7:02
very counterintuitive.
7:04
Or at least initially it's counterintuitive,
7:06
but hopefully you'll appreciate this over time.
7:09
This we've already talked about in some depth.
7:12
People have even created simulations
7:14
to show that this is an unbiased estimate of population variance
7:19
when we divide it by n minus 1.
7:21
And that's a good starting point if we're
7:22
going to take the square root of anything.
7:24
But it actually turns out that because the square root
7:28
function is nonlinear, that this sample standard
7:32
deviation-- and this is how it tends
7:35
to be defined-- sample standard deviation, that this sample
7:42
standard deviation, which is the square root of our sample
7:53
variance, so from i equals 1 to n
7:57
of our unbiased sample variance, so we divide it by n minus 1.
8:01
This is how we literally divide our sample standard deviation.
8:04
Because the square root function is nonlinear,
8:11
it turns out that this is not an unbiased estimate
8:16
of the true population standard deviation.
8:20
And I encourage people to make simulations of that
8:23
if they're interested.
8:24
But then you might say, well, we went through great pains
8:27
to divide by n minus 1 here in order
8:29
to get an unbiased estimate of the population variance.
8:32
Why don't we go through similar pains
8:34
and somehow figure out a formula for an unbiased estimate
8:38
of the population standard deviation?
8:41
And the reason why that's difficult
8:43
is to unbias the sample variance,
8:46
we just have to divide by n minus 1 instead of n.
8:48
And that'd work for any probability distribution
8:52
for our population.
8:54
It turns out to do the same thing
8:55
for the standard deviation.
8:57
It's not that easy.
8:59
It's actually dependent on how that population is actually
9:02
distributed.
9:03
So in statistics, we just define the sample standard deviation.
9:07
And the one that we typically use
9:10
is based on the square root of the unbiased sample variance.
9:15
But when you take that square root,
9:19
it does give you a biased result when
9:25
you're trying to use this to estimate the population
9:27
standard deviation.
9:28
But it's the simplest, best tool we have.",How would I know to divide by n-1 or n?

0:00
Right now, based on what we know so far, if we wanted to
0:03
name this molecule, we would say, well, what's the longest
0:07
carbon chain here?
0:08
Well, we have a two-carbon chain, and there's all single
0:12
bonds, so we're dealing with an ethane.
0:16
Actually, I'll write it all at once.
0:18
And then we have on the one carbon, we can call this the
0:21
one carbon, and call this the two carbon, we have a bromine
0:25
and a fluorine.
0:26
So we could call this 1-bromo, and we're putting the bromo
0:34
instead of the fluoro because B comes before F
0:36
alphabetically.
0:37
1-bromo-1-fluoro, and then we're dealing with an ethane.
0:46
We have a two-carbon chain, all single bonds,
0:49
fluoroethane.
0:51
That's the name of that molecule there, just a review
0:54
of some of the earlier organic nomenclature
0:56
videos we had done.
0:57
Now, we know immediately, based on the last few videos,
1:00
that this is also a chiral carbon, and if we were to take
1:03
its mirror image, we would get another enantiomer of this
1:10
same molecule, or that they are enantiomers of each other.
1:13
So what is the mirror image of this
1:16
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane look like?
1:19
Well, you'd have the carbon right here.
1:23
I want to get all the colors right.
1:24
You would still have the bromine up above.
1:28
You would have this methyl group that's attached to the
1:31
carbon now pointing in the left direction, CH3.
1:35
The fluorine would now still be behind the carbon, and now
1:42
the hydrogen would still pop out of the page, but it would
1:44
now pop out and to the right.
1:51
That is the hydrogen.
1:53
Now, based on our naming so far, we would name this
1:56
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, and we would also name this
2:01
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, but these are fundamentally two
2:08
different molecules.
2:09
Even though they have the same molecules in them; they have
2:12
the same molecular formula; they have the same
2:15
constitution in that this carbon is connected to a
2:19
hydrogen, a fluorine, and a bromine; this carbon is
2:21
connected to the same things; this carbon is connected to a
2:24
carbon, three hydrogens; so is this one; these are
2:28
stereoisomers.
2:29
These are stereoisomers, and they're mirror images of each
2:32
other, so they're enantiomers.
2:37
And actually, they will, one, polarize light differently,
2:40
and they actually can often have very different chemical
2:45
properties, either in a chemical or biological system.
2:47
So it seems not good that we have the same
2:52
names for both of these.
2:53
So what we're going to focus on in this video is how do you
2:55
differentiate between the two?
3:01
So how do we differentiate between the two?
3:04
So the naming system we're going to use right here is
3:07
called the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, but it's a different
3:12
Cahn, it's not me.
3:13
It's C-A-H-N instead of K-H-A-N.
3:17
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, and it's a way of differentiating
3:26
between this enantiomer, which right now we would call
3:29
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, and this enantiomer,
3:32
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane.
3:34
It's a pretty straightforward thing.
3:36
Really, the hardest part is to just visualize rotating the
3:39
molecules in the right way and figuring out in which
3:41
direction it's kind of-- whether it's kind of a
3:43
left-handed or right-handed molecule.
3:45
We're going to take it step by step.
3:46
So the first thing you do in the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system
3:50
is to, one, identify your chiral molecule.
3:56
Here, it's pretty obvious.
3:57
It's this carbon right here.
4:00
We'll just focus on this left one, the one we started with
4:03
first. It's bonded to three different groups.
4:06
And then what you want to do is you want to rank the groups
4:09
by atomic number.
4:11
So if you go up here, out of bromine, hydrogen, fluorine,
4:18
and a carbon, this is what is bonded directly to this
4:21
carbon, which has the highest atomic number?
4:23
Bromine is over here-- let me do this in a darker color.
4:27
We have bromine at 35, we have fluorine at 9, we have carbon
4:32
at 6, and then we have hydrogen at 1.
4:37
So of all these, bromine is the largest. We'll just call
4:40
this number one.
4:42
Then after that, we have fluorine.
4:44
That is the number two.
4:46
Number three is the carbon.
4:49
And then hydrogen is the smallest, so
4:51
that is number four.
4:55
So now that we've numbered them, the next step is to
4:58
orient this molecule so that the smallest atomic number
5:01
group is sitting into the page.
5:04
It's sitting behind the molecule.
5:08
Right now, this hydrogen is the smallest of all of them.
5:11
Bromine's the largest, hydrogen is the smallest, so
5:13
we want to orient it behind the molecule.
5:15
The way it's drawn right now, it's oriented in
5:17
front of the molecule.
5:18
So to orient it behind the molecule, and this really is
5:21
the hardest part is just to visualize it properly.
5:23
Remember, this fluorine is behind; this is right in the
5:25
plane of the paper; this is popping out of the paper.
5:30
We would want to rotate.
5:31
You could imagine we'd be rotating the molecule in this
5:36
direction so that-- let me redraw it.
5:44
We have the carbon here.
5:46
And now since we've rotated it like this, we've rotated it
5:49
roughly 1/3 around the circle, so it's about 120 degrees.
5:54
Now, this hydrogen is where the fluorine was.
6:01
So that's where the hydrogen is.
6:02
The fluorine is now where this methyl group is.
6:10
These dotted lines show that we're behind now.
6:11
This shows that we're in the plane.
6:13
And the methyl group is now where the hydrogen is.
6:15
It's now popping out of the page.
6:16
It's going to the left and out.
6:18
So this methyl group is now popping out of the page, out
6:24
and to the left.
6:25
That's where our methyl group is.
6:27
So all we've done is we've just rotated this around about
6:29
120 degrees.
6:30
We've just gotten this to go behind, and that's kind of the
6:33
first step after we've identified the chiral carbon
6:36
and ranked them by atomic number.
6:38
And.
6:38
Of course.
6:38
The bromine is still going to be on top.
6:43
Now, once you put the smallest atomic number molecule in the
6:47
back, then you want to look at the rankings
6:49
of one through three.
6:50
And we have four molecules here.
6:52
We look at the largest, which is bromine, number one.
6:57
Then number two is fluorine, number two, and then number
7:00
three is this methyl group.
7:01
That's the carbon that's bonded to this carbon, so it's
7:04
number three right there.
7:06
And in the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, we literally just
7:10
think about what would it take to go from number one to
7:12
number two to number three?
7:13
And in this case, we would go in this direction.
7:16
To go from number one to number two to number three, we
7:19
would go in the clockwise direction.
7:21
We're just ignoring the hydrogen right now.
7:22
That's just sitting behind it.
7:24
That was the first step, to orient it so it's sitting in
7:26
the back, the smallest molecule.
7:28
And then the three largest ones, you just say what
7:30
direction do we have to go to go from number one to number
7:32
two to number three?
7:33
In this case, we have to go clockwise.
7:37
And if we go clockwise now, then we call this a
7:42
right-handed molecule, or we use the Latin word for right,
7:46
which is rectus.
7:49
And so we would call this molecule right here not just
7:54
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, this is R, R for rectus.
8:00
Or you could even think right, although we'll see left is
8:03
used as S, which is sinister, so the Latin is really where
8:05
the R comes from.
8:07
But this is (R)-1-bromo-1-fluoroethane
8:18
That's this one right here.
8:19
So you might guess, well, this must be the opposite, this
8:21
must be the counterclockwise version.
8:23
We can do it really fast.
8:24
So same idea.
8:26
We know the largest one.
8:28
Bromine is number one.
8:29
That's the largest in terms of atomic number.
8:32
Fluorine is number two.
8:34
Carbon is number three.
8:36
Hydrogen is number four.
8:38
What we want to do is put hydrogen in the back, so what
8:40
we're going to have to do is rotate it to the back to where
8:43
fluorine is right now.
8:45
So if we had to redraw this molecule right here, you'd
8:48
have your carbon still.
8:49
You still have your bromine sitting on top.
8:52
But we're going to put the hydrogen now to the back, so
8:55
the hydrogen is now where the fluorine used to be.
8:59
The hydrogen's there.
9:05
This methyl group, this carbon with the three hydrogens, is
9:08
going to be rotated to where the hydrogen used to be.
9:12
It's now going to pop out of the page, because we're
9:15
rotating it in that direction, so this is our methyl group
9:18
right there.
9:19
And then this fluorine is going to be moved where the
9:21
methyl group was, so this fluorine will go right here.
9:26
And now, using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system,
9:30
this is our number one, this is our number two, just by
9:33
atomic number, this is number three.
9:35
You go from number one through number two to number three.
9:38
You go in this direction.
9:40
You're going counterclockwise.
9:45
Or we are going to the left, or we use the Latin word for
9:48
it, which is sinister.
9:51
And the word sinister comes from the Latin word for left,
9:54
so I guess right is good, and people thought either
9:57
left-handed people were bad, or if you're not going to the
9:59
right, it's bad.
9:59
I don't know why sinister took on its sinister meaning now in
10:04
common language.
10:05
But it's now the sinister version of the molecule.
10:09
So we would call this version, this enantiomer of
10:12
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, we would call this S, S for
10:19
sinister, or for left, or for counterclockwise:
10:22
(S)-1-bromo-1-fluoroethane.
10:31
So now we can differentiate the names.
10:33
We know that these are two different configurations.
10:38
And that's what the S and the R tell us, that if you have to
10:40
go from this to this, you would literally have to detach
10:43
and reattach different groups.
10:45
You'd actually have to break bonds.
10:46
You actually have to swap two of these groups in some way in
10:50
order to get from this enantiomer to this enantiomer.
10:53
They're different configurations, really
10:55
fundamentally different molecules, stereoisomers,
10:58
enantiomers, however you want to--",How does changing the position of the atoms change what a molecule does?

0:59
or whatever.
1:00
In the world there's this pool of savings

they're like ""y'know what, if I could just get...""

2:14
to the world, and the world has given them trinkets
2:17
whether it's gold coins or paper money
2:19
lets just say it's gold
2:20
and I want to make this point because everyone always talks about gold
2:25
as if it's something special, as if it really represents wealth
2:30
while paper money really does not represent wealth
2:32
and that's just not true
2:33
there's nothing about gold
2:35
gold is not useful, other than the fact that it's pretty
2:38
that's the only thing that makes gold useful
2:40
actually it's pretty and it's hard to counterfeit
2:42
Paper money, not so pretty, but it has other advantages
2:45
it's lighter, and at least the paper money we use now, is not so easy to counterfeit
2:51
People always somehow feel that gold is somehow better than paper money
2:59
and we'll talk in the future about inflation and deflation
3:01
and the fact that there is a constraint on how much gold can be produced
3:05
but you can print money
3:07
but we'll talk about that in a little bit.
3:09
So in our modern world, savings are these green pieces of paper
3:13
but lets say we're talking about some primitive culture
3:15
and they're using gold
3:17
so a bunch of people perform a bunch of goods and services
3:21
and they get these little coins
3:22
and these coins are essentially this society's way of agreeing
3:26
if you have one of these coins
3:27
in the future, if you give this coin to someone else
3:30
they'll do something for you
3:32
and how much of that coin you have to give
3:34
for them to do this is based on supply and demand and price.

This is a picture of a Gottfried Leibnitz,

super famous, or maybe not as famous,

0:14
and mathematician, and he was a contemporary of Isaac Newton.
0:17
These two gentlemen together were really
0:19
the founding fathers of calculus.
0:22
And they did some of their-- most of their major work
0:25
in the late 1600s.
0:27
And this right over here is Usain Bolt, Jamaican sprinter,
0:31
whose continuing to do some of his best work in 2012.
0:35
And as of early 2012, he's the fastest human alive,
0:38
and he's probably the fastest human that has ever lived.
0:41
And you might have not made the association with these three
0:45
gentleman.
0:45
You might not think that they have a lot in common.
0:48
But they were all obsessed with the same fundamental question.
0:52
And this is the same fundamental question
0:54
that differential calculus addresses.
0:56
And the question is, what is the instantaneous rate
1:00
of change of something?
1:01
And in the case of Usain Bolt, how fast is he going right now?
1:05
Not just what his average speed was for the last second,
1:08
or his average speed over the next 10 seconds.
1:10
How fast is he going right now?
1:14
And so this is what differential calculus is all about.
1:17
Instantaneous rates of change.
1:19
Differential calculus.
1:23
Newton's actual original term for differential calculus
1:26
was the method of fluxions, which
1:28
actually sounds a little bit fancier.
1:31
But it's all about what's happening in this instant.
1:37
And to think about why that is not a super easy problem
1:40
to address with traditional algebra, let's
1:42
draw a little graph here.
1:44
So on this axis I'll have distance.
1:49
I'll say y is equal to distance.
1:51
I could have said d is equal to distance,
1:53
but we'll see, especially later on in calculus,
1:55
d is reserved for something else.
1:57
We'll say y is equal to distance.
1:59
And in this axis, we'll say time.
2:01
And I could say t is equal to time,
2:02
but I'll just say x is equal to time.
2:07
And so if we were to plot Usain Bolt's distance
2:09
as a function of time, well at time zero
2:12
he hasn't gone anywhere.
2:13
He is right over there.
2:16
And we know that this gentleman is
2:17
capable of traveling 100 meters in 9.58 seconds.
2:23
So after 9.58 seconds, we'll assume
2:25
that this is in seconds right over here,
2:27
he's capable of going 100 meters.
2:32
And so using this information, we
2:33
can actually figure out his average speed.
2:37
Let me write it this way, his average speed
2:41
is just going to be his change in distance
2:46
over his change in time.
2:50
And using the variables that are over here,
2:52
we're saying y is distance.
2:53
So this is the same thing as change
2:54
in y over change in x from this point to that point.
2:59
And this might look somewhat familiar to you
3:01
from basic algebra.
3:02
This is the slope between these two points.
3:05
If I have a line that connects these two points,
3:11
this is the slope of that line.
3:13
The change in distance is this right over here.
3:15
Change in y is equal to 100 meters.
3:19
And our change in time is this right over here.
3:22
So our change in time is equal to 9.58 seconds.
3:27
We started at 0, we go to 9.58 seconds.
3:30
Another way to think about it, the rise over the run you might
3:33
have heard in your algebra class.
3:34
It's going to be 100 meters over 9.58 seconds.
3:37
So this is 100 meters over 9.58 seconds.
3:43
And the slope is essentially just rate of change,
3:45
or you could view it as the average rate
3:47
of change between these two points.
3:49
And you'll see, if you even just follow the units,
3:51
it gives you units of speed here.
3:54
It would be velocity if we also specified the direction.
3:57
And we can figure out what that is,
3:58
let me get the calculator out.
4:02
So let me get the calculator on the screen.
4:06
So we're going 100 meters in the 9.58 seconds.
4:13
So it's 10.4, I'll just write 10.4, I'll round to 10.4.
4:17
So it's approximately 10.4, and then the units
4:20
are meters per second.
4:23
And that is his average speed.
4:26
And what we're going to see in a second
4:28
is how average speed is different
4:31
than instantaneous speed.
4:32
How it's different than what the speed
4:34
he might be going at any given moment.
4:36
And just to have a concept of how fast this is,
4:38
let me get the calculator back.
4:40
This is in meters per second.
4:41
If you wanted to know how many meters he's going in an hour,
4:43
well there's 3,600 seconds in an hour.
4:48
So he'll be able to go this many meters 3,600 times.
4:51
So that's how many meters he can,
4:53
if he were able to somehow keep up that speed in an hour.
4:56
This is how fast he's going meters per hour.
4:58
And then, if you were to say how many miles per hour,
5:01
there's roughly 1600-- and I don't know the exact number,
5:03
but roughly 1600 meters per mile.
5:06
So let's divide it by 1600.
5:08
And so you see that this is roughly a little over 23,
5:11
about 23 and 1/2 miles per hour.
5:14
So this is approximately, and I'll
5:16
write it this way-- this is approximately 23.5 miles
5:28
per hour.
5:29
And relative to a car, not so fast.
5:31
But relative to me, extremely fast.
5:34
Now to see how this is different than instantaneous velocity,
5:38
let's think about a potential plot of his distance
5:41
relative to time.
5:42
He's not going to just go this speed immediately.
5:44
He's not just going to go as soon as the gun fires,
5:46
he's not just going to go 23 and 1/2 miles per hour all the way.
5:49
He's going to accelerate.
5:51
So at first he's going to start off going a little bit slower.
5:54
So the slope is going to be a little bit lot lower
5:56
than the average slope.
5:57
He's going to go a little bit slower,
5:58
then he's going to start accelerating.
6:00
And so his speed, and you'll see the slope here
6:02
is getting steeper and steeper and steeper.
6:05
And then maybe near the end he starts tiring off a little bit.
6:09
And so his distance plotted against time
6:11
might be a curve that looks something like this.
6:14
And what we calculated here is just
6:15
the average slope across this change in time.
6:20
What we could see at any given moment
6:21
the slope is actually different.
6:23
In the beginning, he has a slower rate
6:26
of change of distance.
6:28
Then over here, then he accelerates over here,
6:30
it seems like his rate of change of distance, which
6:32
would be roughly-- or you could view it
6:34
as the slope of the tangent line at that point,
6:36
it looks higher than his average.
6:38
And then he starts to slow down again.
6:40
When you average it out, it gets to 23 and 1/2 miles per hour.
6:43
And I looked it up, Usain Bolt's instantaneous velocity,
6:46
his peak instantaneous velocity, is actually
6:49
closer to 30 miles per hour.
6:51
So the slope over here might be 23 whatever miles per hour.
6:54
But the instantaneous, his fastest point
6:57
in this 9.58 seconds is closer to 30 miles per hour.
7:01
But you see it's not a trivial thing to do.
7:03
You could say, OK, let me try to approximate the slope right
7:06
over here.
7:07
And you could do that by saying, OK, well,
7:09
what is the change in y over the change of x right around this?
7:13
So you could say, well, let me take some change of x,
7:18
and figure out what the change of y is around it,
7:20
or as we go past that.
7:23
So you get that.
7:23
But that would just be an approximation,
7:25
because you see that the slope of this curve
7:27
is constantly changing.
7:28
So what you want to do is see what
7:30
happens as your change of x gets smaller
7:32
and smaller and smaller.
7:33
As your change of x get smaller and smaller and smaller,
7:35
you're going to get a better and better approximation.
7:37
Your change of y is going to get smaller
7:39
and smaller and smaller.
7:40
So what you want to do, and we're
7:41
going to go into depth into all of this,
7:43
and study it more rigorously, is you
7:44
want to take the limit as delta x approaches
7:49
0 of your change in y over your change in x.
7:57
And when you do that, you're going
8:00
to approach that instantaneous rate of change.
8:02
You could view it as the instantaneous slope
8:04
at that point in the curve.
8:06
Or the slope of the tangent line at that point in the curve.
8:08
Or if we use calculus terminology,
8:10
we would view that as the derivative.
8:12
So the instantaneous slope is the derivative.
8:17
And the notation we use for the derivative is a dy over dx.
8:22
And that's why I reserved the letter y.
8:24
And then you say, well, how does this
8:25
relate to the word differential?
8:28
Well, the word differential is relating--
8:30
this dy is a differential, dx is a differential.
8:33
And one way to conceptualize it, this
8:35
is an infinitely small change in y
8:37
over an infinitely small change in x.
8:40
And by getting super, super small changes in y
8:42
over change in x, you're able to get your instantaneous slope.
8:46
Or in the case of this example, the instantaneous speed
8:49
of Usain Bolt right at that moment.
8:53
And notice, you can't just put a 0 here.
8:55
If you just put change in x is zero,
8:56
you're going to get something that's undefined.
8:58
You can't divide by 0.
9:00
So we take the limit as it approaches 0.
9:02
And we'll define that more rigorously
9:04
in the next few videos.",Where do we use limits in civil engineering?

500 years ago,

trans-oceanic travel became a reality.
0:16
Since the end of the last Ice Age,
0:19
farming societies have been absorbing their neighbors,

making populations more similar within continents.
0:29
That when people began to cross oceans, in large numbers,
0:34
the genetic and cultural differences

and sometimes they found lands occupied,

And sometimes they found land and labor,

Let's give ourselves a little bit
0:02
of practice with percentages.
0:04
So let's ask ourselves, what percent of-- I don't know,
0:13
let's say what percent of 16 is 4?
0:18
And I encourage you to pause this video
0:20
and to try it out yourself.
0:22
So when you're saying what percent of 16 is 4,
0:25
percent is another way of saying, what fraction of 16
0:29
is 4?
0:30
And we just need to write it as a percent, as per 100.
0:35
So if you said what fraction of 16 is 4, you would say,
0:39
well, look, this is the same thing as 4/16,
0:43
which is the same thing as 1/4.
0:48
But this is saying what fraction 4 is of 16.
0:51
You'd say, well, 4 is 1/4 of 16.
0:53
But that still doesn't answer our question.
0:55
What percent?
0:58
So in order to write this as a percent,
0:59
we literally have to write it as something over 100.
1:03
Percent literally means ""per cent.""
1:05
The word ""cent"" you know from cents and century.
1:08
It relates to the number 100.
1:10
So it's per 100.
1:12
So you could say, well, this is going
1:13
to be equal to question mark over 100, the part of 100.
1:19
And there's a bunch of ways that you could think about this.
1:21
You could say, well, look, if in the denominator
1:23
to go from 4 to 100, I have to multiply by 25.
1:27
In the numerator to go from-- I need
1:30
to also multiply by 25 in order to have an equivalent fraction.
1:34
So I'm also going to multiply by 25.
1:37
So 1/4 is the same thing as 25/100.
1:40
And another way of saying 25/100 is this is 25 per 100, or 25%.
1:48
So this is equal to 25%.
1:52
Now, there's a couple of other ways
1:53
you could have thought about it.
1:55
You could have said well, 4/16, this
2:00
is literally 4 divided by 16.
2:02
Well, let me just do the division
2:04
and convert to a decimal, which is
2:05
very easy to convert to a percentage.
2:08
So let's try to actually do this division right over here.
2:10
So we're going to literally divide 4 by 16.
2:15
Now, 16 goes into 4 zero times.
2:18
0 times 16 is 0.
2:20
You subtract, and you get a 4.
2:22
And we're not satisfied just having this remainder.
2:24
We want to keep adding zeroes to get a decimal answer right over
2:30
here.
2:31
So let's put a decimal right over here.
2:33
We're going into the tenths place.
2:35
And let's throw some zeroes right over here.
2:38
The decimal makes sure we keep track of the fact
2:41
that we are now in the tenths, and in the hundredths,
2:43
and in the thousandths place if we have to go that far.
2:45
But let's bring another 0 down.
2:47
16 goes into 40 two times.
2:51
2 times 16 is 32.
2:54
If you subtract, you get 8.
2:57
And you could bring down another 0.
2:59
And we have 16 goes into 80.
3:03
Let's see, 16 goes into 80 five times.
3:08
5 times 16 is 80.
3:11
You subtract, you have no remainder, and you're done.
3:14
4/16 is the same thing as 0.25.
3:17
Now, 0.25 is the same thing as twenty-five hundredths.
3:21
Or, this is the same thing as 25/100,
3:26
which is the same thing as 25%.",25% of what number is 80?

In the last few videos we learned that
0:02
the configuration of electrons in an atom
0:05
aren't in a simple, classical,
0:08
Newtonian orbit configuration.
0:10
And that's the Bohr model of the electron.
0:12
And I'll keep reviewing it,
0:13
just because I think it's an important point.
0:14
If that's the nucleus, remember,
0:16
it's just a tiny, tiny, tiny dot
0:17
if you think about the entire volume of the actual atom.
0:21
And instead of the electron being in orbits around it,
0:24
which would be how a planet orbits the sun.
0:29
Instead of being in orbits around it,
0:31
it's described by orbitals,
0:33
which are these probability density functions.
0:36
So an orbital-- let's say that's the nucleus
0:39
it would describe,
0:42
if you took any point in space around the nucleus,
0:45
the probability of finding the electron.
0:48
So actually, in any volume of space around the nucleus,
0:53
it would tell you the probability
0:54
of finding the electron within that volume.
0:56
And so if you were to just take
0:58
a bunch of snapshots of electrons
1:00
-- let's say in the 1s orbital.
1:03
And that's what the 1s orbital looks like.
1:05
You can barely see it there,
1:08
but it's a sphere around the nucleus,
1:10
and that's the lowest energy state that an electron can be in.
1:14
If you were to just take a number of snapshots of electrons.
1:16
Let's say you were to take a number of snapshots of helium,
1:21
which has two electrons.
1:22
Both of them are in the 1s orbital.
1:25
It would look like this.
1:26
If you took one snapshot, maybe it'll be there,
1:28
the next snapshot, maybe the electron is there.
1:30
Then the electron is there.
1:32
Then the electron is there. Then it's there.
1:34
And if you kept doing the snapshots,
1:35
you would have a bunch of them really close.
1:37
And then it gets a little bit sparser as you get out,
1:40
as you get further and further out away from the electron.
1:44
But as you see, you're much more likely
1:47
to find the electron close to
1:50
the center of the atom than further out.
1:54
Although you might have had an observation with the electron
1:56
sitting all the way out there, or sitting over here.
1:58
So it really could have been anywhere,
1:59
but if you take multiple observations,
2:01
you'll see what that probability function is describing.
2:04
It's saying look, there's a much lower probability of
2:07
finding the electron out in this little cube of volume space
2:11
than it is in this little cube of volume space.
2:14
And when you see these diagrams
2:16
that draw this orbital like this.
2:18
Let's say they draw it like a shell, like a sphere.
2:23
And I'll try to make it look three-dimensional.
2:25
So let's say this is the outside of it,
2:27
and the nucleus is sitting some place on the inside.
2:29
They're just saying -- they just draw a cut-off
2:32
-- where can I find the electron 90% of the time?
2:35
So they're saying, OK, I can find the electron
2:36
90% of the time within this circle,
2:38
if I were to do the cross-section.
2:40
But every now and then the electron
2:42
can show up outside of that, right?
2:44
Because it's all probabilistic.
2:45
So this can still happen.
2:46
You can still find the electron
2:47
if this is the orbital we're talking about out here.
2:51
Right?
2:52
And then we, in the last video, we said,
2:54
OK, the electrons fill up the orbitals
2:57
from lowest energy state to high energy state.
3:05
You could imagine it. If I'm playing Tetris--
3:09
well I don't know if Tetris is the thing--
3:10
but if I'm stacking cubes, I lay out cubes from low energy,
3:14
if this is the floor,
3:15
I put the first cube at the lowest energy state.
3:17
And let's say I could put the second cube
3:21
at a low energy state here.
3:21
But I only have this much space to work with.
3:27
So I have to put the third cube
3:28
at the next highest energy state.
3:30
In this case our energy would
3:32
be described as potential energy, right?
3:34
This is just a classical, Newtonian physics example.
3:36
But that's the same idea with electrons.
3:39
Once I have two electrons in this 1s orbital
3:44
-- so let's say the electron configuration of helium is 1s2
3:49
-- the third electron I can't put there anymore,
3:52
because there's only room for two electrons.
3:54
The way I think about it is these two electrons are now
3:57
going to repel the third one I want to add.
3:59
So then I have to go to the 2s orbital.
4:02
And now if I were to plot the 2s orbital on top of this one,
4:06
it would look something like this,
4:07
where I have a high probability
4:08
of finding the electrons in this shell
4:12
that's essentially around the 1s orbital, right?
4:19
So right now, if maybe I'm dealing with lithium right now.
4:23
So I only have one extra electron.
4:24
So this one extra electron,
4:25
that might be where I observed that extra electron.
4:29
But every now and then it could show up there,
4:31
it could show up there, it could show up there,
4:32
but the high probability is there.
4:34
So when you say where is it going to be 90% of the time?
4:37
It'll be like this shell that's around the center.
4:39
Remember, when it's three-dimensional
4:40
you would kind of cover it up.
4:42
So it would be this shell.
4:42
So that's what they drew here.
4:45
They do the 1s.
4:47
It's just a red shell.
4:49
And then the 2s.
4:50
The second energy shell is just this blue shell over it.
4:53
And you can see it a little bit better in, actually,
4:55
the higher energy orbits, the higher energy shells,
4:57
where the seventh s energy shell is this red area.
5:02
Then you have the blue area, then the red, and the blue.
5:04
And so I think you get the idea
5:05
that each of those are energy shells.
5:07
So you kind of keep overlaying
5:09
the s energy orbitals around each other.
5:11
But you probably see this other stuff here.
5:14
And the general principle, remember,
5:15
is that the electrons fill up the orbital
5:18
from lowest energy orbital to higher energy orbital.
5:21
So the first one that's filled up is the 1s.
5:24
This is the 1.
5:26
This is the s.
5:27
So this is the 1s.
5:28
It can fit two electrons.
5:30
Then the next one that's filled up is 2s.
5:32
It can fill two more electrons.
5:34
And then the next one, and this is where it gets interesting,
5:37
you fill up the 2p orbital.
5:40
2p orbital.
5:42
That's this, right here.
5:44
2p orbitals.
5:46
And notice the p orbitals have something,
5:49
p sub z, p sub x, p sub y.
5:53
What does that mean?
5:55
Well, if you look at the p-orbitals,
5:57
they have these dumbbell shapes.
5:58
They look a little unnatural, but I think in future videos
6:00
we'll show you how they're analogous to standing waves.
6:03
But if you look at these, there's three ways
6:06
that you can configure these dumbbells.
6:08
One in the z direction, up and down.
6:09
One in the x direction, left or right.
6:11
And then one in the y direction,
6:13
this way, forward and backwards, right?
6:16
And so if you were to draw--
6:17
let's say you wanted to draw the p-orbitals.
6:20
So this is what you fill next.
6:22
And actually, you fill one electron here,
6:24
another electron here, then another electron there.
6:26
Then you fill another electron,
6:28
and we'll talk about spin and things like that in the future.
6:30
But, there, there, and there.
6:32
And that's actually called Hund's rule.
6:34
Maybe I'll do a whole video on Hund's rule,
6:36
but that's not relevant to a first-year chemistry lecture.
6:39
But it fills in that order, and once again,
6:42
I want you to have the intuition of what this would look like.
6:46
Look.
6:47
I should put look in quotation marks,
6:50
because it's very abstract.
6:52
But if you wanted to visualize the p orbitals--
6:54
let's say we're looking at
6:56
the electron configuration for, let's say, carbon.
7:01
So the electron configuration for carbon,
7:04
the first two electrons go into, so, 1s1, 1s2.
7:09
So then it fills-- sorry, you can't see everything.
7:13
So it fills the 1s2, so carbon's configuration.
7:20
It fills 1s1 then 1s2.
7:23
And this is just the configuration for helium.
7:26
And then it goes to the second shell,
7:28
which is the second period, right?
7:30
That's why it's called the periodic table.
7:32
We'll talk about periods and groups in the future.
7:34
And then you go here.
7:35
So this is filling the 2s.
7:38
We're in the second period right here.
7:40
That's the second period.
7:41
One, two.
7:43
Have to go off, so you can see everything.
7:45
So it fills these two.
7:47
So 2s2.
7:50
And then it starts filling up the p orbitals.
7:52
So then it starts filling 1p and then 2p.
7:56
And we're still on the second shell, so 2s2, 2p2.
8:01
So the question is what would this look like
8:04
if we just wanted to visualize this orbital
8:07
right here, the p orbitals?
8:08
So we have two electrons.
8:11
So one electron is going to be in a-- Let's say if this is,
8:14
I'll try to draw some axes.
8:16
That's too thin.
8:20
So if I draw a three-dimensional volume kind of axes.
8:28
If I were to make a bunch of observations of, say,
8:30
one of the electrons in the p orbitals,
8:33
let's say in the pz dimension,
8:35
sometimes it might be here, sometimes it might be there,
8:38
sometimes it might be there.
8:39
And then if you keep taking a bunch of observations,
8:46
you're going to have something that looks like this bell shape,
8:51
this barbell shape right there.
8:53
And then for the other electron
8:55
that's maybe in the x direction,
8:58
you make a bunch of observations.
9:00
Let me do it in a different,
9:01
in a noticeably different, color.
9:03
It will look like this.
9:04
You take a bunch of observations, and you say,
9:06
wow, it's a lot more likely to find that
9:09
electron in kind of the dumbell, in that dumbbell shape.
9:12
But you could find it out there.
9:13
You could find it there.
9:14
You could find it there.
9:15
This is just a much higher probability of
9:17
finding it in here than out here.
9:19
And that's the best way I can think of to visualize it.
9:23
Now what we were doing here,
9:25
this is called an electron configuration.
9:27
And the way to do it-- and there's multiple ways that are
9:30
taught in chemistry class, but the way I like to do it
9:33
-- is you take the periodic table and you say, these groups,
9:40
and when I say groups I mean the columns,
9:42
these are going to fill the s subshell or the s orbitals.
9:51
You can just write s up here, just right there.
9:53
These over here are going to fill the p orbitals.
9:59
Actually, let me take helium out of the picture.
10:01
The p orbitals.
10:03
Let me just do that.
10:04
Let me take helium out of the picture.
10:05
These take the p orbitals.
10:07
And actually, for the sake of figuring out these,
10:09
you should take helium and throw it right over there.
10:12
Right?
10:13
The periodic table is just a way
10:14
to organize things so it makes sense,
10:16
but in terms of trying to figure out orbitals,
10:18
you could take helium.
10:19
Let me do that.
10:20
The magic of computers.
10:22
Cut it out, and then let me paste it right over there.
10:27
Right?
10:29
And now you see that helium, you get 1s and then you get 2s,
10:33
so helium's configuration is
10:34
-- Sorry, you get 1s1, then 1s2.
10:38
We're in the first energy shell.
10:40
Right?
10:41
So the configuration of hydrogen is 1s1.
10:50
You only have one electron
10:52
in the s subshell of the first energy shell.
10:58
The configuration of helium is 1s2.
11:02
And then you start filling the second energy shell.
11:06
The configuration of lithium is 1s2.
11:12
That's where the first two electrons go.
11:13
And then the third one goes into 2s1, right?
11:18
And then I think you start to see the pattern.
11:20
And then when you go to nitrogen you say,
11:24
OK, it has three in the p sub-orbital.
11:29
So you can almost start backwards, right?
11:31
So we're in period two, right?
11:36
So this is 2p3.
11:39
Let me write that down.
11:40
So I could write that down first. 2p3.
11:45
So that's where the last three electrons
11:47
go into the p orbital.
11:48
Then it'll have these two that go into the 2s2 orbital.
11:57
And then the first two, or the electrons
12:01
in the lowest energy state, will be 1s2.
12:06
So this is the electron configuration,
12:07
right here, of nitrogen.
12:11
And just to make sure you did your configuration right,
12:15
what you do is you count the number of electrons.
12:17
So 2 plus 2 is 4 plus 3 is 7.
12:20
And we're talking about neutral atoms,
12:22
so the electrons should equal the number of protons.
12:24
The atomic number is the number of protons.
12:27
So we're good.
12:28
Seven protons. So this is, so far,
12:30
when we're dealing just with the s's and the p's,
12:32
this is pretty straightforward.
12:34
And if I wanted to figure out the configuration of silicon,
12:39
right there, what is it?
12:42
Well, we're in the third period.
12:43
One, two, three.
12:46
That's just the third row.
12:47
And this is the p-block right here.
12:50
So this is the second row in the p-block, right?
12:52
One, two, three, four, five, six.
12:54
Right.
12:56
We're in the second row of the p-block,
12:57
so we start off with 3p2.
13:03
And then we have 3s2.
13:08
And then it filled up all of this p-block over here.
13:10
So it's 2p6.
13:14
And then here, 2s2.
13:17
And then, of course, it filled up at the first shell
13:19
before it could fill up these other shells.
13:20
So, 1s2.
13:21
So this is the electron configuration for silicon.
13:26
And we can confirm that we should have 14 electrons.
13:29
2 plus 2 is 4, plus 6 is 10.
13:33
10 plus 2 is 12 plus 2 more is 14.
13:38
So we're good with silicon.
13:40
I think I'm running low on time right now,
13:42
so in the next video we'll start addressing what happens
13:44
when you go to these elements, or the d-block.
13:47
And you can kind of already guess what happens.
13:50
We're going to start filling up these d orbitals here
13:54
that have even more bizarre shapes.
13:56
And the way I think about this, not to waste too much time,
13:59
is that as you go further and further out from the nucleus,
14:03
there's more space in between the lower energy orbitals
14:06
to fill in more of these bizarro-shaped orbitals.
14:10
But these are kind of the balance --
14:12
I will talk about standing waves in the future
14:14
-- but these are kind of a balance between trying to
14:16
get close to the nucleus
14:18
and the proton and those positive charges,
14:20
because the electron charges are attracted to them,
14:22
while at the same time avoiding the other electron charges,
14:25
or at least their mass distribution functions.
14:27
Anyway, see you in the next video.",Do the electrons in the 2s orbital ever have any probability of being in the 1st orbital?
khan_video_G2ZXpbMukEQ_0,Math,ESSAY,"•
0:00
- [Voiceover] So we have here f of x
0:01
being equal to the natural log of the square root of x.
0:06
And what we wanna do in this video
0:07
is find the derivative of f.
0:09
And the key here is to recognize that f can actually
0:14
be viewed as a composition of two functions.
0:17
And we can diagram that out, what's going on here?
0:20
Well if you input an x into our function f,
0:23
what's the first thing that you do?
0:24
Well, you take the square root of it.
0:26
So if we start off with some x, you input it,
0:32
the first thing that you do, you take the square root of it.
0:35
You are going to take the square root of the input
0:39
to produce the square root of x,
0:43
and then what do you do?
0:44
You take the square root and then
0:46
you take the natural log of that.
0:48
So then you take the natural log of that,
0:51
so you could view that as inputting it
0:53
into another function that takes the natural log
0:55
of whatever is inputted in.
0:57
I'm making these little squares to
0:58
show what you do with the input.
1:00
And then what do you produce?
1:02
Well you produce the natural log of the square root of x.
1:06
Natural log of the square root of x.
1:10
Which is equal to f of x.
1:12
So you could view f of x as this entire set,
1:18
or this entire, I guess you could say,
1:20
this combination of functions right over there.
1:23
That is f of x, which is essentially,
1:27
a composition of two functions.
1:29
You're inputting into one function
1:31
then taking that output and inputting it into another.
1:34
So you could have a function u here,
1:36
which takes the square root of whatever its input is,
1:38
so u of x is equal to the square root of x.
1:43
And then you take that output,
1:47
and input it into another function that we could call v,
1:49
and what does v do?
1:51
Well it take the natural log of whatever the input is.
1:53
In this case, in the case of f, or in the case of how
1:57
I just diagrammed it, v is taking the natural log,
2:00
the input happens to be square root of x,
2:02
so it outputs the natural log of the square root of x.
2:05
If we wanted to write v with x as an input,
2:08
we would just say well that's the natural log,
2:10
that is just the natural log of x.
2:14
And as you can see here, f of x,
2:16
and I color-coded ahead of time,
2:17
is equal to, f of x is equal to,
2:22
the natural log of the square root of x.
2:24
So that is v of the square root of x, or v of u of x.
2:31
So it is a composition which tells you that,
2:33
okay, if I'm trying to find the derivative here,
2:36
the chain rule is going to be very, very, very, very useful.
2:39
And the chain rule tells us that f prime of x
2:43
is going to be equal to the derivative of,
2:47
you can view it as the outside function,
2:49
with respect to this inside function,
2:51
so it's going to be v prime of u of x,
2:55
v prime of u of x,
2:58
times the derivative of this inside function
3:01
with respect to x.
3:02
So that's just u prime, u prime of x.
3:06
So how do we evaluate these things?
3:08
Well, we know how to take the derivative of u of x
3:11
and v of x, u prime of x here, is going to be equal to,
3:16
well remember, square root of x is just the same thing
3:19
as x to 1/2 power, so we can use the power rule,
3:22
bring the 1/2 out from so it becomes 1/2 x to the,
3:26
and then take off one out of that exponent,
3:29
so that's 1/2 minus one is negative 1/2 power.
3:32
And what is v of x, sorry, what is v prime of x?
3:38
Well the derivative of the natural log of x
3:40
is one over x, we show that in other videos.
3:45
And so we now know what u prime of x is,
3:48
we know what v prime of x is, but what is v prime of u of x?
3:52
Well v prime of u of x, wherever we see the x,
3:58
we replace it, let me write that a little bit neater,
4:00
we replace that with a u of x, so v prime of u of x
4:05
is going to be equal to,
4:07
is going to be equal to one over u of x,
4:10
one over u of x, which is equal to,
4:15
which is equal to one over,
4:17
u of x is just the square root of x.
4:20
One over the square root of x.
4:24
This thing right over here, we have figured out,
4:29
is one over the square root of x,
4:31
and this thing, u prime of x, we figured out,
4:36
is 1/2 times x to the negative 1/2,
4:39
and x to the negative 1/2, I could rewrite that as 1/2
4:41
times one over x to the 1/2, which is the same thing
4:46
as 1/2 times one over the square root of x,
4:51
or I could write that as one over 2 square roots of x.
4:55
So what is this thing going to be?
4:58
Well this is going to be equal to, in green,
5:02
v prime of u of x is one over the square root of x,
5:07
times, times, u prime of x is one over two times
5:13
the square root of x, now what is this going to be equal to?
5:16
Well, this is going to be equal to,
5:19
this is just algebra at this point,
5:21
one over, we have our two and square root of x
5:24
times square root of x is just x.
5:26
So it just simplifies to one over two x.
5:29
So hopefully this made sense,
5:31
and I intentionally diagrammed it out
5:32
so that you start to get that muscle in your brain going
5:35
of recognizing the composite functions,
5:37
and then making a little bit more sense of
5:39
some of these expressions of the chain rule
5:41
that you might see in your calculus class,
5:43
or in your calculus textbook.
5:44
But as you get more practice, you'll be able to do it,
5:47
essentially, without having to write out all of this.
5:49
You'll say okay, look, I have a composition.
5:51
This is the natural log of the square root of x,
5:55
this is v of u of x.
5:57
So what I wanna do is I wanna take the derivative
6:00
of this outside function with respect
6:02
to this inside function.
6:03
So the derivative of natural log of something,
6:07
with respect to that something, is one over that something.
6:11
So it is one over that something,
6:14
the derivative natural log of something
6:16
with respect to that something is one over that something,
6:19
so that's what we just did here.
6:21
One way to think about it, what would natural log of x be?
6:24
Well that'd be one over x, but it's not natural log of x.
6:27
It's one over square root of x,
6:28
so it's going to be one over the square root of x,
6:31
so you take the derivative of the outside function
6:33
with respect to the inside one,
6:35
and then you multiply that times just the derivative
6:37
of the inside function with respect to x.
6:41
And we are done.","Using Leibniz' notation, is it correct to say that whatever is in the function bracket defines what the derivative has been taken with respect to?"

0:00
Where we left off in the last video,
0:02
I think we were getting a reasonably good appreciation
0:04
for how huge the sun is, especially
0:07
relative to the Earth, and how far the Earth is away
0:12
from the sun.
0:12
That most of these diagrams that we see in science textbooks--
0:16
they don't give justice.
0:17
In fact, when I showed this sun over here
0:20
that was about five or six inches across,
0:22
I said Earth would be just this little speck, about 40 feet.
0:27
It wouldn't be this distance.
0:28
It would be about 40 feet to the left or the right.
0:30
Or its orbit would have a radius of about 40 feet.
0:35
You wouldn't even notice it if you
0:36
were looking at this thing over here.
0:38
It would be this little speck orbiting
0:39
at this huge, huge distance.
0:42
If you look at this sun over here,
0:44
if I were to draw the whole sun, it
0:46
looks like it would have a diameter of about 20 inches.
0:49
So in this situation, this Earth right here-- and this
0:53
is drawn to scale-- this Earth would not
0:55
be anywhere near this close.
0:56
It would be about 200 feet that way, or about 60
1:02
or 70 meters, 60 meters.
1:06
So you can imagine if the sun was this size, sitting
1:08
on something like a football field,
1:10
this little speck of an Earth, this little thing right here,
1:13
would be sitting on the other 40-yard line, 60 meters away.
1:19
So you wouldn't even notice it.
1:21
You might notice this from a distance,
1:23
but you wouldn't even see this thing over here.
1:25
And the other planets are even further.
1:26
Well, not all of the other planets.
1:27
Obviously, you have Mercury.
1:31
I think most of us are familiar with these.
1:33
But I'll just list them here, just in case.
1:35
That's Mercury.
1:37
This is Venus.
1:38
Mercury is the smallest of the planets where it's not
1:40
debated whether it's a planet.
1:41
Pluto is the smallest, but some people
1:44
debate whether it's really a planet or just
1:46
a large solar body or a dwarf planet
1:48
or any of those type of things.
1:50
But then you have Venus, probably the closest in size
1:53
to the Earth.
1:54
Or it is the closest in size to the Earth.
1:56
And then you have Mars.
1:59
And then you have Jupiter.
2:00
And just to give a sense of, once again,
2:02
how far these things are, if I were to go back
2:05
to the analogy of this being the size of the sun,
2:08
then Jupiter is five times further than Earth.
2:11
So this would be-- If I were to actually do the scale distance,
2:15
this would be 300 meters away.
2:19
So if I had a nice, big, maybe medicine-balled-size sun
2:23
right over here, maybe basketball-sized.
2:25
A little bit bigger than a basketball,
2:27
this looks on my screen-- then this little thing
2:31
that's smaller than a ping pong ball,
2:33
I would put this three football fields away.
2:36
That's how far Jupiter is.
2:38
And then Saturn's about twice as far as that.
2:40
Saturn is about nine times the distance.
2:42
So let me make it clear.
2:45
The Earth is one astronomical unit away from the sun,
2:48
roughly.
2:48
Its distance changes.
2:49
It's not a perfectly circular orbit.
2:53
Jupiter is approximately a little bit--
2:55
5 plus astronomical units-- a little bit
2:58
more than five times the distance
3:00
of the sun to the Earth.
3:02
And Saturn is approximately nine astronomical units,
3:07
or nine times the distance from the sun to the Earth.
3:11
So once again, this would be nine football fields away.
3:13
Or another way to think about it would be, essentially,
3:16
a kilometer away.
3:16
If we had kind of a medicine-ball-size sun,
3:20
this little smaller than a ping pong
3:22
balled Saturn would be a kilometer away.
3:26
And I just want to really reiterate
3:27
that because you never visualize it that way.
3:30
Because just for the sake of being
3:31
able to draw it on a page, you see
3:32
diagrams that look like this.
3:35
And they really don't give you a sense of how small
3:38
these planets are relative to the sun,
3:40
and especially relative to their distance from the sun.
3:45
And then after Saturn, you have Uranus and then Neptune.
3:58
And obviously, these guys are even further.
3:59
And just to give you a sense, it's
4:01
very easy to start talking about galaxies and universes and all
4:05
of the-- or the universe.
4:07
But I really just want to get-- already,
4:09
what we've talked about, we're talking about huge distances,
4:12
huge scale.
4:14
We already talked about that it would take a jet plane 17 years
4:17
to travel from the Earth to the sun.
4:19
Multiply that by five, about 100 years
4:22
to go from Jupiter to the sun, 200 years
4:24
to go from Saturn to the sun.
4:27
So you could have had Abraham Lincoln get into a jet plane,
4:31
and if he left from Saturn, he still
4:34
would not have gotten to the sun.
4:36
So these are huge, huge distances.
4:37
But we're not done with the solar system, there.
4:39
Just to give a sense of scale-- so this right here,
4:44
that's the sun.
4:45
And each of these planets are actually
4:47
narrower than these orbits.
4:48
So they just draw these orbits here,
4:50
but you wouldn't actually even see the actual planets
4:52
here at this type of a scale.
4:54
But this is one astronomical unit right over here,
4:56
the distance from the sun to the Earth.
4:59
Then you have Mars.
5:00
Then you have the asteroid belt.
5:02
There you have the asteroid belt,
5:06
which also has some pretty big things in it, itself.
5:08
And it has these things that are kind of considered almost
5:11
dwarf planets, things like Ceres.
5:13
You could look those type things up.
5:14
And then you have Jupiter out here.
5:16
And once again, we said it would take 100 years, or roughly
5:19
100 years, for a jet plane to get from Jupiter to the sun.
5:23
But even if you take this whole box
5:25
here-- which is a huge amount of distance, of roughly about
5:28
five astronomical units-- it would take about 40 minutes
5:33
for light to get from the sun to Jupiter.
5:37
So this is a huge, huge distance.
5:40
But even this huge distance-- we can put it
5:42
into this little box right over here.
5:46
So this whole box right over there can be fit into this box.
5:55
And you need to do that in order to appreciate
5:57
the orbits of the outer planets.
5:59
And so on this scale, Earth and Venus and Mercury and Mars,
6:03
their orbits look pretty much-- you can't even
6:05
differentiate them from the sun.
6:07
They look so close.
6:08
They almost look like they're part
6:09
of the sun when you look at it on this scale.
6:11
And then you have you have the outer planets--
6:13
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
6:15
And they we have a Kuiper belt.
6:17
And this is more asteroids, but these are kind of more frozen.
6:21
And when we think of ice, you always think of water ice.
6:24
But out here, it's so cold.
6:25
And it's relatively getting dark, now,
6:27
because we're pretty far from the sun
6:29
that things that we normally associate as gases are going
6:31
to be in their solid form out here.
6:33
So this isn't just rocky elements.
6:36
This will also be things that we normally associate as gases,
6:39
like methane, frozen methane.
6:41
But even here, we're not done.
6:42
We're not even out of the solar system yet.
6:46
And actually, just to give you a sense of the scale we're
6:49
operating right here, I have this chart right here
6:52
from the Voyager mission.
6:53
So the Voyager missions-- Voyager 1 and 2-- actually,
6:55
Voyager 2 left a little bit earlier, a month earlier.
6:58
Voyager 1 is just traveling faster.
7:00
They left about a year after I was born
7:04
And their current velocity, just to give you
7:06
a sense of how fast-- Voyager 1 right here is right
7:12
now traveling at 61,000 kilometers per hour.
7:19
That's about 17 kilometers per second.
7:23
The size of a city every second-- it's going that fast.
7:25
That's, at least in my mind, an unfathomably fast velocity.
7:31
This thing has been traveling roughly that fast.
7:33
It's been going around planets and gaining acceleration
7:36
as it went around orbits.
7:37
But for most of the time, it's been
7:38
going at a pretty fast speed.
7:39
And just to translate it to people
7:42
who don't relate to kilometers, that's
7:43
about 38,000 miles per hour, so this huge, huge unfathomably
7:50
fast speed.
7:51
And it's been doing it since 1977.
7:55
I was learning to walk.
7:57
And when I was learning to walk, it
7:58
was traveling at this super fast speed.
8:00
And then when I was learning to talk-- our whole lives,
8:04
when we're sleeping, everything, we're eating,
8:06
I'm in elementary school-- it's still rocketing out
8:09
of the solar system at roughly this speed.
8:11
Its velocity has changed, but especially,
8:13
once it got outside of the planets,
8:15
it's been roughly at this velocity.
8:17
So it's just been rocketing out.
8:19
And I don't want to say only, but it's gotten this far.
8:24
If we look at it on this scale, it's
8:25
gotten about that far right there.
8:28
It's about 115, 116 astronomical units.
8:32
And to give a sense-- so there's two ways to think about it.
8:34
One says, like, wow, that's really far.
8:36
Because we know that even on this scale,
8:39
you can't even see Earth's orbit.
8:40
So this looks like it's a pretty, pretty far distance.
8:43
And just to give you a sense of how far 116 astronomical units
8:47
are, if 2,000 years ago, Jesus got on a plane--
8:52
I actually cut and pasted a copy of Jesus,
8:54
just for visualization purposes--
8:56
but if he'd got on a jet liner at 1,000 kilometers per hour
8:59
and went straight in that direction,
9:01
in the direction that Voyager, Voyager would only just now be
9:05
catching up to Jesus.
9:06
So this is a huge, huge, huge, huge distance.
9:09
But at the same time, even though it's
9:11
a huge distance, especially relative to everything
9:13
else we've talked about, relative to just even
9:15
the outer reaches of the solar system,
9:18
we're still talking in terms of a small scale.
9:21
So that's how far Voyager is.
9:24
And just to give a sense, on this scale-- so this whole box
9:27
over here can be contained in this box.
9:32
And when you look at this box, Voyager's
9:34
only gotten about that far after traveling
9:39
at this unbelievable velocity for over 30 years,
9:44
for about 33 years.
9:45
And just to give you an idea of these other things, Sedna,
9:47
right here, is a reasonably large-sized outer solar system
9:53
object.
9:54
It's one of the furthest objects that we
9:56
know of in the solar system.
9:58
And it has this very eccentric orbit.
10:00
So it gets-- I don't want to say relatively close, but not
10:02
unreasonably far away.
10:05
And then it gets really far away from the sun.
10:09
But even Sedna's orbit-- so if I were to look at this,
10:11
so this whole box over here can be contained right over here.
10:17
So in this diagram right here, you
10:19
wouldn't even be able to see.
10:20
It would be like a speck how far Voyager
10:22
has traveled in 33 years at 38,000 miles per hour.
10:27
You would not even be able to notice.
10:30
You wouldn't even notice that distance.
10:33
And even though you can't even notice that distance,
10:35
we still have the sun's influence.
10:39
The gravitational pull is still attracting things to it.
10:42
And this right here, we speculate
10:45
that there is the Oort cloud.
10:46
And this is where the comets originate from.
10:48
And this is just a bunch of frozen gases
10:51
and ice particles and things like that.
10:54
But we're starting to get to the outer reaches
10:57
of the solar system.
10:58
And this distance right here is about 50,000 astronomical
11:04
units.
11:07
And just to give a scale-- because you
11:09
hear a lot about light years and all of that-- light years
11:11
are about 63,000 astronomical units.
11:14
So if you go a light year out from the sun,
11:19
you'll end up in the Oort cloud, the hypothesized Oort cloud.
11:24
And just to give a sense, another scale,
11:26
the Oort cloud is actually-- most of the planets' orbits
11:30
are roughly in the same plane.
11:32
But this right here is the orbit of the planets.
11:34
And once again, these lines are drawn too thick.
11:36
They're just drawn the thinnest possible so
11:38
that you can see them, but they're still drawn too thick.
11:40
And this gets us all the way to the Kuiper belt.
11:42
But all of this over here, so all the way
11:45
out to the Kuiper belt, all the way out
11:46
to all of the major planets-- this
11:48
is Pluto's orbit right over here.
11:52
This whole diagram is only sitting in right over there.
11:56
You can barely see it.
11:57
This whole diagram is just that dot in this.
12:00
And then you can see the Oort cloud all around it.
12:02
And it's more of a spherical cloud.
12:04
And we think it exists.
12:05
Obviously, it's hard to observe things at that distance.
12:08
So hopefully, that gives you a beginning sense
12:11
of the scale of the solar system.
12:12
And what's really going to blow your mind-- if this hasn't
12:14
blown your mind already-- is that this whole thing's
12:17
going to start looking like a speck.
12:19
When you even just look at the local area around our galaxy,
12:21
much less the galaxy, much less the universe as a whole.
12:25

As we enter into 1917, the United States
0:04
has been able to maintain its neutrality in World War
0:07
I. In fact, President Wilson has just won a re-election based
0:10
on the platform that he kept us out of war.
0:14
And to large degree, he was able to keep the US out of war
0:17
because the German Empire had pulled back
0:19
from its unrestricted submarine warfare.
0:22
After the sinking of the Lusitania
0:23
and how angered America had gotten,
0:25
they said, OK, we're not going to attack
0:27
passenger vessels anymore.
0:28
We're only going to attack things that are definitely
0:31
British, non-passenger vessels.
0:34
But as we go into January 1917, the British blockade
0:39
on the Central Powers was having its effect.
0:41
And the Central Powers were getting desperate,
0:43
in particular Germany.
0:45
And so they are eager to essentially do
0:47
the same to the British.
0:49
Once again, go with the unrestricted submarine warfare.
0:53
But the Germans knew that if they
0:55
were to go back to this, that it's likely that the US would
0:58
enter the war on the side of the Allies.
1:01
So knowing that was likely to happen.
1:03
They said, well, how could we slow the US down.
1:05
And the thinking was, well, maybe we could somehow
1:07
enlisted the help of Mexico which at the time
1:10
was not the best terms with the United States.
1:13
And so Arthur Zimmerman who was the German Foreign Secretary,
1:19
the equivalent of the United States Secretary of State.
1:21
The Foreign Minister, Arthur Zimmerman
1:24
sends an encoded a telegram to the Mexicans.
1:28
And it's encoded, especially because it
1:30
has to go over lines that are controlled by the Americans.
1:34
And in it, he actually proposes an alliance
1:38
to slow the Americans down.
1:41
So this is what he wrote.
1:42
So this is a coded telegram.
1:44
And then, it was actually intercepted
1:46
by British intelligence and decoded and then shared
1:49
with the Americans, and then that
1:51
was also then made public to the American public.
1:55
And so this is why it's fascinating to actually read
1:57
this stuff.
1:57
This is January 1917.
2:00
This is the Germans talking to the Mexicans.
2:02
""We intend to begin on the first of February
2:05
unrestricted submarine warfare.
2:09
We shall endeavor in spite of this
2:11
to keep the United States of America neutral.
2:13
In the event of this not succeeding,
2:16
we make Mexico a proposal alliance
2:18
on the following basis-- make war together, make peace
2:22
together, generous financial support, and an understanding
2:26
on our part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost
2:32
territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.
2:37
The settlement in detail is left to you.
2:39
You will inform the President--"" they're
2:41
talking about the president of Mexico.
2:42
""--of the above most secretly as soon as the outbreak of war
2:46
with the United States of America is certain and add
2:50
the suggestion that he should, on his own initiative,
2:53
invite Japan to immediate adherence and at the same time
2:56
mediate between Japan and ourselves.
2:59
Please call the President's attention to the fact
3:02
that the ruthless employment of our submarines
3:06
now offers the prospect of compelling England
3:09
in a few months to make peace.
3:12
Signed Zimmerman.""
3:14
Now, the Mexicans, when they read this,
3:15
they really didn't take it too seriously.
3:17
They didn't think that they could seriously
3:19
engage the US in a war.
3:20
They couldn't seriously take back
3:21
or occupy these territories.
3:23
So they didn't really think much of it.
3:24
The real effect of this telegram was
3:26
to make the American public angry.
3:30
They were going to go back into the unrestricted submarine
3:32
warfare.
3:33
And the Germans, themselves, talk about ruthless-- ""ruthless
3:36
employment of our the submarines.""
3:40
So when people talk about, what were the causes.
3:42
What brought the US into war?
3:44
The ones that are typically cited
3:46
are the unrestricted submarine warfare.
3:49
The sinking of the Lusitania.
3:50
The Zimmerman telegram that was trying
3:52
to get Mexico to somehow get into a war with the US
3:56
and reclaim these territories.
3:59
And as we'll see, a few months after this,

- [Voiceover] When we observe the physical world
0:12
we find random fluctuations everywhere.
0:21
We can generate truly random numbers
0:24
by measuring random fluctuations, known as noise.
0:28
When we measure this noise, known as sampling,
0:32
we can obtain numbers.
0:34
- [Voiceover] One, two, three, four--
0:36
- [Voiceover] For example, if we measure
0:37
the electric current of TV static over time,
0:40
we will generate a truly random sequence.
0:45
We can visualize this random sequence
0:47
by drawing a path that changes direction
0:50
according to each number, known as a random walk.
0:54
Notice the lack of pattern at all scales.
0:57
At each point in the sequence
0:59
the next move is always unpredictable.
1:03
Random processes are said to be nondeterministic,
1:07
since they are impossible to determine in advance.
1:11
Machines, on the other hand, are deterministic.
1:14
Their operation is predictable and repeatable.
1:18
In 1946, John von Neumann was involved
1:20
in running computations for the military;
1:23
specifically involved in the design of the hydrogen bomb.
1:29
Using a computer called the ENIAC,
1:31
he planned to repeatedly calculate approximations
1:33
of the processes involved in nuclear fission.
1:37
However, this required quick access
1:38
to randomly generated numbers
1:40
that could be repeated, if needed.
1:43
However, the ENIAC had very limited internal memory;
1:46
storing long random sequences was not possible.
1:50
So, Neumann developed an algorithm
1:52
to mechanically simulate the scrambling aspect
1:55
of randomness as follows:
1:58
First, select a truly random number, called the ""seed"".
2:02
This number could come from the measurement of noise,
2:04
or the current time in milliseconds.
2:07
Next, this seed is provided as input
2:09
to a simple calculation.
2:12
Multiply the seed by itself,
2:14
and then output the middle of this result.
2:18
Then you use this output as the next seed,
2:20
and repeat the process as many times as needed.
2:26
This is known as the middle-squares method
2:28
and is just the first in a long line
2:30
of pseudorandom number generators.
2:34
The randomness of the sequence is dependent on
2:36
the randomness of the initial seed only.
2:39
Same seed, same sequence.
2:41
So, what are the differences between
2:43
a randomly generated versus
2:45
pseudorandomly generated sequence?
2:51
Let's represent each sequence as a random walk.
2:58
They seem similar until we speed things up.
3:02
The pseudorandom sequence must eventually repeat.
3:06
This occurs when the algorithm reaches a seed
3:09
it has previously used, and the cycle repeats.
3:13
The length, before a pseudorandom sequence repeats,
3:16
is called ""the period"".
3:19
The period is strictly limited
3:21
by the length of the initial seed.
3:24
For example, if we use a two-digit seed,
3:27
then an algorithm can produce, at most,
3:29
100 numbers, before reusing a seed
3:32
and repeating the cycle.
3:34
A three-digit seed can't expand past 1,000 numbers
3:38
before repeating its cycle,
3:40
and a four-digit seed can't expand
3:43
past 10,000 numbers before repeating.
3:46
Though if we use a seed large enough,
3:49
the sequence can expand
3:50
into trillions and trillions of digits before repeating.
3:57
Though the key difference is important.
3:59
When you generate numbers pseudorandomly,
4:02
there are many sequences which cannot occur.
4:06
For example, if Alice generates a truly random sequence
4:09
of 20 shifts, it's equivalent to a uniform selection
4:14
from the stack of all possible sequences of shifts.
4:17
This stack contains 26 to the power of 20 pages,
4:21
which is astronomical in size.
4:24
If we stood at the bottom and shined a light upwards,
4:27
a person at the top would not see the light
4:30
for around 200,000,000 years.
4:33
Compare this to Alice generating
4:35
a 20 digit pseudorandom sequence,
4:37
using a four-digit random seed.
4:40
Now, this is equivalent to a uniform selection
4:43
from 10,000 possible initial seeds,
4:47
meaning she can only generate
4:49
10,000 different sequences,
4:52
which is a vanishingly small fraction
4:55
of all possible sequences.
4:57
When we move from random to pseudorandom shifts,
5:00
we shrink the key space into
5:03
a much, much smaller seed-space.
5:06
So, for a pseudorandom sequence to be indistinguishable
5:10
from a randomly generated sequence,
5:12
it must be impractical for a computer
5:15
to try all seeds and look for a match.
5:19
This leads to an important distinction
5:21
in computer science, between what is possible,
5:24
versus what is possible in a reasonable amount of time.
5:29
We use the same logic when we buy a bike lock.
5:32
We know that anybody can simply try
5:34
all possible combinations,
5:35
until they find a match and it opens.
5:38
But it would take them days to do so.
5:40
So, for eight hours we assume it's practically safe.
5:46
With pseudorandom generators,
5:48
the security increases as the length of the seed increases.
5:54
If the most powerful computer would take
5:56
hundreds of years to run through all seeds,
5:59
then we safely can assume it's practically secure,
6:04
instead of perfectly secure.
6:07
As computers get faster
6:09
the seed size must increase accordingly.
6:14
Pseudorandomness frees Alice and Bob
6:16
from having to share their
6:18
entire random shift sequence in advance.
6:22
Instead, they share a relatively short random seed,
6:25
and expand it into the same
6:27
random-looking sequence when needed.
6:31
But what happens if they can never meet
6:33
to share this random seed?",Is it possible for me to send encrypted messages to somebody using a secret code number?

Let's do some more problems
0:02
that involve the ideal gas equation.
0:04
Let's say I have a gas in a container
0:06
and the current pressure is 3 atmospheres.
0:14
And let's say that the volume of the container is 9 liters.
0:27
Now, what will the pressure become
0:29
if my volume goes from 9 liters to 3 liters?
0:39
So from the first ideal gas equation video,
0:42
you can kind of have the intuition, that you have a bunch of
0:44
-- and we're holding-- and this is important.
0:47
We're holding the temperature constant,
0:50
and that's an important thing to realize.
0:52
So in our very original intuition
0:58
behind the ideal gas equation we said,
1:00
look, if we have a certain number of particles
1:03
with a certain amount of kinetic energy,
1:05
and they're exerting a certain pressure on their container,
1:09
and if we were to make the container smaller,
1:14
we have the same number of particles.
1:15
n doesn't change.
1:17
The average kinetic energy doesn't change,
1:19
so they're just going to bump into the walls more.
1:21
So that when we make the volume smaller,
1:23
when the volume goes down, the pressure should go up.
1:30
So let's see if we can calculate the exact number.
1:32
So we can take our ideal gas equation:
1:34
pressure times volume is equal to nRT.
1:41
Now, do the number of particles change
1:43
when I did this situation when I shrunk the volume? No!
1:48
We have the same number of particles.
1:50
I'm just shrinking the container,
1:51
so n is n, R doesn't change, that's a constant,
1:55
and then the temperature doesn't change.
1:56
So my old pressure times volume is going to be equal to nRT,
2:02
and my new pressure times volume
2:04
-- so let me call this P1 and V1.
2:07
That's V2.
2:16
V2 is this, and we're trying to figure out P2.
2:20
P2 is what?
2:22
Well, we know that P1 times V1 is equal to nRT,
2:29
and we also know that since temperature
2:33
and the number of moles of our gas stay constant,
2:36
that P2 times V2 is equal to nRT.
2:39
And since they both equal the same thing, we can say that
2:44
the pressure times the volume,
2:46
as long as the temperature is held constant, will be a constant.
2:48
So P1 times V1 is going to equal P2 times V2.
2:55
So what was P1?
2:57
P1, our initial pressure, was 3 atmospheres.
3:03
So 3 atmospheres times 9 liters
3:10
is equal to our new pressure times 3 liters.
3:15
And if we divide both sides of the equation by 3,
3:18
we get 3 liters cancel out,
3:24
we're left with 9 atmospheres.
3:33
And that should make sense.
3:35
When you decrease the volume by 2/3
3:39
or when you make the volume 1/3 of your original volume,
3:42
then your pressure increases by a factor of three.
3:46
So this went by times 3, and this went by times 1/3.
3:50
That's a useful thing to know in general.
3:53
If temperature is held constant,
3:55
then pressure times volume are going to be a constant.
3:58
Now, you can take that even further.
4:01
If we look at PV equals nRT,
4:06
the two things that we know don't change
4:08
in the vast majority of exercises we do is
4:11
the number of molecules we're dealing with,
4:13
and obviously, R isn't going to change.
4:15
So if we divide both sides of this by T,
4:18
we get PV over T is equal to nR,
4:22
or you could say it's equal to a constant.
4:25
This is going to be a constant number for any system
4:27
where we're not changing the number
4:29
of molecules in the container.
4:30
So if initially we start with pressure one, volume one,
4:38
and some temperature one that's going to be
4:40
equal to this constant.
4:41
And if we change any of them, if we go back to pressure two,
4:45
volume two, temperature two, they should still be
4:49
equal to this constant, so they equal each other.
4:51
So for example, let's say I start off
4:55
with a pressure of 1 atmosphere.
4:59
and I have a volume of-- I'll switch units here
5:06
just to do things differently-- 2 meters cubed.
5:09
And let's say our temperature is 27 degrees Celsius.
5:19
Well, and I just wrote Celsius because I want you to
5:22
always remember you have to convert to Kelvin,
5:24
so 27 degrees plus 273 will get us exactly to 300 Kelvin.
5:32
Let's figure out what the new temperature is going to be.
5:41
Let's say our new pressure is 2 atmospheres.
5:46
The pressure has increased.
5:47
Let's say we make the container smaller, so 1 meter cubed.
5:52
So the container has been decreased by half
5:54
and the pressure is doubled by half.
6:02
Let me make the container even smaller.
6:07
Actually, no. Let me make the pressure even larger.
6:10
Let me make the pressure into 5 atmospheres.
6:12
Now we want to know what the second temperature is,
6:16
and we set up our equation.
6:18
And so we have 2/300 atmosphere meters cubed per Kelvin
6:27
is equal to 5/T2, our new temperature,
6:32
and then we have 1,500 is equal to 2 T2.
6:40
Divide both sides by 2.
6:41
You have T2 is equal to 750 degrees Kelvin,
6:46
which makes sense, right?
6:48
We increased the pressure so much
6:50
and we decreased the volume at the same time that
6:53
the temperature just had to go up.
6:55
Or if you thought of it the other way,
6:56
maybe we increased the temperature
6:58
and that's what drove the pressure to be so much higher,
7:00
especially since we decreased the volume.
7:04
I guess the best way to think about
7:05
is this pressure went up so much,
7:08
it went up by factor of five,
7:09
it went from 1 atmosphere to 5 atmospheres,
7:12
because on one level we shrunk the volume by a factor of 1/2,
7:17
so that should have doubled the pressure,
7:19
so that should have gotten us to two atmospheres.
7:21
And then we made the temperature a lot higher,
7:24
so we were also bouncing into the container.
7:25
We made the temperature 750 degrees Kelvin,
7:27
so more than double the temperature,
7:30
and then that's what got us to 5 atmospheres.
7:33
Now, one other thing that you'll probably hear about
7:37
is the notion of what happens
7:39
at standard temperature and pressure.
7:41
Let me delete all of the stuff over here.
7:44
Standard temperature and pressure.
7:46
Let me delete all this stuff that I don't need.
7:51
Standard temperature and pressure.
7:54
And I'm bringing it up because even though it's called
7:58
standard temperature and pressure, and sometimes called STP,
8:03
unfortunately for the world, they haven't really standardized
8:07
what the standard pressure and temperature are.
8:13
I went to Wikipedia and I looked it up.
8:15
And the one that you'll probably see in most physics classes
8:18
and most standardized tests is standard temperature
8:21
is 0 degrees celsius, which is,
8:24
of course, 273 degrees Kelvin.
8:26
And standard pressure is 1 atmosphere.
8:29
And here on Wikipedia, they wrote it as 101.325 kilopascals,
8:38
or a little more than 101,000 pascals.
8:40
And of course, a pascal is a newton per square meter.
8:44
In all of this stuff,
8:45
the units are really the hardest part to get a hold of.
8:47
But let's say that we assume that
8:49
these are all different standard temperatures and pressures
8:52
based on different standard-making bodies.
8:55
So they can't really agree with each other.
8:56
But let's say we took this
8:57
as the definition of standard temperature and pressure.
9:00
So we're assuming that temperature is equal to 0 degrees Celsius,
9:06
which is equal to 273 degrees Kelvin.
9:10
And pressure, we're assuming, is 1 atmosphere,
9:14
which could also be written as 101.325 or 3/8 kilopascals.
9:21
So my question is if I have an ideal gas
9:26
at standard temperature and pressure,
9:29
how many moles of that do I have in 1 liter?
9:35
No, let me say that the other way.
9:37
How many liters will 1 mole take up?
9:40
So let me say that a little bit more.
9:42
So n is equal to 1 mole.
9:45
So I want to figure out what my volume is.
9:49
So if I have 1 mole of a gas,
9:50
I have 6.02 times 10 to 23 molecules of that gas.
9:55
It's at standard pressure, 1 atmosphere,
9:58
and at standard temperature,
9:59
273 degrees, what is the volume of that gas?
10:03
So let's apply PV is equal to nRT.
10:06
Pressure is 1 atmosphere,
10:10
but remember we're dealing with atmospheres.
10:11
1 atmosphere times volume-- that's what we're solving for.
10:16
I'll do that and purple--
10:17
is equal to 1 mole times R times temperature, times 273.
10:27
Now this is in Kelvin; this is in moles.
10:31
We want our volume in liters.
10:38
So which version of R should we use?
10:41
Well, we're dealing with atmospheres.
10:44
We want our volume in liters, and of course,
10:47
we have moles and Kelvin, so we'll use this version, 0.082.
10:50
So this is 1, so we can ignore the 1 there, the 1 there.
10:54
So the volume is equal to 0.082 times 273 degrees Kelvin,
11:01
and that is 0.082 times 273 is equal to 22.4 liters.
11:19
So if I have any ideal gas,
11:21
and all gases don't behave ideally ideal,
11:24
but if I have an ideal gas and it's at standard temperature,
11:27
which is at 0 degrees Celsius, or the freezing point of water,
11:30
which is also 273 degrees Kelvin,
11:32
and I have a mole of it,
11:33
and it's at standard pressure, 1 atmosphere,
11:37
that gas should take up exactly 22.4 liters.
11:42
And if you wanted to know
11:43
how many meters cubed it's going to take up,
11:46
well, you could just say 22.4 liters times--
11:50
now, how many meters cubed are there
11:53
-- so for every 1 meter cubed, you have 1,000 liters.
11:57
I know that seems like a lot, but it's true.
11:59
Just think about how big a meter cubed is.
12:02
So this would be equal to 0.0224 meters cubed.
12:09
If you have something at 1 atmosphere,
12:11
a mole of it, and at 0 degrees Celsius.
12:14
Anyway, this is actually a useful number to know sometimes.
12:17
They'll often say, you have 2 moles
12:22
at standard temperature and pressure.
12:25
How many liters is it going to take up?
12:27
Well, 1 mole will take up this many,
12:29
and so 2 moles at standard temperature and pressure
12:32
will take up twice as much,
12:33
because you're just taking PV equals nRT and just doubling.
12:35
Everything else is being held constant.
12:38
The pressure, everything else is being held constant,
12:41
so if you double the number of moles,
12:43
you're going to double the volume it takes up.
12:44
Or if you half the number of moles,
12:46
you're going to half the volume it takes up.
12:47
So it's a useful thing to know that
12:49
in liters at standard temperature and pressure,
12:51
where standard temperature and pressure
12:53
is defined as 1 atmosphere and 273 degrees Kelvin,
12:56
an ideal gas will take up 22.4 liters of volume.","at 0:01, would ideal gas law apply to plasma?"
khan_video_IQJ4DBkCnco_59610,Science,ESSAY,"•
0:00
- [Voiceover] Before we go in-depth on meiosis,
0:02
I want to do a very high level overview
0:04
comparing mitosis to meiosis.
0:07
So, in mitosis, this is all a review,
0:10
if you've watched the mitosis video,
0:12
in mitosis, we start with a cell,
0:16
that has a diploid number of chromosomes.
0:19
I'll just write 2n to show it has a diploid number.
0:22
For human beings, this would be 46 chromosomes.
0:29
46 for humans, you get 23 chromosomes from your mother,
0:33
23 chromosomes from your father or you can say
0:36
you have 23 homologous pairs, which leads to 46 chromosomes.
0:42
Now after the process of mitosis happens
0:44
and you have your cytokinesis and all the rest,
0:47
you end up with two cells that each
0:49
have the same genetic information as the original.
0:53
So you now have two cells
0:56
that each have the diploid number of chromosomes.
0:59
So, 2n and 2n.
1:04
And now each of these cells
1:05
are just like this cell was,
1:08
it can go through interphase again.
1:10
It grows and it can replicate its DNA
1:15
and centrosomes and grow some more
1:16
then each of these can go through mitosis again.
1:19
And this is actually how
1:21
most of the cells in your body grow.
1:23
This is how you turn from a single cell organism into you,
1:27
or for the most part, into you.
1:30
So that is mitosis.
1:32
It's a cycle.
1:33
After each of these things go through mitosis,
1:36
they can then go through
1:37
the entire cell cycle again.
1:38
Let me write this a little bit neater.
1:40
Mitosis, that s was a little bit hard to read.
1:43
Now what happens in meiosis?
1:45
What happens in meiosis?
1:48
I'll do that over here.
1:50
In meiosis, something slightly different happens
1:54
and it happens in two phases.
1:58
You will start with a cell
2:00
that has a diploid number of chromosomes.
2:03
So you will start with a cell
2:06
that has a diploid number of chromosomes.
2:09
And in it's interphase, it also replicates its DNA.
2:12
And then it goes through something called Meiosis One.
2:15
And in Meiosis One,
2:16
what you end up with is two cells
2:18
that now have haploid number of chromosomes.
2:23
So you end up with two cells,
2:26
You now have two cells that each have a
2:28
haploid number of chromosomes.
2:31
So you have n and you have n.
2:34
So if we're talking about human beings,
2:35
you have 46 chromosomes here,
2:37
and now you have 23 chromosomes in this nucleus.
2:40
And now you have 23 in this nucleus.
2:42
But you're still not done.
2:45
Then each of these will go through a phase,
2:47
which I'll talk about in a second, which is
2:49
very similar to mitosis, which will
2:53
duplicate this entire cell into two.
2:56
So actually, let me do it like this.
2:57
So now, this one,
3:01
you're going to have four cells
3:04
that each have the haploid number
3:06
that each have the haploid number of chromosomes.
3:11
And they don't all necessarily have the same
3:13
genetic informatioin anymore.
3:15
Because as we go through this first phase,
3:17
right over here of meiosis, and this first phase
3:19
here you go from diploid to haploid, right over here,
3:23
this is called Meiosis One.
3:25
Meiosis One,
3:29
you're essentially splitting the homologous pairs
3:32
and so this one might get some of the
3:36
ones that you originally got from your father,
3:38
and some that you originally got from your mother,
3:39
some that you originally got from your father,
3:41
some that you originally got from your mother,
3:43
they split randomly, but each homogolous pair
3:46
gets split up.
3:48
And then in this phase, Meiosis Two,
3:51
so this phase right over here is called Meiosis Two,
3:55
it's very similar
3:56
to mitosis, except your now dealing with cells that start off
4:00
with the haploid number.
4:02
It's important to realize that meiosis is not a cycle.
4:05
These cells that you have over here, these are gametes.
4:09
This are sex cells.
4:10
These are gametes.
4:12
This can now be used in fertilization.
4:14
If we're talking about, if you're male, this is happening
4:18
in your testes, and these are going to be sperm cells
4:22
If you are female, this is happening in your ovaries
4:26
and these are going to be egg cells.
4:28
If you a tree, this could be pollen or it could be an ovul.
4:34
But these are used for fertilization.
4:37
These will fuse together in sexual reproduction
4:39
to get to a fertilized egg, which then can undergo
4:44
mitosis to create an entirely new organism.
4:48
So not a cycle here,
4:49
although these will find sex cells
4:52
from another organism and fuse with them
4:57
and those can turn into another organism.
4:59
And I guess the whole circle of life starts again.
5:01
But it's not the case with mitosis where this can keep
5:04
going and going, going.
5:05
This cell is just like this cell, while these sex cells
5:10
are differeent than this one right over here.
5:12
Now, where does this happen in the body?
5:14
We've talked about this in previous videos.
5:16
These are your somatic cells right over here.
5:19
These are the ones that make up the bulk of your body,
5:22
somatic cells.
5:23
And where is this happening?
5:25
Well, this is happening in germ cells,
5:27
As we mentioned, if you're male it's in your tesis
5:29
and if you're female it's in your ovaries.
5:32
And germ cells actually can undergo mitosis
5:36
to produce other germ cells that have a diploid
5:38
number of chromosomes, or they can undergo
5:42
meiosis in order to produce sperm or egg cells
5:46
in order to produce gametes.","A sperm cell cannot divide into four new sperm cells, am I right?"

Find the volume of a sphere with a diameter of 14 centimeters.
0:06
So if I have a sphere-- so this isn't just a circle,
0:09
this is a sphere.
0:10
You could view it as a globe of some kind.
0:12
So I'm going to shade it a little bit so you
0:14
can tell that it's three-dimensional.
0:15
They're giving us the diameter.
0:17
So if we go from one side of the sphere
0:19
straight through the center of it.
0:20
So we're imagining that we can see through the sphere.
0:23
And we go straight through the centimeter,
0:25
that distance right over there is 14 centimeters.
0:28
Now, to find the volume of a sphere-- and we've proved this,
0:32
or you will see a proof for this later when you learn calculus.
0:36
But the formula for the volume of a sphere
0:38
is volume is equal to 4/3 pi r cubed,
0:43
where r is the radius of the sphere.
0:47
So they've given us the diameter.
0:48
And just like for circles, the radius of the sphere
0:54
is half of the diameter.
0:56
So in this example, our radius is going to be 7 centimeters.
1:00
And in fact, the sphere itself is the set
1:02
of all points in three dimensions that is exactly
1:05
the radius away from the center.
1:07
But with that out of the way, let's just
1:09
apply this radius being 7 centimeters to this formula
1:12
right over here.
1:14
So we're going to have a volume is
1:16
equal to 4/3 pi times 7 centimeters to the third power.
1:22
So I'll do that in that pink color.
1:25
So times 7 centimeters to the third power.
1:31
And since it already involves pi,
1:33
and you could approximate pi with 3.14.
1:35
Some people even approximate it with 22/7.
1:39
But we'll actually just get the calculator out
1:41
to get the exact value for this volume.
1:43
So this is going to be-- so my volume is
1:47
going to be 4 divided by 3.
1:51
And then I don't want to just put a pi there,
1:53
because that might interpret it as 4 divided by 3 pi.
1:56
So 4 divided by 3 times pi, times 7 to the third power.
2:07
In order of operations, it'll do the exponent
2:09
before it does the multiplication,
2:10
so this should work out.
2:12
And the units are going to be in centimeters cubed or cubic
2:15
centimeters.
2:17
So we get 1,436.
2:19
They don't tell us what to round it to.
2:21
So I'll just round it to the nearest 10th-- 1,436.8.
2:25
So this is equal to 1,436.8 centimeters cubed.
2:32
And we're done.",Is V= 4/3pi r3 the equation to always use for finding the volume of a sphere?

In the last video we saw that if we had some line that was
0:03
defined as all of the scalar multiples of sum vector-- I'll
0:09
just write it like this.
0:11
The scalar multiples, obviously,
0:13
are any real number.
0:15
We defined a transformation, and I didn't speak of it much
0:18
in terms of transformations, but it was a transformation.
0:21
We defined a projection onto that line L as a
0:26
transformation.
0:27
In the video, we drew it as transformations within R2, but
0:30
it could be, in general, a transformation from Rn to Rn.
0:36
We defined it as, the projection of x onto L was
0:44
equal to the dot product of x, with this defining vector.
0:49
x dot this defining vector, divided by that defining
0:53
vector dotted with itself.
0:58
All of that times the defining vector of the line.
1:01
This was our definition.
1:03
A couple of things might have popped out at you right when
1:05
we first saw this.
1:07
When you dot a vector with itself, what's that equal to?
1:10
We know that if I take some vector, and I dot it with
1:15
itself, that is equivalent to the length
1:19
of the vector squared.
1:22
We can rewrite this as being equal to x dot v, over the
1:30
length of v squared, all of that times v.
1:34
Wouldn't it be nice if the length of v was 1.
1:38
The length of v was equal to 1.
1:43
If the length of v was 1, or this is another way of saying
1:46
that, v is a unit vector.
1:52
Our formula for our projection would just
1:55
simplify to x dot v.
1:59
All of that times, this will just be some scalar number,
2:02
that times v.
2:05
You say, hey Sal, how do we know if this is a
2:08
unit vector or not.
2:10
What you can realize is that any-- Let me draw it this way.
2:14
When I drew it in the previous video, I just picked
2:18
a line, like that.
2:20
The line can be really defined to this vector v in the line.
2:23
It can be any of the vectors that's contained in the line.
2:26
The vector v could be like that.
2:28
Let's say someone gives you a vector v that
2:30
isn't a unit vector.
2:31
Let's say that the length of v is not equal to 1.
2:36
How can you define a line using sum unit vector.
2:39
You can just normalize v.
2:42
You can define sum unit vector right here.
2:46
You could define sum vector right there.
2:48
Let's call it u, and I'll say it's a unit vector.
2:52
That is equal to 1 over 1 over the length of v times v.
2:59
I showed you this in the unit vector video.
3:01
You can construct a unit vector that goes in the same
3:03
direction as any vector, essentially just by dividing,
3:07
or I guess multiplying, that vector
3:09
times 1 over its length.
3:11
In general, we can always redefine the line.
3:14
All of the possible scalar multiples of v are going to be
3:17
the same thing as all of the scalar multiples of our unit
3:20
vector, u, which is just a scalar multiple of v.
3:24
We can redefine our line.
3:26
If we redefine our line, L, as being equal to all the
3:30
possible scalar multiples of our unit vector, where the
3:35
scalars are any members of the real numbers.
3:39
Our projection definition simplifies a good bit.
3:41
The projection of x onto L becomes x dot our unit vector,
3:51
times the unit vector, times the unit vector itself.
3:57
That case that I did in the previous video, where I had
4:00
those two vectors.
4:02
Where I said the vector v that defined the line, I think it
4:04
was vector 2, 1.
4:08
Our vector x was equal to 2, 3.
4:16
If you want to do this definition, we just have to
4:18
turn this guy into a unit vector first.
4:21
The way you turn him into a unit vector, you figure out
4:25
the magnitude.
4:26
In this case the magnitude of v is equal to what.
4:30
2 squared plus 1 squared is 1.
4:35
You take the square root of that.
4:37
Let me just write.
4:37
It's equal to square root of 2 squared plus 1 squared, which
4:41
is equal to the square root of 5.
4:43
You can define your u-- your unit vector could just be 1
4:47
over this, times that guy.
4:49
1 over the square root of 5 times 2, 1.
4:54
You could multiply it out, or not.
4:55
You could just leave it in this form.
4:57
You can always, for any vector v, you can always find a unit
5:00
vector that goes in the same direction, assuming that we're
5:03
dealing with non-zero vectors.
5:05
You can always reduce anything like this, to some other
5:10
definition, like this.
5:11
Where this is a unit vector version of
5:13
your vector v up there.
5:16
I just said that, look, this is a
5:17
transformation from Rn to Rn.
5:19
The one thing that we're not sure of, is this a linear
5:23
transformation.
5:24
We can always write it like this.
5:26
Let's see if this is always going to be a linear
5:28
transformation.
5:30
There's two conditions for it to be a linear transformation.
5:41
Let's see what happens if I take the projection onto L of
5:47
two vectors.
5:48
Let's say the vector a plus the vector v.
5:52
If I take the sum of their vectors.
5:53
If this is a linear transformation, this should be
5:55
equivalent to taking each of their projections
5:58
individually, and then summing.
5:59
Let's see if this is the case.
6:01
This is equal to, by our definition, we'll use the unit
6:03
vector version, because it's simpler.
6:06
This is equal to a plus b, that's our x, dot u.
6:14
And then, all of that times our unit vector.
6:18
We know that the dot product has a distributive property,
6:20
so that this is equal to a dot u plus b dot u.
6:29
These are unit vectors.
6:31
All of that times the vector u.
6:33
These are just scalar numbers.
6:34
So scalar multiplication has distributive properties.
6:37
This is equal to a dot u, times our vector u.
6:44
Remember, this is just going to be some scalar.
6:46
Plus b dot u times our unit vector u.
6:52
What is this equal to.
6:54
This right here is equal to the projection of a.
6:58
This is equal to the projection of a onto L, by
7:02
definition, right here.
7:03
By this definition.
7:04
If we assume that we're dealing with the unit vector
7:07
definition for the line.
7:09
This is equal to, this whole thing right here, is equal to
7:13
plus the projection onto L of the vector b.
7:18
We see our first condition for this being a linear
7:23
transformation holds.
7:25
A projection of the sum of the vectors is equal to the sum of
7:28
the projections of the vectors.
7:30
Our second condition is that the projection of a scalar
7:33
multiple should be equal to a scalar multiple of the
7:35
projection.
7:36
Let me write that down.
7:39
What is the projection onto L of some scalar multiple of
7:44
some vector a.
7:46
That is equal to ca dot our unit vector u
7:53
times unit vector u.
7:57
This one is a little bit more straightforward.
7:58
This is the scalar multiple.
8:01
We see it in our dot product properties, this is equal to c
8:04
times a dot u, times the vector u.
8:09
This is just equal to c times, this right here, is a
8:12
projection of a onto L.
8:18
We met both of our conditions for linear transformations.
8:21
We know that our projection onto a line L in Rn is a
8:26
linear transformation.
8:27
That tells us that we can represent it as a matrix
8:30
transformation.
8:35
We know that projection of x onto L, we already know this
8:41
definition, it can be rewritten.
8:42
It doesn't hurt to rewrite it.
8:43
As x dot some unit vector that defines our line.
8:48
Let me draw it with a little hat to show that
8:50
it is a unit vector.
8:51
Times the unit vector itself, so that we
8:53
actually get a vector.
8:56
How can I write this as some matrix product.
8:59
Some matrix vector product.
9:01
I want to write it as a product of some
9:02
matrix times x.
9:09
To simplify things, since we're actually dealing with a
9:11
matrix, let's limit ourselves to the case of R2.
9:15
I'm assuming that my projection onto L is going to
9:19
be a mapping from R2 to R2.
9:22
You could do what I'm doing here with
9:23
an arbitrary dimension.
9:25
If we're doing it in R2, then our matrix A, right there, is
9:29
going to be a 2 by 2 matrix.
9:33
We've seen in multiple videos that to figure out the matrix
9:36
A, we just take the identity matrix that has the standard
9:41
basis vectors as columns.
9:43
0, 1.
9:44
Or 1, 0, and then 0, 1.
9:46
And we apply the transformation to each of
9:48
these columns.
9:50
We could say that A is going to be equal to-- its first
9:54
column is going to be equal to the projection onto L of this
9:58
thing right here.
10:00
We'll do it in this orange color, right here.
10:03
What is that going to be.
10:05
That is going to be this dot u.
10:08
Let me write my u.
10:09
My unit vector, let's just assume that u can be rewritten
10:12
as my unit vector is equal to sum u1 and u2.
10:17
Just like that.
10:20
I need to take this dot my unit vector, let
10:23
me write this down.
10:24
Let me write this on the side.
10:25
The first thing I want to do is figure out what the
10:27
projection-- the projection onto L, let me
10:32
write it this way.
10:35
We know the projection is just equal to this dot this times
10:38
that vector.
10:39
Let me write that.
10:41
The vector 1, 0 dot the unit vector u,
10:46
which is just u1, u2.
10:48
We're going to have that times my unit vector.
10:53
I'll write it like this.
10:54
Times the vector u1, u2.
10:58
This is going to be my first column in my
11:00
transformation matrix.
11:02
My second column is going to be the same thing, but I'm not
11:06
ready to take the projection of this guy.
11:07
The definition of our projection is you dot this guy
11:10
with our unit vector.
11:13
So we dot it.
11:14
We're taking the dot product of 0, 1.
11:19
0, 1 dot my unit vector dot u1, u2.
11:26
I'm going to multiply that times my unit
11:28
vector, times u1, u2.
11:31
This seems very complicated, but it should simplify when we
11:34
actually try to work out our transformation matrix.
11:36
Let's do it.
11:38
When I dot these two guys, what do I get.
11:40
Let me write it here.
11:42
My matrix A will become 1 times u1, plus 0 times u2.
11:50
That's just u1.
11:52
This whole thing just simplifies to u1, when I take
11:55
the dot product of these two things.
11:57
Times u1, u2.
12:01
That's going to be my first column.
12:03
My second column, if I dot these two guys, I get 0 times
12:06
u1 plus 1 times u2.
12:08
So I'm going to get u2 times my unit vector, u1, u2.
12:16
If I multiply that out, this will be equal to what.
12:18
I can just write them as columns. u1
12:20
times u1 is u1 squared.
12:24
u1 times u2 is u1, u2.
12:29
u2 times u1 is u2 times u1.
12:34
Then, u2 times u2 is u2 squared.
12:38
You give me any unit vector and I will give you the
12:43
transformation that gives you any projection of some other
12:45
vector onto the line defined by that.
12:48
That was a very long way of saying that.
12:50
Let's go back to what I did before.
12:54
Let's say we want to find any projection onto the line, onto
12:58
the vector, I'll draw it here.
13:00
We'll do the same example that we did in the last video.
13:03
If I have some vector v that looks like that.
13:07
We said the vector v was equal to the vector 2, 1.
13:13
That was my vector v.
13:14
How can we find sum transformation for the
13:16
projection onto the line defined by v?
13:19
Onto this line right here.
13:21
The line defined by v.
13:24
What we can first do is convert v into a unit vector.
13:29
We can convert v into a unit vector that
13:32
goes in the same direction.
13:34
Some unit vector u.
13:36
We did that already up here.
13:38
Where we essentially just divided [? bv ?]
13:40
by it's length.
13:42
Let's take v and divide by it's length.
13:44
The unit vector is this, 1 over the square root of 5
13:46
times our vector v.
13:50
It was 1 over the square root of 5 times our
13:55
vector v, right there.
13:56
You start with a unit vector there.
13:59
You just create this matrix, and then we will have our
14:02
transformation matrix.
14:04
If this is our u, what will our matrix be equal to.
14:07
This is u.
14:09
Then our matrix would be equal to u1 squared.
14:14
What is u1 squared.
14:15
Let me rewrite our u a little bit, not at angles.
14:20
Our vector u, our unit vector that defines this line, is
14:24
equal to the vector 2 over the square root of 5 and 1 over
14:29
the square root of 5.
14:29
I just multiplied out this scalar.
14:32
If we want to construct this matrix, we get A is equal to
14:37
u1 squared.
14:38
What is this squared?
14:39
It becomes 2 squared 4 over the square root of 5 squared,
14:43
which is just 5.
14:44
Equals 4 over 5.
14:48
What is u1 times u2?
14:50
2 times 1 over square root of 5 times square root of 5.
14:52
So, 2/5.
14:55
I just multiplied these two.
14:56
What is u2 times u1.
14:58
Same thing.
14:59
Order doesn't matter when you multiply.
15:01
This will also be 2/5.
15:03
What is u2 squared.
15:04
1 squared over the square root of 5 squared is just 1/5.
15:11
Now we can say-- and that's the neat thing about creating
15:14
these matrices, that the projection-- Let's say we have
15:18
some, let's say this is the origin right here, we have
15:20
some other vector x, right here.
15:22
We can now define our transformation.
15:25
The projection onto L where L is equal to any scalar
15:31
multiple of our unit vector u.
15:34
It's right here.
15:37
Is a member of the reals.
15:39
That is our line L.
15:40
The projection onto L of any vector x is
15:43
equal to this matrix.
15:45
Is equal to the matrix 4, 5, 2/5, 2/5, 1/5 times x.
15:54
Which is a pretty neat result, at least for me.
15:56
We once again reduced everything to just a matrix
15:59
multiplication.
16:00
You take this x and you multiply it by this matrix,
16:03
you're going to get its projection onto
16:05
the L, onto the line.
16:08
If you take this vector, let's say a, and you multiply it
16:13
times this matrix right there, you're going to get its
16:15
projection.
16:16
Its projection onto the line.
16:18
If you could take this vector-- No, it should go
16:21
through the origin.
16:22
I want to draw it in standard position.
16:23
If you take this vector, right there, and multiply it times
16:26
this matrix, you're going to get this vector, right here,
16:30
that is contained in the line.
16:32
When you subtract it from this, it's orthogonal.
16:34
We know the definition.
16:35
It's kind of the shadow of that vector.
16:37
Anyway, I think this is pretty neat.","When calculating the projection of a vector onto a line, is the line treated as though it passes through the origin no matter where it actually is?"
khan_video_JMsqu236bZo_11,Science,MCQ,"•
0:01
Voiceover: Let's look at how to name aldehydes and ketones
0:03
And let's start with an aldehyde and just to refresh
0:05
your memory about how to recognize an aldehyde
0:07
right there's a carbonyl present right.
0:09
A carbon double bonded to an oxygen
0:11
and there's an alkyl group on one side
0:13
and a hydrogen on the other side.
0:16
And so if we wanted to name this extremely
0:17
simple molecule over here on the left,
0:19
right we know there are total of four carbons
0:21
and it's an alkane, so we call this ""butane.""
0:24
So if we look at a four-carbon aldehyde
0:28
right over here on the right so when you number
0:31
an aldehyde you want to make
0:32
your carbonyl carbon number one.
0:33
So, one, two, three and four.
0:36
So we have a four-carbon aldehyde.
0:38
And what we're going to do is drop the E
0:40
and add ""-AL"" for aldehyde.
0:42
So this would be ""Butanal,"" right.
0:45
So a four-carbon aldehyde is ""butanal""
0:49
with an ""-AL""ending like that.
0:50
Let's go ahead and look at some more examples.
0:52
So once again we're going to number to give our
0:55
carbonyl carbon the lowest number possible.
0:58
And the aldehyde is going to take priority
1:01
over things like double-bonds and alkyl groups
1:05
and halogens and so let's go ahead
1:07
and look at this one on the top left here.
1:09
And so we want to number to give our carbonyl carbon
1:13
the lowest number possible so one, two,
1:15
three, four and five.
1:18
And so we have a five-carbon aldehyde right.
1:21
Well a five-carbon alkane would be ""pentane.""
1:24
So if our five-carbon aldehyde would be ""pentanal"".
1:27
So let's go ahead and write ""pentanal"" here.
1:29
So ""pentanal.""
1:31
And then we also have a substituent right
1:34
at carbon four, we have a bromine
1:36
so we have to go ahead and put that in.
1:38
So a ""four-bromopentanal"" would be
1:42
the iupac name for this molecule.
1:44
Let's do this one over here on the right.
1:46
And so once again we're going to number
1:48
giving our carbonyl carbon the lowest number
1:51
possible so one, two, and three.
1:54
So we have three-carbon aldehyde but this one has
1:57
a double bond in it so a three-carbon aldehyde
2:00
would be called a ""propanal"" but since we have
2:02
a double bond present we're going to call it ""propenal.""
2:05
Alright, so we have ""propenal"" here.
2:07
So let's go ahead and write that.
2:09
So, ""propenal.""
2:11
And then the double bond starts at carbon two
2:13
right here so we can write ""two-propenal.""
2:16
We also have a phenyl group coming off of carbon three.
2:20
So we can write ""three-phenyl,"" so ""three-phenyl"" in here.
2:25
And if you wanted to specify the stereochemistry
2:27
of the double bonds, right you think about hydrogen
2:30
being here and hydrogen being here.
2:33
And so when you think about this double bond here,
2:35
the hydrogens are on opposite sides
2:37
so you can say that's their [trans] or you could use
2:41
the easy system and your highest priority groups
2:43
are on opposite sides here, so this would be E.
2:46
So go ahead and write E.
2:48
So ""E three-phenyl two-propenal"" is one way
2:51
to name this molecule.
2:53
It's kind of the old way of doing it.
2:54
If you want to do it the newer way, you would write
2:57
E, and then you still have a phenyl group here
3:00
so ""three-phenyl"" and for the new way you would write
3:06
""Prop"" and put the two in here so ""Prop-two-en""
3:11
and then ""-al"".
3:12
So once again the two specifies where the double-bond is
3:14
and you still have your ""-al"" ending.
3:16
And since this is the more modern way of doing it.
3:19
So these are both iupac names for cinnamaldehyde.
3:23
So this molecule here is actually cinnamaldehyde
3:27
which is the molecule that gives cinnamon it's smell.
3:31
So this a fantastic smell, and you can steam distill
3:34
cinnamon bark and isolate this molecule
3:37
which is a great undergraduate organic chemistry
3:39
lab to do and so that's cinnamaldehyde.
3:43
Alright so another great smelling aldehyde over here
3:46
on the left, is ""benzaldehyde.""
3:49
So here we have ""benzaldehyde.""
3:51
Which is such a common name that it's been
3:53
incorporated into iupac nomenclature
3:56
and benzaldehyde smells like almonds.
3:59
This is another fantastic smell so labs
4:02
of benzaldehyde are a lot of fun too.
4:05
So if you see benzaldehyde,
4:07
you can use that in your iupac name.
4:09
And so if we look at it over here on the right
4:11
you can see that benzaldehyde can form the base
4:13
for the name for this molecule.
4:14
So let's go ahead and write that over here.
4:16
So we have ""benzaldehyde."".
4:20
And then we're going to number to give
4:23
this carbon on our ring, number one.
4:26
Right so we have two choices we can go around
4:28
the ring clockwise or counterclockwise.
4:31
And we know we want to give the lowest number
4:32
possible to our substituents and so that would be
4:35
by going around clockwise.
4:37
So let's do that, so two, three and then four.
4:40
So we have two substituents, right.
4:43
We have a methoxy substituent here at carbon three.
4:47
We have a hydroxy substituent here at carbon four.
4:50
And so we need to put those into alphabetical order
4:53
so H comes before M and so we're going to start
4:56
with the hydroxies, so let's,
4:58
hopefully we'll have enough room here.
4:59
So ""four-hydroxy"" and then we have a ""three-methoxy
5:08
""Benzaldehyde"" is the iupac name for vanillin.
5:13
So vanillin of course is where
5:16
we get our vanilla flavor from.
5:18
So a fantastic vanilla smell so these are white crystals
5:22
which have an amazing vanilla scent to them.
5:26
So also a lot of fun to do labs with.
5:28
Alright so a lot of aldehydes have nice smells to them.
5:32
Let's look at two more aldehydes.
5:36
Alright so let's look at the one on the left here right.
5:38
So it's not benzaldehyde, we don't have benzene ring
5:41
here anymore, we have a cyclohexene,
5:43
so this one is going to be called
5:45
""cyclohexane carbaldehyde.""
5:49
So, ""cyclohexane carbaldehyde""
5:52
is the iupac name for this.
5:55
So, ""carbaldehyde.""
5:57
Alright, let's look at this molecule over here
5:59
on the right so this is two aldehydes
6:02
in the same molecule.
6:04
Alright so let's look at this, so it'll be
6:06
one, two, three, four and five total carbons.
6:11
And so it's two aldehydes, so it's going to be
6:13
""dial"" and it's five carbons total so it's going
6:16
to be ""pentane"", so we could write ""pentane.""
6:20
We could write ""pentanedial"" here.
6:23
And if you wanted to put where the numbers are,
6:26
so it'll be one, five, so you can put that in there.
6:29
So ""one-five-pentanedial"" for two aldehydes.
6:33
Alright, let's look at ketone nomenclature next
6:36
and so just to remind you
6:38
of the general structure of ketones.
6:40
So once again you have a carbonyl, a carbon
6:43
double bonded to an oxygen.
6:44
This time you have two alkyler groups right,
6:46
so you have two alkyler groups here and they can
6:50
be the same or they can be different right.
6:51
So I can write ""R prime"" here
6:53
and either one would still be a ketone.
6:57
So once again we looked at butane earlier,
7:00
so our four-carbon alkane, ""butane.""
7:04
And what about if we had a four-carbon ketone?
7:06
So this right here is a four-carbon ketone
7:10
so it wouldn't be butane it's an O N E ending.
7:13
It's an ""-one"", so it would be ""butanone.""
7:15
So we're going to drop the E here and add O N E.
7:19
So ""butanone.""
7:22
That gives us the iupac name for this molecule.
7:25
So there's an old way of naming ketones which is
7:29
to think about the two alkyl groups, right.
7:32
So let's go ahead and look at that.
7:33
There's a methyl group on this side,
7:35
so let's go ahead and write ""methyl"" right here.
7:38
and then on this side there is an ethyl group.
7:41
right, two carbons so ""methylethyl"".
7:44
and then ""ketone"" gives you the structure
7:47
for this molecule too, so ""methylethylketone""
7:50
is kind of the old way of doing it.
7:51
And normally you would put the E before the M
7:54
just thinking about the alphabet but for this one
7:57
it doesn't really matter, everyone knows
7:59
what ""methylethylketone"" is, also abbreviated ""MEK.""
8:04
So naming the alkyl groups is an old way
8:07
of naming ketones which you will sometimes still see.
8:11
Alright so let's do another one here.
8:13
Let's look at a longer ketone so we want to number
8:17
to give the ketone, the carbonyl carbon lowest
8:20
number possible and so we start from the left.
8:22
Alright so one, two three, four, five and six.
8:28
So we have a six-carbon ketone.
8:32
So it's going to be ""hexanone.""
8:34
So let's go ahead and write that.
8:35
So this would be ""hexanone"".
8:37
And we need to identify where the ketone is this time.
8:40
So, it's on carbon three here, so for longer molecules
8:46
it's important to specify where it is.
8:48
So it would be three-hexanone
8:50
is one the ways to name this molecule.
8:52
Again this is kind of the old way of doing it.
8:54
So the newer way would be to write for this one,
8:58
""hexan-three-one"".
9:02
And if you wanted to use the alkyl way of naming
9:04
this molecule, you could say this is an ethyl.
9:08
So you're gonna write ""ethyl"" here, so ""ethyl.""
9:11
and on this side a three-carbonyl alkyl group is ""propyl.""
9:14
So ""ethylpropylketone"" is just another way to name it.
9:22
So several names for the same molecule.
9:25
Alright ketones take priority over things like double
9:28
bonds and alkyl groups and halogens once again.
9:30
So if you look at this molecule you want to number
9:32
to give your ketone the lowest number possible
9:34
and not your double bond so we're going to start
9:36
from the left again so one, two, three, four, five and six.
9:44
So we have a six-carbon ketone.
9:47
So that would be ""hexanone"" but we have a double
9:49
bond present so it's going to be ""hexenone""
9:53
So we have ""hexenone"" as thinking
9:55
about our base name here.
9:56
And once again two ways to think about naming it
9:59
right, so I can do ""hexenone"", so ""hexene""
10:04
and then we have our ketone, carbon-two.
10:07
So ""hexene-two-one"" so the two goes with the ""-one"",
10:10
to tell you where the ketone is.
10:12
And then the double bond
10:13
starts at carbon-four right here so,
10:15
""four hexene-two-one.""
10:18
If you want to specify the stereochemistry
10:21
of the double bonds, so once again
10:22
you have the hydrogens on opposite sides
10:24
so that would be trans or E, right.
10:27
So you could just write ""E"" here.
10:28
So ""E-four-hexene-two-one"" is one way to name this.
10:32
Again, kind of the old way of doing it.
10:34
If you wanted to name it another way,
10:37
You could write ""E"" and then you can write ""hex,""
10:42
and then ""four-ene"", so once again the four
10:44
is going with the ""-ene"" part telling you where the double
10:47
bond is and then you have the ""two-one"" as well.
10:50
So whichever way you prefer.
10:53
Alright, so let's look at two more examples here,
10:57
for nomenclature of ketones.
11:00
So what if you have a ketone in a cyclic molecule here?
11:03
So if I just, if I think about what I have,
11:08
it would be ""cyclohexane"", but I have a ketone
11:10
in my ring so it would be ""cyclohexanone.""
11:14
So let's go ahead and write that.
11:15
So, ""cyclohexanone"" indicating we have
11:21
a ketone present and so we know the ketones
11:24
take priority over alkyl groups so we're going
11:26
to give this carbon a number one on our ring.
11:29
And we're going to choose to around clockwise
11:30
because that gives the lowest number to our alkyl group.
11:33
So we go two and three.
11:35
And so we have a methyl group at carbon three.
11:37
So it'd be ""three-methylcyclohexanone""
11:42
as the iupac name.
11:44
Alright, and then finally what happens if you
11:46
have two ketones in the same molecule here?
11:49
So we want to give the lowest number possible
11:52
so we start numbering from the left side
11:54
so one, two, three, four, five and six.
11:59
So we have two ketones, so that's going
12:01
to be a ""dione.""
12:02
So one way to name it would be to say
12:05
well it will be, ""hexane"" and then we have
12:06
two ketones, right, so ""dione"".
12:09
So ""hexanedione,"" the ketones are at two and four
12:12
the carbonyl carbons are at two and four.
12:14
So ""two-four-hexanedione"" is one way to do it.
12:19
And of course you can also do it the more modern way,
12:22
you can just write ""hexane"" right,
12:24
and then after hexane, so hexane [as I've] told you
12:27
six carbons, so you could write
12:28
""two-four-dione""
12:32
Alright so that's it for nomenclature
12:34
of aldehydes and ketones.",What is incorrect about naming the molecule in that manner?
khan_video_JVDrlTdzxiI_6,Math,MCQ,"•
0:00
I have here three linear equations of four unknowns.
0:03
And like the first video, where I talked about reduced
0:07
row echelon form, and solving systems of linear equations
0:10
using augmented matrices, at least my gut feeling says,
0:13
look, I have fewer equations than variables, so I probably
0:16
won't be able to constrain this enough.
0:18
Or maybe I'll have an infinite number of solutions.
0:20
But let's see if I'm right.
0:21
So let's construct the augmented matrix for this
0:24
system of equations.
0:27
My coefficients on the x1 terms are 1, 1, and 2.
0:33
Coefficients on the x2 are 2, 2, and 4.
0:38
Coefficients on x3 are 1, 2, and 0.
0:43
There's of course no x3 term, so we can view it as a 0
0:46
coefficient.
0:47
Coefficients on the x4 are 1, minus 1, and 6.
0:53
And then on the right-hand side of the equals sign, I
0:56
have 8, 12, and 4.
1:00
There's my augmented matrix, now let's put this guy into
1:04
reduced row echelon form.
1:08
The first thing I want to do is, I want to zero out these
1:10
two rows right here.
1:12
So what can we do?
1:14
I'm going to keep my first row the same for now, so it's 1,
1:18
2, 1, 1, 8.
1:23
That line essentially represents my equals sign.
1:28
What I can do is, let me subtract-- let me replace the
1:30
second row with the second row minus the first row.
1:35
So 1 minus 1 is 0, 2 minus 2 is 0, 2 minus 1 is 1, 1--
1:45
negative 1 minus 1 is minus 2, and then 12 minus 8 is 4.
1:54
There you go, that looks good so far, it looks like column,
1:58
or x2 which is represented by column two, looks like it
2:00
might be a free variable, but we're not 100% sure yet.
2:04
Let's do all of our rows.
2:07
So let's take-- to get rid of this guy right here, let's
2:11
replace our third equation with the third equation minus
2:14
two times our first equation.
2:17
So we get 2 minus 2 times 1 is 0, 4 minus 2 times 2, well
2:26
that's 0, 0 minus 2 times 1, that's minus 2.
2:35
6 minus 2 times 1, well that's 4, right?
2:40
6 minus 2.
2:41
And then 4 minus 2 times 8, is minus 16, 4
2:47
minus 16 is minus 12.
2:52
Now what can we do?
2:53
Well, let's see if we can get rid of this minus
2:56
2 term right there.
2:58
So let me rewrite my augmented matrix.
3:03
I'm going to keep row two the same this time, so I get a 0,
3:07
0, 1, minus 2, and essentially my equals sign, or the
3:12
augmented part of the matrix.
3:15
And now let's see what I can do.
3:17
Let me get rid of this 0 up here, because I want to get
3:19
into reduced row echelon form.
3:21
So any of my pivot entries, which are always going to have
3:24
the coefficient 1, or the entry 1, it should be the only
3:26
non-zero term in my row.
3:28
How do I get rid of this one here?
3:30
Well I can subtract-- I can replace row one with row 1
3:35
minus row 2.
3:38
So 1 minus 0 is 1, 2 minus 0 is 2, 1 minus 1 is 0, 1 minus
3:48
minus 2, that's 1 plus 2, which is 3.
3:52
And then 8 minus 4 is 4.
3:56
And now how can I get rid of this guy?
3:59
Well let me replace row 3 with row 3 plus 2 times row 1.
4:06
Sorry, with row 3 plus 2 times row 2.
4:09
Right?
4:10
Because then you'd have minus 2, plus 2 times this, and
4:12
they'd cancel out.
4:13
So let's see the zeros.
4:15
0 plus 2 times 0, that's 0.
4:18
0 plus 2 times 0, that's 0, minus 2 plus 2 times 1 is 0.
4:26
4 plus 2 times minus 2, that's 4 minus 4, that's 0.
4:35
And then I have minus 12, plus 2 times 4.
4:40
That's minus 12 plus 8, that's minus 4.
4:47
Now, this is interesting right now-- this is interesting.
4:49
I have essentially put this in reduced row echelon form.
4:53
I have two pivot entries, that's a pivot entry right
4:56
there, and that's a pivot entry right there.
4:59
They're the only non-zero term in their respective columns.
5:03
And this is just kind of a style issue, but this pivot
5:05
entry is in a lower row than that one.
5:08
So it's in a column to the right of this one right there.
5:12
And I just inspected, this looks like a-- this column two
5:16
looks kind of like a free variable-- there's no pivot
5:19
entry there, no pivot entry there.
5:20
But let's see, let's map this back to
5:22
our system of equations.
5:24
These are just numbers to me and I just kind of
5:26
mechanically, almost like a computer, put this in reduced
5:29
row echelon form.
5:31
Actually, almost exactly like a computer.
5:32
But let me put it back to my system of linear equations, to
5:35
see what our result is.
5:37
So we get 1 times x1, let me write it in yellow.
5:41
So I get 1 times x1, plus 2 times x2, plus 0 times x3,
5:50
plus 3 times x4 is equal to 4.
5:55
Obviously I could ignore this term right there, I didn't
5:57
even have to write it.
5:58
Actually.
5:59
I'm not going to write that.
5:59
Then I get 0 times x1, plus 0 times x2, plus 1 times x3, so
6:05
I can just write that.
6:05
I'll just write the one.
6:06
1 times x3, minus 2 times x4, is equal to 4.
6:12
And then this last term, what do I get?
6:14
I get 0 x1, plus 0 x2 plus 0 x3 plus 0 x4, well, all of
6:19
that's equal to 0, and I've got to write something on the
6:21
left-hand side.
6:22
So let me just write a 0, and that's got to be
6:25
equal to minus 4.
6:27
Well this doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
6:31
0 equals minus 4.
6:33
This is this is a nonsensical constraint, this is
6:36
impossible.
6:37
0 can never equal minus 4.
6:40
This is impossible.
6:46
Which means that it is essentially impossible to find
6:49
an intersection of these three systems of equations, or a
6:53
solution set that satisfies all of them.
6:56
When we looked at this initially, at the beginning of
6:58
the of the video, we said there are only three
7:00
equations, we have four unknowns, maybe there's going
7:02
to be an infinite set of solutions.
7:03
But turns out that these three-- I guess you can call
7:07
them these three surfaces-- don't intersect in r4.
7:11
Right?
7:11
These are all four dimensional, we're dealing in
7:14
r4 right here, because we have-- I guess each vector has
7:19
four components, or we have four variables, is the way you
7:22
could think about it.
7:23
And it's always hard to visualize things in r4.
7:26
But if we were doing things in r3, we can imagine the
7:29
situation where, let's say we had two planes in r3.
7:34
So that's one plane right there, and then I had another
7:36
completely parallel plane to that one.
7:39
So I had another completely parallel plane
7:42
to that first one.
7:43
Even though these would be two planes in r3, so let me give
7:47
an example.
7:47
So let's say that this first plane was represented by the
7:51
equation 3x plus 6y plus 9z is equal to 5, and the second
8:02
plane was represented by the equation 3x plus 6y plus 9z is
8:08
equal to 2.
8:11
These two planes in r3-- this is the case of r3, so this is
8:15
r3 right here.
8:17
These two planes, clearly they'll never intersect.
8:19
Because obviously this one has the same coefficients adding
8:23
up to 5, this one has the same coefficient adding up to 2.
8:26
And when, if we just looked at this initially, if it wasn't
8:28
so obvious, we would have said, we have only two
8:31
equations with three unknowns, maybe this has an infinite set
8:33
of solutions.
8:34
But it won't be the case, because you can actually just
8:36
subtract this equation, from the bottom equation, from the
8:39
top equation.
8:40
And what do you get?
8:41
You would get a very familiar-- so if you just
8:44
subtract the bottom equation from the top equation, and you
8:46
get 3x minus 3x, 6y minus 6y, 9z minus 9z-- actually, let me
8:50
do it right here.
8:51
So for that minus that, you get zero is equal to 5 minus
8:55
2, which is 3.
8:56
Which is a very similar result that we got up there.
8:59
So when you have two parallel planes, in this case in r3, or
9:03
really to any kind of two parallel equations, or a set
9:07
of parallel equations, they won't intersect.
9:08
And you're going to get, when you put it in reduced row
9:12
echelon form, or you just do basic elimination, or you
9:14
solve the systems, you're going to get a statement that
9:17
zero is equal to something, and that means that there are
9:19
no solutions.
9:23
So the general take-away, if you have zero equals
9:26
something, no solutions.
9:27
If you have the same number of pivot variables, the same
9:31
number of pivot entries as you do columns, so if you get the
9:36
situations-- let me write this down, this is good to know.
9:39
if you have zero is equal to anything, then
9:41
that means no solution.
9:44
If you're dealing with r3, then you probably have
9:46
parallel planes, in r2 you're dealing with parallel lines.
9:50
If you have the situation where you have the same number
9:55
of pivot entries as columns, so it's just 1, 1, 1, 1, this
10:02
is the case of r4 right there.
10:05
I think you get the idea.
10:07
That equals a, b, c, d.
10:10
Then you have a unique solution.
10:15
Now if, you have any free variables-- so free variables
10:19
look like this, so let's say we have 1, 0, 1, 0, and then I
10:23
have the entry 1, 1, let me be careful.
10:30
0, let me do it like this.
10:33
1, 0, 0, and then I have the entry 1, 2, and then I have a
10:41
bunch of zeroes over here.
10:43
And then this has to equal zero-- remember, if this was a
10:45
bunch of zeroes equaling some variable, then I would have no
10:47
solution, or equalling some constant, let's say this is
10:50
equal to 5, this is equal to 2.
10:52
If this is our reduced row echelon form that we
10:55
eventually get to, then we have a few free variables.
10:58
This is a free, or I guess we could call this column a free
11:02
column, to some degree this one would be too.
11:04
Because it has no pivot entries.
11:07
These are the pivot entries.
11:09
So this is variable x2 and that's variable x4.
11:13
Then these would be free, we can set
11:14
them equal to anything.
11:16
So then here we have unlimited solutions,
11:19
or no unique solutions.
11:21
And that was actually the first example we saw.
11:23
And these are really the three cases that you're going to see
11:25
every time, and it's good to get familiar with them so
11:27
you're never going to get stumped up when you have
11:29
something like 0 equals minus 4, or 0 equals 3.
11:32
Or if you have just a bunch of zeros and a bunch of rows.
11:35
I want to make that very clear.
11:36
Sometimes, you see a bunch of zeroes here, on the left-hand
11:40
side of the augmented divide, and you might say, oh maybe I
11:44
have no unique solutions, I have an
11:45
infinite number of solutions.
11:46
But you have to look at this entry right here.
11:50
Only if this whole thing is zero and you have free
11:52
variables, then you have an infinite number of solutions.
11:56
If you have a statement like, 0 is equal to a, if this is
11:59
equal to 7 right here, then all of the sudden you would
12:01
have no solution to this.
12:03
That you're dealing with parallel surfaces.
12:05
Anyway, hopefully you found that helpful.",why do i need 4 equations for 4 unknowns?

The main mast of a fishing boat is supported by a sturdy
0:04
rope that extends from the top of the mast to the deck.
0:07
If the mast is 20 feet tall and the rope attaches to the
0:10
deck 15 feet away from the base of the mast,
0:14
how long is the rope?
0:16
So let's draw ourselves a boat and make sure we understand
0:19
what the deck and the mast and all of that is.
0:22
So let me draw a boat.
0:25
I'll start with yellow.
0:27
So let's say that this is my boat.
0:31
That is the deck of the boat.
0:33
And the boat might look something like this.
0:37
It's a sailing boat.
0:40
This is the water down here.
0:45
And then the mast is the thing that holds up the sail.
0:47
So let me draw ourselves a mast.
0:56
And they say the mast is 20 feet tall.
0:59
So this distance right here is 20 feet.
1:04
That is what is holding up the sail.
1:07
I can draw it as a pole so it's a little bit clearer.
1:10
Even shade it in if we like.
1:12
And then they say a rope attaches to the deck 15 feet
1:16
away from the base of the mast. So this is the base of
1:18
the mast. This is the deck right here.
1:20
The rope attaches 15 feet away from the base of the mast.
1:26
So if this is the base of the mast, we go 15 feet, might be
1:29
about that distance right there.
1:31
Let me mark that.
1:36
And the rope attaches right here.
1:37
From the top of the mast all the way that base.
1:40
So the rope goes like that.
1:44
And then they ask us, how long is the rope?
1:48
So there's a few things you might realize.
1:50
We're dealing with a triangle here.
1:52
And it's not any triangle.
1:53
We're assuming that the mast goes straight up and that the
1:57
deck is straight left and right.
1:59
So this is a right triangle.
2:00
This is a 90 degree angle right here.
2:05
And we know that, if we know two sides of a right triangle,
2:08
we can always figure out the third side of a right triangle
2:11
using the Pythagorean theorem.
2:19
And all that tells us is it the sum of the squares of the
2:24
shorter sides of the triangle are going to be equal to the
2:27
square of the longer side.
2:29
And that longer side is call the hypotenuse.
2:36
And in all cases, the hypotenuse is the side
2:39
opposite the 90 degree angle.
2:40
It is always going to be the longest side
2:42
of our right triangle.
2:44
So we need to figure out the hypotenuse here.
2:46
We know the lengths of the two shorter sides.
2:48
So we can see that if we take 15 squared, that's one of the
2:54
short sides, I'm squaring it.
2:56
And then add that to the square of the other shorter
2:59
side, to 20 feet squared.
3:01
And when I say the shorter side, I mean relative to the
3:03
hypotenuse.
3:04
The hypotenuse will always be the longest side.
3:09
Let's say the hypotenuse is in green just so we get our color
3:12
coding nice.
3:13
That is going to be equal to the rope squared.
3:17
Or the length of the rope.
3:18
Let's call this distance right here r.
3:21
r for rope.
3:28
So 15 squared plus 20 squared is going to
3:30
be equal to r squared.
3:33
And what's 15 squared?
3:34
It's 225.
3:37
20 squared is 400.
3:43
And that's going to be equal to r squared.
3:47
Now 225 plus 400 is 625.
3:52
625 is equal to r squared.
3:55
And then we can take the principal root of both sides
3:57
of this equation.
3:58
Because we're talking about distances, we want the
4:00
positive square root.
4:01
So you take the positive square root, or the principal
4:04
root, of both sides of this equation.
4:07
And you are left with r is equal to the
4:10
square root of 625.
4:11
You can play with it a little bit if you like.
4:13
But if you've ever played with numbers around 25, you'll see
4:17
that this is 25 squared.
4:20
So r is equal to the square root of 625, which is 25.
4:25
So this distance right here, the length of the rope, is
4:28
equal to 25 feet.",does other triangles have methods to work out their length of the three sides?

Voiceover:Let's say that we've got a position vector, P
0:04
and it is equal to or represented as a column vector,
0:07
right over here, 2, 1.
0:09
If we wanted to plot this, and that is what I'll do.
0:12
Let's plot it.
0:15
If we were to plot it,
0:17
that's my Y axis,
0:19
this right over here is my X axis.
0:25
If we assume that the first entry
0:27
here is X coordinate, 1, 2, 1.
0:32
Our position vector is going to be right over here.
0:35
We could represent it.
0:37
We could represent it in
0:38
this kind of vector symbol, like that.
0:40
Where the tail is at the origin
0:42
and the tip, the head, is at that point
0:44
or we could say it's really representing this position,
0:48
right over here on the coordinate plan.
0:51
What I wanted to do in this video
0:52
is apply a transformation to this position vector.
0:57
The way I'm going to do it
0:58
is I'm going to multiply our vector, P
1:01
by a matrix and then the resulting product
1:04
is going to give me another position vector.
1:07
So, what do I mean by that?
1:09
I could have a transformation matrix, capital T
1:13
and let's just say it is equal to 2, 1, -1, and 2.
1:24
What happens if I multiply TxP?
1:27
Let's do that right over here.
1:28
TxP, so first let's just make sure that
1:35
this is actually a valid operation
1:38
that matrix multiplication
1:40
or matrix vector multiplication is defined here.
1:43
Let's just look at what T and P look like.
1:47
I'm gonna copy and paste.
1:49
That is T and this is P right over here.
1:58
Can we multiply a 2x2 matrix
2:03
times a column vector like this,
2:06
which is essentially 2x1 matrix.
2:09
Well sure, as as we know
2:11
matrix multiplication is only defined,
2:13
or at least conventional matrix multiplication
2:14
is only defined if the first matrix number
2:19
of columns is equal to the number
2:24
of rows in the second matrix, right over here.
2:27
We see there, both of those are 2.
2:29
This is going to result in a 2x1 matrix.
2:34
This is going to result in a 2x1 matrix.
2:39
What's interesting about that is
2:43
that this is another column vector.
2:45
This is another position vector.
2:46
You took this vector P,
2:48
multiplied it by this transformation vector
2:50
and we're gonna get another 2x1,
2:52
which we could think of as a position vector,
2:54
which we could plot.
2:55
What's essentially happened is
2:57
this transformation vector has moved,
2:59
has essentially given this point.
3:02
It has given us a new point.
3:04
Let's think about what that is.
3:07
This first entry here,
3:08
we're essentially thinking about,
3:09
we're going to deal with the first row
3:12
and the first and the only column, really.
3:15
Let me do, use a color that I haven't used yet.
3:18
We're gonna think about this row and this column.
3:21
It's gonna be 2x2, which is 4,
3:23
plus 1x1, which is 1
3:26
or this is just going to be equal to 5.
3:29
For the second entry, right over here.
3:32
It's going for the second row, first column.
3:35
It's gonna deal with the second row here
3:37
and the one and only column, right over here.
3:40
-1x2 is -2, plus 2x1, which is 2.
3:46
-2+2 is just equal to 0.
3:52
Now, we have the position 5, 0,
3:55
which is right over here.
3:57
1,2,3,4,5
4:03
So, we started with this point,
4:05
this position vector, I guess you could say, P
4:08
As transformed it to this other position vector
4:11
and I guess we could call this P prime.
4:16
If you wanted to draw them as vectors,
4:18
this right over, kinda tradition vector form,
4:21
that right over there is P prime
4:24
and this right over here is P.
4:27
This right over here is P.
4:31
This is P actually, let me make sure there's a prime.
4:33
This is P prime
4:34
and the way we got from P to P prime
4:37
is using this transformation matrix.",Is there a specific reason you had to multiply the vector with the matrix?
khan_video_LNSB0N6esPU_30754,Math,ESSAY,"•
0:00
- [Voiceover] Let's say that we have the linear equation,
0:02
y = 1/2x - 3.
0:09
So if we wanted to draw the line that represents
0:13
the set of all points, all the coordinates where the x value
0:16
and the y value satisfy this equation,
0:18
we could start off by just trying to draw,
0:20
by trying to draw a few of those points,
0:23
and then connecting them with a line.
0:26
Let's set up a little table here x, y.
0:30
And we can just try a couple of x values here,
0:32
then figure out what the corresponding y values are.
0:35
I'm going to pick x values where it's going
0:37
to be fairly easy to calculate the y values.
0:39
Let's say when x is equal to zero,
0:41
then you're gonna have 1/2 x 0 - 3,
0:44
well then y is going to be -3.
0:46
When x is, let me try x = 2, because then 1/2 x 2
0:50
is just gonna be 1.
0:52
So when x = 2, you're going to have
0:55
1/2 x 2 = 1, -3 is -2.
1:00
When x is equal to, let's try 4.
1:04
So 1/2 x 4 is 2, and then -3 is -1,
1:12
and we could keep going but actually
1:14
all we need is two points for a line.
1:16
So we're ready to plot this line if we'd like.
1:18
The point 0, -3 is on this line.
1:22
0, -3 and actually let me do this in a slightly darker color
1:25
so that we can see it on this white background.
1:27
0, -3 is on the line, 2, -2 is on the line.
1:32
So 2, -2 and then we have 4, -1.
1:38
So when x is 4, y is -1,
1:42
and I could draw a line that connects all of these
1:47
so it would look something like...
1:49
If I, let's see if I could do this.
1:51
It would look something like,
1:54
it would something like, like that.
1:59
So this right over here, this is literally,
2:01
this is the graph of y = 1/2x - 3.
2:09
Now when we look at a graph like this
2:11
an interesting thing that we might want to ask ourself
2:13
is where does the graph intersect our axes?
2:18
So first we can say, well where does
2:19
in intersect our x-axis?
2:22
When you look at this, it looks like
2:23
it happens at this point right over here.
2:26
This point where a graph intersects an axes
2:30
this is called an intercept.
2:31
This one in particular is called the x-intercept.
2:35
Why is it called the x-intercept?
2:37
Because that's where the graph
2:38
is intersecting the x-axis
2:41
and the x-intercept, it looks like
2:44
this is at the .6, 0.
2:47
Now it's very interesting, the x-intercept
2:49
happens when y = 0.
2:51
Remember, you're on the x-axis when
2:53
you haven't moved up or down from that axis
2:56
which means y = 0.
2:58
So your x-intercept happens at x = 6, y = 0.
3:02
It's this coordinate.
3:04
Now what about the y-intercept?
3:06
Well the y-intercept is this point right over here.
3:08
This is where you intersect or I guess
3:10
you could say intercept the y-axis.
3:13
So this right over here, that over there
3:16
is the y-intercept.
3:19
The y-intercept is at the coordinate
3:21
that has a 0 for the x-coordinate.
3:24
X is 0 here and y is -3.
3:27
X is 0 and y is -3.
3:30
This was actually one of the points,
3:31
or one of the pairs that we first tried out.
3:36
You can validate that 6, 0 satisfies this equation
3:40
right over here.
3:41
If x is 6, 1/2 x 6 is 3, -3 is indeed equal to 0.
3:46
So now that we know what an x-intercept is,
3:49
it's the point where a graph intersects the x-axis
3:52
or intercepts the x-axis and the y-intercept
3:54
is the point where a graph intercepts the y-axis
3:58
or intersects the y-axis.
4:00
Let's try to see if we can find the x and y-intercepts
4:01
for a few other linear equations.
4:05
So let's say that I had the linear equation.
4:09
Let's say that I have 5x + 6y = 30.
4:19
I encourage you to pause this video,
4:21
and figure out what are the x and y-intercepts
4:24
for the graph that represents the solutions,
4:27
all the xy pairs that satisfy this equation.
4:31
Well the easiest thing to do here,
4:33
let's see what the y value is when x = 0
4:38
and what x value is when y = 0.
4:42
When x = 0 this becomes 6y = 30.
4:46
So 6 times what is 30?
4:48
Well y would be equal to 5 here.
4:50
So when x is 0, y is 5.
4:54
What about when y is 0?
4:55
Well when y is 0, that's going to be 0,
4:57
and you have 5x = 30.
4:59
Well then x would be equal to 6.
5:02
Then x would be equal to 6.
5:05
So we could plot those points, 0, 5.
5:08
When x is 0, y is 5.
5:12
When x is 6, y is 0.
5:16
So those are both points on this graph
5:20
and then the actual graph is going to,
5:22
or the actual line that represents the x and y pairs
5:26
that satisfy this equation is going to look like,
5:30
it's going to look like this.
5:32
I'll just try.
5:34
So I can make it go, it's going to look like...
5:38
It's going to go through those two points.
5:41
So it going to...I can make it go the other way too.
5:44
Let me see.
5:45
It's going to go through those two points
5:48
and so it's going to look something like that.
5:51
Now what are its' x and y-intercepts?
5:54
Well, we already kind of figured it out
5:55
but the intercepts themselves,
5:56
these are the points on the graph where
5:58
they intersect the axes.
6:01
So this right over here, this is the y-intercept.
6:03
That point is the y-intercept
6:06
and it happens, it's always going to happen
6:08
when x = 0, and when x = 0 we know that y = 5.
6:13
It's that point, the point 0, 5.
6:15
And what is the y inter...what is the x-intercept?
6:19
The x-intercept is the point, it's actually
6:21
the same x-intercept for this equation right over here.
6:25
It's the point 6, 0. That point right over there.","I have a question: this question i got is to find the x and y intercept
3x-2/3=1/2y+7

the 2/3 and 1/2 are fractions and first of all where do I start?"

What I want to do in this video is
0:00
reconcile the more traditional Drake equation
0:00
So this product would give you the average stars
0:00
with the stuff that we derived, or that we came up with.
0:01
This is the average rate of star formation
0:01
are actually the same thing.
0:01
And then the rest of it looks pretty similar.
0:01
We kind of thought through it in the last several videos.
0:01
seems kind of unintuitive, and frankly,
0:01
So the more known Drake equation is this.
0:01
So I don't know what it is.
0:01
The number of detectable civilizations in the galaxy
0:01
is equal to-- and they'll have this.
0:01
What I want to do in this video is
0:01
The number of detectable civilizations in the galaxy
0:02
And this is not the number of stars in the galaxy.
0:02
So times the fraction of stars that have planets.
0:02
it is, but hopefully we'll reconcile to show you
0:03
So that's the average rate of star formation.
0:03
with the traditional Drake equation
0:03
that this, and what we're going to show
0:03
Average rate of star formation, which
0:03
So star-- so let me write this down.
0:03
You multiply that times the average number
0:03
with planet formations per year.
0:03
Maybe it's 10 stars a year, or something on that order.
0:03
of planets capable of sustaining life
0:03
reconcile the more traditional Drake equation
0:05
per year in the galaxy.
0:05
with the stuff that we derived, or that we came up with.
0:06
So the more known Drake equation is this.
0:06
We kind of thought through it in the last several videos.
0:06
for a star that has planets, for a solar system that
99:59:59
has planets.
99:59:59
So essentially, if you multiply this,
99:59:59
this is the average new planets per year
99:59:59
in our galaxy capable of sustaining life.
99:59:59
You multiply that times this, which
99:59:59
is the same exact fraction.
99:59:59
The fraction of those planets that
99:59:59
are capable of sustaining life, that actually, this
99:59:59
is capable of sustaining life, now we're
99:59:59
saying that the fraction that actually do develop life.
99:59:59
And then of the life, we care about the fraction
99:59:59
that actually does become intelligent.
99:59:59
And of the fraction that actually
99:59:59
does become intelligent, we care about the fraction
99:59:59
that eventually becomes detectable.
99:59:59
That can actually communicate.
99:59:59
And then in the traditional Drake equation,
99:59:59
we multiply that times this L over here.
99:59:59
Times the detectable life of the civilization.
99:59:59
So how long is that civilization detectable?
99:59:59
Are they releasing radio waves, or something like it
99:59:59
that a civilization like ours can detect?
99:59:59
Maybe there are other ways to communicate,
99:59:59
and we're just not advanced enough.
99:59:59
Maybe in a few years, we'll discover
99:59:59
in a few decades, or a few hundreds of years,
99:59:59
we'll discover that all the other advanced civilizations
99:59:59
are using a much more sophisticated way
99:59:59
of communicating that doesn't involve electromagnetic waves.
99:59:59
Who knows?
99:59:59
But this is what we're thinking right now.
99:59:59
But anyway, the whole point here is
99:59:59
to reconcile this thing which is less intuitive-- for me
99:59:59
at least-- than with this thing.
99:59:59
Because I started up here with the total number
99:59:59
of stars in the galaxy.
99:59:59
The traditional Drake equation starts
99:59:59
with the average rate of star formation.
99:59:59
So it's like, well, how does the average rate of star formation
99:59:59
gel with the total number of stars,
99:59:59
or civilizations that are now detectable?
99:59:59
What I want to do is diagram that out a little bit,
99:59:59
and I'm going to make a few assumptions.
99:59:59
I'm going to assume that this is kind of constant, that we're
99:59:59
in a steady state.
99:59:59
So this is constant, and we are in a steady state.
99:59:59
The reality is that what would matter
99:59:59
is the rate of star formation maybe 4, 5,
99:59:59
6 billion years ago, I don't know
99:59:59
how long it has to be ago, so that now it
99:59:59
starts to become realistic for real intelligence
99:59:59
and real detectable intelligence to exist.
99:59:59
But let's just assume that this number
99:59:59
is constant for most of the life of the galaxy.
99:59:59
Obviously we're making all sorts of crazy assumptions here,
99:59:59
so why not make another one?
99:59:59
But what I want you to show is that this
99:59:59
is equivalent to the number of stars in the galaxy divided
99:59:59
by the average life of a star, or the average life
99:59:59
of a solar system.
99:59:59
And if n divided by this t sub s,
99:59:59
if that's the same thing as our star, then
99:59:59
essentially we have the same formulas.
99:59:59
And to see that they're the same, imagine this.
99:59:59
Imagine this.
99:59:59
That this year, so this is this year, so this is-- well,
99:59:59
let me say this year.
99:59:59
This year.
99:59:59
Let's say that we have our star.
99:59:59
Let's say that this number is 10.
99:59:59
We have 10 new stars in the galaxy.
99:59:59
So this is-- I'll just say it's 10.
99:59:59
So our star is equal to 10.
99:59:59
So this height over here is 10.
99:59:59
That's what I'm depicting.
99:59:59
So if I were to slide it, I could
99:59:59
show that this is 10 units high, or whatever.
99:59:59
And then last year, there was also 10, so on and so forth.
99:59:59
Now, let's go to whatever-- let's
99:59:59
say that this number, this number right over here
99:59:59
is 10 billion years.
99:59:59
The average star life is 10 billion years.
99:59:59
So let's go back 10 billion years into the past.
99:59:59
So the average life of a star is equal to 10 billion years.
99:59:59
And we're assuming that this is constant.
99:59:59
So 10 billion years ago this year,
99:59:59
there were also 10 new stars came about.
99:59:59
And every year in between you had 10 stars come about.
99:59:59
Now, how many total stars would there be in our galaxy?
99:59:59
Well, any star that came about-- so we could go beyond that.
99:59:59
We could go to stars that were born more than 10 billion years
99:59:59
ago, more than this t sub s years ago.
99:59:59
So you could have a star that was born 10
99:59:59
billion and 1 years ago, on average.
99:59:59
We're talking about on averages here.
99:59:59
On average, that star will not exist anymore,
99:59:59
so that star is not in existence.
99:59:59
The stars that are in existence, once again, on average,
99:59:59
are the ones that were born 10 billion years ago, all the way
99:59:59
to the ones that were born this year.
99:59:59
So you have 10 billion years of star birth,
99:59:59
the ones that are still around.
99:59:59
Each year there's 10 of those years,
99:59:59
so the total number of stars should
99:59:59
be equal to the number of stars that
99:59:59
are born each year-- assuming that that is constant--
99:59:59
times the average lifespan of the stars.
99:59:59
Times the average lifespan of the stars.
99:59:59
And once again, this works because the stars that
99:59:59
were born before this lifespan don't exist anymore.
99:59:59
They've died out, on average.
99:59:59
We care about kind of this area right over here.
99:59:59
10 stars per year times 10 billion years.
99:59:59
And now if you manipulate this a little bit,
99:59:59
you'll see that we'll get the result we want.
99:59:59
Let's solve for r.
99:59:59
So we could just divide both sides by this t.
99:59:59
So you get n star, so the number of stars in our galaxy now,
99:59:59

Show 109% by shading.
0:04
So just as a bit of review, 109% if we were to write it
0:09
out, would literally be 109 percent, which is the same
0:16
thing as 109 per-- and I could write cent again, but that's
0:25
getting old.
0:26
Cent means 100, so it literally
0:28
means 109 per hundred.
0:32
If you had 100 per 100, you're dealing with the whole, but
0:35
now we have more than a whole.
0:37
We have 109 per 100.
0:38
We can actually write this as a ratio, or as a fraction.
0:41
This is the same thing as 109 per 100.
0:45
It's the the same thing as 109/100.
0:48
So let's shade that in.
0:50
So we have a whole here, so we could consider
0:53
this square a whole.
0:55
In the last video, we counted.
0:57
This is a 10 by 10 square.
0:58
It is cut up into 100 pieces.
1:01
So if we want 109 of those 100 pieces, what
1:05
are we talking about?
1:06
That means we're going to shade in all of the
1:08
100 right over here.
1:09
Let me do that in a new color.
1:10
So we'll shade in all of this.
1:17
If you just shaded that in, that would be 100%.
1:20
That would be 100/100, or 100 per 100, or 100%.
1:28
I think you're getting the meaning of all of this.
1:30
I don't just want you just memorize this stuff.
1:31
This really just means 100 out of 100, or a whole.
1:34
And you can see that this is the whole square.
1:37
That's 100 out of 100 right there.
1:39
The question is saying show us 109% by shading.
1:43
We already did 100 per 100, but we need to do another 9,
1:46
so let's shade in another 9.
1:48
So now we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
1:55
eight, nine.
1:57
So this piece right here, you could almost view that is--
1:59
well, that is!
2:02
That is 9% of an entire square.
2:04
This is 100% of an entire square.
2:06
If you considered this whole thing plus this blue area
2:10
right over here, you are talking about 109% of one
2:16
whole square.
2:18
Hopefully, that made sense.",do you really turn percentages into fractions?

I told you in the last video on calendar notation that,
0:03
regardless of whether you're using BC, AD or BCE and CE,
0:08
that there is no year 0, that we had 1 BC.
0:13
And then we had that theoretical birth of Jesus,
0:16
and most historians don't think that he
0:18
was born right exactly on January 1, 1 AD.
0:23
But there's no year 0.
0:24
Right after that, you go from December 31, 1
0:28
BC, to January 1, 1 AD.
0:31
There's no year 0.
0:33
And despite the fact that I emphasized
0:35
that in the last video, I didn't take that into consideration
0:39
when I calculated how many years there
0:41
were between Plato's birth and Columbus discovering
0:46
the new world.
0:47
And the reason why I didn't take that into consideration
0:50
is that the year 1492, whether you
0:52
want to call it AD 1492, Anno Domini 1492.
0:57
Whether you want to call it that,
0:58
or whether you want to call it 1492 in the Common Era.
1:01
It's not 1492 years since the theoretical birth of Jesus,
1:07
which we know is not the actual birth.
1:08
He was probably born before that.
1:11
It is 1,491 years since the birth of Jesus.
1:15
And to think about it this way, let's
1:17
just assume-- I'll keep emphasizing,
1:19
it's a theoretical date that we're talking--
1:21
or the theoretical event, this kind of birth of Jesus
1:24
that our calendars revolve around.
1:27
If we talk about January 1, let's think about it this way.
1:33
So January 1, 1 in the Common Era.
1:42
How long is that since the birth of Jesus?
1:45
It's not one year.
1:46
You wouldn't just look at this and say
1:47
it's been one year, because this is theoretically
1:50
the day that he was born.
1:52
So this is zero years, or almost zero years
1:55
since that theoretical birth of Jesus.
1:57
Another way to think about it is how long after January 1,
2:04
the year 1 before the Common Era--
2:09
and I could've called this AD, and I
2:11
could've called this BC-- what's the time
2:13
difference between these two dates?
2:15
So the way I calculated it before, I said,
2:17
oh, this is one year after that theoretical birth.
2:19
That's wrong.
2:20
This is during that theoretical birth.
2:22
But if I did it the way I did in the last video,
2:24
I would have said, oh, that's one year after,
2:25
one year before.
2:26
You add them together, and you would get two.
2:28
But that's wrong because there is no year 0.
2:31
So January 1, 1 AD, or 1 in the Common Era is right over here.
2:37
And then January 1, 1 BCE, is exactly one year before that.
2:42
So there's only one year, one year difference.
2:45
And the reason why the math is strange
2:47
is because there is no year 0.
2:50
If there was a year 0, then my calculation in the last video
2:53
was correct.
2:54
So really, the way that you would calculate
2:57
the time between Plato's birth at 428 BC and Columbus sailing
3:03
across the Atlantic in 1492, you would say, OK.
3:08
This is 428 years before that theoretical birth of Christ.
3:13
But this isn't 1,492 years after that theoretical birth.
3:18
This is 1492 minus 1.
3:21
So what you would do is you would add these two numbers.
3:23
This is 428 before.
3:25
This is 1,492 minus 1 years after.
3:28
So you would add them and then subtract 1.
3:31
So the correct answer-- so this is the correction part--
3:34
it isn't 1,920 years between Plato's birth and Columbus.
3:40
We want to subtract 1 from that.
3:42
It is 1,920 minus 1 years.
3:45
So that is 1,919 years.
3:49
The same way that the difference between 1 AD and 1 BCE,
3:54
you could almost view it as positive and negative numbers.
3:57
You say, oh, this is positive 1 minus negative 1.
3:59
That would give me two.
4:00
But there is no 0, so you would need to subtract another 1.
4:03
So this is exactly 1 year difference.
4:06
So just want to clarify that.
4:07
That's what that no year 0 does to us.","so instead of christ, we should as a species use a more generally humanitarian acronym, like ""aag"" or ""after agriculture""?"

0:00
In this video, we're going to hopefully understand
0:06
why the exponential form of a complex number
0:08
is actually useful.
0:13
So let's say we want to solve the equation x
0:15
to the third power is equal to 1.
0:18
So we want to find all of the real and/or complex roots
0:22
of this equation right over here.
0:24
This is the same thing as x to the third minus 1
0:27
is equal to 0.
0:27
So we're looking for all the real and complex roots of this.
0:31
And there are ways to do this without exponential form
0:34
of a complex number.
0:35
But the technique we're going to see in this video
0:38
could be applied if this was x to the fifth minus 1,
0:40
or x to the 13th minus 1.
0:42
And it's also going to show us the patterns that
0:46
emerge when you start looking at things on an Argand diagram.
0:49
So to do this, let's think about the exponential representation
0:54
of 1.
0:55
So let's just say z is equal to 1.
0:57
1 is a complex number.
0:59
It's a real number.
1:00
All real numbers are also complex numbers.
1:02
They're a subset.
1:04
They're in the complex plane.
1:07
They just don't have an imaginary part.
1:10
So let's draw this on an Argand diagram.
1:13
So that's my real axis.
1:15
This is my imaginary axis.
1:22
And so this is the real.
1:24
This is the imaginary.
1:26
And if I wanted to represent z equals 1,
1:29
it only has a real part.
1:31
So let me just draw 1 all around.
1:33
Negative 1.
1:35
Negative 1.
1:36
z looks like this.
1:42
z would look like that, a position
1:44
vector that just goes to 1, 0.
1:47
One way to view it-- this is the same thing as equal to 1
1:51
plus 0i.
1:54
Now, let's put this in exponential form.
1:57
Well, its magnitude is pretty straightforward.
2:00
The magnitude of z is just the length of this vector,
2:03
or it's the absolute value of 1.
2:06
That's just going to be 1.
2:09
Now, what's the argument of z?
2:14
What's the angle that this vector
2:15
makes with the positive real axis?
2:19
Well, it's on the positive real axis.
2:20
It's a real number.
2:22
So it has no angle.
2:23
So the arg of z is 0.
2:26
So that might not be too interesting so far.
2:30
We just figured out that 1 is equal to 1 times e to the 0i.
2:40
And this is kind of obvious.
2:41
e to the 0-- this is just going to be 0.
2:44
0 times i is 0.
2:45
e to the 0 is going to be 1, times 1 is equal to 1.
2:47
Not a big deal there.
2:49
But what is neat is that this argument-- you could view it
2:52
as 0 radians, or you could go all the way around
2:55
and add 2 pi to it and get to the same point.
3:02
So the argument of our complex number-- or of the number 1,
3:07
really-- could also be an angle of 2 pi, or an angle of 4 pi,
3:12
or an angle of 6 pi, or an angle of 8 pi.
3:15
So we can write 1 as 1 times e-- I
3:20
won't write the 1 anymore-- 1 times
3:22
e to the 2 pi i, or 1 times e to the 4 pi i.
3:31
And the reason why this is interesting
3:32
is then this equation right here can
3:35
be written in multiple ways.
3:36
It can be written as x to the third is equal to 1.
3:42
It could be written as x to the third
3:44
is equal to e to the 2 pi i.
3:49
Or it could be written as x to the third
3:52
is equal to e to the 4 pi i.
3:57
And this is interesting, and we're
3:59
going to see this in a second.
4:00
Let's take both sides of all these equations
4:02
to the one-third power to solve for x.
4:04
So to the one-third.
4:06
We're going to take that to the one-third.
4:08
We're going to do that same thing over here.
4:10
We're just taking everything to the one-third power
4:12
to solve for the x's in each of these equations.
4:16
To the one-third power.
4:18
So this first equation over here becomes x is equal to 1
4:21
to the one-third power, which is just equal to 1.
4:25
Now, what's the second equation become?
4:27
This second equation-- x is equal to e to the-- well,
4:31
this is going to be the 2 pi over 3, i power.
4:41
And then this equation over here is
4:43
going to be-- so x is going to be equal to-- obviously,
4:46
the 3 to the one-third, that just becomes x to the 1.
4:50
Let me do that same blue.
4:52
x over here is going to be equal to e to the 4 pi over 3, i.
5:03
So let's think about this for a little bit.
5:06
What is this?
5:08
So immediately, what's the argument here?
5:11
So these are three different roots.
5:14
Let me call this x1, x2, and x3.
5:18
So these are three different numbers.
5:20
One of the roots is 1.
5:22
That's pretty clear over here.
5:23
1 is one of the cube roots of itself.
5:26
But these are other numbers.
5:28
And these are going to be complex numbers.
5:30
So let's visualize these numbers a little bit.
5:33
So what is the argument?
5:39
The magnitude of x2 is still clearly 1.
5:41
It's the coefficient out in front of the e.
5:44
It's clearly 1.
5:46
Let me do that same color.
5:48
The magnitude of x3 is also clearly going to be 1.
5:52
But what is the argument of x2?
5:55
What is phi?
5:57
What is the argument?
5:59
Well, it's 2 pi over 3.
6:02
So how would we draw x2?
6:06
So the angle is 2 pi over 3.
6:09
It's easier for me to visualize in degrees.
6:11
So 2 pi is 360 degrees.
6:14
360 degrees divided by 3 is 120 degrees.
6:18
So this is going to be-- 120 degrees
6:20
is 60 short of-- so it's going to look like this.
6:29
So this angle right here, its argument
6:31
is going to be 120 degrees, which
6:34
is the same thing as 2 pi over 3.
6:38
And it's going to have the exact same length.
6:40
So let me do it in the same color.
6:41
So this is x1.
6:43
So that is this green color right over here.
6:46
x2 is this magenta one right over here.
6:50
And they all have the same magnitude.
6:51
So we really just rotate it.
6:53
We rotate it 120 degrees.
6:54
And what about x3?
6:55
What's its argument?
6:57
What's x3's argument?
7:00
Its argument is 4 pi over 3.
7:04
That's the same thing as 720 degrees over 3,
7:09
if we were to put it into degrees.
7:11
And so 3 goes into 720-- what is it?
7:16
240?
7:18
720.
7:19
240.
7:22
Right.
7:22
I should have known that.
7:24
So 240 degrees-- we're going to go 180 degrees,
7:27
and then go another 60 degrees.
7:29
So it's going to be right over here.
7:35
So let me draw it like this.
7:36
It's going to be right over here.
7:41
That angle right over there is 4 pi
7:44
over 3 radians, which is equal to 240 degrees.
7:52
And once again, it has the same magnitude.
7:55
So what we just saw is when I take the cube
7:57
roots of this real number, I'm essentially
8:00
taking the entire-- I guess we could
8:02
call it the entire circle or the entire 360
8:05
degrees or the entire 2 pi radians--
8:07
and I'm dividing it into three, essentially.
8:12
This is one third.
8:13
Then we have another 120 degrees.
8:15
And then we have another 120 degrees.
8:17
And so you see the pattern of where all of the roots are.
8:20
And in case you're still not satisfied,
8:21
you're just like, well, you said you would find complex roots.
8:24
Yeah, I'm not used to this or this
8:27
as actually being complex numbers.
8:30
I actually want it to be in the form a plus bi-- we can easily
8:34
figure it out from this right over here.
8:36
So x2-- it's going to be equal to the cosine of 2 pi over 3
8:47
plus i times the sine of 2 pi over 3.
8:55
And if you look at this over here,
8:57
we can figure out what those things are going to be.
8:59
This is the angle right over here.
9:01
If this angle right over here is 60 degrees-- which
9:04
it is, because this up here is 30
9:05
degrees-- the hypotenuse, or the length, is 1, then
9:09
this over here is square root of 3 over 2.
9:12
And then this distance right over here is negative 1/2.
9:16
So x2 is going to be equal to-- cosine of 2 pi over 3
9:23
is-- negative 1/2.
9:26
Did I do that right?
9:27
Yep, negative 1/2, plus i times sine of 2 pi over 3.
9:32
That's this height over here, which
9:33
is square root of 3 over 2, i.
9:37
So that's x2.
9:38
And we could do the exact same thing with x3.
9:42
x3 is going to be equal to its x value.
9:45
Or I should say its real value is
9:47
going to be the exact same thing.
9:48
It's going to be negative 1/2.
9:51
And then, its imaginary value, so this angle right
9:56
over here-- this just from the negative real axis down
10:00
to the vector-- is going to be negative 60 degrees.
10:03
So this height right over here is
10:05
going to be negative square root of 3 over 2.
10:08
So it's negative 1/2 minus the square root of 3 over 2, i.
10:13
So using this technique, we were able to find
10:17
the three complex roots of 1.
10:20
This is one of them.
10:22
This is another one.
10:24
And of course, 1 is one of them as well.
10:27
Where did we do that?
10:27
1 is one of them as well.
10:29
And you could use this exact same technique
10:31
if we were finding the fourth roots.
10:32
We would take the 2 pi radians, or the 360 degrees,
10:36
and divide it into 4.
10:37
And so it would actually be this.
10:38
It would be i.
10:40
It would be negative 1.
10:41
And it would be negative i.
10:42
And we know if you take i to the fourth, you get 1.
10:44
If you take negative i to the fourth, you get 1.
10:48
And if you take negative 1 to the fourth, you get 1.
10:50
And if you take 1 to the fourth, you get 1.
10:52
And so you can find the eighth roots of 1
10:54
using this technique.
10:56
Now, the other question that might be popping in your brain
10:59
is, why did I stop at e to the 4 pi i?
11:03
Why didn't I go on and say, well,
11:05
this is equal to e to the 6 pi i and look for another root?
11:08
And so if I did that, if I said x to the third-- let's say
11:11
I wanted to find a fourth root here, maybe.
11:13
x to the third is equal to e to the 6 pi i.
11:18
And I take both sides of this equation
11:20
to the one-third power.
11:22
Taking this to the one third, I would get e to the 2 pi i.
11:28
Well, what's e to the 2 pi i? e to the 2 pi
11:30
i would just get us back to 1.
11:32
So when I added 2 pi again, it just gets us back to this root
11:35
again.
11:36
If I took e to the 6 pi, if I took e to the 8 pi,
11:39
I would get this root again.
11:40
So you're going to get only three roots if you're
11:46
finding the third roots of something.
11:49
Anything beyond that, it just becomes redundant.",what is the relationship of e(2.718...) and the unit circle?

Let me cut it right over here into 2 equal pieces.
0:11
And let's say that I ate one of those 2 equal pieces.
0:14
So let's say I ate all of this right over here.
0:17
What fraction of the pizza have I eaten?
0:20
Well, I took the whole and I divide it
0:23

0:33
So I ate 1/2 of the pizza.

But let's say that I want to eat the same amount of pizza.
1:09
How many of these 4 equal pieces would I have to eat.
1:12
I encourage you to pause the video and think about that.
1:15
Well, I would eat this piece.
1:18
You could imagine me eating this piece and this piece right
1:20
over here.
1:21
I've eaten the same amount of the pizza.
1:25
Each of these pieces you could imagine got cut into 2 pieces
1:28
when I cut the whole pizza this way.
1:31
And so now I have to eat 2 slices of the 4,
1:34
as opposed to 1 slice of the 2.
1:36
So I just ate 2 out of the 4 slices.
1:42
I'm using different numbers here.
1:44
Here I'm using a 1 in the numerator
1:47
and 2 in the denominator.
1:48
Here, I'm using a 2 in the numerator
1:49
and a 4 in the denominator.
1:51
These two fractions represent the same quantity.
1:54
I ate the same amount of pizza.
1:56
If I eat 2/4 of a pizza, if I eat 2 out of 4 equal pieces,
2:00
that's the same fraction of the pizza
2:02
as if I eat 1 out of 2 equal pieces.
2:05
So we would say that these two things
2:07
are equivalent fractions.
2:10
Now let's do another one like this.
2:12
Instead of just dividing it into 4 equal pieces,
2:15
let's divide it into 8 equal pieces.
2:23
So now we could cut once like this.
2:26
So now we have 2 equal pieces.
2:29
Cut once like this.
2:30
Now we have 4 equal pieces.
2:32
And then divide each of those 4 pieces into 2 pieces.
2:35
So I'll cut those in-- So let's see.
2:39
I want to make them equal pieces.
2:40
Those don't look as equal as I would like.
2:43
So that looks more equal, and that looks reasonably equal.
2:51
So now how many equal pieces do I have?
2:53
I have 8 equal pieces.
2:57
But let's say I wanted to eat the same fraction of the pizza.
3:01
So I could eat all of these pieces right over here.
3:04
Well, how many of those 8 equal pieces have I eaten?
3:07
Well, I've eaten 1, 2, 3, 4 of those 8 equal pieces.
3:11
And so once again, this fraction, 4 of 8, or 4/8,
3:15
is equivalent to 2/4, which is equivalent to 1/2.
3:19
And you might see a little bit of a pattern here.
3:21
Going from this scenario to this scenario,
3:26
I got twice as many equal slices.
3:29
Because I had twice as many equal slices,
3:32
I needed to eat two times the number of slices.
3:35
So I multiply the denominator by 2,
3:38
and I multiply the numerator by 2.
3:41
If I multiply the numerator and the denominator
3:43
by the same number, then I'm not changing
3:46
what that fraction represents.
3:48
And you see that over here.
3:50
Going from 4 slices to 8 slices, I cut every slice,
3:54
I turned every slice into 2 more slices,
3:57
so I had twice as many slices.
3:59
And then if I want to eat the same amount,
4:01
I have to eat twice as many pieces.
4:07
So all of these, 1/2, 2/4, four 4/8, and I could keep going.
4:10
I could do 8/16.
4:12
I could do 16/32.
4:14
All of these would be equivalent fractions.",How do you divide fractions by a larger numerator than the denominator?

So I've got a whole pizza here, and let's say
0:02
that I were to cut it into two equal pieces.
0:05
Let me cut it right over here into 2 equal pieces.
0:11
And let's say that I ate one of those 2 equal pieces.
0:14
So let's say I ate all of this right over here.
0:17
What fraction of the pizza have I eaten?
0:20
Well, I took the whole and I divide it
0:23
into two equal pieces, and then I ate one of those pieces.
0:33
So I ate 1/2 of the pizza.
0:37
Now, let's imagine that instead of cutting that pizza into only
0:43
2 equal pieces, let's imagine instead
0:45
that decide to cut it into 4 equal pieces.
0:48
So let's draw that.
0:50
So 4 equal pieces.
0:52
So I could cut once this way and then
0:56
I could cut it once this way.
0:59
And so here I have 4 equal pieces.
1:05
But let's say that I want to eat the same amount of pizza.
1:09
How many of these 4 equal pieces would I have to eat.
1:12
I encourage you to pause the video and think about that.
1:15
Well, I would eat this piece.
1:18
You could imagine me eating this piece and this piece right
1:20

1:21
I've eaten the same amount of the pizza.
1:25
Each of these pieces you could imagine got cut into 2 pieces
1:28
when I cut the whole pizza this way.
1:31
And so now I have to eat 2 slices of the 4,
1:34
as opposed to 1 slice of the 2.
1:36
So I just ate 2 out of the 4 slices.
1:42
I'm using different numbers here.
1:44
Here I'm using a 1 in the numerator
1:47
and 2 in the denominator.
1:48
Here, I'm using a 2 in the numerator
1:49
and a 4 in the denominator.
1:51
These two fractions represent the same quantity.
1:54
I ate the same amount of pizza.
1:56
If I eat 2/4 of a pizza, if I eat 2 out of 4 equal pieces,
2:00
that's the same fraction of the pizza
2:02
as if I eat 1 out of 2 equal pieces.
2:05
So we would say that these two things
2:07
are equivalent fractions.
2:10
Now let's do another one like this.
2:12
Instead of just dividing it into 4 equal pieces,
2:15
let's divide it into 8 equal pieces.
2:23
So now we could cut once like this.

So now we have 2 equal pieces.
2:29

Now we have 4 equal pieces.
2:32
And then divide each of those 4 pieces into 2 pieces.
2:35
So I'll cut those in-- So let's see.
2:39
I want to make them equal pieces.
2:40
Those don't look as equal as I would like.
2:43
So that looks more equal, and that looks reasonably equal.
2:51
So now how many equal pieces do I have?
2:53
I have 8 equal pieces.
2:57
But let's say I wanted to eat the same fraction of the pizza.
3:01
So I could eat all of these pieces right over here.
3:04
Well, how many of those 8 equal pieces have I eaten?
3:07
Well, I've eaten 1, 2, 3, 4 of those 8 equal pieces.
3:11
And so once again, this fraction, 4 of 8, or 4/8,
3:15
is equivalent to 2/4, which is equivalent to 1/2.
3:19
And you might see a little bit of a pattern here.
3:21
Going from this scenario to this scenario,
3:26
I got twice as many equal slices.
3:29
Because I had twice as many equal slices,
3:32
I needed to eat two times the number of slices.
3:35

If I multiply the numerator and the denominator

0:04
SPEAKER 1: We're in the British Museum,
0:06
and we're looking at one of the most important objects
0:08
in the collection, the Rosetta Stone.
0:10
SPEAKER 2: It's in a glass case, surrounded
0:12
by people who are taking pictures of it.
0:14
SPEAKER 1: People love it.
0:15
SPEAKER 2: They do.
0:16
And there's gifts in the gift shop about it.
0:18
SPEAKER 1: You can get your own little Rosetta Stone.
0:20
SPEAKER 2: Exactly!
0:20
SPEAKER 1: You can get Rosetta Stone posters.
0:22
SPEAKER 2: On a mug.
0:23
SPEAKER 1: I think you can get a doormat Rosetta Stone.
0:25
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.
0:26
SPEAKER 1: But the stone itself is historically
0:28
incredibly important.
0:29
It allowed us for the first time to be able to understand,
0:32
to be able to read, to be able to translate hieroglyphics.
0:36
SPEAKER 2: Hieroglyphics was the written language
0:38
of the ancient Egyptians.
0:40
And until the mid 19th century, we really
0:43
didn't know what it said.
0:45
SPEAKER 1: The language itself is pictorial.
0:46
And actually that led to one of the real confusions,
0:49
because they think that early archaeologists believed
0:52
and linguists believed that the pictures
0:54
they could see-- you can make out
0:55
birds and snakes in various different kinds of forms--
0:58
actually referred in some way to a specific thing in the world.
1:01
SPEAKER 2: Right.
1:01
So if you saw a bird, it somehow referred to a bird.
1:04
SPEAKER 1: And in fact, that's not the case.
1:06
SPEAKER 2: Right.
1:07
SPEAKER 1: This is a far more sophisticated language.
1:09
SPEAKER 2: And the Rosetta Stone was really
1:11
what helped them to understand that Egyptian hieroglyphics are
1:14
not pictorial.
1:15
They're not pictographs.
1:16
They're actually phonetic.
1:18
So all those things that look like pictures actually
1:21
represent sounds.
1:22
And that's how they were able to finally figure
1:24
out and translate ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.
1:27
SPEAKER 1: And the reason we were able to do that
1:29
is because this stone said the same statement three times
1:32
in three different languages.
1:34
So the three languages are ancient Greek,
1:37
which is down at the bottom.
1:38
Now, that was the language of the administration.
1:41
That was the language of government.
1:42
And the reason for that is because Alexander the Great
1:45
had conquered Egypt and had set up this sort of Greek rule
1:49
in this Hellenistic era, and that maintained itself
1:52
in ancient Egypt.
1:53
SPEAKER 2: Let's remember, we're talking about 200 BC here.
1:56
SPEAKER 1: Which is actually getting
1:57
close to the end of the life of hieroglyphics as well.
2:00
It would last for another few hundred years
2:02
before it died out completely.
2:03
So this is really the tail end of this 3,000-year-long
2:07
language.
2:07
SPEAKER 2: So the middle section is
2:09
Demotic, which actually means the language of the people.
2:13
And it was this common language used by the Egyptians.
2:17
SPEAKER 1: And the top, of course, was the sacred writing.
2:20
This was hieroglyphs.
2:21
SPEAKER 2: Right.
2:22
SPEAKER 1: And that was the language
2:23
that we really couldn't read.
2:25
SPEAKER 2: Until we had the Rosetta Stone,
2:27
and we could see within the writings of the Rosetta Stone
2:31
cartouches, which held the names of the rulers.
2:35
Cartouches are a kind of oblong shape
2:37
that contains the name of the ruler.
2:39
SPEAKER 1: In this case, that would be Ptolemy V.
2:42
SPEAKER 2: And by recognizing that ruler's name
2:45
in these three different languages,
2:47
we found a way to begin to unlock hieroglyphics.
2:49
SPEAKER 1: Now, that would take decades.
2:50
It was an incredibly difficult task.
2:52
SPEAKER 2: And we haven't even talked yet
2:54
about how this was found.
2:55
Napoleon has his army in Egypt, and Napoleon's brought with him
2:59
some what I guess what we would call
3:01
sort of archaeologist types.
3:03
And one of those people who accompanied Napoleon
3:07
found or came across the Rosetta Stone.
3:10
SPEAKER 1: It was being used as a part
3:11
of the foundation of a fort, in fact.
3:14
SPEAKER 2: And of course, it would have originally
3:16
been erected in a temple or near an ancient Egyptian temple.
3:18
SPEAKER 1: And I suppose it's important to say that this
3:21
is the bottom portion of a much larger stele, or sort of stone
3:24
tablet, that would have been quite tall.
3:26
SPEAKER 2: So Napoleon took it back--
3:28
SPEAKER 1: Except hold on a second, because we're not
3:29
in the Louvre.
3:30
We're in London in a British Museum.
3:32
So how does that work?
3:33
SPEAKER 2: Well, the British defeated Napoleon
3:36
and brought back the stone.
3:38
And a year or two later, I think 1801 or 1802,
3:41
it was brought to the British Museum,
3:42
and it's been here ever since.
3:43

khan_video_PZIoFD_Z73M_47,Math,ESSAY,"•
0:00
- Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a
0:02
principle of quantum mechanics.
0:04
And so if we take a particle, let's say we have
0:06
a particle here of Mass M, moving with Velocity V,
0:11
the momentum of that particle, the linear momentum
0:14
is equal to the Mass times the Velocity.
0:16
And according to the uncertainty principle,
0:19
you can't know the position and momentum
0:22
of that particle accurately, at the same time.
0:25
So if you know the position, if you know where that particle
0:28
is in space really well, you don't know the momentum,
0:32
or you don't know the velocity of that particle,
0:34
and vice versa.
0:35
If you know the momentum really well,
0:36
you don't know the position.
0:38
So let's look at a mathematical description
0:40
of the uncertainty principle.
0:42
So the uncertainty in the position,
0:44
so Delta X is the uncertainty in the position,
0:47
times the uncertainty in the momentum,
0:49
so Delta P is uncertainty in momentum,
0:53
the product of these two must be greater than
0:56
or equal to some constant.
0:58
And that constant is Planck's Constant:
1:00
h divided by four pi.
1:03
So we have a constant divided by another constant.
1:08
So this just gives us a number on the right side,
1:11
and you might see something a little bit different
1:12
in another textbook.
1:13
It doesn't really matter that much,
1:15
it just depends on how you define things.
1:17
So the point is, the product of the two uncertainties
1:21
must be greater than or equal to some number.
1:24
So the uncertainties are inversely proportional
1:27
to each other: if you increase one, you decrease the other.
1:31
Let's go ahead and use some really simple numbers here,
1:33
just so you can understand that point.
1:35
So let's say, and this is just extremely simplified,
1:39
so let's just see if we can understand that idea
1:40
of inversely proportional.
1:42
So if you have an uncertainty of two for the position,
1:46
and let's say you had an uncertainty
1:47
of two for the momentum.
1:49
Alright, so two times two is equal to four,
1:52
so I won't even worry about greater than,
1:55
I'll just put equal to here.
1:56
So if two times two is equal to four.
1:59
If I decrease the uncertainty of the position,
2:02
so I decrease it to one,
2:03
so the uncertainty in the momentum must increase to four,
2:08
because one times four is equal to four.
2:10
If I decrease the uncertainty in the position even more,
2:13
so if I lower that to point five, I increase the uncertainty
2:17
in the momentum, that must go up to eight.
2:19
So point five times eight gives us four.
2:22
And so, what I'm trying to show you here,
2:24
is as you decrease the uncertainty in the position,
2:28
you increase the uncertainty in the momentum.
2:31
So another way of saying that is,
2:33
the more accurately you know the position of a particle,
2:37
the less accurately you know the momentum of that particle.
2:40
And that's the idea of the uncertainty principle.
2:44
And so let's apply this uncertainty principle
2:46
to the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom.
2:49
So let's look at a picture of the Bohr model
2:51
of the hydrogen atom.
2:52
Alright, we know our negatively charged electron
2:55
orbits the nucleus, like a planet around the sun.
2:58
And, let's say the electron is going this direction,
3:01
so there is a velocity associated with that electron,
3:05
so there is velocity going in that direction.
3:08
Alright, the reason why the Bohr model is useful,
3:10
is because it allows us to understand things like
3:12
quantized energy levels.
3:14
And we talked about the radius for the electron,
3:18
so if there's a circle here, there's a radius
3:21
for an electron in the ground state,
3:23
this would be the radius of the first energy level,
3:26
is equal to 5.3 times 10 to the negative 11 meters.
3:30
So if we wanted to know the diameter of that circle,
3:33
we could just multiply the radius by two.
3:35
So two times that number would be equal
3:38
to 1.06 times 10 to the negative 10 meters.
3:44
And this is just a rough estimate of the size
3:47
of the hydrogen atom using the Bohr model,
3:50
with an electron in the ground state.
3:52
Alright, we also did some calculations
3:55
to figure out the velocity.
3:57
So the velocity of an electron in the ground state
4:01
of a hydrogen atom using the Bohr model,
4:03
we calculated that to be
4:04
2.2 times 10 to the six meters per second.
4:08
And since we know the mass of an electron,
4:10
we can actually calculate the linear momentum.
4:12
So the linear momentum P is equal
4:14
to the mass times the velocity.
4:16
Let's say we knew the velocity with a 10% uncertainty
4:21
associated with that number.
4:23
So a 10% uncertainty.
4:26
If we convert that to a decimal, we just divide 10 by 100,
4:30
so we get 10% is equal to point one.
4:34
So we have point one here.
4:35
If I want to know the uncertainty of the momentum
4:38
of that electron, so the uncertainty
4:40
in the momentum of that particle,
4:43
momentum is equal to mass times velocity.
4:45
If there's a 10% uncertainty associated with the velocity,
4:50
we need to multiply this by point one.
4:52
So let's go ahead and do that.
4:54
So we would have the mass of the electron
4:58
is 9.11 times 10 to the negative 31st.
5:02
The velocity of the electron is
5:04
2.2 times 10 to the sixth, and we know that
5:08
with 10% uncertainty, so we need to multiply
5:10
all of that by point one.
5:12
So let's go ahead and do that.
5:14
We're gonna multiply all those things together.
5:17
So we take the mass of an electron,
5:18
9.11 times 10 to the negative 31st
5:23
and we multiply that by the velocity,
5:26
2.2 times 10 to the sixth,
5:29
and we know there's a 10% uncertainty
5:32
associated with the velocity,
5:34
so we get an uncertainty in the momentum
5:36
2.0 times 10 to the negative 25.
5:40
So the uncertainty in the momentum is
5:43
2.0 times 10 to the negative 25.
5:47
And the units would be,
5:48
this is the mass in kilograms, and the velocity
5:51
was in meters over seconds,
5:53
so kilograms times meters per second.
5:55
Alright, so this is the uncertainty associated
5:59
with the momentum of our electrons.
6:02
Let's plug it in to our uncertainty principle here:
6:06
we had the uncertainty in the position of the electron,
6:10
times the uncertainty in the momentum of the electron
6:13
must be greater than or equal to
6:15
Planck's Constant divided by four pi.
6:19
So we can take that uncertainty in the momentum
6:22
and we can plug it in here.
6:24
So now we have the uncertainty in the position
6:27
of the electron in the ground state of the hydrogen atom
6:30
times 2.0 times 10 to the negative 25.
6:34
This product must be greater than or equal to,
6:37
Planck's Constant is 6.626 times 10 to the negative 34.
6:43
Alright, divide that by four pi.
6:48
So we could solve for the uncertainty in the position.
6:52
So, Delta X must be greater than or equal to,
6:56
let's go ahead and do that math.
6:58
So we have Planck's Constant,
7:00
6.626 times 10 to the negative 34,
7:06
we divide that by 4, we need to divide that also by pi,
7:13
and then we need to divide by the
7:15
uncertainty in the momentum.
7:17
So we also need to divide by the uncertainty in momentum,
7:20
that's 2.0 times 10 to the negative 25,
7:25
and that gives us 2.6 times 10 to the negative 10.
7:30
So the uncertainty in the position must be greater than
7:33
or equal to 2.6 times 10 to the negative 10
7:39
and if you worked our your units,
7:41
you would get meters for this.
7:43
So the uncertainty in the position must be
7:46
greater than or equal to
7:46
2.6 times 10 to the negative 10 meters.
7:49
Let's go back up here to the picture of the hydrogen atom.
7:53
2.6 times 10 to the negative 10 meters,
7:55
that's greater than the diameter of our hydrogen atom,
8:00
so the uncertainty would be greater than this diameter.
8:04
So the uncertainty in the position would be greater than
8:07
the diameter of the hydrogen atom, using the Bohr model.
8:10
So the Bohr model is wrong.
8:12
It's telling us we know the electron is orbiting the nucleus
8:15
at a certain radius, and it's moving at a certain velocity.
8:18
The uncertainty principle says this isn't true.
8:21
If we know the velocity fairly accurately,
8:24
we don't know the position of the electron,
8:27
the position of the electron is greater than
8:28
the diameter, according to the Bohr model.
8:30
So this just one reason why the Bohr model is wrong.
8:34
But again, we keep the Bohr model around
8:36
because it is useful as a simple model
8:38
when you're just starting to get into chemistry.
8:40
But this concept of the uncertainty principle goes
8:44
against our natural intuitions.
8:46
So our every day life doesn't really give us
8:48
any experience with the uncertainty principle.
8:51
For example, if we had a particle,
8:53
let's make it a much bigger particle here,
8:55
so a much bigger particle than an electron,
8:58
so something that we can actually see in our real life,
9:00
and so this has a much bigger mass,
9:03
and moving with some velocity,
9:04
logic tells us we can figure out pretty accurately
9:07
where the position of that object is,
9:09
and we can probably, pretty accurately,
9:11
figure out the velocity, and so we know the momentum.
9:14
And, that's true.
9:16
We do know these things fairly accurately.
9:19
But if you did a calculation using
9:21
the uncertainty principle, so if you plugged in some
9:24
different numbers, like if you increased the mass,
9:26
so instead of 9.11 times 10 to the negative 31st,
9:29
let's say you're using nine kilograms,
9:31
and you plugged in some velocity here,
9:34
and you solved for the uncertainty in the position,
9:37
you're gonna get an uncertainty in the position
9:38
that's extremely small.
9:40
So you don't really notice those things
9:42
on a macroscopic scale.
9:44
You only notice them when you think about the atomic scale.
9:47
And so that's why this isn't really an intuitive concept.
9:50
Same idea with quantum mechanics:
9:52
quantum mechanics is something
9:53
that makes absolutely no sense when you first encounter it.
9:56
You have no experience with quantum mechanics
9:58
in your daily life, it just doesn't make any sense.
10:00
You don't see these sorts of things.
10:02
So this is just showing you an application
10:05
at an atomic scale.
10:07
Again, this is the uncertainty principle.
10:09
We'll get more into quantum mechanics,
10:11
and how quantum mechanics affects
10:13
electrons and atoms in the next few videos.",How is uncertainity quantized or how it is put into term of percentage?

0:01
- [Voiceover] Ok, so let's say you have some kind of letter
0:04
that you wanna, that you wanna deliver, right?
0:05
So you have a letter that's in your mailbox,
0:07
and let's say that this is the sender of the letter, right?
0:11
And so the sender of that letter is gonna deliver that mail
0:14
all the way over here to the recipient, right?
0:16
And the way that they're gonna do that is you're gonna have
0:18
this mailman in this truck deliver it from the sender
0:23
to the recipient, and they're gonna drive along this road.
0:26
But then let's say something happens.
0:28
Let's say, for some reason, an earthquake happens, right?
0:31
And the earthquake actually destroys the road over here.
0:34
And so now, the mailman can't really get to
0:35
where they need to go anymore, right?
0:37
Because the road has been damaged.
0:39
So why am I giving this extremely hypothetical scenario?
0:42
Well I think that it serves as a pretty good analogy
0:44
towards understanding a disease called Multiple Sclerosis.
0:49
So Multiple Sclerosis is a disease of the brain.
0:51
And more specifically, it affects the communication
0:54
within the brain.
0:55
So what do I mean by communication in the brain?
0:57
Well in the brain, you have all these neurons, right?
1:00
You have all these neurons that are constantly talking
1:02
to each other, kinda like these two neurons over here.
1:04
And so this neuron is going to send an electrical signal
1:07
down the length of a diaxon.
1:09
And that electrical signal is in the form
1:11
of an action potential.
1:12
And so to improve the efficiency of the communication,
1:14
you have this stuff that kind of insulates the axon,
1:16
so, this stuff that I've drawn here in red
1:18
is called myelin.
1:20
And it really just makes the action potential
1:22
move down the axon much more quickly.
1:24
So we can actually kind of compare this
1:27
two-way communication system, right, with our mailman.
1:30
So, you know we have kind of the sender of the message,
1:32
that would be the first neuron,
1:35
we have the message, that would be
1:37
kind of like the action potential,
1:38
we have the road, which would be, you know,
1:40
the myelin and the axon together,
1:43
and we have the recipient.
1:45
Now, in our analogy, we had an earthquake
1:47
that actually destroyed the road somehow.
1:49
So, in Multiple Sclerosis, what happens is, well,
1:52
you get destruction of the road, and more specifically,
1:54
you get a degradation of the myelin.
1:58
And so because there's degradation of the myelin,
2:00
we can call Multiple Sclerosis a Demyelinating Disease.
2:04
So this is really where that disruption
2:05
in the communication goes on, right?
2:07
And when the myelin is degraded, the action potential
2:10
won't really travel down the axon as quickly anymore,
2:14
and sometimes it may not even travel down to begin with.
2:16
So what's causing that degradation?
2:18
Well as it turns out, in Multiple Sclerosis,
2:20
the immune system actually sneaks its way into the brain,
2:25
and when the immune system sneaks its way into the brain,
2:27
for some reason it mistakenly recognizes that myelin,
2:31
right, this myelin over here, as foreign.
2:34
And when it mistakenly recognizes it as foreign,
2:36
it starts to attack the myelin, hence this degradation.
2:40
And because the immune system is attacking the body itself,
2:43
we call Multiple Sclerosis an Autoimmune Disease as well.
2:47
So that's kind of a cellular perspective
2:48
on Multiple Sclerosis, but now I kind of want to give you
2:51
a more macroscopic perspective
2:53
on what the disease does to the brain, right?
2:56
So let me clear up some space over here.
2:59
And let me actually show you now two different brains.
3:02
So this is just really a brain scan,
3:04
or two different brain scans of, well,
3:06
two different brains.
3:07
So on the left, we have a perfectly healthy brain.
3:09
And on the right, we have the brain of someone
3:12
who's suffering from Multiple Sclerosis.
3:15
Immediately on the right brain you can tell
3:16
that you have these bright spots over here, right,
3:19
called Plaques.
3:20
So Plaque is also really referred to as a Lesion.
3:23
And a Lesion is really just a piece of tissue
3:25
that's been damaged.
3:26
So let's say, for example, you know,
3:27
you have a hand over here,
3:29
you know, maybe you get a cut on your hand somehow.
3:32
Right, you can call that cut kind of a Lesion of the skin.
3:36
In Multiple Sclerosis you have a Lesion in the brain, right?
3:39
And those Lesions are really coming from the damaged myelin
3:42
from the immune system.
3:44
So what happens is, you have all these immune cells
3:47
that kind of come together, right, they kind of
3:50
cluster around certain parts of the brain,
3:52
and they attack it.
3:54
And when you have a whole bunch of immune cells
3:55
coming together to attack a certain part of the body,
3:58
we call this Inflammation, and because it's happening
4:00
in the brain, we call it Neuroinflammation.
4:03
Now, the condition in which you have these Lesions,
4:06
in the brain, is called Sclerosis.
4:08
In the case of Multiple Sclerosis, you have multiple Lesions
4:12
hence why we call it Multiple Sclerosis.
4:15
Now notice how you're getting these Lesions
4:16
in different parts of the brain, ok.
4:18
Different parts of the brain are gonna be responsible
4:20
for different functions.
4:22
Some may be responsible for Vision,
4:24
others may be responsible for Cognition,
4:27
for moving around, for Movement, for Touch,
4:32
and so on and so forth.
4:34
And depending on where these Lesions form in the brain,
4:36
you can get a variety of different symptoms
4:37
that can affect all of these functions.
4:40
Now, why do these Lesions form?
4:41
Why does the immune system attack the brain?
4:44
The problem is that we don't actually know.
4:46
We're not really sure with 100% certainty
4:48
what causes Multiple Sclerosis.
4:51
All we know is that some people may have
4:53
a kind of Genetic Predisposition
4:55
towards developing the disease,
4:58
and that there are also probably some
4:59
Environmental Factors that may be involved as well.
5:02
And the fact of the matter is that your genetics
5:06
can really interact with the environment,
5:08
and that can kinda stimulate the progression of the disease.
5:11
Now the exact types of genes that are involved,
5:13
and the exact types of Environmental Factors
5:15
that may be involved will be a talk that I'll cover
5:17
in a later video, but for now this is really
5:19
all that we know about the causes of Multiple Sclerosis.
5:23
Now even though we don't really know perfectly
5:26
what causes Multiple Sclerosis, we do know
5:28
who is more likely to develop the disease.
5:30
So I'm gonna actually clear up some more space here again.
5:33
And so now I'm gonna show you a picture of the earth.
5:35
And the reason is because I wanna give you
5:36
a global perspective on, you know, the prevalence,
5:39
and the incidence of Multiple Sclerosis.
5:41
So the disease affects about 2.5 million people worldwide.
5:46
Now, is everyone on the planet equally likely
5:48
to develop the disease?
5:50
Well, no.
5:50
As it turns out, if you move north from the equator, right,
5:54
so if you move north from here,
5:55
you'll notice that the incidence of MS actually increases.
5:59
And the incidence is actually pretty high, you know,
6:01
in these northern areas, right, so here in Canada,
6:04
and in the northern United States, and here
6:07
in a lot of Europe and Russia as well.
6:10
So it often affects Caucasians more than other races.
6:14
And more specifically among the Caucasians,
6:16
it affects people of Northern European Descent more often.
6:20
The disease is also more common in women than it is in men.
6:25
Right, and it's thought that of the 2.5 million people
6:27
worldwide about two thirds of them are women.
6:31
So 66% of them are women.
6:33
So what age do people start to develop MS?
6:35
It's usually in the age range of 20 to 50 years old.
6:40
And it's usually on the earlier end of that spectrum.
6:42
And lastly, one thing that I really want to emphasize
6:45
is that the disease itself is NOT FATAL.
6:49
So the disease itself won't actually kill you, right,
6:51
but the Life expectancy is a bit lower.
6:54
And it's thought to be lowered by about, you know,
6:56
a few months to a few years.
6:57
Now even though it's not fatal, the disease itself
7:00
is quite debilitating, and it can really affect
7:02
the person's lifestyle through a number of different
7:04
signs and symptoms, and that'll be a topic
7:06
that I'll cover in the next video.",Why can't the brain just order the immune system to stop attacking the myelin?

- DNA gets a lot of attention as the store
0:02
of our genetic information, and it deserves that.
0:06
If we didn't have DNA, there would be no way
0:07
of keeping the information that makes us us,
0:10
and other organisms what those organisms are.
0:13
And DNA has some neat properties, it can replicate itself,
0:16
and we go into a lot of depth on that in other videos.
0:19
So DNA producing more DNA, we call that,
0:23
we call that replication, but just being able
0:26
to replicate yourself on its own isn't enough
0:28
to actually produce an organism.
0:31
And to produce an organism, you somehow have to
0:33
take that information in the DNA, and then
0:35
produce things like a structural molecules,
0:39
enzymes, transport molecules, signaling molecules,
0:43
that actually do the work of the organism.
0:48
And that process, the first step, and this is all a review
0:51
that we've seen in other videos.
0:53
The first step is to go from DNA to RNA,
0:55
and in particular, messenger RNA.
0:58
""Messenger RNA,"" and this process right over here,
1:02
this is called transcription.
1:04
""Transcription,"" we go into a lot of detail
1:06
on this in other videos.
1:08
And then you wanna go from that messenger RNA,
1:10
it goes to the ribosomes and then tRNA goes and grabs
1:14
amino acids, and they form actual proteins.
1:17
So you go from messenger RNA, and then in conjunction,
1:21
so this is all, this is in conjunction with tRNA
1:24
and amino acids, so let me say ""+tRNA,"" and ""amino acids.""
1:32
And I'll write ""amino acids"" in, I'll write it in a brighter
1:35
color, since that's going to be the focus of this video.
1:39
So tRNA and amino acids, you're able to construct proteins.
1:45
You are able to construct proteins,
1:47
which are made up of chains of amino acids,
1:51
and it's the proteins that do
1:53
a lot of the work of the organism.
1:56
Proteins, which are nothing but chains of amino acids,
1:59
or they're made up of, sometimes
2:00
multiple chains of amino acids.
2:02
So you can image, I'm just going to, that's an amino acid.
2:05
That's another amino acid.
2:07
This is an amino acid.
2:10
This is an amino acid, you could keep going.
2:13
So these chains of amino acids, based on
2:16
how these different, based on the properties
2:19
of these different amino acids,
2:21
and how the protein takes shape and how
2:23
it might interact with its surrounding,
2:24
these proteins can serve all sorts of different functions.
2:27
Anything from part of your immune system,
2:30
antibodies, they can serve as enzymes,
2:33
they can serve as signaling hormones, like insulin.
2:38
They're involved in muscle contraction.
2:40
Actin and myosin, we actually have
2:42
a fascinating video on that.
2:43
Transport of oxygen.
2:45
Hemoglobin.
2:46
So proteins, the way at least my brain of it,
2:48
is they do a lot of the work.
2:50
DNA says, well, what contains the information,
2:54
but a lot of the work of organism is actually done,
2:57
is actually done by the proteins.
3:00
And as I just said, the building blocks
3:02
of the proteins are the amino acids.
3:05
So let's focus on that a little bit.
3:07
So up here are some examples of amino acids.
3:10
And there are 20 common amino acids,
3:12
there are a few more depending on what organism you look at,
3:17
and theoretically there could be many more.
3:19
But in most biological systems,
3:21
there are 20 common amino acids that the DNA is coding for,
3:24
and these are two of them.
3:26
So let's just first look at what is common.
3:29
So, we see that both these, and actually all three of this,
3:33
this is just a general form, you have an amino group.
3:36
You have an amino group, and this where,
3:39
this is why we call it an ""amino,"" an amino acid.
3:42
So you have an amino group.
3:44
Amino group right over here.
3:46
Now you might say, ""well, it's called an amino acid,""
3:49
""so where is the acid?""
3:50
And that comes from this carboxyl group right over here.
3:55
So that's why we call it an acid.
3:57
This carboxyl group is acidic.
4:02
It likes to donate this proton.
4:04
And then in between, we have a carbon,
4:06
and we call that the alpha carbon.
4:09
We call that the alpha carbon.
4:12
Alpha carbon, and that alpha carbon is bonded,
4:14
it has a covalent bond to the amino group,
4:16
covalent bond to the carboxyl group,
4:18
and a covalent bond to a hydrogen.
4:20
Now, from there, that's where you get the variation
4:24
in the different amino acids, and actually,
4:26
there's even some exceptions for how the nitrogen is,
4:30
but for the most part, the variation between
4:32
the amino acids is what this fourth covalent bond
4:36
from the alpha carbon does.
4:38
So you see in serine, you have this,
4:43
what you could call it an alcohol.
4:45
You could have an alcohol side chain.
4:47
In valine right over here, you have a
4:50
fairly pure hydrocarbon, hydrocarbon side chain.
4:54
And so in general, we refer to these side chains
4:58
as an R group, and it's these R groups
5:01
that play a big role in defining the shape of the proteins,
5:05
and how they interact with their environment
5:07
and the types of things they can do.
5:08
And you can even see, just from these examples
5:10
how these different sides chains might behave differently.
5:13
This one has an alcohol side chain,
5:16
and we know that oxygen is electronegative,
5:18
it likes to hog electrons, it's amazing how much
5:21
of chemistry or even biology you can deduce
5:23
from just pure electronegativity.
5:26
So, oxygen likes to hog electrons, so you're gonna have
5:28
a partially-negative charge there.
5:31
Hydrogen has a low electronegativity relative to oxygen,
5:38
so it's gonna have its electrons hogged,
5:40
so you're gonna have a partially positive charge,
5:42
just like that, and so this has a polarity to it,
5:46
and so it's going to be hydrophilic, it's going to,
5:48
at least this part of the molecule is going to
5:50
be able to be attracted and interact with water.
5:54
And that's in comparison to what we have over here,
5:57
this hydrocarbon side chain, this has no polarity over here,
6:02
so this is going to be hydrophobic.
6:04
So this is going to be hydrophobic.
6:08
And so when we start talking about the structures
6:10
of proteins, and how the structures of proteins
6:12
are influenced by its side chains,
6:14
you could image that parts of proteins that have
6:17
hydrophobic side chains, those are gonna
6:18
wanna get onto the inside of the proteins
6:21
if we're in an aqueous solution,
6:23
while the ones that are more hydrophilic
6:24
will wanna go onto the outside,
6:26
and you might have some side chains
6:27
that are all big and bulky, and so they might
6:29
make it hard to tightly pack, and then you might have
6:32
other side chains that are nice and small
6:34
that make it very easy to pack, so these things
6:36
really do help define the shape,
6:39
and we're gonna talk about that a lot more
6:41
when we talk about the structure.
6:44
But how do these things actually connect?
6:47
And we're gonna go into much more detail
6:49
in another video, but if you have...
6:51
If you have serine right over here, and then you have
6:56
valine right over here, they connect through
7:01
what we call peptide bonds, and a peptide
7:03
is the term for two or more amino acids connected together,
7:08
so this would be a dipeptide, and the bond
7:10
isn't this big, I just, actually let me just,
7:12
let me draw it a little bit smaller.
7:14
So...
7:15
That's serine.
7:17
This is valine.
7:20
They can form a peptide bond, and this would be the smallest
7:23
peptide, this would be a dipeptide right over here.
7:27
""Peptide,"" ""peptide bond,"" or sometimes
7:30
called a peptide linkage.
7:32
And as this chain forms, that polypeptide,
7:35
as you add more and more things to it,
7:37
as you add more and more amino acids,
7:42
this is going to be, this can be a protein
7:44
or can be part of a protein that does all of these things.
7:47
Now one last thing I wanna talk about,
7:50
this is the way, the way these amino acids have been drawn
7:52
is a way you'll often see them in a textbook,
7:54
but at physiological pH's, the pH's inside of your body,
7:59
which is in that, you know, that low sevens range,
8:01
so it's a pH of roughly 7.2 to 7.4.
8:08
What you have is this, the carboxyl group right over here,
8:12
is likely to be deprotonated, it's likely
8:15
to have given away its hydrogen,
8:16
you're gonna find that more likely than when you have...
8:19
It's gonna be higher concentrations having been
8:21
deprotonated than being protonated.
8:23
So, at physiological conditions, it's more likely
8:26
that this oxygen has taken both of those electrons,
8:33
and now has a negative charge,
8:35
so it's given, it's just given away the hydrogen proton
8:37
but took that hydrogen's electron.
8:40
So it might be like this, and then the amino group,
8:43
the amino group at physiological pH's,
8:46
it's likely to actually grab a proton.
8:49
So nitrogen has an extra loan pair,
8:52
so it might use that loan pair to grab a proton,
8:55
in fact it's physiological pH's,
8:56
you'll find a higher concentration of it having
8:58
grabbed a proton than not grabbing a proton.
9:01
So, the nitrogen will have grabbed a proton,
9:05
use its loan pairs to grab a proton,
9:07
and so it is going to have...
9:09
So it is going to have a...
9:11
It is going to have a positive charge.
9:14
And so sometimes you will see amino acids
9:19
described this way, and this is actually more accurate
9:21
for what you're likely to find at physiological conditions,
9:24
and these molecules have an interesting name,
9:26
a molecule that is neutral even though
9:28
parts of it have charge, like this,
9:31
this is called a zwitterion.
9:33
That's a fun, fun word.
9:35
Zwitterion.
9:39
And ""zwitter"" in German means ""hybrid,""
9:41
and ""ion"" obviously means that it's going to have charge,
9:44
and so this has hybrid charge,
9:46
even though it has charges at these ends,
9:47
the charges net out to be neutral.",Where are amino acids formed in plants and animals?

- [Voiceover] Alright, this problem is a classic,
0:01
you're gonna see this in basically
0:03
every single physics text book.
0:05
And the problem is this, if you've got two masses
0:07
tied together by a rope, and that rope passes over a pulley,
0:10
what's the acceleration of the masses?
0:13
In other words, what's the acceleration of the 3 kg mass?
0:18
And then what's the acceleration of the 5 kg mass?
0:21
And if you're wondering what the heck is a pulley?
0:26
The pulley is this part right here.
0:28
This right here is the pulley.
0:30
So what a pulley does, a pulley is a little piece of plastic
0:33
or metal that can rotate.
0:35
And it's usually got a groove in it so that a string
0:38
or a rope can pass over it.
0:40
What it does, is it rotates freely so that you can turn
0:44
what's a horizontal tension on one side,
0:46
into a vertical tension on the other.
0:48
Or vice versa.
0:49
It turns vertical forces into horizontal forces.
0:52
It allows you to transfer a force from one direction
0:55
to another direction.
0:56
So that's what these pulleys are useful for.
0:58
And if they can spin freely, and if this pulley
1:01
has basically no mass, if there's no resistance
1:03
to motion at all, then this tension on this side
1:07
is gonna be equal to the tension on this side.
1:10
This vertical tension gets transferred fully undiluted,
1:14
into a horizontal tension and these tension values
1:17
will just be the same if this pulley can spin freely.
1:20
And if its mass is really small so that
1:22
there's no inertial reason why it doesn't wanna spin.
1:26
So that's the problem.
1:28
Let's say you wanted to figure this out.
1:30
What is the acceleration of the 3 kg mass
1:33
with the acceleration of the 5 kg mass?
1:36
Now, I've gotta warn you, there's an easy way to do this,
1:38
and a hard way to do this.
1:40
Now, I'm gonna show you the hard way first.
1:43
Sorry, no one ever wants to hear that.
1:46
But, the reason is that, the easy way won't make any sense
1:50
unless I show you the hard way first.
1:51
It won't make any sense why the easy way works unless
1:54
I show you the hard way.
1:56
And for two, the hard way isn't really all that hard.
1:59
So I'm calling it the hard way,
2:00
but it's not really that bad.
2:01
And for three, sometimes teachers and professors just wanna
2:04
see you do it the hard way, so you should know how
2:05
to do this.
2:07
So what do we do?
2:08
We wanna find acceleration, well you know how
2:09
to find acceleration.
2:11
We're gonna use Newton's second law.
2:13
So we'll say that the acceleration in a given direction
2:15
is gonna equal the net force in that direction,
2:18
divided by the mass.
2:19
Now what do we do?
2:20
What mass are we gonna choose?
2:21
We've got a couple masses here.
2:23
One thing we could do, let's just pick the 5 kg mass.
2:26
Just pick one of them.
2:27
So I'm gonna say that the acceleration of the 5 kg mass
2:30
is the net force on the 5 kg mass, divided by the mass
2:34
of the 5 kg mass.
2:36
And remember, we should always pick a direction as well.
2:38
So do we wanna pick the vertical direction
2:40
or the horizontal direction?
2:42
Well, since this box is gonna be accelerating horizontally,
2:44
and that's what we're interested in, I'm gonna put one more
2:47
sub-script up here, X, to let us know we're picking
2:49
the horizontal direction.
2:52
So I can fill this out now, I can plug stuff in.
2:54
The acceleration of the 5 kg mass in the X direction
2:58
is gonna be equal to.
3:00
Alright what forces do we have to figure out what goes
3:02
up here?
3:03
You always draw a force diagram.
3:06
So what forces do I have on the 5 kg mass?
3:08
I'm gonna have a force of gravity, I'll draw
3:10
that straight down.
3:11
FG, and there's gonna be an equal force,
3:14
normal force upward.
3:16
So this normal force up should be equal to the force
3:19
of gravity and magnitude because this box is probably not
3:23
gonna be accelerating vertically.
3:24
There's no real reason why it should be
3:26
if this table is rigid.
3:28
And there's one more force on this box.
3:30
There's a force to the right.
3:31
That's gonna be the force of tension.
3:34
And if there's no friction on this table,
3:36
then I have no leftward forces here.
3:38
I'm ignoring air resistance since
3:39
we usually ignore air resistance.
3:42
So that's is, the only horizontal force
3:43
I've got is T, tension.
3:45
And I divide by the mass of the 5 kg box, which is 5 kg.
3:50
But we got a problem.
3:51
Look it, we don't know the acceleration of the 5 kg mass,
3:54
and we don't know the tension.
3:56
I can't solve this.
3:58
Normally what you do in this case, is you go to
3:59
the vertical direction, the other direction in other words.
4:02
But that's not gonna help me either.
4:04
That's just gonna tell me that the normal force is gonna
4:06
be equal to the force of gravity.
4:08
And we kind of already knew that.
4:09
So that doesn't help.
4:10
So what do we do?
4:12
Well, you might note, this is only the equation for
4:14
the 5 kg mass.
4:16
And so now I have to do this for the 3 kg mass.
4:18
So let's come over here, let's say that the acceleration
4:21
of the 3 kg mass is gonna be equal to the net force
4:25
on the 3 kg mass, divided by the mass of the 3 kg mass.
4:30
And again, which direction should we pick?
4:33
Well this acceleration over here is gonna be vertical.
4:35
So let's solve this for the vertical direction.
4:37
I'm gonna add one more sub-script, Y, to remind myself.
4:40
And you should do this too so you remember which direction
4:43
you're picking.
4:44
So what forces do I plug in here?
4:46
You figure that out with a force diagram.
4:48
I'm gonna have a force of gravity on this 3 kg mass,
4:52
and then I'm gonna have the same size of friction,
4:55
or sorry, the same as tension, that I had over here.
4:57
So the tension on this side of the rope, it's gonna
4:59
be the same as the tension on this side.
5:01
Assuming this pulley offers no resistance either by its mass
5:05
or friction.
5:06
So assuming that its mass is negligible, there's basically
5:09
no friction, then I'm gonna have a tension.
5:11
That tension is gonna be the same size.
5:14
So I'll draw that coming upward.
5:16
But it's not gonna be as big as the force of gravity is
5:19
on this 3 kg mass.
5:21
I've got the force of gravity here.
5:23
This tension is gonna be smaller, and the reason is,
5:26
this 3 kg mass is accelerating downwards.
5:28
So these forces can't be balanced.
5:30
The upward force of tension has gotta be smaller
5:33
than the force of gravity on this 3 kg mass.
5:36
But this tension here should be the same
5:37
as this tension here.
5:39
So I'll plug those in.
5:40
So let's plug this in.
5:41
A of the 3 kg mass, in the Y direction is gonna be equal to,
5:46
I've got two vertical forces.
5:48
I've got tension up, so I'll make that positive,
5:50
'cause we usually treat up as positive.
5:52
I've got gravity down, and so I'm gonna have negative,
5:55
'cause it's downward force of 3 kg times the acceleration
6:01
on Earth, is 9.8 meters per second squared.
6:07
Now what do we do?
6:07
We divide by 3 kg, 'cause that's the mass.
6:10
But I've still got a problem.
6:11
I don't know this acceleration or this tension.
6:14
So what do I do?
6:16
You might notice, if you're clever you'll say wait,
6:18
I've got my unknown on this side is acceleration
6:21
and tension.
6:22
My unknown on this side is acceleration and tension.
6:24
It seems like I've got two equations, two unknowns,
6:27
maybe we should combine them.
6:28
And that's exactly how you do these.
6:30
So I've got tension in both of these equations.
6:34
Let me solve for tension over here,
6:35
where it's kind of simple.
6:37
And I'll just get the tension equals 5 kg,
6:41
times the acceleration of the 5 kg mass in the X direction.
6:47
So now I know what tension is.
6:48
Tension is equal to this.
6:49
And that tension over on this side is the same as
6:51
the tension on this side.
6:53
So I can take this and I can plug it in for
6:56
this tension right here.
6:57
And let's see what we get.
6:59
We get that the acceleration of the 3 kg mass vertically,
7:02
is gonna equal, alright, I'm gonna have a big mess on top,
7:06
what am I gonna get?
7:07
I'm gonna get, so T is the same as 5AX.
7:11
So I'll plug in 5 kg times the acceleration
7:16
of the 5 kg mass in the X direction.
7:19
And then I get all of this stuff over here.
7:21
So I'll get the rest of this right here.
7:27
I'll just bring that down right there.
7:29
Alright, now what do I have?
7:31
I've got 3 kg on the bottom still, so I have to put
7:33
that here.
7:35
Are we any better off?
7:36
Yeah, we're better, because now my only unknowns
7:38
are acceleration.
7:39
But these are not the same acceleration.
7:41
Look, this acceleration here is the acceleration of
7:43
the 3 kg mass, vertically.
7:46
This acceleration here is the acceleration
7:48
of the 5kg mass horizontally.
7:51
Now here's where I'm gonna have to make an argument,
7:53
and some people don't like this.
7:55
But, it's crucial to figuring out this problem.
7:58
And the key idea is this, if this 3 kg mass moves down,
8:03
let's say one meter, let's say it moves downward one meter.
8:06
Well then this 5 kg mass had better move forward one meter.
8:10
Because if it doesn't, then it didn't provide the one meter
8:14
of rope that this 3 kg mass needed to go downward.
8:17
Which means either the rope broke, or the rope stretched.
8:21
And we're gonna assume that our rope does not break
8:23
or stretch.
8:25
That's kind of a lie.
8:25
All ropes are gonna stretch a little bit under tension.
8:29
We're gonna assume that stretch is negligible.
8:31
So the argument is that if this 3 kg mass moves downward
8:35
a certain amount, this 5 kg mass has to move forward
8:38
by that same amount in order to feed that amount of rope
8:41
for this 3 kg mass to go downward by that amount.
8:44
Otherwise, think about it.
8:45
If this 5 kg mass just sat here and the 3 kg moved,
8:49
or the 3 kg moved farther than the 5 kg mass,
8:53
then this rope is stretching or breaking.
8:54
So if you believe that, if you don't believe it,
8:56
pause it and think about it.
8:57
'Cause you've gotta convince yourself of that.
8:59
If you believe that then you can also convince yourself
9:01
that, well if the 3 kg mass was moving downward
9:04
at a certain speed, let's say two meters per second.
9:07
Then the 5 kg mass had better also be moving forward
9:10
two meters per second because otherwise it wouldn't
9:13
be feeding rope at a rate that this 3 kg needs
9:16
to move downward at that rate.
9:18
And finally, if you believe all that,
9:20
it's not too much harder to convince yourself that
9:22
this 3 kg mass, no matter what
9:25
its acceleration downward must be,
9:27
this 5 kg mass had better have the same magnitude
9:30
of acceleration forward so that it's again,
9:34
feeding the rope so this rope doesn't break,
9:36
or snap, or stretch.
9:38
'Cause we're gonna assume the rope doesn't do that.
9:40
So what I'm saying is that the acceleration of the 3 kg mass
9:44
in the Y direction had better equal the magnitude.
9:48
So these magnitudes have to be the same.
9:50
The sign doesn't have to be the same.
9:53
So this 3 kg mass has a negative acceleration
9:56
just 'cause it points down, and we're assuming up
9:58
is positive, down is negative.
10:00
This 5 kg mass has a positive acceleration 'cause
10:03
it's pointing to the right, and we're assuming rightward
10:05
is the positive horizontal direction.
10:08
So, they can have different signs, but the magnitudes
10:11
had better be the same so that your feeding this rope at
10:13
a rate that the other one needs in order to move.
10:16
And so we can say that the magnitudes are the same.
10:18
In this case, since one is negative of the other,
10:21
I can say that the acceleration of the 3 kg mass
10:23
vertically downward is gonna be equal to, let's say negative
10:28
of the acceleration of the 5 kg mass in the X direction.
10:33
I could have written it the other way.
10:34
I could have wrote that A of the 5 kg mass
10:37
in the X direction is a negative A of the 3 kg mass
10:40
in the Y direction.
10:41
They're just different by a negative sign is all
10:43
that's important here.
10:44
Okay, so this is the link we need.
10:46
This is it.
10:47
So this allows us to put this final equation here
10:49
in terms of only one variable.
10:51
'Cause I know I've got A3Y on this left hand side.
10:54
I know A3Y should always be -A5X.
10:57
If I take this and just plug it in for A3Y right here,
11:02
I'm gonna get -A5X =, well all of this stuff, so I'll
11:10
just copy this.
11:11
Save some time.
11:12
Copy, paste.
11:14
Just equals all of that.
11:15
All I did was plug in what I know A3Y has to be equal to.
11:19
'Cause now look, I've got one equation with one unknown.
11:22
I just need to solve for what A5X is.
11:24
It's on both sides.
11:25
So I'll need to combine these and then isolate
11:28
it on one side.
11:29
So there's gonna be a little bit of algebra here.
11:31
Let's just take this, let's give ourselves some room.
11:35
Move this up just a little bit.
11:36
Okay, so what do we do?
11:38
We're gonna solve for A5X.
11:39
Let me just get rid of this denominator.
11:41
Let me multiply both sides by 3 kg.
11:45
So I'm gonna get -3kg x A5 in the X direction,
11:52
if I multiply both sides by 3 kg,
11:55
and then I get 5 kg x A5 in the X direction.
12:01
And I've still got minus, alright 3 x 9.8 is 29.4 Newtons.
12:08
So we'll just turn this into what it's supposed to be.
12:10
29.4 Newtons.
12:12
So let's combine our A terms now.
12:14
Let's move this negative 3A to the right hand side
12:17
by adding it to both sides.
12:19
And let's add this 29.4 to both sides.
12:22
So I'll get the 29.4 Newtons over here with a positive,
12:26
if I add it to both sides.
12:27
And it'll disappear on the right hand side.
12:29
And then I'll add this term to both sides.
12:31
Add a positive 3 kg x A to both sides.
12:36
It'll disappear on the left, and I'll get 5 kg x A5
12:41
in the X direction + 3 kg x A5 in the X direction.
12:47
Now we're close, look on the right hand side I can combine
12:50
these terms because 5A plus 3A is the same thing as 8A.
12:55
So 29.4 Newtons, .4 = 8 kg x, I'll put the parenthesis here,
13:05
times five.
13:06
85 in the X direction.
13:08
Now I can divide both sides by eight and usually we put
13:12
the thing we're solving for on the left, so I'm just gonna
13:14
put that over here.
13:15
I'll get 29.4 Newtons over 8 kg is equal to
13:22
the acceleration of mass five.
13:24
The 5 kg mass in the X direction.
13:27
And if we calculate that,
13:29
I'll just put that into my calculator.
13:30
29.4 divided by eight.
13:34
I get 3.675.
13:36
So we'll just round.
13:37
We'll just say that's 3.68.
13:40
3.6 whoops, 3.68 and it's positive, that's good.
13:45
We should get a positive because the 5 kg mass has
13:49
a positive acceleration.
13:50
So we get positive 3.68 meters per second squared.
13:55
But that's just of the 5 kg mass.
13:57
How do we get the acceleration of the 3 kg mass?
14:00
Well that's easy.
14:00
It's gotta have the same magnitude of the 5 kg mass.
14:04
All I have to do is take this number now.
14:06
I know what A5X is.
14:08
So if I just plug that in right here,
14:10
well then I know that A3Y is just gonna be equal
14:15
to -3.68 meters per second squared.
14:22
And I'm done, I did it.
14:23
We figured out the acceleration of the 3 kg mass,
14:27
it's negative.
14:28
No surprise, 'cause it's accelerating downward.
14:30
We figured out the acceleration of the 5 kg mass,
14:33
it's positive, not a surprise.
14:34
It was accelerating to the right.
14:36
The way we did it, recapping really quick,
14:38
we did Newton's second law for the 5 kg mass.
14:41
That didn't let us solve.
14:43
We did Newton's second law for the 3 kg mass,
14:46
that didn't let us solve.
14:47
In fact it got really bleak, because it seemed like we
14:49
had three unknowns and only two equations,
14:53
but the link that allowed us to make it so that we only
14:56
had one equation with one unknown, is that we plugged
14:59
one equation to the other first.
15:01
We had to then write the accelerations in terms
15:03
of each other, that's because these accelerations
15:07
are not independent.
15:08
The accelerations have to have the same magnitude.
15:10
And in this case one had the opposite sign.
15:13
So when we plugged that in, we have one equation
15:15
with one unknown, we solve, we get the amount
15:18
of acceleration.
15:19
So that's the hard way to do these problems.
15:21
So in the next video I'll show you the easy way
15:24
to do these problems.",why does the tension that's pulling the 5kg box rightward have the same magnitude as the tension that's pulling the 3kg box up?

- [Instructor] We've already seen that the change
0:02
in free energy, delta G,
0:05
can be related to the cell potential E, by this equation.
0:09
Under standard state conditions,
0:11
this would be the standard change in free energy,
0:13
so delta G zero which is related to the
0:15
standard cell potential E zero, right,
0:18
by the same equation.
0:20
This equation down here comes from thermodynamics,
0:23
and we're going to plug in for delta G and delta G zero,
0:27
so we're going to plug this in for delta G,
0:31
and we're going to plug this in for delta G zero.
0:34
So that gives us negative nFE is equal to,
0:39
negative nFE zero, plus RT,
0:45
natural log of Q,
0:47
where Q is the reaction quotient.
0:50
Let's divide everything by negative nF,
0:53
so we're going to divide everything
0:55
in here by negative nF,
0:57
and let's see what cancels out.
1:00
So all of this would cancel out,
1:02
all of that would cancel out,
1:04
and we get the Nernst equation.
1:07
So let me go ahead and write it,
1:08
the cell potential E,
1:11
is equal to the standard cell potential, E zero,
1:15
minus RT over nF,
1:20
times the natural log of Q,
1:23
where Q is the reaction quotient.
1:26
So this is the Nernst equation,
1:29
alright, we'll talk about why the Nernst equation
1:32
is so important, we'll talk more about that
1:33
at the end of the video.

Right now, let's go ahead and derive
1:38
another form of the Nernst equation,
1:40
I should say, the form when you're talking
1:41
about a certain temperature.
1:43
So at 25 degrees C, right,
1:46
most of our reactions take place at 25 degrees C,
1:50
well, temperature, right,
1:52
temperature in here, this in the temperature in Kelvin,
1:54
so we need to convert to Kelvin.
1:57
So if you add 273.15, alright,
2:01
you get your temperature in Kelvin,
2:03
so that would be 298.15,
2:08
so what we're going to do is solve for RT over F,
2:12
to write a different form of the Nernst equation.
2:15
And so the temperature is 298.15 Kelvin,
2:18
so let's write that in,
2:20
so 298.15 Kelvin.
2:24
R is the gas constant,
2:26
so remember, the gas constant is 8.314, 8.314,
2:31
joules over mole Kelvin.
2:35
And F is Faraday's constant,
2:38
remember Faraday's constant from an earlier video, right,
2:40
that's 96,500 coulombs per mole.
2:45
So Faraday's constant is the
2:48
charge of one mole of electrons.
2:52
Alright, so let's solve for
2:53
what all this is equal to,
2:55
so let's get some more space,
2:57
and let's get out the calculator.
3:00
So we've already done this calculation
3:02
in an earlier video,
3:03
but I'm going to go ahead and do it again,
3:05
for this Nernst equation video.
3:06
So 8.314 times 289.15,
3:14
we need to divide that by Faraday's constant, 96,500.
3:19
So that gives us 0.0257, alright,
3:24
so this is equal to,
3:26
this is equal to 0.0257,
3:31
and for units, Kelvin would cancel out,
3:33
moles would cancel out,
3:35
that gives us joules over coulombs,
3:37
which is equal to volts, alright.
3:40
So this is equal to volts,
3:42
and we can write another form of the Nernst equation.
3:46
So if your reaction is at 25 degrees C,
3:50
you can write the Nernst equation this way,
3:52
you could say that the cell potential E,
3:54
is equal to the standard cell potential E zero, minus,
3:59
so all that RT over F is equal to this, 0.0257, right.
4:05
So 0.0257 volts,
4:09
we still have n,
4:11
remember n is the number of moles
4:14
I'm going to use green for that,
4:15
n is the number of moles
4:17
of electrons that are transferred
4:19
in your redox reaction, right.
4:21
So we're going to put n in here,
4:23
and we still have the natural log of Q,
4:26
the reaction quotient, right.
4:28
So here is another form of the Nernst equation,
4:33
alright, so at 25 degrees, you can use this form,
4:36
and then we can also write this
4:40
into base 10 logarithms that have natural logs.
4:43
So we can do that conversion, right.
4:45
So we also did that in an earlier video,
4:47
but if you're trying to convert this 0.0257,
4:52
you need to multiply by the natural log of 10.
4:56
So when we do that,
4:58
so we have 0.0257 times the natural log of 10,
5:05
that gives us 0.0592,
5:08
so this is equal to 0.0592.
5:14
So we can write the Nernst equation once again,
5:18
alright, so E, or the cell potential,
5:20
is equal to the standard cell potential E zero,
5:22
minus 0.0592 over n.
5:29
And we essentially just change this
5:32
from natural logarithm to base 10 logarithm,
5:34
so this would be log of Q, log of the reaction quotient.
5:39
So here is just another form of the Nernst equation.
5:44
So why is the Nernst equation important
5:47
and why is it useful?
5:48
It's useful, because it allows us to calculate
5:51
a cell potential under non-standard state conditions,
5:56
so think about this cell potential
5:59
as being the instantaneous cell potential,
6:02
and you can relate that
6:03
to the progress of the reaction, right.
6:05
So as you change concentrations,
6:07
the reaction quotient Q changes, right,
6:10
and that means that the
6:12
instantaneous cell potential changes,
6:15
alright, so if you change if the concentrations,
6:17
if you change the concentrations,
6:19
you're changing the cell potential.
6:21
And so we'll see more about that in the next video,
6:23
so I think that the Nernst equation makes much more
6:26
sense when you do some problems with it,
6:29
and then you can understand better what it means.",What are the criteria for standard conditions in relation to delta G naught being change in free energy under standard conditions?
khan_video_QaOtsYouet0_6,Science,ESSAY,"•
0:01
- [Instructor] We've already seen that the change
0:02
in free energy, delta G,
0:05
can be related to the cell potential E, by this equation.
0:09
Under standard state conditions,
0:11
this would be the standard change in free energy,
0:13
so delta G zero which is related to the
0:15
standard cell potential E zero, right,
0:18
by the same equation.
0:20
This equation down here comes from thermodynamics,
0:23
and we're going to plug in for delta G and delta G zero,
0:27
so we're going to plug this in for delta G,
0:31
and we're going to plug this in for delta G zero.
0:34
So that gives us negative nFE is equal to,
0:39
negative nFE zero, plus RT,
0:45
natural log of Q,
0:47
where Q is the reaction quotient.
0:50
Let's divide everything by negative nF,
0:53
so we're going to divide everything
0:55
in here by negative nF,
0:57
and let's see what cancels out.
1:00
So all of this would cancel out,
1:02
all of that would cancel out,
1:04
and we get the Nernst equation.
1:07
So let me go ahead and write it,
1:08
the cell potential E,
1:11
is equal to the standard cell potential, E zero,
1:15
minus RT over nF,
1:20
times the natural log of Q,
1:23
where Q is the reaction quotient.
1:26
So this is the Nernst equation,
1:29
alright, we'll talk about why the Nernst equation
1:32
is so important, we'll talk more about that
1:33
at the end of the video.
1:35
Right now, let's go ahead and derive
1:38

2:01
you get your temperature in Kelvin,
2:03
so that would be 298.15,
2:08
so what we're going to do is solve for RT over F,
2:12
to write a different form of the Nernst equation.
2:15
And so the temperature is 298.15 Kelvin,
2:18
so let's write that in,
2:20
so 298.15 Kelvin.
2:24
R is the gas constant,
2:26
so remember, the gas constant is 8.314, 8.314,
2:31
joules over mole Kelvin.
2:35
And F is Faraday's constant,
2:38
remember Faraday's constant from an earlier video, right,
2:40
that's 96,500 coulombs per mole.
2:45
So Faraday's constant is the
2:48
charge of one mole of electrons.
2:52
Alright, so let's solve for
2:53
what all this is equal to,
2:55
so let's get some more space,

3:02

for this Nernst equation video.
3:06
So 8.314 times 289.15,
3:14
we need to divide that by Faraday's constant, 96,500.
3:19
So that gives us 0.0257, alright,
3:24
so this is equal to,
3:26
this is equal to 0.0257,
3:31
and for units, Kelvin would cancel out,
3:33
moles would cancel out,
3:35
that gives us joules over coulombs,
3:37
which is equal to volts, alright.
3:40
So this is equal to volts,
3:42
and we can write another form of the Nernst equation.
3:46
So if your reaction is at 25 degrees C,
3:50
you can write the Nernst equation this way,
3:52
you could say that the cell potential E,
3:54
is equal to the standard cell potential E zero, minus,
3:59
so all that RT over F is equal to this, 0.0257, right.
4:05
So 0.0257 volts,
4:09
we still have n,
4:11
remember n is the number of moles
4:14
I'm going to use green for that,
4:15
n is the number of moles
4:17
of electrons that are transferred
4:19
in your redox reaction, right.
4:21
So we're going to put n in here,
4:23
and we still have the natural log of Q,
4:26
the reaction quotient, right.
4:28
So here is another form of the Nernst equation,

so we have 0.0257 times the natural log of 10,
5:05
that gives us 0.0592,
5:08
so this is equal to 0.0592.
5:14
So we can write the Nernst equation once again,
5:18
alright, so E, or the cell potential,
5:20
is equal to the standard cell potential E zero,
5:22
minus 0.0592 over n.
5:29
And we essentially just change this
5:32
from natural logarithm to base 10 logarithm,
5:34
so this would be log of Q, log of the reaction quotient.
5:39

6:17
if you change the concentrations,
6:19
you're changing the cell potential.
6:21
And so we'll see more about that in the next video,
6:23
so I think that the Nernst equation makes much more

Voiceover: What I want to talk about in this video
0:01
are the notions of Electronegativity,
0:05
electro, negati, negativity,
0:13
and a closely, and a closely related
0:15
idea of Electron Affinity, electron affinity.
0:22
And they're so closely related that in general,
0:24
if something has a high electronegativity,
0:27
they have a high electron affinity,
0:29
but what does this mean?
0:31
Well, electron affinity is how much does that atom
0:34
attract electrons, how much does it like electrons?
0:37
Does it want, does it maybe want more electrons?
0:41
Electronegativity is a little bit more specific.
0:45
It's when that atom is part of a covalent bond,
0:49
when it is sharing electrons with another atom,
0:53
how likely is it or how badly does it want
0:55
to hog the electrons in that covalent bond?
0:58
Now what do I mean by hogging electrons?
1:01
So let me make, let me write this down.
1:03
So how badly wants to hog,
1:13
and this is an informal definition clearly,
1:15
hog electrons, keep the electrons,
1:18
to spend more of their time closer to them
1:20
then to the other party in the covalent bond.
1:23
And this is how, how much they like electrons,
1:28
or how much affinity they have towards electrons.
1:32
So how much they want electrons.
1:39
And you can see that these are very,
1:41
these are very related notions.
1:43
This is within the context of a covalent bond,
1:45
how much electron affinity is there?
1:47
Well this, you can think of it as a slightly broader notion,
1:50
but these two trends go absolutely in line with each other.
1:54
And to think about, to just think about
1:55
electronegativity makes it a little bit more tangible.
1:58
Let's think about one of the most famous
1:59
sets of covalent bonds,
2:00
and that's what you see in a water molecule.
2:03
Water, as you probably know, is H two O,
2:07
you have an oxygen atom,
2:11
and you have two hydrogens.
2:13
Each of the hydrogen's have one valence electron,
2:17
and the oxygen has, we see here, at it's outermost shell,
2:21
it has one, two, three, four, five, six valence electrons.
2:25
One, two, three, four, five, six valence electrons.
2:31
And so you can imagine, hydrogen would be happy
2:33
if it was able to somehow pretend like it had another
2:35
electron then it would have an electron configuration
2:37
a stable, first shell that only requires two electrons,
2:41
the rest of them require eight,
2:42
hydrogen would feel, hey I'm stable like helium
2:45
if it could get another electron.
2:46
And oxygen would feel, hey I'm stable like neon
2:49
if I could get two more electrons.
2:51
And so what happens is they share each other's electrons.
2:53
This, this electron can be shared in conjunction
2:57
with this electron for this hydrogen.
2:59
So that hydrogen can kind of feel like it's using
3:01
both and it gets more stable,
3:03
it stabilizes the outer shell,
3:04
or it stabilizes the hydrogen.
3:06
And likewise, that electron could be,
3:08
can be shared with the hydrogen,
3:10
and the hydrogen can kind of feel more like helium.
3:13
And then this oxygen can feel like
3:14
it's a quid pro quo,
3:16
it's getting something in exchange for something else.
3:18
It's getting the electron, an electron,
3:20
it's sharing an electron from each of these hydrogens,
3:22
and so it can feel like it's, that it stabilizes it,
3:26
similar to a, similar to a neon.
3:30
But when you have these covalent bonds,
3:32
only in the case where they are equally
3:34
electronegative would you have a case
3:35
where maybe they're sharing,
3:37
and even there what happens
3:38
in the rest of the molecule might matter,
3:40
but when you have something like this,
3:42
where you have oxygen and hydrogen,
3:43
they don't have the same electronegativity.
3:45
Oxygen likes to hog electrons more than hydrogen does.
3:49
And so these electrons are not gonna spend
3:51
an even amount of time.
3:52
Here I did it kind of just drawing these,
3:54
you know, these valence electrons as these dots.
3:57
But as we know, the electrons are in this
3:59
kind of blur around, around the,
4:03
around the actual nuclei,
4:06
around the atoms that make up the atoms.
4:09
And so, in this type of a covalent bond,
4:11
the electrons, the two electrons that this bond represents,
4:15
are going to spend more time around the oxygen
4:18
then they are going to spend around the hydrogen.
4:20
And these, these two electrons are gonna spend
4:23
more time around the oxygen,
4:25
then are going to spend around the hydrogen.
4:27
And we know that because oxygen is more electronegative,
4:30
and we'll talk about the trends in a second.
4:31
This is a really important idea in chemistry,
4:34
and especially later on as you study organic chemistry.
4:36
Because, because we know that
4:39
oxygen is more electronegative,
4:40
and the electrons spend more time
4:41
around oxygen then around hydrogen,
4:44
it creates a partial negative charge on this side,
4:47
and partial positive charges on this side right over here,
4:50
which is why water has many of the properties that it does,
4:55
and we go into much more in depth in that in other videos.
4:59
And also when you study organic chemistry,
5:00
a lot of the likely reactions that are
5:02
going to happen can be predicted,
5:04
or a lot of the likely molecules that form
5:06
can be predicted based on elecronegativity.
5:09
And especially when you start going
5:10
into oxidation numbers and things like that,
5:12
electronegativity will tell you a lot.
5:15
So now that we know what electronegativity is,
5:19
let's think a little bit about what is,
5:21
as we go through, as we start,
5:24
as we go through, as we go through a period,
5:27
as say as we start in group one,
5:29
and we go to group, and as we go all the way
5:35
all the way to, let's say the halogens,
5:38
all the way up to the yellow column right over here,
5:42
what do you think is going to be
5:44
the trend for electronegativity?
5:47
And once again, one way to think about it
5:49
is to think about the extremes.
5:50
Think about sodium, and think about chlorine,
5:53
and I encourage you to pause
5:54
the video and think about that.
5:56
Assuming you've had a go at it,
5:58
and it's in some ways the same idea,
6:01
or it's a similar idea as ionization energy.
6:03
Something like sodium has only one electron
6:06
in it's outer most shell.
6:07
It'd be hard for it to complete that shell,
6:09
and so to get to a stable state it's much easier
6:12
for it to give away that one electron that it has,
6:15
so it can get to a stable configuration like neon.
6:18
So this one really wants to give away an electron.
6:22
And we saw in the video on ionization energy,
6:24
that's why this has a low ionization energy,
6:26
it doesn't take much energy, in a gaseous state,
6:29
to remove an electron from sodium.
6:32
But chlorine is the opposite.
6:33
It's only one away from completing it's shell.
6:35
The last thing it wants to do is give away electron,
6:37
it wants an electron really, really, really, really badly
6:40
so it can get to a configuration of argon,
6:42
so it can complete it's third shell.
6:45
So the logic here is that sodium wouldn't mind
6:49
giving away an electron,
6:50
while chlorine really would love an electron.
6:52
So chlorine is more likely to hog electrons,
6:55
while sodium is very unlikely to hog electrons.
6:59
So this trend right here,
7:00
when you go from the left to the right,
7:02
your electronegativity, let me write this,
7:04
your getting more electronegative.
7:07
More electro, electronegative, as you,
7:13
as you go to the right.
7:16
Now what do you think the trend is going to be
7:18
as you go down, as you go down in a group?
7:22
What do you think the trend is going to be as you go down?
7:25
Well I'll give you a hint.
7:27
Think about, think about atomic radii, and given that,
7:31
pause the video and think about
7:31
what do you think the trend is?
7:32
Are we gonna get more or less electronegative
7:34
as we move down?
7:36
So once again I'm assuming you've given a go at it,
7:39
so as we know, from the video on atomic radii,
7:41
our atom is getting larger, and larger, and larger,
7:44
as we add more and more and more shells.
7:46
And so cesium has one electron in it's outer most shell,
7:50
in the sixth shell,
7:52
while, say, lithium has one electron.
7:55
Everything here, all the group one elements,
7:57
have one electron in it's outer most shell,
7:59
but that fifty fifth electron,
8:01
that one electron in the outer most shell in cesium,
8:03
is a lot further away then the outer most electron
8:05
in lithium or in hydrogen.
8:08
And so because of that, it's, well one,
8:12
there's more interference between that electron and the
8:14
nucleus from all the other electrons in between them,
8:16
and also it's just further away,
8:18
so it's easier to kind of grab it off.
8:20
So cesium is very likely to give up,
8:24
it's very likely to give up electrons.
8:27
It's much more likely to give up electrons than hydrogen.
8:30
So, as you go down a given group,
8:33
you're becoming less, less electronegative, electronegative.
8:39
So what, what are, based on this,
8:41
what are going to be the most electronegative
8:44
of all the atoms?
8:46
Well they're going to be the ones
8:47
that are in the top and the right of the periodic table,
8:50
they're going to be these right over here.
8:52
These are going to be the most electronegative,
8:54
Sometimes we don't think as much about the noble gases
8:56
because they aren't, they aren't really that reactive,
8:59
they don't even form covalent bond,
9:01
because they're just happy.
9:02
While these characters up here,
9:03
they sometimes will form covalent bonds,
9:06
and when they do, they really like to hog those electrons.
9:09
Now what are the least electronegative,
9:11
sometimes called very electropositive?
9:13
Well these things down here in the bottom left.
9:15
These, over here, they have only,
9:18
you know in the case of cesium,
9:19
they have one electron to give away
9:21
that would take them to a stable state like, like xenon,
9:25
or in the case of these group two elements
9:27
they might have to give away two,
9:28
but it's much easier to give away two
9:29
then to gain a whole bunch of them.
9:31
And they're big, they're big atoms.
9:34
So those outer most electrons are getting
9:35
less attracted to the positive nucleus.
9:39
So the trend in the periodic table
9:40
as you go from the bottom left,
9:42
to the top right,
9:44
you're getting more, more electro, electronegative.","Why does oxygen wants to ""hog""more electrons than Hydrogen (as he says at 3:45) in a water molecule?"

Steven: We're looking at one of the single canvases from a series of canvases
0:08
of the Campbell Soup Cans by Andy Warhol from 1962
0:12
at the Museum of Modern Art.
0:13
And one of the really important questions that comes up about,
0:16
especially modern art, is well, why is this art?
0:21
Sal: When you ask me that a bunch of things kind of surface in my brain.
0:24
It does evoke something in me so I'm inclined to say yes,
0:28
but then there's a bunch of other things that say well,
0:30
if I didn't see this in a museum and if I just saw this
0:32
in the marketing department of Campbell's Soup,
0:35
would you be viewing it differently?
0:37
Steven: Because it's advertising then. Sal: Yes.
0:38
Steven: But in the context of the museum or in the context
0:41
of Andy Warhol's studio, it's not quite advertising, right?
0:44
Sal: Even if it's the exact same thing. Steven: Yeah.
0:47
Sal: And the idea here is by putting it in the museum
0:50
it's saying look at this in a different way.
0:52
Steven: Well that's right, it really does relocate it,
0:54
it does change the meaning, it does transform it,
0:57
and that's really one of the central ideas of modern art
1:00
is that you can take something that's not necessarily based
1:03
in technical skill, because I don't think you would say
1:05
that this is beautifully rendered. Sal: Right.
1:08
Steven: But it relocates it and makes us think about it in a different way.
1:11
Sal: And so, I guess he would get credit for taking something
1:14
that was very, almost mundane, something you see in everyone's cupboard,
1:19
and making it a focal point like you should pay attention to this thing.
1:23
Steven: I think that's exactly right and I think that he's doing it
1:26
about a subject that was about as low a subject as one could go.
1:31
I mean cheap advertising art was something that was so far away
1:34
from fine art from the great masters and then to focus on something
1:38
as lowly as a can of soup, and cream of chicken no less, right? (laughs)
1:44
Sal: A lot of it is, if he did it 50 years earlier,
1:47
people would have thought this guy's a quack
1:49
and if he did it now they'd think he was just derivative and...
1:52
It was really just that time where people happened to think this was art.
1:57
Steven: I think that that's right.
1:59
In 1962, what Warhol is doing is he's saying
2:02
what is it about our culture that is really authentic and important?
2:06
And it was about mass production, it was about factories.
2:09
He in a sense said let's not be looking at nature
2:13
as if we were still an agrarian culture, we're now an industrial culture.
2:16
What is the stuff of our visual world now?
2:19
Sal: I think I'm 80 percent there.
2:21
I remember in college there was a student run art exhibit
2:24
and as a prank a student actually put a little podium there
2:28
and put his lunch tray.
2:30
He put a little placard next to it, you know, lunch tray on Saturday
2:33
or something is what he called it.
2:34
So he did it as a prank and everyone thought it was really funny
2:37
but to some degree it's kind of a sign that maybe what he did was art.
2:40
Steven: Well I think that's why it was funny
2:42
because it was so close, right?
2:43
Sal: And to some degree when someone took a lunch tray
2:45
and gave it the proper lighting and gave it a podium to look at it
2:49
and wrote a whole description about it, I did view the lunch tray
2:51
in a different way.
2:52
That's kind of the same idea, that something
2:54
that's such a mundane thing but you use it everyday.
2:56
I mean, what would you say to that?
2:58
Was that a prank or was that art?
3:00
Steven: I think it is a prank but it's also very close
3:02
to some important art that had been made earlier in the century.
3:04
He had license to do that because of somebody named Marcel Duchamp.
3:08
In fact, Warhol had in a sense the same kind of license
3:11
to not focus on the making of something, not focus on the brushwork,
3:15
not focus on the composition, not focus on the color,
3:18
but focus on the refocusing of ideas.
3:21
Sal: And the reason why we talk about Warhol or Duchamp
3:25
or any of these people is that, as you said,
3:27
it's not that they did something technically profound.
3:29
Obviously Campbell Soup's marketing department had already done
3:32
something as equally as profound, it's more that they were the people
3:37
who looked at the world in a slightly different way and highlighted that.
3:41
Steven: Well I think that that's right.
3:42
Warhol is also very consciously working towards
3:46
asking the same questions that the prankster at your school was asking.
3:49
He's saying can this be art?
3:52
And in fact he's really pushing it.
3:54
Look at the painting closely for a moment.
3:55
This is one of the last paintings that he's actually painted.
3:58
He's really defined the calligraphy of this Campbell's,
4:01
he's really sort of rendered the reflection of the tin at the top.
4:05
But then he stopped and he said, I don't want to paint the fleur de lis.
4:08
You see those little fleur de lis down at the bottom.
4:11
I don't want to paint those.
4:12
So he actually had a little rubber stamp made of them
4:14
and actually sort of placed them down mechanically.
4:17
What does that mean for an artist then,
4:19
to say I don't even want to bother to paint these?
4:21
I'm just going to find a mechanical process to make this easier.
4:24
Warhol is doing something I think which is important
4:26
which is reflecting the way that we manufacture,
4:29
the way that we construct our world.
4:31
Think about the things that we surround ourselves with,
4:35
almost everything was made in a factory.
4:37
Almost nothing is singular in the world anymore.
4:40
It's not a world that we would normally find beautiful.
4:43
Sal: I don't know, sometimes I feel and correct me if I'm wrong,
4:45
that a decision was made that Warhol was interesting or great
4:49
and then people will interpret his stuff to justify his greatness.
4:53
That oh look, he used a printer instead of drawing it
4:58
which shows that he was reflecting the industrial or whatever,
5:01
but if he had done it the other way, if he had hand drawn it
5:04
or hand drawn it with his elbow you know, or finger painted it or something
5:08
people would say oh isn't this tremendous because we normally
5:10
would see this thing printed by a machine and now he did it with his hands.
5:13
How much do you think that is the case or am I just being cynical?
5:16
Steven: Well no, I think that there's value in a certain degree of cynicism
5:20
and I think that in some ways what we're really talking about here
5:24
is what does it mean to be an avant-garde artist?
5:26
What does it mean to sort of change the language of art
5:29
and to try to find ways that art relates to our historical moment
5:33
in some really direct and authentic way?
5:36
Sal: And maybe it's easy for me to say this because
5:38
I remember looking at this when I took 5th grade art class,
5:43
Andy Warhol and all of that, so now it seems almost not that unique
5:47
but in '62 what I'm hearing is that Warhol was really noteworthy
5:51
because he really did push people's thinking.
5:53
Steven: I think that Warhol was looking for, in 1962, a kind of subject matter
5:58
that was completely outside of the scope of that we could consider fine art.
6:02
One of his contemporaries, Roy Lichtenstein,
6:04
was asked what pop art was and he said,
6:06
""Well we were looking for subject matter that was so despicable,
6:10
""that was so low, that nobody could possibly believe that it was really art.""
6:14
And I think you're right, I think now we look at it
6:16
and it's so much a part of our visual culture that we immediately accept it.
6:20
But I think that it's really interesting to retrieve
6:22
just how shocking and radical that was.
6:25
Sal: This is fascinating.
6:26
It seems like there's a lot of potential there,
6:29
that stuff that's pseudo-art made for other purposes,
6:32
for commercial purposes but if you kind of shine a light on it,
6:35
in the way that a light has been shone on this, that it does...
6:39
In your mind would that cross the barrier into being art?
6:43
Steven: Well I think that, you mentioned before,
6:45
that if somebody was doing this now it would feel really derivative.
6:48
And I think that that's right.
6:49
I think it underscores just how hard it is to find in our culture now,
6:54
ways of making us see the world in new ways.
6:57
Sal: Fascinating.

0:00
In this video, we're going to talk about the law of demand,
0:04
which is one of the core ideas of microeconomics.
0:07
And lucky for us, it's a fairly intuitive idea.
0:10
It just tells us that if we raise the price of a product,
0:16
that will lower the quantity demanded for the product.
0:20
Quantity demanded will go down.
0:23
And you could imagine the other side of that.
0:25
If we lower the price of a product,
0:30
that will raise the quantity demanded of that product.
0:36
And the law of demand says this just kind of generally.
0:39
What we'll see in a few videos from now
0:41
is that there are some exceptions to this.
0:44
But to make this little concrete,
0:46
let's think about the demand for a certain product.
0:49
And one thing I want to clear here,
0:51
and I'm going to go through great pains
0:53
to not mess this up, is that when
0:55
we talk about the word demand in a formal economic sense,
0:59
we're not talking about a quantity.
1:01
We're actually going to talk, all
1:02
else equal, ceteris paribus, the relationship
1:07
between price and quantity demanded.
1:10
If we talk about an actual quantity,
1:11
we should say the quantity demanded.
1:13
So demand versus quantity demanded.
1:17
These are two different things.
1:19
And if it's a little confusing to you
1:21
right now, hopefully by the end of this video,
1:23
the difference between demand and quantity
1:25
demanded will become a little bit clearer.
1:27
And definitely over the next few videos, because in this video,
1:30
we're going to focus on how the quantity demanded changes
1:33
relative to the price.
1:34
In future videos, we'll talk about how
1:36
the entire relationship, how demand changes
1:39
based on different factors.
1:41
But to make things concrete, let's
1:42
say I'm about to release my science fiction
1:47
book, Space Whatever.
1:48
I don't know, the book that I want to release.
1:50
So I'm going to release some ebook.
1:54
And we've done some market study,
1:56
or we just know how the demand is related to price
2:00
or the price is related to demand.
2:02
And we're going to show that in a demand schedule, which
2:06
is really just a table that just shows how the price-- and,
2:12
actually I just made my first mistake.
2:14
I just said how price relates to demand.
2:17
I should say how price relates to quantity demanded
2:20
and how quantity demanded relates to price.
2:23
So demand schedule, it shows a relationship between price
2:27
and quantity demanded, all else equal.
2:32
So we're going to have multiple scenarios here.
2:36
So this column, let me do my scenarios.
2:38
In this column, let me put my price.
2:41
In this column, I put my quantity demanded.
2:50
So scenario, let's call this scenario A.
2:54
I could price my book at $2.
2:59
And I'll get a ton of people downloading it at that price.
3:02
So I will get 60,000 people download my book
3:07
at that price, my ebook.
3:09
Scenario B, I could raise the price by $2.
3:12
So it's now $4.
3:14
And that kills off a lot of the demand.
3:17
Now the quantity demanded goes down
3:18
to 40,000 people downloading it.
3:21
Then I can go to scenario C, if I raise it by another $2.
3:24
So now I'm at $6.
3:26
Now that lowers the quantity demanded to 30,000.
3:32
I'll do a couple more of these.
3:33
Scenario D, I raise another $2.
3:37
So I get to $8 now.
3:39
Now the quantity demanded goes down to 25,000.
3:43
And I'll do one more of these.
3:46
Let me see, what color have I not used yet.
3:48
I haven't used yellow yet.
3:49
Scenario E, if I raise it to $10,
3:53
now the quantity demanded, let's just say, is 23,000.
3:59
So this relationship shows the law of demand right over here.
4:05
And this table that shows how the quantity demanded
4:07
relates to price and vice versa, this
4:09
is what we call a demand schedule.
4:11
Now we can also, based on this demand schedule,
4:14
draw a demand curve.
4:15
And really, we're just going to plot these points
4:17
and draw the curve the connects them.
4:20
Because these aren't the only scenarios.
4:23
Anything in between is possible.
4:24
We could charge $2.01 for the book.
4:26
We could charge for $4.50 for the book.
4:28
And so that's what the demand curve captures a little bit
4:30
better, because it's a continuous curve, not just
4:32
five points.
4:34
So let's do that.
4:35
Let's graph it.
4:37
And this is one of those conventions of economics
4:39
that I am not a fan of.
4:40
Because people often talk about changing the price,
4:45
and how the quantity demanded changes from that.
4:48
And in traditional-- in most of math and science, the thing
4:51
that you're changing, you normally
4:52
put on the horizontal axis.
4:54
So if I was in charge of the convention of economics,
4:58
I would plot price on the horizontal axis
5:01
right over here.
5:02
But the way it's done typically is
5:04
that price is done on the vertical axis.
5:06
And so you're used to seeing it in kind of a traditional class
5:08
environment.
5:09
I'll do the same.
5:10
So we'll put price in the vertical axis,
5:13
and we'll put quantity demanded in the horizontal axis.
5:21
And our quantity demanded goes all the up to 60,000.
5:23
So let's see, that's 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.
5:29
So that's 10-- this is in thousands-- 20, 30, 40-- sorry,
5:34
not 45-- 40, 50, and 60.
5:38
And this is in thousands.
5:41
And then the price goes up to $10, from $2 to $10.
5:45
So let's say this is 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.
5:55
So let's plot the scenarios.
5:57
So scenario A, price is $2, 60,000 units are demanded.
6:02
That is scenario A right over there.
6:05
Scenario B, when the price is $4, 40,000 units are demanded.
6:13
And that's right over there.
6:14
That's scenario B.
6:16
Scenario C, $6, 30,000 units.
6:22
Right over there, scenario C. Scenario D, $8, 25,000 units.
6:29
$8, 25 is right about there.
6:32
That looks like 25,000, right in between.
6:34
That's close enough.
6:36
So that right over there is scenario D.
6:39
And then finally scenario E, $10, 23,000 units.
6:46
So it might be something like that.
6:48
That is scenario E.
6:50
And so we could actually have prices
6:52
anywhere in between that.
6:53
And maybe we could even go further.
6:55
So this right over here.
6:56
So if I were to draw the demand curve,
6:58
it could look something like this.
7:00
The demand curve would look something--
7:03
I'm trying to do my best to draw it
7:04
as a straight continuous line-- could look something like that.
7:08
And it could keep going on and on.
7:11
And so these are two ways to show demand.
7:13
So just going back to what I said earlier,
7:16
the quantity demanded is, all else
7:17
equal for a given price, how many units people are
7:22
willing to download or buy of my ebook.
7:25
When we talk about the demand itself,
7:30
we're talking about this entire relationship.
7:33
So this demand itself is this entire demand schedule.
7:36
Or another way to think of it is this entire demand curve.
7:39
If demand were to change, we would actually
7:43
have a different curve.
7:44
This curve would shift, or the entries in this table
7:48
would shift.
7:49
If the quantity of demand changes--
7:51
so we move along this curve when you hold everything else equal
7:55
and you only change price.
7:57
So hopefully that makes it clear.
7:58
When everything else is equal, and you're only changing price,
8:02
you're not changing demand, you're
8:04
changing the quantity demanded.
8:05
The demand, because everything else is equal,
8:07
is this relationship.
8:09
In the next few videos, we'll think
8:10
about what does happen when you do
8:12
change some of those other factors.",We know the latter is untrue because science studies the variables but was there a study for the law of demand?

- [Voiceover] Graph 0.04 on the number line.
0:03
So here we have this number line
0:05
that goes from zero to 0.1, or 1/10,
0:09
and between zero and 1/10,
0:11
we have one, two, three, four, five, six,
0:14
seven, eight, nine, ten equal spaces.
0:18
So each of these spaces represents 1/10th of the distance,
0:23
is one out of ten equal spaces.
0:26
Or we could say, it is 1/10th of this tenth,
0:31
it's a tenth of the way to 1/10th.
0:35
That's a little bit tricky,
0:36
maybe let's pause and look at that visually
0:38
and think about what does a tenth of a tenth really mean.
0:42
So here I have already drawn
0:44
a picture that's divided into 10 equal pieces.
0:47
And if we shade one of them, then we're shading 1/10th.
0:53
This right here is 1/10th.
0:55
And this amount right here is what the number line showed,
0:58
the whole number line showed 1/10th.
1:01
But then we had divided that tenth into 10 equal pieces,
1:05
so if we split that 10 into 10 equal pieces,
1:09
we're gonna have something like this.
1:12
So here again this top row would represent the entire tenth,
1:17
from the whole number line,
1:19
but each little piece would be 1/10th of that whole tenth.
1:26
Or, so this is what each little piece
1:29
on the number line represents,
1:31
or we could say that's 1/100th,
1:35
a tenth of a tenth is a 1/100th,
1:38
'cause when you divide 10 into 10 equal pieces,
1:40
you're gonna end up with 100 pieces.
1:43
So a tenth of a tenth is a 1/100th.
1:48
So looking back at the number line,
1:50
now we know that this distance,
1:53
a tenth of our tenth, is 1/100th.
1:57
And we want to graph 0.04.
2:02
Well this four right here, let's think about place value.
2:06
The zero's in the ones, the next zero in the tenth,
2:10
and this four is in the hundreds,
2:12
so we could call this four hundredths,
2:16
or even the fraction, 4/100.
2:21
So if one of these lengths is 1/100
2:24
and we wanna go 4/100,
2:26
then we're gonna need to go four of these lengths.
2:28
One, two, three, four of these lengths
2:32
would be four of the hundredths, or 0.04.",what does graphing mean in math?

0:54
the final velocity at that point in time
0:57
and of course the acceleration we know
1:00
our acceleration is pretty straigth forward
1:03
the acceleration due to gravity is just gonna be negative 9.8 m/s*s
1:09
once again the negative being the convention that
1:11
it is in the downward direction
1:13
our initial velocity is going to be upper direction 19.6m/s
1:19
so let's plot this out a little bit, let's plot these out
1:22
so the first graph I wanna do will be my displacement verses time
1:31
so this axis right over here is going to be time
1:36
and let me just call it change in time, actually I'll just call it time
1:41
let's just call it time and then this axis right over here
1:46
I will call it displacement and we leave some marker here
1:50
so let's say that this is 5m, 10m, 15m and 20m
1:55
and the time, this is zero, this is 1 this is 2 this is 3 &amp; this is 4
2:06
seconds, so this is in second here
2:08
this is meters 5,10,15,20 and then so this is displacement
2:22
displacement graph, and I wanna do at the same time a velocity graph
2:28
let me draw my velocity graph like this, a little bit different
2:32
so this is the velocity will be going up and down, so we have positive
2:38
and negative values here, time will only be positive
2:41
so once again I care about 1s 2s 3s and 4s
2:49
and velocity I'm gonna call this, this is going to be 10m/s
2:55
10m/s this is 20m/s, this will be negative 10m/s
3:01
and this will be negative 20m/s, all of these are in m/s
3:07
this right here is velocity, this axis right here is time
3:13
so this is my velocity graph, and why don't we draw an acceleration graph
3:19
over here, to some degree it's easiest of them all
3:23
so the acceleration graph, so I will just do the fraction here and assume
3:31
that the acceleration is a constant, so this is 1s 2s 3s and 4s
3:37
and let's call this negative 10 and all of these are meters per s square
3:45
so we know our acceleration is 9.8 m/s*s so the acceleration
3:49
the entire time over the four seconds
3:54
the acceleration over the four seconds is going to be negative 9.8
3:59
it's gonna be a constant acceleration the entire time
4:03
let's figure out the displacment and velocity,
4:05
let me draw a table here, in one column I will do change in time
4:14
and you can sometime do that as time
4:17
let's figure out what our final velocity is
4:21
I should say the current velocity of velocity at that time
4:25
and in this column I will figure out what displacement is
4:31
and I will do it in time 0 1 2 3 4 so in 0 zero second gone by
4:40
when 1 second has gone by, when 2s 3s 4s has gone by
4:45
Actually let me call it change in time axis
4:47
this is essentially how many seconds it has gone by
4:50
So this is my change in time, let me make it clear that this graph here
4:55
is acceleration graph acceleration I will put it on the screen
5:01
Alright, so let's fill these things out
5:04
so times zero, what is our velocity?
5:09
well if we use this expression right here time zero or delta t equal zero
5:15
this expression right here is gonna be zero, and it's just going to be
5:18
initial velocity, in the last video we gave our initial velocity
5:22
is going to be 19.6m/s, so it is going to be 19.6m/s
5:32
I will plot that over here, time zero, it's going to be 19.6 m/s
5:38
what is our initial displacement at time zero?
5:41
Our change in time zero, so you look at this up here
5:45
delta t is zero so this expression here is going to be zero
5:51
so we haven't done any displacement yet when no time has gone by
5:55
So we have done no displacement, we are right over there
6:01
now what happen after 1s? 1s has gone by
6:05
what is now our velocity? well our initial velocity right here is 19.6m/s
6:12
that was a given, and our acceleration is negative 9.8m/s*s
6:20
so it's negative right over there and you multiply that by delat t
6:24
in every situation, so in this situation we are gonna multiply it by 1
6:28
delta t is 1, so you have 19.6 minus 9.8 that gives exactly 9.8m/s
6:36
and the unit we got cause we multiply here is second
6:40
so its give us meters per second
6:41
19.6m/s minus 9.8m/s one of these seconds go away multiply by second
6:48
give you 9.8m/s so after 1s our velocity is now half of what it was before
6:55
so we are now going 9.8m/s, let me draw a line here
7:01
9.8m/s, now what is our displacement? so you look up here
7:09
Let me rewrite this displacement formular here with all the infomation
7:13
So we know that displacement is going to be equal to initial veloctiy
7:17
which is 19.6m/s
7:21
now I won't write the units here just for the sake of space
7:22
times change in time, times our, use the same color to see what is what
7:28
times our change in time, plus one half let me be clear one half
7:33
times negative 9.8m/s*s so one half times a is going to be
7:40
I rewrite this right over here cause this is gonna be negative 9.8m/s*s
7:45
times one half, so this is going to be negative 4.9
7:50
All I did is one half times negative 9.8 over here
7:57
It is important that is why the vector quantity is start to matter
8:00
because if you put a positive here you wouldn't have the obeject slowing
8:04
down as you went up, because you will have gravity somehow accelerating
8:07
as it went up, but it's actually slowing it down
8:09
it's pulling it, it's accelerating it in downward direction
8:12
so that's why you have a negative right over there,
8:15
that was out convention at the beginning
8:16
of last video, up is positive, down is negative, so let's focus
8:22
So this part right over here, negative 4.9 m/s*s times delat t square
8:27
times delta t, times delta t square, this will make it a little bit easier
8:32
Although it still, let me get the calculator out
8:34
So when one second has past, I let my trusty TI-85 out now
8:42
when 1s past it's 19.6 times 1,
8:46
well that's just 19.6 minus 4.9 times 1 square
8:50
So that's just minus 4.9, mius 4.9, gives us 14.7 meters
8:58
So 14.7 meters So after 1s, the ball has travel 14.7 meters in the air
9:06
So that's roughly over there, now what happen after 2s?
9:12
I'll do the same agenda, so after 2s,
9:15
our velocity is 19.6 minus 9.8 times 2, times 2 this is 2s has gone by
9:23
well 9.8 times 2, 9.8 times 2 square seconds gives us 19.6 m/s
9:32
so these just cancel out, so we get out velocity now is zero
9:36
So after two seconds our velocity now is zero
9:40
let me make it so this thing should more look like a line
9:47
I don't get a sense, so this is let me just draw the line like this
9:51
so our velocity now is zero after 2 seconds
9:55
what is our displacement?
9:57
So literally we at the point with the ball has no velocity
10:01
exactly two seconds, it kind of gone up,
10:04
and right for that exact moment of time it's stationary
10:09
and then what do we have going on in our displacement?
10:13
We have 19.6 let me get the calculator out for this
10:16
We can do it by hand but for the sake of quickness
10:21
19.6 times 2 minus 4.9 times 2s squared, this is 2s squared
10:36
so that's times four, so that gives us 19.6 meters
10:41
So we have 19, we are at 19.6 meters after 2 seconds
10:49
we are 19.6 meters in the air
10:53
now let's go to 3s, so after 3s, our velocity now
11:01
it's 19.6 m/s minus 9.8 times 3, we could do that in our head but just
11:09
verified it for us, let me get the calculator out
11:11
it's 19.6-9.8*3, that gives us 9.8 m/s, negative 9.8m/s
11:24
So after 3s, our velocity is now negative 9.8 m/s, what is that mean?
11:29
it's now going in downward direction, 9.8 m/s,
11:33
so this is our velocity graph, and what is our displacement?
11:39
So once again, let's get the calculator out
11:41
you are getting the hang of this
11:43
at anytime I encourage you to pause it and try it for yourself
11:46
So now what is this is, Okay I'm looking at the displacement
11:53
Our displacment was delta t with 3s 19.6*3 - 4.9 times
12:03
so this is delat t so this is 3s
12:06
we are talking about delat t, our change in time is 3s so that's square
12:10
So times 9 and that gives us 14.7 meters, so 14.7 meters
12:18
So after 3s we are 14.7m again, the same position with 1s
12:24
but the difference is now we are moving downard
12:27
over here we were moving upwards
12:28
and finally what happen after 4s? Or what's our velocity?
12:32
Let me just get the calculator out
12:34
or you might be figure this out in your head
12:36
Our velocity is going to be 19.6 - 9.8 times 4s
12:48
just minus 19.6 m/s
12:55
So we are going a magnitude of velocity which is the same initially
12:59
threw the ball except now it's going at opposite direction
13:02
it's now going downward, so it's now going downward
13:07
and what is our displacement? get the calculator out
13:11
So we have out displacement is 19.6 times 4, 4s has gone by
13:18
minus 4.9 times 4 square which is 16 times, which is equal to zero!
13:27
the displacement here is zero!
13:29
We are back on the ground
13:32
So if you plot the displacement, you will actually got a parabola
13:38
a downward opening parabola that looks something like this
13:41
I best draw it relatively neatly
13:44
So my check to do it better than that
13:46
Dotted line, dotted line is always easier to adjust than its streamed
13:50
so if you plot displacement verses time it look something like this
13:56
it's velocity just downward sloping line, and the acceleration is constant
14:01
and the whole reason why I wanted to this is I wanted to show you
14:05
that velocity the whole time is decreasing at constant rate
14:08
and that make sense because that's the rate which the velocity increases
14:13
and decreases as the acceleration,
14:15
and the acceleration base on our convention is downward
14:19
so that why it's decreasing, we have a negative slope here
14:22
we have a negative slope of negative 9.8 m/s*s
14:28
and just to think about what's happening for this ball
14:32
I know this video is getting long as it goes
14:34
I'm gonna draw the vectors for velocity
14:38
So I'm gonna do that in orange, or maybe I will do that in blue
14:42
So velocity in blue, so right when we start,
14:45
it has a positive velocity of 19.6m/s,
14:49
so I will draw a big vector like this
14:52
19.6m/s that's velocity, but after 1s is 9.8m/s so half of that
14:58
so then its maybe would look something like this
15:01
9.8m/s, then at the speed right over here has the velocity of zero
15:06
then as you go to 3s, the magnitude of the velocity is 9.8m/s
15:12
but it is now downwards, so it looks like this
15:16
and then finally right when it hits the ground,
15:20
right before it hits the ground it has a negative velocity of 19.6m/s
15:26
So it would look like this, roughly like this
15:32
If I use the same scale over here,
15:35
but what was the acceleration the entire time?
15:38
well the entire time the acceleration is negative
15:40
It's 9.8m/s*s I will do that in orange
15:44
So the acceleration over here
15:46
Negative, now I wanna do that in orange
15:48
The acceleration is negative 9.8m/s*s
15:58
The acceleration is constant the entire time
16:02
So last one is negative 9.8m/s*s
16:05
it does not change depending on where you are
16:07
in the curve when you are near the surface of the earth
16:10
So hopefully that clarify the things a little bit and gives you
16:12
what happen when you throw up a projectile into the air","Shouldn't ""g"" be -ve when we throw an object upwards as its going against gravity and +ve when under free fall as it's coming towards the earth?"

Let's write 113.9% as a decimal.
0:06
So percent, this symbol right over here,
0:09
literally means per hundred.
0:10
So this is the same thing as 113.9 per 100,
0:16
which is the same thing as 113.9 divided by 100.
0:22
So essentially, if we want to write this as a decimal,
0:25
we just take a 113.9, and we divide it by 100.
0:29
And to do that, 113.9 divided by 100.
0:33
If you divide by 10, you move the decimal once to the left.
0:36
If you divide by 100, you're moving the decimal twice
0:39
to the left.
0:39
If we're doing it by 1,000, we would go to the left once more.
0:42
10,000, each time you divide by 10,
0:44
you'd go one step to the left, which hopefully makes sense.
0:47
If we were to multiply by 10, we would be moving the decimal
0:49
over to the right, and there are other videos
0:51
that go into far more depth on the intuition behind that.
0:54
But anyway, we're dividing 113.9 by 100,
0:58
so move the decimal two spaces to the left.
1:00
So the decimal will end up right over here.
1:03
So this will be equal to 1.139.
1:08
And we are done.",How do you convert decimal problems to a fraction or a per cent where there is a bar over a digit?
khan_video_U2W7HPyC0cM_27,Science,ESSAY,"•

Let's start again with a point.
0:02
Let's call that point point A. And what I'm curious about
0:05
is all of the points on my screen right over here,
0:08
that are exactly 2 centimeters away from A.
0:11
So 2 centimeters on my screen is about that far.
0:16
So clearly if I start at A and I go
0:17
2 centimeters in that direction, this point right over there,
0:20
is 2 centimeters from A. If I call that point, point B,
0:23
then I could say line segment AB is 2 centimeters.
0:27
The length is 2 centimeters.
0:28
Remember this would refer to the actual line segment.
0:33
I could say this looks nice, but if I talk about its length,
0:36
I would get rid of that line on top
0:37
and I would just say AB is equal to 2.
0:39
If I wanted to put units I could say 2 centimenters.
0:42
But I'm not curious just about B, I want to think about all
0:45
of the points, the set of all of the points
0:47
that are exactly 2 centimeters away from A.
0:51
So I could go 2 centimeters in the other direction,
0:53
maybe get to point C right over here.
0:57
So AC is also going to be equal to 2 centimeters,
1:00
but I could go 2 centimeters in any direction.
1:02
And so if I find the set of all of the points
1:04
that are exactly 2 centimeters away from A,
1:07
I will get a very familiar looking shape, like this,
1:11
and I'm trying to draw it freehand.
1:13
So I would get a shape that looks like this.
1:16
Actually, let me draw it in.
1:17
I don't want to make you think that it's only the points where
1:20
there's white, it's all of these points right over here.
1:22
I don't want to draw a dashed line over there, which maybe I
1:25
should just, let me clear out all of these
1:28
and I'll just draw it as a solid line.
1:31
So this could look something like that.
1:36
My best attempt.
1:38
And this set of all of the points that
1:40
are exactly 2 centimeters away from A,
1:43
this is a circle, as I'm sure you are already familiar with.
1:47
But that is the formal definition-- the set
1:49
of all points that are a fixed distance,
1:51
or that have a fixed distance, from A
1:53
that are a given distance from A.
1:55
If I said the set of all points that are 3 centimeters from A,
1:58
it might look something like this.
2:00
It might look something like that.
2:02
That would give us another circle.
2:06
I think you get the general idea.
2:07
Now what I want to do in this video
2:09
is introduce ourselves into some of the concepts and words
2:14
that we use when dealing with circles.
2:16
So let me get rid of that 3-centimeter circle.
2:18
So first of all, let's think about this distance.
2:22
This distance, or one of these line segments
2:26
that join A, which we would call the center of the circle.
2:30
So we'll call A the center of the circle,
2:32
and it makes sense just from the way
2:33
we use the word center in everyday life.
2:36
What I want to do is think about what line segment AB is.
2:41
AB connects the center and it connects a point on the circle
2:45
itself.
2:46
Remember, the circle itself is all of the points that
2:48
are equal distance from the center.
2:50
So AB, any line segment, I should say,
2:53
that connects the center to a point on the circle,
2:56
we would call a radius.
3:01
And so the length of the radius, AB over here,
3:03
is equal to 2 centimeters.
3:05
And you're probably already familiar with the word radius,
3:07
but I'm just being a little bit more formal.
3:09
And what's interesting about geometry,
3:11
at least when you start learning it at the high school level,
3:13
is it's probably the first class where you're
3:15
introduced into a slightly more formal mathematics, where we're
3:18
a little bit more careful about giving our definitions
3:21
and then building on those definitions
3:23
to come up with interesting results
3:24
and proving to ourselves that we definitely
3:27
know what we think we know.
3:28
And so that's why we're being a little bit more
3:30
careful with our language over here.
3:33
So AB is our radius, line segment AB, and so
3:36
is line segment-- let me draw another point on here,
3:41
let's say this is X-- so line segment AX is also a radius.
3:52
Now you can also have other forms of lines and line
3:55
segments that interact in interesting ways
3:58
with the circle.
3:59
So you could have a line that just intersects
4:02
that circle at exactly one point.
4:05
So let's call that point right over there, let's call that D.
4:08
And let's say you have a line, and the only point
4:12
on the circle-- the only point in the set of all of the points
4:16
that are equal distant from A, the only point on that circle
4:19
that is also on that line is point D.
4:22
And we could call that line l.
4:25
So sometimes you'll see lines specified
4:27
by some of the points on them.
4:29
So for example, if I had another point right over here called E,
4:32
we could call this line line DE, or we could just
4:37
put a little script letter here with an l
4:39
and say this is line l.
4:41
But this line that only has one point in common
4:44
with our circle, we call this a tangent line.
4:47
So line l is a tangent.
4:49
It is tangent to the circle.
4:54
So let me write it this way, line l
4:58
is tangent-- you normally wouldn't write it
5:01
in caps like this, I'm just doing
5:02
that for emphasis-- is tangent to-- instead of writing
5:06
the circle centered at A, you'll sometimes
5:09
see this notation-- to the circle centered at A.
5:13
So this tells us that this is the circle we're talking about.
5:15
Because who knows, maybe we had another circle over here
5:18
that is centered at M, another circle.
5:21
So we have to specify it's not tangent to that one,
5:23
it's tangent to this one.
5:24
So this circle with a dot in the middle
5:26
tells we're talking about a circle,
5:28
and this is a circle centered at point
5:30
A. I want to be very clear, point A is not on the circle,
5:33
point A is the center of the circle.
5:35
The points on the circle are the points equal distant
5:38
from point A. Now, l is tangent, because it only
5:42
intersects the circle in one point.
5:44
You could just as easily imagine a line
5:48
that intersects the circle at two points.
5:51
So we could call, maybe this is F and this is G,
5:55
you could call that line FG.
5:58
So we could write it like this, line FG.
6:01
And this line that intersects it at two points,
6:03
we call this a secant of circle A.
6:09
It is a secant line to this circle right over here,
6:14
because it intersects it in two points.
6:16
Now, if FG was just a segment, if it
6:19
didn't keep on going forever, like lines like to do,
6:22
if we only spoke about this line segment--
6:25
let me do this in a new color-- if we only spoke
6:28
about this line segment between F and G,
6:32
and not thinking about going on forever, then all of a sudden
6:35
we have a line segment, which we would specify there.
6:38
And we would call this a chord of the circle,
6:43
a chord of circle A. It starts at a point on the circle,
6:49
a point that is exactly in this case 2 centimeters away,
6:52
and then it finishes at a point on the circle.
6:54
So it connects two points on the circle.
6:58
Now, you could have chords like this,
7:00
and you can also have a chord, as you can imagine,
7:02
a chord that actually goes through the center
7:04
of the circle.
7:06
So let's call this point, point H,
7:09
and you have a straight line connecting F to H through A.
7:14
So that's about as straight as I could draw it.
7:16
So if you have a chord like that,
7:20
that contains the actual center of the circle,
7:23
of course it goes from one point of the circle
7:25
to another point of the circle, and it goes
7:26
through the center of the circle,
7:28
we call that a diameter of A.
7:39
And you've probably seen this in tons of problems
7:42
before, when we were not talking about geometry as formally,
7:46
but the diameter is made up of exactly two radiuses.
7:51
We already know that a radius connects a point to the center.
7:54
So you have one radius right over here
7:56
that connects F and A, that's one radius,
8:00
and then you have another radius connecting
8:02
A and H, the center to a point on the circle.
8:05
So the diameter is made up of these two radiuses,
8:07
or radii I should call it, I think
8:09
that's the plural for radius.
8:11
And so the length of a diameter is
8:13
going to be twice the length of a radius.
8:15
So we could say the length of the diameter, so the length
8:19
of FH-- and once again I don't put the line on top of it
8:22
when I'm just talking about the length--
8:24
is going to be equal to FA, the length of segment
8:28
FA, plus the length of segment AH.
8:34
Now there's one last thing I want
8:36
to talk about when we're dealing with circles,
8:38
and that's the idea of an arc.
8:40
So we also have the parts of the circle itself.
8:43
So let me draw another circle over here.
8:46
Let's center this circle right over here at B.
8:49
And I'm going to find all of the points that
8:52
are a given distance from B. So it has some radius,
8:56
I'm not going to specify it right over here,
8:59
and let me pick some random points on the circle.
9:01
So let's call this J, let's call that K, let's call this S,
9:10
let's call this T, let's call this U right over here.
9:14
And I know it doesn't look that centered, let me try to center
9:16
B a little bit better.
9:17
Let me erase that.
9:19
And if I put B a little bit closer
9:21
to the center of the circle, so that's my best shot, so let's
9:25
put B right over there.
9:27
Now, one interesting thing is, what do you
9:29
call the length of the circle that goes between two points?
9:33
So what would you call-- let me get a good color here--
9:37
what would you call this?
9:38
Well, you could imagine in everyday language
9:40
we would call something that looks like that an arc,
9:41
and we would also call that an arc in geometry.
9:44
To specify this arc we would call
9:46
this JK, the two endpoints of the arc,
9:50
the two points on the circle that
9:51
are the endpoints of the arc, and you
9:53
use a little notation like that.
9:55
So you put a little curve on top instead of a straight line.
9:59
Now you could also have another arc that connects JK,
10:01
this is the minor arc.
10:03
It is the shortest way along the circle to connect J and K,
10:06
but you could also go the other way around.
10:08
You could also have this thing that
10:10
goes all the way around the circle.
10:13
And we would call that the major arc.
10:15
And normally when you specify a major arc, just
10:17
to show that you're going the long way around,
10:21
it's not the shortest way to get between J and K,
10:23
you'll often specify another point
10:24
that you're going through.
10:25
So for example, this major arc we could specify we start at J,
10:30
we went through-- we could have said U, T, or S,
10:32
but I'll put T right over there-- we went through T
10:34
and then we went all the way to K.
10:37
And so this specifies the major arc
10:40
and this thing could have been the same thing as if I wrote
10:42
JUK, these are specifying the same thing, or JSK.
10:48
So there's multiple ways to specify this major arc
10:51
right over here.
10:51
But the one thing I make clear is,
10:53
is that the minor arc is the shortest distance,
10:56
so this is the minor arc, and the longer distance around
11:01
is the major arc.
11:06
And I'll leave you there and maybe the next few videos we'll
11:09
start playing with some of this notation a little bit more.",Wouldn't the ends of the line segment have to be specially shaped so that they could not go beyond the circle and not have some space?

couldn't protect the Papal States anymore.

Let's learn a little bit about the law of large numbers, which
0:08
is on many levels, one of the most intuitive laws in
0:11
mathematics and in probability theory.
0:14
But because it's so applicable to so many things, it's often a
0:18
misused law or sometimes, slightly misunderstood.
0:22
So just to be a little bit formal in our mathematics, let
0:26
me just define it for you first and then we'll talk a little
0:28
bit about the intuition.
0:29
So let's say I have a random variable, X.
0:33
And we know its expected value or its population mean.
0:38
The law of large numbers just says that if we take a sample
0:41
of n observations of our random variable, and if we were
0:46
to average all of those observations-- and let me
0:49
define another variable.
0:50
Let's call that x sub n with a line on top of it.
0:54
This is the mean of n observations of our
0:56
random variable.
0:57
So it's literally this is my first observation.
1:00
So you can kind of say I run the experiment once and I get
1:03
this observation and I run it again, I get that observation.
1:07
And I keep running it n times and then I divide by my
1:11
number of observations.
1:12
So this is my sample mean.
1:14
This is the mean of all the observations I've made.
1:17
The law of large numbers just tells us that my sample mean
1:23
will approach my expected value of the random variable.
1:27
Or I could also write it as my sample mean will approach my
1:32
population mean for n approaching infinity.
1:39
And I'll be a little informal with what does approach or
1:43
what does convergence mean?
1:44
But I think you have the general intuitive sense that if
1:46
I take a large enough sample here that I'm going to end up
1:50
getting the expected value of the population as a whole.
1:54
And I think to a lot of us that's kind of intuitive.
1:56
That if I do enough trials that over large samples, the trials
2:01
would kind of give me the numbers that I would expect
2:04
given the expected value and the probability and all that.
2:06
But I think it's often a little bit misunderstood in terms
2:09
of why that happens.
2:10
And before I go into that let me give you
2:13
a particular example.
2:15
The law of large numbers will just tell us that-- let's say I
2:17
have a random variable-- X is equal to the number of heads
2:24
after 100 tosses of a fair coin-- tosses or flips
2:30
of a fair coin.
2:36
First of all, we know what the expected value of
2:37
this random variable is.
2:39
It's the number of tosses, the number of trials times
2:43
the probabilities of success of any trial.
2:46
So that's equal to 50.
2:49
So the law of large numbers just says if I were to take a
2:53
sample or if I were to average the sample of a bunch of these
2:57
trials, so you know, I get-- my first time I run this trial I
3:03
flip 100 coins or have 100 coins in a shoe box and I shake
3:06
the shoe box and I count the number of heads, and I get 55.
3:10
So that Would be X1.
3:11
Then I shake the box again and I get 65.
3:15
Then I shake the box again and I get 45.
3:18
And I do this n times and then I divide it by the number
3:22
of times I did it.
3:24
The law of large numbers just tells us that this the
3:27
average-- the average of all of my observations, is going
3:31
to converge to 50 as n approaches infinity.
3:38
Or for n approaching 50.
3:40
I'm sorry, n approaching infinity.
3:42
And I want to talk a little bit about why this happens
3:45
or intuitively why this is.
3:47
A lot of people kind of feel that oh, this means that if
3:50
after 100 trials that if I'm above the average that somehow
3:54
the laws of probability are going to give me more heads
3:57
or fewer heads to kind of make up the difference.
4:00
That's not quite what's going to happen.
4:01
That's often called the gambler's fallacy.
4:04
Let me differentiate.
4:05
And I'll use this example.
4:06
So let's say-- let me make a graph.
4:08
And I'll switch colors.
4:23
This is n, my x-axis is n.
4:25
This is the number of trials I take.
4:27
And my y-axis, let me make that the sample mean.
4:32
And we know what the expected value is, we know the expected
4:36
value of this random variable is 50.
4:39
Let me draw that here.
4:42
This is 50.
4:47
So just going to the example I did.
4:49
So when n is equal to-- let me just [INAUDIBLE]
4:53
here.
4:54
So my first trial I got 55 and so that was my average.
4:59
I only had one data point.
5:00
Then after two trials, let's see, then I have 65.
5:04
And so my average is going to be 65 plus 55 divided by 2.
5:09
which is 60.
5:10
So then my average went up a little bit.
5:13
Then I had a 45, which will bring my average
5:15
down a little bit.
5:16
I won't plot a 45 here.
5:18
Now I have to average all of these out.
5:19
What's 45 plus 65?
5:22
Let me actually just get the number just
5:23
so you get the point.
5:24
So it's 55 plus 65.
5:28
It's 120 plus 45 is 165.
5:32
Divided by 3.
5:36
3 goes into 165 5-- 5 times 3 is 15.
5:39
It's 53.
5:42
No, no, no.
5:43
55.
5:45
So the average goes down back down to 55.
5:46
And we could keep doing these trials.
5:49
So you might say that the law of large numbers tell this,
5:51
OK, after we've done 3 trials and our average is there.
5:56
So a lot of people think that somehow the gods of probability
6:00
are going to make it more likely that we get fewer
6:02
heads in the future.
6:03
That somehow the next couple of trials are going to have to
6:06
be down here in order to bring our average down.
6:09
And that's not necessarily the case.
6:10
Going forward the probabilities are always the same.
6:13
The probabilities are always 50% that I'm
6:15
going to get heads.
6:16
It's not like if I had a bunch of heads to start off with or
6:19
more than I would have expected to start off with, that all of
6:22
a sudden things would be made up and I would get more tails.
6:25
That would the gambler's fallacy.
6:27
That if you have a long streak of heads or you have a
6:29
disproportionate number of heads, that at some point
6:32
you're going to have-- you have a higher likelihood of having a
6:35
disproportionate number of tails.
6:37
And that's not quite true.
6:38
What the law of large numbers tells us is that it doesn't
6:41
care-- let's say after some finite number of trials your
6:45
average actually-- it's a low probability of this happening,
6:48
but let's say your average is actually up here.
6:50
Is actually at 70.
6:52
You're like, wow, we really diverged a good bit from
6:56
the expected value.
6:57
But what the law of large numbers says, well, I don't
6:58
care how many trials this is.
7:00
We have an infinite number of trials left.
7:03
And the expected value for that infinite number of trials,
7:06
especially in this type of situation is going to be this.
7:11
So when you average a finite number that averages out to
7:15
some high number, and then an infinite number that's going to
7:18
converge to this, you're going to over time, converge back
7:22
to the expected value.
7:24
And that was a very informal way of describing it, but
7:27
that's what the law or large numbers tells you.
7:29
And it's an important thing.
7:30
It's not telling you that if you get a bunch of heads that
7:33
somehow the probability of getting tails is going
7:36
to increase to kind of make up for the heads.
7:38
What it's telling you is, is that no matter what happened
7:41
over a finite number of trials, no matter what the average is
7:44
over a finite number of trials, you have an infinite
7:46
number of trials left.
7:47
And if you do enough of them it's going to converge back
7:51
to your expected value.
7:52
And this is an important thing to think about.
7:54
But this isn't used in practice every day with the lottery and
7:57
with casinos because they know that if you do large enough
8:02
samples-- and we could even calculate-- if you do large
8:04
enough samples, what's the probability that things
8:07
deviate significantly?
8:09
But casinos and the lottery every day operate on this
8:12
principle that if you take enough people-- sure, in the
8:15
short-term or with a few samples, a couple people
8:18
might beat the house.
8:19
But over the long-term the house is always going to win
8:22
because of the parameters of the games that they're
8:24
making you play.
8:25
Anyway, this is an important thing in probability and I
8:28
think it's fairly intuitive.
8:29
Although, sometimes when you see it formally explained like
8:32
this with the random variables and that it's a little
8:34
bit confusing.
8:34
All it's saying is that as you take more and more samples, the
8:39
average of that sample is going to approximate the
8:44
true average.
8:45
Or I should be a little bit more particular.
8:47
The mean of your sample is going to converge to the true
8:51
mean of the population or to the expected value of
8:54
the random variable.
8:56

- [Instructor] I'm going to construct a sequence.
0:02
We're going to start with some number.
0:04
Let's say I start with the number, a.
0:05
And then each successive term of the sequence,
0:08
I'm going to multiply the,
0:09
to get each successive term of the sequence,
0:11
I'm going to muliply the previous term
0:13
by some fixed non-zero number,
0:16
and I'm going to call that r.
0:17
So the next term is going to be a,
0:19
is going to be a times r.
0:22
And then the term after that,
0:24
I'm going to multipy this thing times r.
0:27
So it's going to be a,
0:28
if you multiply ar times r,
0:30
that's going to be ar-squared.
0:34
And then if you were going to multiply this term times r,
0:38
you would get a times r to the third power.
0:43
And you could keep going on and on and on and on.
0:46
And this type of sequence or this type of progression
0:49

So you start with some first value,
1:05
and then to get each successive term,
1:08
you multiply by this fixed number.
1:10
In this case, this fixed number is r.
1:13
And so we call r, our common ratio.

and divide this term by this term right over here,
1:28
ar to the third, divided by ar-squared.
1:31
So if you find the ratio between these two things.
1:34
Let me rewrite this in the same colors.
1:36
So if you took ar to the third power,
1:40
and were to divide it by the term before it.
1:43
So if you were to divide it by ar-squared,
1:47
what are you going to be left with?
1:49
Well a divided by a is one,
1:51
r to the third divided by r-squared is just going to be r.
1:55
And this is true if you divide any term
1:57
by the term before it.
1:59
Or if you find the ratio between any term
2:02
and the term before it,
2:02
it's going to be r.
2:04
And so that's why it's called a common ratio.
2:07
And so let's look at some examples of geometric sequences.
2:11
So if I start with the number,
2:13
if I start with the number five, so my a is five
2:17
and then each time I'm going to multiply,
2:20
I'm going to multiply by, I don't know.
2:23
Let's say I multiply by 1/7.
2:25
So then the next term is going to be five over seven.
2:32
What's the next term going to be?
2:34
Well, I'm going to multiply this thing times 1/7.
2:37
So that's going to be 5/7 times 1/7 is 5/49.
2:41
So it's going to be five over seven-squared or 49.
2:47
If I were to multiply this times 1/7,
2:49
what am I going to get?
2:51
I'll just change the notation.
2:52
I'll get five times,
2:55
I don't actually know in my head
2:56
what seven to the third power is,
2:57
I guess I could calculate it, 280 plus 63,
3:03
let's see, so that would be
3:04
let's see seven times 40 is 280,
3:06
seven times nine is 63,
3:09
so you're going to get to 343, I believe.
3:13
Let me see, did I do that right?
3:15
Seven times 280,
3:17
plus 63 is 343,
3:20
and you can just keep going.
3:22
So this right over here is an example
3:24
of a geometric,
3:26
of a geometric sequence.
3:28
Started with some first value
3:30
and each successive value, I multiplied by 1/7.
3:33
1/7 is the common ratio here.
3:36
Let me give you another one.
3:38
Let's say I have this,
3:40
let's say I have three and then let's say I have six,
3:45
and let's say I have 12.
3:48
Then I have 24,
3:51
then I have 48.
3:53
Is this a geometric series?
3:55
And if it is, what is the common ratio here?
3:59
Well you could figure out the common ratio
4:01
by just taking any two successive terms and dividing.
4:04
Well first, you could try it with two terms.
4:07
A 12 divided by six is two.
4:10
So we have to multiply by two.
4:12
To go from 12 to 24, you multipled by two.
4:15
To go from 24 to 48, you have to multiply by two.
4:19
To go from three to six, we have to multiply by two.
4:21
So you get a fixed common ratio.
4:22
For any of these terms, if we multiplied by two
4:25
and say multiplied by three,
4:27
and so we didn't multiply by the same thing,
4:29
then it wouldn't be a geometric sequence anymore.
4:34
So this clearly is a geometric sequence,
4:36
I forgot to mention that.",isnt a harmonic progression a type of arithmetic progression?
khan_video_WScwPIPqZa0_200,Social Studies,MCQ,"•
0:00
Let's say I have a balloon.
0:03
And in that balloon I have a bunch of
0:05
particles bouncing around.
0:07
They're gas particles, so they're floating freely.
0:10
And they each have some velocity, some kinetic energy.
0:17
And what I care about, let me just draw a few more, what I
0:23
care about is the pressure that is exerted on the surface
0:27
of the balloon.
0:28
So I care about the pressure.
0:29
And what's pressure?
0:30
It's force per area.
0:36
So the area here, you can think of it as the inside
0:39
surface of the balloon.
0:40
And what's going to apply force to that?
0:42
Well any given moment-- I only drew six particles here, but
0:46
in a real balloon you would have gazillions of particles,
0:50
and we could talk about how large, but more particles than
0:54
you can really probably imagine-- but at any given
0:57
moment, some of those particles are bouncing off the
0:59
wall of the container.
1:01
That particle is bouncing there, this particle is
1:03
bouncing there, this guy's bouncing like that.
1:06
And when they bounce, they apply force to the container.
1:10
An outward force, that's what keeps the balloon blown up.
1:14
So think about what the pressure is going to be
1:16
dependent on.
1:18
So first of all, the faster these particles move, the
1:22
higher the pressure.
1:31
Slower particles, you're going to be bouncing into the
1:34
container less, and when you do bounce into the container,
1:37
it's going to be less of a ricochet, or less of a change
1:40
in momentum.
1:41
So slower particles, you're going to
1:45
have pressure go down.
1:47
Now, it's practically impossible to measure the
1:50
kinetic energy, or the velocity, or the direction of
1:53
each individual particle.
1:55
Especially when you have gazillions
1:56
of them in a balloon.
1:57
So we do is we think of the average
2:00
energy of the particles.
2:01
And the average energy of the particles, you might say oh,
2:04
Sal is about to introduce us to a new concept.
2:08
It's a new way of looking at probably a very familiar
2:11
concept to you.
2:12
And that's temperature.
2:14
Temperature can and should be viewed as the average energy
2:18
of the particles in the system.
2:20
So I'll put a little squiggly line, because there's a lot of
2:23
ways to think about it.
2:24
Average energy.
2:28
And mostly kinetic energy, because these particles are
2:31
moving and bouncing.
2:32
The higher the temperature, the faster that these
2:35
particles move.
2:36
And the more that they're going to bounce into the side
2:40
of the container.
2:41
But temperature is average energy.
2:44
It tells us energy per particle.
2:52
So obviously, if we only had one particle in there with
2:57
super high temperature, that's going to have less pressure
3:00
than if we have a million particles in there.
3:02
Let me draw that.
3:05
If I have, let's take two cases right here.
3:12
One is, I have a bunch of particles with a certain
3:16
temperature, moving in their different directions.
3:22
And the other example, I have one particle.
3:25
And maybe they have the same temperature.
3:27
That on average, they have the same kinetic energy.
3:29
The kinetic energy per particle is the same.
3:32
Clearly, this one is going to be applying more pressure to
3:35
its container, because at any given moment more of these
3:38
particles are going to be bouncing off the side than in
3:40
this example.
3:41
This guy's going to bounce, bam, then going to go and
3:43
move, bounce, bam.
3:44
So he's going to be applying less pressure, even though his
3:46
temperature might be the same.
3:47
Because temperature is kinetic energy, or you can view it as
3:51
kinetic energy per particles.
3:53
Or it's a way of looking at kinetic energy per particle.
3:55
So if we wanted to look at the total energy in the system, we
3:59
would want to multiply the temperature times the number
4:04
of particles.
4:05
And just since we're dealing on the molecular scale, the
4:08
number of particles can often be represented as moles.
4:11
Remember, moles is just a number of particles.
4:13
So we're saying that that pressure-- well, I'll say it's
4:19
proportional, so it's equal to some constant,
4:26
let's call that R.
4:29
Because we've got to make all the units work out in the end.
4:31
I mean temperature is in Kelvin but we eventually want
4:33
to get back to joules.
4:34
So let's just say it's equal to some constant, or it's
4:36
proportional to temperature times the number of particles.
4:41
And we can do that a bunch of ways.
4:43
But let's think of that in moles.
4:44
If I say there are 5 mole particles there, you know
4:47
that's 5 times 6 times 10 to the 23 particles.
4:50
So, this is the number of particles.
4:55
This is the temperature.
4:57
And this is just some constant.
5:02
Now, what else is the pressure dependent on?
5:04
We gave these two examples.
5:06
Obviously, it is dependent on the temperature; the faster
5:08
each of these particles move, the higher pressure we'll
5:10
have. It's also dependent on the number of particles, the
5:13
more particles we have, the more pressure we'll have. What
5:16
about the size of the container?
5:18
The volume of the container.
5:20
If we took this example, but we shrunk the container
5:23
somehow, maybe by pressing on the outside.
5:26
So if this container looked like this, but we still had
5:29
the same four particles in it, with the same average kinetic
5:37
energy, or the same temperature.
5:39
So the number of particles stays the same, the
5:41
temperature is the same, but the volume has gone down.
5:44
Now, these guys are going to bump into the sides of the
5:47
container more frequently and there's less area.
5:50
So at any given moment, you have more force and less area.
5:54
So when you have more force and less area, your pressure
5:56
is going to go up.
5:57
So when the volume went down, your pressure went up.
6:08
So we could say that pressure is inversely
6:10
proportional to volume.
6:12
So let's think about that.
6:13
Let's put that into our equation.
6:15
We said that pressure is proportional-- and I'm just
6:22
saying some proportionality constant, let's call that R,
6:26
to the number of particles times the temperature, this
6:31
gives us the total energy.
6:32
And it's inversely proportional to the volume.
6:36
And if we multiply both sides of this times the volume, we
6:39
get the pressure times the volume is proportional to the
6:46
number of particles times the temperature.
6:49
So PV is equal to RnT.
6:51
And just to switch this around a little bit, so it's in a
6:53
form that you're more likely to see in your chemistry book,
6:56
if we just switch the n and the R term.
6:58
You get pressure times volume is equal to n, the number of
7:03
particles you have, times some constant times temperature.
7:08
And this right here is the ideal gas equation.
7:14
Hopefully, it makes some sense to you.
7:21
When they say ideal gas, it's based on this little mental
7:25
exercise I did to come up with this.
7:27
I made some implicit assumptions when I did this.
7:30
One is I assumed that we're dealing with an ideal gas.
7:35
And so you say what, Sal, is an ideal gas?
7:38
An ideal gas is one where the molecules are not too
7:43
concerned with each other.
7:44
They're just concerned with their own kinetic energy and
7:46
bouncing off the wall.
7:47
So they don't attract or repel each other.
7:56
Let's say they attracted each other, then as you increased
7:59
the number of particles maybe they'd want to
8:01
not go to the side.
8:02
Maybe they'd all gravitate towards the center a little
8:04
bit more if they did attract each other.
8:06
And if they did that, they would bounce into the walls
8:08
less and the pressure would be a little bit lower.
8:10
So we're assuming that they don't attract
8:11
or repel each other.
8:13
And we're also assuming that the actual volume of the
8:17
individual particles are inconsequential.
8:20
Which is a pretty good assumption, because they're
8:22
pretty small.
8:22
Although, if you start putting a ton of particles into a
8:28
certain volume, then at some point, especially if they're
8:31
big molecules, it'll start to matter in terms of their size.
8:34
But we're assuming for the purposes of our little mental
8:37
exercise that the molecules have inconsequential volumes
8:43
and they don't attract or repel each other.
8:45
And in that situation, we can apply the ideal gas equation
8:50
right here.
8:52
Now, we've established the ideal gas equation.
8:54
But you're like, well what's R, how do I deal with it, and
8:56
how do I do math problems, and solve chemistry
8:59
problems with it?
8:59
And how do the units all work out?
9:01
We'll do all of that in the next video where we'll solve a
9:03
ton of equations, or a ton of exercises with
9:06
the ideal gas equation.
9:08
The important takeaway from this video is just to have the
9:12
intuition as to why this actually does make sense.
9:15
And frankly, once you have this intution, you should
9:17
never forget it.
9:17
You should be able to maybe even derive it on your own.","What is ""R"" in the ideal gas law?"

We're asked, what is the prime factorization of 36?
0:04
Let me get my little scratch paper out.
0:07
So the prime factorization of 36.
0:11
So let's start with the smallest prime number we know,
0:14
and that is 2.
0:15
And think about, does 2 go into 36?
0:17
Well, sure, it does.
0:18
36 is 2 times 18.
0:21
So we can write that down.
0:22
36 is 2 times 18.
0:27
So now we have 36 as a product of a prime number,
0:30
and 18 is clearly a composite number.
0:32
It has factors other than 1 and 18.
0:35
So let's try to factor this further.
0:37
So is this divisible by 2?
0:39
Sure.
0:40
18 is 2 times 9.
0:46
So now 9 is a composite number that we haven't fully factored.
0:49
Obviously, the 2's are both prime.
0:51
9 is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 3.
0:55
9 is 3 times 3.
0:59
So we can say that 36 is equal to 2 times 2 times 3 times 3.
1:08
This is its prime factorization.
1:10
All of these numbers are prime.
1:12
So now let's input that to make sure we got it right.
1:17
2 times 2 times 3 times 3.
1:22
And you can check yourself.
1:23
If you have the product of numbers that are all prime
1:26
and the product actually is 36, you have successfully
1:29
prime factorized the number.
1:32
Let's do a couple more of these.
1:35
What is the prime factorization of 30?
1:37
So I'll get my scratch paper out again.
1:39
So we'll do the same process.
1:41
So 30-- well, it's divisible by 2.
1:44
So we can write that as 2 times 15.
1:48
15 isn't divisible by 2.
1:50
But it is divisible by 3.
1:52
It's the same thing as 3 times 5.
1:56
And both 3 and 5 are prime numbers.
1:58
They are only divisible by 1 and themselves.
2:01
So the prime factorization of 30 is 2 times 3 times 5.
2:07
Let's enter that in.
2:09
So it is 2 times 3 times 5.
2:15
Let's do one more of these.
2:19
What is the prime factorization of 73?
2:22
Now, 73 is interesting.
2:26
I'll get my scratch paper out for this.
2:28
We could try to factor 73.
2:31
So you might try 2.
2:32
Well, this is clearly an odd number.
2:33
So 2 isn't going to be divisible into 73.
2:35
You might try 3.
2:37
You would immediately see, well, 3 is divisible into 72.
2:39
If you divide into 73, you have a remainder of 1.
2:42
Well, 4 isn't a prime number, so we wouldn't even try.
2:45
5 isn't divisible into 73.
2:46
It doesn't end in a 5 or 0.
2:49
7 is not divisible into 73.
2:52
7 goes into 70, so you'd have a remainder of 3.
2:55
11 isn't divisible into 73.
2:57
It's divisible into 66 or 77, so not 73.
3:02
As I test more and more numbers, it
3:04
doesn't look like there's any easy thing that
3:07
divides into 73.
3:10
So I'm willing to go with 73 itself is a prime number.
3:15
So this is its prime factorization.
3:18
It's just 73.
3:19
So let's write that down.
3:21
So the answer here, let's just write 73.
3:24
And you don't want to write 1 times 73,
3:25
because 1 is not a prime number.
3:28
Remember, 1 only has one factor, itself.
3:34
A prime number has two factors, 1 and itself.
3:37
Two different prime factors-- 1 and itself.
3:39
And itself is not one.
3:41
So we just want to write prime numbers here.
3:43
73 is a prime number.
3:44
Let's check our answer.
3:46
And we got it right.",how can i get the prime factorization of a large number like 69 without using a calculator?

0:00
I've now done a bunch of videos on thermodynamics, both
0:04
in the chemistry and the physics playlist, and I
0:07
realized that I have yet to give you, or at least if my
0:09
memory serves me correctly, I have yet to give you the first
0:12
law of thermodynamics.
0:13
And I think now is as good a time as any.
0:17
The first law of thermodynamics.
0:24
And it's a good one.
0:26
It tells us that energy-- I'll do it in this magenta color--
0:32
energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be
0:38
transformed from one form or another.
0:41
So energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
0:56
So let's think about a couple of examples of this.
0:59
And we've touched on this when we learned mechanics and
1:02
kinetics in our physics playlist, and we've done a
1:07
bunch of this in the chemistry playlist as well.
1:10
So let's say I have some rock that I just throw as fast as I
1:15
can straight up.
1:17
Maybe it's a ball of some kind.
1:19
So I throw a ball straight up.
1:21
That arrow represents its velocity vector, right?
1:24
it's going to go up in the air.
1:25
Let me do it here.
1:27
I throw a ball and it's going to go up in the air.
1:29
It's going to decelerate due to gravity.
1:31
And at some point, up here, the ball is not going to have
1:35
any velocity.
1:36
So at this point it's going to slow down a little bit, at
1:39
this point it's going to slow down a little bit more.
1:41
And at this point it's going to be completely stationary
1:42
and then it's going to start accelerating downwards.
1:45
In fact, it was always accelerating downwards.
1:46
It was decelerating upwards, and then it'll start
1:49
accelerating downwards.
1:50
So here its velocity will look like that.
1:52
And here its velocity will look like that.
1:53
Then right when it gets back to the ground, if we assume
1:56
negligible air resistance, its velocity will be the same
1:59
magnitude as the upward but in the downward direction.
2:03
So when we looked at this example, and we've done this
2:05
tons in the projectile motion videos in the physics
2:09
playlist, over here we said, look, we have some kinetic
2:13
energy here.
2:13
And that makes sense.
2:14
I think, to all of us, energy intuitively means that you're
2:18
doing something.
2:19
So kinetic energy.
2:21
Energy of movement, of kinetics.
2:23
It's moving, so it has energy.
2:25
But then as we decelerate up here, we clearly have no
2:29
kinetic energy, zero kinetic energy.
2:34
So where did our energy go?
2:35
I just told you the first law of thermodynamics, that energy
2:38
cannot be created or destroyed.
2:40
But I clearly had a lot of kinetic energy over here, and
2:43
we've seen the formula for that multiple times, and here
2:46
I have no kinetic energy.
2:48
So I clearly destroyed kinetic energy, but the first law of
2:53
thermodynamics tells me that I can't do that.
2:55
So I must have transformed that kinetic energy.
2:58
I must have transformed that kinetic energy
3:00
into something else.
3:01
And in the case of this ball, I've transformed it into
3:04
potential energy.
3:05
So now I have potential energy.
3:08
And I won't go into the math of it, but potential energy is
3:10
just the potential to turn into other forms of energy.
3:17
I guess that's the easy way to do it.
3:18
But the way to think about it is, look, the ball is really
3:20
high up here, and by virtue of its position in the universe,
3:24
if something doesn't stop it, it's going to fall back down,
3:28
or it's going to be converted into another form of energy.
3:30
Now let me ask you another question.
3:32
Let's say I throw this ball up and let's say we actually do
3:34
have some air resistance.
3:36
So I throw the ball up.
3:38
I have a lot of kinetic energy here.
3:41
Then at the peak of where the ball is, it's all potential
3:46
energy, the kinetic energy has disappeared.
3:49
And let's say I have air resistance.
3:50
So when the ball comes back down, the air was kind of
3:53
slowing it down, so when it reaches this bottom point,
3:57
it's not going as fast as I threw it.
4:01
So when I reach this bottom point here, my ball is going a
4:04
lot slower than I threw it up to begin with.
4:07
And so if you think about what happened, I have a lot of
4:09
kinetic energy here.
4:10
I'll give you the formula.
4:11
The kinetic energy is the mass of the ball, times the
4:14
velocity of the ball, squared, over 2.
4:17
That's the kinetic energy over here.
4:19
And then I throw it.
4:20
It all turns into potential energy.
4:22
Then it comes back down, and turns into kinetic energy.
4:24
But because of air resistance, I have a
4:26
smaller velocity here.
4:28
I have a smaller velocity than I did there.
4:31
Kinetic energy is only dependent on the magnitude of
4:33
the velocity.
4:34
I could put a little absolute sign there to show that we're
4:37
dealing with the magnitude of the velocity.
4:39
So I clearly have a lower kinetic energy here.
4:42
So lower kinetic energy here than I did here, right?
4:50
And I don't have any potential energy left.
4:52
Let's say this is the ground.
4:54
We've hit the ground.
4:55
So I have another conundrum.
4:57
You know, when I went from kinetic energy to no kinetic
5:00
energy there, I can go to the first law and
5:02
say, oh, what happened?
5:03
And the first law says, oh, Sal, it all turned into
5:05
potential energy up here.
5:07
And you saw it turned into potential energy because when
5:09
the ball accelerated back down, it turned back into
5:12
kinetic energy.
5:12
But then I say, no, Mr. First Law of Thermodynamics, look,
5:17
at this point I have no potential energy, and I had
5:20
all kinetic energy and I had a lot of kinetic energy.
5:22
Now at this point, I have no potential energy once again,
5:26
but I have less kinetic energy.
5:27
My ball has fallen at a slower rate than I
5:30
threw it to begin with.
5:31
And the thermodynamics says, oh, well that's
5:33
because you have air.
5:34
And I'd say, well I do have air, but where
5:36
did the energy go?
5:37
And then the first law of thermodynamics says, oh, when
5:41
your ball was falling-- let me see, that's the ball.
5:47
Let me make the ball yellow.
5:50
So when your ball was falling, it was rubbing
5:52
up against air particles.
5:54
It was rubbing up against molecules of air.
5:59
And right where the molecules bumped into the wall, there's
6:02
a little bit of friction.
6:04
Friction is just essentially, your ball made these molecules
6:08
that it was bumping into vibrate a little bit faster.
6:11
And essentially, if you think about it, if you go back to
6:13
the macrostate/ microstate problem or descriptions that
6:16
we talked about, this ball is essentially transferring its
6:20
kinetic energy to the molecules of air that it rubs
6:24
up against as it falls back down.
6:26
And actually it was doing it on the way up as well.
6:28
And so that kinetic energy that you think you lost or you
6:32
destroyed at the bottom, of here, because your ball's
6:34
going a lot slower, was actually transferred to a lot
6:36
of air particles.
6:38
It was a lot of-- to a bunch of air particles.
6:41
Now, it's next to impossible to measure exactly the kinetic
6:45
energy that was done on each individual air particle,
6:47
because we don't even know what their microstates were to
6:49
begin with.
6:50
But what we can say is, in general I transferred some
6:53
heat to these particles.
6:56
I raised the temperature of the air particles that the
7:01
ball fell through by rubbing those particles or giving them
7:05
kinetic energy.
7:06
Remember, temperature is just a measure of kinetic-- and
7:10
temperature is a macrostate or kind of a gross way or a macro
7:14
way, of looking at the kinetic energy of
7:17
the individual molecules.
7:18
It's very hard to measure each of theirs, but if you say on
7:21
average their kinetic energy is x, you're essentially
7:22
giving an indication of temperature.
7:24
So that's where it went.
7:25
It went to heat.
7:27
And heat is another form of energy.
7:29
So that the first law of thermodynamics
7:30
says, I still hold.
7:32
You had a lot of kinetic energy, turned into potential,
7:36
that turned into less kinetic energy.
7:37
And where did the remainder go?
7:39
It turned into heat.
7:40
Because it transferred that kinetic energy to these air
7:44
particles in the surrounding medium.
7:47
Fair enough.
7:49
So now that we have that out of the way, how do we measure
7:51
the amount of energy that something contains?
7:57
And here we have something called the internal energy.
8:00
The internal energy of a system.
8:03
Once again this is a macrostate, or you could call
8:06
it a macro description of what's going on.
8:08
This is called u for internal.
8:10
The way I remember that is that the word internal does
8:13
not begin with a U.
8:15
U for internal energy.
8:25
Let me go back to my example-- that I had in the past, that I
8:30
did in our previous video, if you're watching these in
8:33
order-- of I have, you know, some gas with some movable
8:39
ceiling at the top.
8:40
That's its movable ceiling.
8:42
That can move up and down.
8:43
We have a vacuum up there.
8:44
And I have some gas in here.
8:50
The internal energy literally is all of the energy that's in
8:53
the system.
8:54
So it includes, and for our purposes, especially when
8:58
you're in a first-year chemistry course, it's the
9:01
kinetic energy of all the atoms or molecules.
9:10
And in a future video, I'll actually calculate it for how
9:13
much kinetic energy is there in a container.
9:16
And that'll actually be our internal energy plus all of
9:19
the other energy.
9:19
So these atoms, they have some kinetic energy because they
9:22
have some translational motion, if we look at the
9:24
microstates.
9:25
If they're just individual atoms, you can't really say
9:28
that they're rotating, because what does it mean for an atom
9:30
to rotate, right?
9:31
Because its electrons are just jumping around anyway.
9:34
So if they're individual atoms they can't rotate, but if
9:36
they're molecules they can rotate, if it looks
9:38
something like that.
9:40
There could be some rotational energy there.
9:43
It includes that.
9:44
If we have bonds-- so I just drew a molecule.
9:47
The molecule has bonds.
9:49
Those bonds contain some energy.
9:51
That is also included in the internal energy.
9:53
If I have some electrons, let's say that this was not
9:56
a-- well I'm doing it using a gas, and gases aren't good
9:59
conductors-- but let's say I'm doing it for a solid.
10:03
So I'm using the wrong tools.
10:05
So let's say I have some metal.
10:11
Those are my metal-- let me do more-- my metal atoms. And in
10:16
that metal atom, I have, a bunch of electrons-- well
10:21
that's the same color-- I have a bunch of-- let me use a
10:24
suitably different color-- I have a bunch
10:26
of electrons here.
10:29
And I have fewer here.
10:31
So these electrons really want to get here.
10:33
Maybe they're being stopped for some reason, so they have
10:35
some electrical potential.
10:37
Maybe there's a gap here, you know, where they can't conduct
10:40
or something like that.
10:41
Internal energy includes that as well.
10:43
That's normally the scope out of what you'd see in a
10:45
first-year chemistry class.
10:46
But it includes that.
10:47
It also includes literally every form of energy that
10:51
exists here.
10:52
It also includes, for example, in a metal, if we were to heat
10:54
this metal up they start vibrating, right?
10:57
They start moving left and right, or up or down, or in
11:00
every possible direction.
11:01
And if you think about a molecule or an atom that's
11:04
vibrating, it's going from here, and then it goes there,
11:09
then it goes back there.
11:10
It goes back and forth, right?
11:12
And if you think about what's happening, when it's in the
11:14
middle point it has a lot of kinetic energy, but at this
11:17
point right here, when it's about to go back, it's
11:19
completely stationary for a super small moment.
11:23
And at that point, all of its kinetic energy
11:25
is potential energy.
11:26
And then it turns into kinetic energy.
11:27
Then it goes back to potential energy again.
11:29
It's kind of like a pendulum, or it's
11:30
actually harmonic motion.
11:33
So in this case, internal energy also includes the
11:37
kinetic energy for the molecules that are moving
11:38
fast. But it also includes the potential energies for the
11:42
molecules that are vibrating, they're at that point where
11:44
they don't have kinetic energy.
11:45
So it also includes potential energy.
11:47
So internal energy is literally all of the energy
11:52
that's in a system.
11:54
And for most of what we're going to do, you can assume
11:58
that we're dealing with an ideal gas.
12:00
Instead of, it becomes a lot more complicated with solids,
12:02
and conductivity, and vibrations and all that.
12:05
We're going to assume we're dealing with an ideal gas.
12:07
And even better, we're going to assume we're dealing with a
12:09
monoatomic ideal gas.
12:11
And maybe this is just helium, or neon.
12:15
One of the ideal gases.
12:16
They don't want to bond with each other.
12:18
They don't form molecules with each other.
12:23
Let's just assume that they're not.
12:25
They're just individual atoms. And in that case, the internal
12:32
energy, we really can simplify to it being the kinetic
12:35
energy, if we ignore all of these other things.
12:37
But it's important to realize, internal energy is everything.
12:39
It's all of the energy inside of a system.
12:44
If you said, what's the energy of the system?
12:45
Its internal energy.
12:48
So the first law of thermodynamics says that
12:52
energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
12:56
So let's say that internal energy is changing.
12:59
So I have this system, and someone tells me, look, the
13:03
internal energy is changing.
13:06
So delta U, that's just a capital delta that says, what
13:09
is the change an internal energy?
13:10
It's saying, look, if your internal energy is changing,
13:14
your system is either having something done to it, or it's
13:17
doing something to someone else.
13:18
Some energy is being transferred to it
13:20
or away from it.
13:22
So, how do we write that?
13:24
Well the first law of thermodynamics, or even the
13:27
definition of internal energy, says that a change in internal
13:29
energy is equal to heat added to the system-- and once again
13:35
a very intuitive letter for heat, because heat does not
13:40
start with Q, but the convention is
13:43
to use Q for heat.
13:45
The letter h is reserved for enthalpy, which is a very,
13:49
very, very similar concept to heat.
13:51
We'll talk about that maybe in the next video.
13:54
It's equal to the heat added to the system, minus the work
13:59
done by the system.
14:03
And you could see this multiple ways.
14:05
Sometimes it's written like this.
14:06
Sometimes it's written that the change in internal energy
14:10
is equal to the heat added to the system, plus the work done
14:18
on the system.
14:19
And this might be very confusing, but you should just
14:21
always-- and we'll really kind of look at this 100 different
14:25
ways in the next video.
14:25
And actually this is a capital U.
14:27
Let me make sure that I write that as a capital U.
14:29
But we're going to do it 100 different ways.
14:31
But if you think about it, if I'm doing work I lose energy.
14:35
I've transferred the energy to someone else.
14:37
So this is doing work.
14:41
Likewise, if someone is giving me heat that is increasing my
14:45
energy, at least to me these are reasonably intuitive
14:48
definitions.
14:48
Now if you see this, you say, OK, if my energy is going up,
14:54
if this is a positive thing, I either have to have this go
14:57
up, or work is being done to me.
15:05
Or energy is being transferred into my system.
15:09
I'll give a lot more examples of what exactly that means in
15:11
the next video.
15:12
But I just want to make you comfortable
15:14
with either of these.
15:15
Because you're going to see them all the time, and you
15:16
might even get confused even if your teacher
15:18
uses only one of them.
15:19
But you should always do this reality check.
15:22
When something does work, it is transferring energy to
15:25
something else, right?
15:27
So if you're doing work, it'll take away, this is taking
15:30
away, your internal energy.
15:32
Likewise, heat transfer is another way for energy to go
15:36
from one system to another, or from one entity to another.
15:40
So if my total energy is going up, maybe heat is being added
15:45
to my system.
15:46
If my energy is going down, either heat is being taken
15:51
away from my system, or I'm doing more work on something.
15:55
I'll do a bunch of examples with that.
15:57
And I'm just going to leave you with this video with some
15:59
other notation that you might see.
16:01
You might see change in internal energy is equal to
16:05
change-- let me write it again-- change in internal
16:09
energy, capital U.
16:11
You'll sometimes see it as, they'll write a delta Q, which
16:14
kind of implies change in heat.
16:17
But I'll explain it in a future video why that doesn't
16:18
make a full sense, but you'll see this a lot.
16:21
But you can also view this as the heat added to the system,
16:24
minus the change in work, which is a little
16:28
non-intuitive because when you talk about heat or work you're
16:30
talking about transferring of energy.
16:32
So when you talk about change in transfer it becomes a
16:33
little-- So sometimes a delta work, they just mean this
16:36
means that work done by a system.
16:41
So obviously if you have some energy, you do some work,
16:44
you've lost that energy, you've given it to someone
16:46
else, you'd have a minus sign there.
16:48
Or you might see it written like this, change in internal
16:52
energy is equal to heat added-- I won't say even this
16:58
kind of reads to me as change in heat.
16:59
I'll just call this the heat added-- plus the work done
17:06
onto the system.
17:07
So this is work done to, this is work done by the system.
17:15
Either way.
17:16
And you shouldn't even memorize this, you should just
17:19
always think about it a little bit.
17:20
If I'm doing work I'm going to lose energy.
17:22
If work is done to me I'm going to gain energy.
17:24
If I lose heat, if this is a negative number, I'm going to
17:27
lose energy.
17:29
If I gain heat I'm going to gain energy.
17:31
Anyway, I'll leave you there for this video, and in the
17:33
next video we'll really try to digest this internal energy
17:37
formula 100 different ways.",what technology uses the concept of work and heat changing the internal energy?
khan_video_Xn29pt5159k_5,Science,ESSAY,"•
0:02
So the story begins with the WHO, the World Health
0:06
Organization.
0:08
And the WHO actually works with a few of the regional labs.
0:12
So there are actually five labs sprinkled around the world.
0:16
And these labs collect specimens from hundreds of countries.
0:20
So hundreds and hundreds of countries
0:22
do surveillance to figure out what type of flu
0:24
is affecting their particular population.
0:27
And they will send this information over
0:30
to these five regional labs.
0:32
And I'm just going to quickly draw out
0:34
for you where the regional labs are.
0:36
There's one over here in the US.
0:38
There's also one down here in China.
0:42
And then there's another one over here in Japan.
0:47
And a fourth one in the southern hemisphere in Australia.
0:53
And finally, there's one in the United Kingdom.
0:56
So this is the last one.
0:57
There are five in total.
0:58
The WHO will take a look at all the different strains that
1:02
have come into these five labs again from all over the world.
1:05
And they'll try to make a decision
1:07
as to what makes the most sense.
1:09
Because flu usually moves around the world
1:12
in a very predictable way.
1:14
So they can make an educated guess
1:15
as to what strains they should include in the vaccine
1:18
to protect people most effectively.
1:20
Sometimes they'll use a strain that they
1:22
used in previous years.
1:23
And sometimes they'll pick something brand new.
1:25
So let's go through the three strains
1:28
that they actually picked for the most
1:29
recent vaccine, the 2012-2013 vaccine.
1:34
I'll start with the type of virus they put in there.
1:36
And generally it's two type A's and one type B.
1:40
That's the usual formula that they use.
1:44
The WHO recommends that for the trivalent, or three strain
1:48
vaccine.
1:49
And the exact one that they choose
1:51
can be actually followed.
1:52
They usually name it in part based on location.
1:55
So they'll say, OK, the type is A.
1:59
And they'll say the location is-- in this case,
2:02
the first one actually came from California.
2:05
The second one came from Victoria, Australia.
2:09
And the final one came from Wisconsin in the United States.
2:13
So this is the location of the three strains.
2:15
In fact, if you ever see it named,
2:17
you'll see a slash between these two.
2:19
So I'll put a slash here as well.
2:20
Next, they actually have strain numbers.
2:22
So they'll give you a number and what that number refers to.
2:26
It doesn't mean a whole heck of a lot to us.
2:27
But we're going to put it in there just because that's
2:30
how they name things.
2:31
The strain number is, for the first one, 7.
2:34
This is 361.
2:36
And this is strain 1.
2:37
And then finally, they'll put the year that they actually
2:40
identified this thing.
2:41
So the year of identification.
2:44
And this first one, this type A, was actually
2:45
identified back in 2009.
2:48
Whereas the other ones are a little bit newer,
2:49
identified in 2011 and 2010.
2:52
So, that's what comes after the strain number.
2:55
And finally, the last thing, which
2:58
only applies to the first two, is that if it's a type A,
3:02
they'll actually tell you the H and N type.
3:05
So, for example, the first one, the California strain,
3:09
this one is actually a type H1N1.
3:13
And the second one is an H3N2.
3:16
And the third one, because it's a type B,
3:18
we don't really use that H and N classification.
3:21
So I'll just put a hash there, meaning nothing.
3:23
So if you ever come across these things
3:25
in some sort of formal document, at least now
3:27
you know what the heck all these numbers and words refer to.
3:31
So this is literally how they name the strains.
3:33
And just for you and I to know, this first one here,
3:37
this one is actually an old strain.
3:39
So, this is actually part of the last few vaccines.
3:42
This is not a new one that was included.
3:44
Whereas these other ones down here, these ones,
3:47
are actually new strains.
3:49
They were not part of the vaccine in previous years.
3:52
These are new additions or changes to the vaccine.
3:56
So just to remember, we always include
3:58
two type A's and one type B. And the type A's, one is a H1N1
4:05
and the other is a H3N2.
4:07
That's how we've been doing it in recent years.
4:09
Now let me bring up a little bit more canvas
4:11
because I want to talk you through exactly what happens
4:13
once the WHO decides that these are
4:16
the strains they're going to use.
4:17
And this decision was actually made back in February of 2012.
4:22
So months and months in advance they're figuring out what
4:24
strain we're going to use.
4:27
And that information then goes to the next group
4:30
of folks, which is the manufacturers.
4:32
The manufacturers are going to take this information
4:35
and they're literally going to start putting things together.
4:38
They're going to start the manufacturing process.
4:41
And one of the key parts of this process, which a lot of people
4:44
don't realize, and it's pretty mind boggling,
4:46
is that you need millions, actually
4:48
hundreds of millions of eggs.
4:51
The same kind of eggs you might eat for breakfast.
4:54
But these eggs are actually laboratory grade
4:56
and they're needed for making this process work.
4:59
And once it's made, one of the key things,
5:01
and this reassures a lot of folks, is safety.
5:04
We want to make sure that these things are safe.
5:06
And so a lot of testing goes into making sure
5:08
that all of these vaccines that they make are safe.
5:12
So once that's done and people feel comfortable that it's
5:15
a safe vaccine, we start distributing it.
5:18
So distribution is next.
5:19
And we're going to go through each of these stages
5:21
and think just a little bit about which people
5:24
are involved in all these steps.
5:25
But I just want to lay out all the steps first
5:28
so you get an appreciation for how many players there are
5:32
and how many steps are in getting a vaccine to you.
5:36
So it goes, of course, from distribution,
5:38
it goes to these clinics.
5:39
And then finally, at the end of the day there is a person.
5:43
There might be you.
5:44
This is you getting your flu shot
5:46
and you're very happy because you're now
5:49
protected from the vaccine.
5:51
And I'll draw a little shield around you,
5:55
a little protection for you, to make sure
5:57
that it's clear that you're protected-- not completely--
6:00
I'll draw a little hole in the protection--
6:02
not completely because a vaccine isn't perfect.
6:05
But it's pretty good.
6:06
And in fact, this year, in terms of how well the vaccine is
6:09
working-- not in studies, but in the real world-- in terms
6:13
of how it's doing as people are getting it--
6:15
about 62% effectiveness.
6:17
So it's actually really quite good.
6:19
In studies we always see around 60% to 70%.
6:22
And now, in real life, we're seeing a 62% effectiveness
6:26
in terms of vaccine effectiveness.
6:29
The word effectiveness just means real world data,
6:32
versus efficacy-- is what we see in studies.
6:35
That's the difference in the two words.
6:37
So let me list out some of the different folks involved
6:40
at each step of the way.
6:42
So in terms of selecting the strain,
6:44
we said that the WHO is responsible in working
6:47
with all the different countries and the public health
6:50
groups and laboratories and scientists that
6:52
are looking at all the strain data.
6:54
And then in terms of manufacturing, there
6:56
you got to think about the vaccine industry.
6:58
There are many, many big players here.
7:00
Big business is involved in terms
7:03
of churning out millions of doses of vaccine.
7:06
So here the vaccine industry is a major player.
7:09
And then, you think of all the other groups that are involved.
7:11
So I said that you have to get hundreds of millions of eggs
7:16
to make this process work.
7:18
And so of course, then you have to really work with farmers.
7:20
And if you have a year where the flu is really
7:23
hurting the birds and the chicken population
7:26
then that's going to make it really hard because there
7:28
are fewer eggs to contribute to the vaccine manufacturing.
7:32
So it's actually an interesting thought process.
7:35
Flu obviously affects chickens as well as humans.
7:38
And so if those populations start dying out,
7:41
then even humans suffer because we don't have the vaccine.
7:44
Now, then safety is huge.
7:45
So you have to think of all the different countries that
7:48
have organizations that care about safety.
7:51
And in the US the one that comes to mind
7:53
is the FDA, or the Food and Drug Administration.
7:56
So each country has its own process
7:58
of thinking about safety.
8:00
And those groups are obviously very involved
8:02
in making the vaccine as well.
8:04
Then you've got all these logistic things to think about.
8:06
I mean, if you're making hundreds of millions
8:08
of vaccines, you've got to distribute them
8:10
around the world.
8:11
You've got to think about airplanes that can actually
8:13
take your flu vaccine and move it around.
8:16
You've got to think about refrigeration.
8:18
Maybe ships if you're moving across large bodies of water.
8:23
Maybe trucks to get vaccine inland
8:26
if it's cheaper that way.
8:27
So lots of logistical issues to think about how to get vaccine
8:31
distributed.
8:32
And then finally, you've got nurses and doctors
8:34
in the clinics that have to be informed.
8:36
They need to know when to start making appointments
8:38
for their patients and how to set up
8:40
clinics to actually administer the vaccine to all the folks.
8:44
And finally we've got you.
8:46
You're at the end of this chain.
8:48
And not just you, but there are about 250 million folks just
8:52
like you getting vaccines.
8:54
So 250 million doses are actually put together.
8:58
And this is quite an effort.
9:00
You can see the countries involved.
9:02
And getting all that information to all these different groups
9:05
that have to get involved in terms
9:06
of making this even possible.
9:08
So, to me, this is actually one of the most impressive feats
9:11
out there.
9:12
And it really is a testament to what
9:14
science can do for mankind.","Other websites like the CDC say the virus is ""inactivated"" well how is it inactivated?"

Voiceover: Bitcoin is a new virtual currency system
0:03
that's been gathering a lot of attention recently,
0:05
and I thought I would do a series of videos
0:07
where I really dive into the innards of bitcoin
0:10
and explain how it works in detail,
0:12
and my plan for this first video in this series
0:15
is to describe some of those mechanics
0:18
at a high level.
0:19
And then what I'll do in subsequent videos
0:21
is dive a bit deeper into all of the underlying aspects
0:24
that I have touched upon within this first video.
0:27
And my hope is that by the end of this video series,
0:29
you'll know not only what a bitcoin is,
0:31
but you'll also understand the mechanics
0:33
of how transactions are initiated.
0:35
You'll see how verification occurs
0:38
for those transactions,
0:38
and you'll also learn what it means for someone
0:41
to really engage in a process
0:43
known as ""bitcoin mining"",
0:44
and that may be a term that you've heard
0:46
if you've had any interest in bitcoin recently.
0:49
I do want to point out, also,
0:50
that the bitcoin scheme is fairly involved.
0:53
It requires some time to really cover
0:56
all of the relevant details,
0:58
and to me the best way to really wrap your head
1:00
around a scheme like bitcoin
1:02
is to really suspend belief for a bit
1:04
and get exposed to all of these relevant details.
1:08
Now, undoubtedly, you'll have a lot of questions
1:10
along the way,
1:11
but my hope is that by the end of this video series,
1:13
all of the relevant stones will have been overturned
1:16
and your questions will have been
1:17
appropriately answered,
1:18
but it might take some time to get there,
1:21
and in part, that's because I'll try to describe things
1:23
in a way that's sensible
1:25
and that might involve leaving some details out
1:28
until I can explain enough pieces of the scheme
1:31
and then add in those details in as I go along
1:33
so that you're not inundated
1:34
with too many minor points and nuances
1:38
along the way,
1:39
but you get a feel for the overall system
1:41
as I go through things.
1:42
With that, let me go ahead and just dive right in.
1:44
First of all, I do want to point out
1:46
that bitcoin has been described, really,
1:48
as a decentralized currency
1:51
because there's no real central bank or entity
1:54
that's involved in generating or transacting bitcoins,
1:57
and, in fact, what happens in the content of a bitcoin
2:00
is all the transactions really require
2:02
what's known as a peer-to-peer network,
2:04
a network of just individual hosts that essentially
2:08
collectively agree on different aspects
2:09
of how the protocol is implemented and used.
2:15
Bitcoin itself is also referred to sometimes
2:17
as a cryptocurrency,
2:19
and by a cryptocurrency,
2:19
I mean that we use a lot of cryptographic techniques
2:22
in order to facilitate or to really enable
2:25
bitcoin transactions to take place,
2:27
and I'll do separate videos
2:28
on some of these techniques,
2:29
but just take it at face value right now,
2:31
that it's decentralized
2:33
and is a type of cryptocurrency.
2:35
I also want to point out that the term ""bitcoin"" itself
2:38
can in fact be a bit confusing,
2:40
and in many ways, bitcoin transactions
2:42
don't really resemble traditional coin transactions
2:46
so much as they represent really entries
2:49
in some type of a global ledger,
2:51
and by that, I mean let's say you have
2:54
a transaction taking place,
2:56
and let's say the transaction is taking place
2:58
within, or among two parties,
3:00
and we'll call them Alice and Bob,
3:03
which are traditional names that are used
3:04
in many cryptographic protocols
3:06
to describe the parties involved,
3:08
and imagine that Alice wants to transfer,
3:12
or really wants to assign,
3:13
a certain number of bitcoins that she possesses
3:15
over to Bob,
3:17
and you can think of this transaction, really,
3:19
as an entry in a ledger of some sort,
3:24
and I also want to point out before proceeding
3:26
that even though I've used terms
3:28
like Alice and Bob,
3:29
what I really mean in the context of bitcoin
3:32
is not the actual identities in the physical sense,
3:36
but really that Alice and Bob are identities
3:39
in the bitcoin system,
3:41
and these identities are just,
3:42
in actual implementation,
3:44
are just collections of numbers
3:46
that do not have to be tied
3:49
with Alice and Bob's real-world identities.
3:52
In that capacity, you can think of bitcoin at any,
3:55
it really is effectively being,
3:57
of being pseudonyms,
3:59
rather than real names,
4:00
and the idea is that bitcoin really becomes more
4:02
of a pseudonymous protocol,
4:03
where people are addressed by their pseudonyms,
4:06
and that provides some level of privacy
4:09
to users that want to transact
4:10
using the bitcoin system.
4:13
Now, in a transaction between Alice and Bob,
4:15
what Alice will basically do
4:16
is specify a few different numbers.
4:18
She has to specify how many bitcoins
4:21
she wants to allocate to Bob.
4:22
Let's say Alice started off with 50 bitcoins of her own.
4:25
She might decide that she wants to give,
4:27
let's say, 30 of these bitcoins over to Bob,
4:31
and let's say she wants to have
4:33
some number of bitcoins returned back to her,
4:35
so you have to specify,
4:36
or Alice has to specify, rather,
4:37
how much change she's going to get,
4:39
so in this case, let's say her change is going to be
4:40
18 bitcoins for herself,
4:43
and then the remaining 2 bitcoins are going to be
4:45
a transaction fee,
4:47
and we'll talk about what a transaction fee means
4:50
a little later,
4:51
and I think I'll also dive into it in future videos,
4:54
but it's basically an incentive for other nodes
4:56
in the bitcoin network to help Alice
4:58
in essentially validating some of the details
5:00
of this transaction for Bob.
5:04
Now, Alice will take these transaction details
5:07
and apply what's known as a digital signature
5:12
to these transaction details,
5:13
and a digital signature is basically
5:14
the mathematical analog of a traditional signature.
5:18
It really binds Alice's identity to the details
5:21
of this transaction.
5:23
And by Alice's identity, again,
5:24
I mean her identity within the bitcoin system,
5:27
and this binding is really done
5:28
in a cryptographically strong way.
5:31
Now, the details of this transaction
5:33
once it takes place,
5:34
are going to be broadcast out,
5:36
so Alice is going to take these transaction details
5:38
and effectively just broadcast them out
5:40
to all the nodes in the peer-to-peer network
5:45
that represent bitcoin nodes.
5:47
Now, Bob, when he receives information
5:50
about this transaction,
5:51
he receives it over the peer-to-peer network.
5:53
He'll probably sandy check
5:55
some part of the transaction.
5:56
For example, he might check that the numbers
5:58
work out correctly,
5:59
that Alice, let's say, started off with 50 bitcoins
6:02
and is not trying to transfer
6:03
more than 50 bitcoins to him, and so on and so forth.
6:06
He's going to have some mathematical assurance
6:08
because of some of the cryptography involved
6:11
that some of these claims are accurate,
6:13
that Alice, let's say, has the bitcoins
6:15
that she's claimed to possess,
6:17
and that she's expressed an interest
6:19
to assign those bitcoins to him,
6:21
but what he won't know yet is whether
6:23
Alice has really tried to transfer those same bitcoins
6:26
to anyone else over the course of time
6:28
or maybe just prior to that point.
6:31
the way that we handle that situation,
6:33
and by the way, I should point out
6:34
that this concept of Alice trying to, let's say,
6:37
spend coins twice,
6:39
in the context of digital cash
6:41
and electronic currency systems,
6:42
this concept is known as double spending,
6:45
and it's something you have to worry about
6:47
when you have virtual currencies
6:49
because it's very easy for someone to just copy
6:51
the numbers that represent this transaction
6:53
and try to use them elsewhere.
6:57
The way we basically handle
6:58
and reduce the risk of double spending
7:00
is through a specific set of nodes
7:03
in this peer-to-peer network
7:05
who are known as bitcoin miners.
7:08
You might have heard this term bitcoin miners,
7:10
and the bitcoin miners are basically
7:12
specific individuals,
7:14
specific nodes within this peer-to-peer network,
7:17
and what they basically do is they take
7:19
all of the transactions that they see,
7:21
and remember,
7:21
they're listening to all of these transactions,
7:23
and not just Alice and Bob's,
7:24
but other transactions that are taking place,
7:26
and they'll take those transactions,
7:27
and ultimately, they will take those transactions
7:29
and will compile them
7:31
into what's known as a transaction block.
7:34
So it's basically a recording
7:35
of all the previously unrecorded transactions.
7:40
If you think of a single transaction
7:42
let's say, as a ledger item,
7:44
you could think of a transaction block
7:45
as representing, let's say, an entire page
7:47
in a ledger book.
7:50
These bitcoin miners will also include in this block,
7:54
in addition to all these unrecorded transactions,
7:55
they will also include in this block
7:57
a special transaction that's meant just for themselves
8:01
to basically reward themselves for the effort
8:04
of doing this mining.
8:06
Now, a transaction block will also contain
8:09
an encoding of the previous transaction block,
8:11
so there's going to be some level of continuity,
8:14
and then bitcoin miners will also include
8:16
a specially-crafted sequence of numbers
8:19
associated with these transactions,
8:21
and this sequence of numbers is known
8:23
as a proof of work,
8:26
and it's called a proof of work
8:27
because it's sometihng that's really hard to generate,
8:30
something that requires a lot of effort to do,
8:31
and that kind of makes it hard for just anybody
8:34
to get involved with bitcoin mining willy-nilly,
8:36
but it requires that they really exhibit or exert
8:39
some computational effort,
8:42
basically in exchange for getting this extra reward
8:45
of a payment,
8:45
and also in exchange for getting
8:47
this transaction fee that they're going to be promised
8:50
by Alice to engage in this sort of work.
8:54
I'll talk about what proof-of-work protocols are
8:55
in a separate video in more detail.
8:57
Now, because each transaction block
8:59
contains information about previous transactions,
9:03
really what you end up having
9:04
is not just a single block.
9:06
You ultimately have what you can think of as a chain
9:09
of transactions,
9:11
and you can call this a transaction block chain.
9:15
The idea is as soon as a bitcoin miner
9:17
is able to construct a transaction block chain
9:19
containing all these unrecorded transactions,
9:21
and this proof of work,
9:22
it'll broadcast the details of that chain out
9:26
to all of the nodes, all of the peers
9:29
on that peer-to-peer network for bitcoin.
9:33
And then once the newly-broadcast chain
9:36
gets kind of verified and meets the right properties,
9:39
the nodes on the network
9:40
are just going to go ahead and start using it,
9:42
and they're going to start appending
9:43
new transaction blocks to that chain.
9:46
They're going to take anything
9:47
that hasn't yet been processed
9:48
and start incorporating it into the transaction chain
9:51
that was broadcast out by the node
9:54
who came up with the proof of work correctly.
9:57
Now, this transaction block chain,
9:58
really what we're going to be doing
10:01
in the context of bitcoin
10:02
is the nodes are only going to consider
10:05
the transaction block chain that reflects
10:08
the greatest amount of work to generate its contents,
10:10
and again, there's this proof of work that I mentioned
10:12
that is used to kind of determine
10:14
or identify what the, what work was involved
10:17
in coming up with the transaction block chain.
10:20
The one that's the longest is going to be considered
10:22
sacrosanct within the bitcoin system.
10:24
Future miners are supposed to only work
10:26
off the chain that has the most work put into it.
10:30
Now, what's remarkable here
10:32
is that the whole process is decentralized.
10:34
There is no bank or no centrally-trusted entity
10:38
that was actually involved in the transaction.
10:40
Hopefully this first video gave you
10:42
a bit of description, a flavor, if you will,
10:44
for the high-level mechanics of the bitcoin system.
10:47
There are a lot of stones I have left unturned,
10:50
and what I'll do in subsequent videos
10:52
is start covering those details,
10:54
and I'm sure you have a lot of questions,
10:55
and hopefully the future videos
10:57
will help answer some of those questions for you.","If it proves to be just another tool for illegal activities of tax evaders, money launderers, terrorist founders, etc, could the government ban such transactions?"

0:00
- [Voiceover] What I wanna do in this video is see
0:01
if we can find the measure of angle D,
0:05
if we could find the measure of angle D
0:07
and like always, pause this video,
0:09
and see if you can figure it out.
0:11
And I'll give you a little bit of a hint.
0:12
It'll involve thinking about how an inscribed angle relates
0:17
to the corresponding to the measure of the arc
0:20
that it intercepts.
0:22
So, think about it like that.
0:24
All right, so, let's work on this a little bit.
0:27
So, what do we know, what do we know?
0:31
Well, angle D, angle D intercepts an arc.
0:35
It intercepts this fairly large arc that I'm going
0:39
to highlight right now in this purple color.
0:42
So, it intercepts that arc.
0:44
We don't know the measure of that arc
0:46
or at least we don't know the measure of that arc yet.
0:48
If we did know the measure of this arc
0:50
that I'm highlighting, then we know that the measure
0:53
of angle D would just be half that because the measure
0:56
of an inscribed angle is half the measure
1:00
of the arc that it intercepts.
1:02
We've seen that multiple times.
1:03
So, if we knew the measure of this arc,
1:05
we would be able to figure out
1:07
what the measure of angle D is.
1:09
But we do know, we don't know the measure of that arc,
1:12
but we do know the measure of another arc.
1:15
We do know the measure of the arc that completes the circle.
1:19
So, we do know the measure of this arc.
1:22
You might be saying, hey wait, how do we know
1:24
that measure, it's not labeled.
1:25
Well, the reason why we know the measure of this arc
1:28
that I've just highlighted in this teal color is
1:31
because the inscribed angle that intercepts it,
1:34
they gave us the information,
1:35
they said this is a 45 degree angle.
1:38
So, this is a 45 degree angle.
1:40
Then this over here is a 90 degree, 90 degree arc.
1:44
The measure of this arc is 90 degrees.
1:48
The measure of arc, I guess you could say
1:50
this is the measure of arc, I'ma write it this way.
1:53
The measure of arc, WL.
1:58
WL is equal to 90 degrees,
2:03
it's twice that, the inscribed angle that intercepts it.
2:07
Now, why is that helpful?
2:09
Well, if you go all the way around the circle,
2:10
you're 360 degrees.
2:12
So, this purple arc that we cared about, that we said hey,
2:16
if we could figure out the measure of that,
2:17
we're gonna be able to figure out the measure of angle D.
2:19
That plus arc, WL,
2:23
they are going to add up to 360 degrees.
2:27
Let me write that down.
2:28
So, the measure of arc, let's see,
2:32
and this is going to be a major arc right over here.
2:36
This is so LIW,
2:39
the measure of arc LIW
2:43
plus the measure of arc WL
2:47
plus the measure
2:50
of arc WL plus this right over here.
2:54
That's going to be equal to 360 degrees.
2:58
This is going to be equal to 360 degrees.
3:02
Now, we already know that this is 90 degrees.
3:05
We already know WL is 90 degrees.
3:08
So, if you subtract 90 degrees from both sides,
3:10
you get that the measure of this large arc right over here,
3:15
measure of arc LIW is going
3:18
to be equal to 270 degrees.
3:21
I just took 300, I went all the way around the circle,
3:23
I subtracted out this 90 degrees
3:25
and I'm left with 270 degrees.
3:28
So, let me write that down.
3:29
This is the measure of this arc in purple is 270 degrees.
3:32
And now, we can figure out the measure of angle D.
3:34
It's an inscribed angle that intercepts that arc
3:37
so it's going to have half the measure,
3:40
the angle's going to have half the measure.
3:42
So, half of 270
3:45
is 135 degrees and we're done,
3:49
and you might notice something interesting,
3:51
that if you add 135 degrees plus 45 degrees,
3:56
that they add up to 180 degrees.
4:00
So, it looks like at least for this case that these angles,
4:03
these opposite angles of this inscribed quadrilateral,
4:07
it looks like they are supplementary.
4:12
So, an interesting question is
4:13
are they always going to be supplementary?
4:15
If you have a quadrilateral, an arbitrary quadrilateral
4:19
inscribed in a circle, so each of the vertices
4:21
of the quadrilateral sit on the circle.
4:24
If you have that, are opposite angles of that quadrilateral,
4:28
are they always supplementary?
4:30
Do they always add up to 180 degrees?
4:32
So, I encourage you to think about that and even prove it
4:35
if you get a chance, and the proof is very close
4:38
to what we just did here.
4:39
In order to prove it, you would just have to do it
4:41
with more general numbers like, you know,
4:42
instead of saying 45 degrees, you could call this X,
4:45
and then you would want to prove that this right over here
4:47
would have to be 180 minus X.
4:50
So, I encourage you to do that on your own
4:51
but I'm gonna do it in a video as well
4:53
so you can check if our reasoning is similar.",because i cant see any solving quadrilaterals like this quadrilateral MINT is inscribed in the circle and the measure of M = 3x+10 and N = 2x and T= x- 27 find the measure of x?

We now know how to find the area of rectangles.
0:03
What I want to do in this video,
0:04
is think about how we can find the areas of triangles.
0:07
So, we're starting here with a right triangle,
0:11
has a 90 degree angle right over here.
0:13
Right triangle ABC.
0:14
And let's think about how we can find this area.
0:17
Well, maybe we can construct a rectangle out of triangle ABC.
0:21
And if we can construct a rectangle out if it, and then, maybe we can
0:24
somehow find our area of part of that rectangle.
0:26
And the best way to construct a rectangle is to really duplicate ABC,
0:30
and then flip it over and put it right on top of this.
0:33
And just to verify, that definitely will be a rectangle.
0:36
So we know that this is 90 degrees right over here.
0:38
Let's say that this is x degrees right over there.
0:41
We have x + 90 + this thing have to be equal to 180.
0:45
So, this thing and this thing have to add up to 90.
0:48
Let's just call this 90-x.
0:51
Now, let's flip this thing and rotate it around,
0:54
so that it will look like this.
0:56
So, then you would have another triangle
0:58
that would look just like this.
1:00
Where now, this right angle,
1:03
on the flipped version is that right angle right over there.
1:06
This angle right over here, this x,
1:08
is now this angle right over there.
1:10
And this 90-x is now this angle, right over there.
1:14
And you can see x + 90-x, that'll give you a right angle.
1:18
And then you have x + 90-x, that gives you a right angle.
1:22
And you have four sides and four right angles,
1:25
you're definitely dealing with a rectangle.
1:27
And this rectangle has two of our original triangles in it.
1:31
So, we can write, we can write that the area of triangle ABC,
1:37
the area of triangle ABC, that's what the brackets mean,
1:40
area of triangle ABC,
1:42
is going to be equal to ? * the area of our entire rectangle.
1:47
And our entire rectangle, let me add another point here.
1:49
Let me call this D, is going to be ? the area of rectangle ABCD.
1:55
And we know how to find the area of rectangle ABCD.
2:00
It's going to be equal to,
2:02
it's going to be equal to the base of the rectangle.
2:05
So, this is going to be equal to ? * and so this part right over here.
2:10
Let me just use a different color.
2:11
The area of ABCD is equal to the base or the width of the rectangle.
2:16
So, that's just the length of BC.
2:19
I'm just putting this in parentheses, it doesn't mean！I just,
2:23
BC is just the length of this segment right over here
2:25
I'm just putting in the parentheses
2:26
so that we don't get the letters jumbled up.
2:28
So it's going to be this width or this base right here
2:30
times the height of the rectangle.
2:33
So, times AD.
2:35
Times！sorry, times AB.
2:38
So, it's this base * this height
2:41
gives us the area of the entire rectangle.
2:42
And the area of a right triangle is half of that.
2:45
So, there we have it.
2:46
It's ? * this base * this height.
2:52
It's the area of a right triangle.
2:54
So, in general if you ever have a right triangle,
2:56
if you ever have a right triangle,
2:57
and this is a right angle right over there which is,
3:01
you need one right angle in order for it to be a right triangle.
3:04
And this base has length B, and this side over here has length H.
3:08
You know that the area,
3:10
the area is going to be equal to ? * the base of the triangle.
3:19
That's the base of the triangle BC * the height of the triangle.
3:23
So you can view it this way, if you look at the actual letter points.
3:27
And if you just use these measures as a base * height,
3:29
it's just ? base * height.
3:30
And we only that this works right now for a right triangle.
3:34
Now, let's think about it for other types of triangles
3:36
that aren't necessarily right triangles.
3:38
So, here I have a kind of an arbitrary triangle ABC.
3:42
And to approach figuring out its area,
3:45
what I wanna do is just split this up into two right triangles.
3:48
So what I'm gonna do is draw a perpendicular from B,
3:52
so I'm just gonna really, if this was, if this was an actual structure,
3:55
you'll just literally drop something straight down from here,
3:57
and that line is going to be perpendicular
3:58
to this base right over here, to AC.
4:01
And let me call that point, let me call that point D.
4:05
And what's useful here is now we've constructed,
4:07
we've turned that one triangle into two right triangles.
4:11
So we can say that the area, let me write it this way,
4:15
we can say the area of triangle ABC,
4:18
that's what we wanna figure out.
4:20
It's equal to the area of this character right here.
4:24
So it's equal to the area of triangle ABD + the area of triangle,
4:35
+ the area of this magenta triangle.
4:38
So, plus the area of BCD, of BCD.
4:45
And this is useful
4:46
because we know how to find the area of right triangles.
4:48
Now, obviously this is 90 degrees
4:49
and this is also going to be 90 degrees.
4:51
The area of ABD is ? base * height.
4:54
So it's going to be ? * the base, which is the length AD.
4:59
So ? * AD, * the height, which is the length of BD right over here,
5:05
assuming that we can figure that out.
5:07
So this * that length, so, BD.
5:11
So that's the area of the blue triangle,
5:13
and I'll find the area of the magenta triangle.
5:14
Well, once again it's a right triangle.
5:16
It's gonna be ?, let me do that in magenta.
5:19
Let me do that in magenta.
5:20
So it's going to be ? * the length of this base right over here,
5:25
which is DC, the length of segment DC * the length of BD again.
5:30
Now, you can factor out a ?, we can factor out a ? BD
5:39
from both of these terms, ? BD.
5:42
So you get ? BD * AD, we're left with AD,
5:50
and that's not the same shade of blue.
5:53
We're left with AD + DC.
6:02
We close the parenthesis.
6:04
And what is AD + DC?
6:06
AD is the length, that length.
6:08
And then DC is this length.
6:10
So if you will add those two lengths, you get the length of AC.
6:13
So this whole thing, this whole thing is the length AC.
6:18
So, we're left with the area of ABC is equal to,
6:22
I'll use in a new color, it's equal to ?,
6:26
and I'll just switch the orders right over here.
6:27
? *, which I'm gonna write in that same color, * AC * BD.
6:34
Now, what is this again?
6:38
Well, this is now ? * the base, which is this AC, * the height,
6:43
which is BD.
6:44
So that's pretty cool.
6:45
It worked for right triangles, and it actually,
6:46
if we know the height of a triangle.
6:48
Now, this isn't one of the sides now.
6:49
For a right triangle, it was one of the sides.
6:51
Now, for this arbitrary triangle, it isn't.
6:53
But if we know it, the area of this triangle
6:56
is still ? * the base * the height.
6:59
Now, what about a triangle like this?
7:02
How can we figure out its area?
7:04
Well, let's try doing the same thing.
7:06
Let's see if we can somehow,
7:07
either construct this out of right triangles,
7:10
or maybe out a right triangle of this
7:12
to make it into another right triangle.
7:14
And the easiest way to do that is,
7:15
we could kind of just drop a rock from right over there.
7:18
And then this, and then where it kind of hits the ground
7:21
would form a right angle.
7:22
And let's call this point D.
7:24
And what we care about, what we wanna find in this,
7:27
what we wanna find the area of,
7:29
we wanna find the area of triangle ABC.
7:32
So that's what we care about.
7:34
Triangle ABC is what we wanna find the area.
7:36
But the area of triangle ABC is gonna be the area
7:40
of this larger right triangle that we've set up.
7:42
That's gonna be this larger triangle.
7:53
Minus the area of this smaller one right over here.
7:57
So, minus the area of ADC, of ADC.
8:03
So I just, this blue one ADB, this is just the whole thing.
8:07
This is the whole thing, just so we're clear of what we're talking about.
8:11
Now, what is the area of ADB.
8:13
Well, we know how to find the area of right triangles.
8:16
ADB, the area of ADB is going to be, is going to be ? * our base,
8:24
which is DB, the length of segment DB * our height,
8:30
which is the length of AD.
8:31
Times AD.
8:34
And then from that we wanna subtract the area of the smaller triangle.
8:37
So that's gonne be ? * our base, which is DC,
8:42
that's the length of our base, DC, * the length of our height,
8:46
which is AD, AD.
8:49
So, here we can factor out a ?, and we can factor an AD.
8:53
A ?, and an AD, so let's do that.
8:56
So we factor out a ? * AD.
8:59
And what's left inside is a DB - a DC.
9:11
Let me put the parenthesis in a white again.
9:16
Well, if you take the length, DB is the length of this whole thing.
9:20
You subtract from that the length DC, you're gonna be left with CB.
9:25
So this character right over here, this is C, this is CB.
9:31
And so the area of ABC is going to be equal to ? * CB,
9:38
I'm just switching the order of multiplication, with a yellow color.
9:42
? * CB * AD
9:46
Now, what is this?
9:49
Once again, it's ? * our base * our height.
9:54
And once again the height in this case,
9:56
'cause it's not a right triangle, it's not one of the sides.
10:00
Someone would have to give you that information.
10:02
You'd have to figure out what this actual height is.
10:05
But what's needed is,
10:06
in any form of triangle the area is ? base * height.
10:09
The height is, kind of, if you have the sides of a right triangle,
10:12
it's easy to figure out.
10:14
For these others, if it's not given,
10:16
you might have to do it in some tricky way,
10:18
figure out the height somehow.
10:20
But anyway, I hope that you find that useful.","For the third triangle, couldn't you have just drawn a line from point C to the line and have two right angles again?"

Construct a regular hexagon inscribed inside the circle.
0:04
So what I'm going to do, first, I'm
0:06
going to draw a diameter of the circle.
0:08
And actually, I'm going to go beyond the diameter
0:10
of the circle.
0:10
I'm just going to draw a line that
0:12
goes through the center of the circle and just keeps on going.
0:15
And I'm going to make it flat, so it goes directly through,
0:20
so this one right over here, goes directly
0:22
through the center.
0:23
And now, what I'm going to do is I'm
0:25
going to construct a circle that's
0:26
the exact same dimensions of this circle that's already
0:29
been drawn.
0:29
So let me put this one right over here.
0:33
And let me make it the same dimensions.
0:36
And now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to move it over,
0:39
so that this new circle intersects
0:41
the center of the old circle.
0:43
And these circles are the same size.
0:44
So notice, this center intersects the old circle.
0:48
And the new circle itself intersects
0:50
the center of the old circle.
0:52
Now, the reason why this is interesting,
0:54
we already know that this distance, the distance
0:56
between these two centers, this is equal to a radius.
1:00
We also know-- we have a straight edge-- we also
1:04
know that this distance right over here is equal to a radius.
1:10
It's equal to the radius of our new circle right over here.
1:13
We also know that this distance right over here
1:18
is equal to a radius of our old circle.
1:22
And that they both have the same radius.
1:23
So this is a radius between these two points.
1:26
Between these two points is a radius.
1:28
And then, in between these two points is a radius.
1:30
So now, I have constructed an equilateral triangle.
1:34
And essentially, you have to just do this six times.
1:36
And then I'm going to have a hexagon inscribed
1:38
inside the circle.
1:39
Let me do it again.
1:40
So we'll go from here to here.
1:45
This is a radius of my new circle, which
1:48
is the same as the radius of the old circle.
1:51
And I could go from here to here.
1:55
That's the radius of my old circle.
1:57
So I have another equilateral triangle.
1:58
Radius, radius, radius.
2:00
Another equilateral triangle.
2:02
I've just got to do this, I have to do this four more times.
2:05
So let me go to my original.
2:07
Let's see, let me make sure I can-- well,
2:09
it's actually going to be hard for me to-- let me just
2:11
add another circle here, to do it on the other side.
2:14
So if I put the center of it right-- I
2:19
want to move it a little bit, right over--
2:22
I want to make it the same size.
2:24
So oh, that's close enough.
2:27
And let's see, that looks pretty close.
2:32
That's the same size.
2:34
Now, let me move it over here.
2:35
Now, I want this center to be on the circle, right like that.
2:40
And now, I'm ready to draw some more equilateral triangles.
2:46
And really, I don't have to even draw the inside of it.
2:48
Now, I see my six vertices for my hexagon,
2:51
here, here, here, here, here, here.
2:55
And I think you're satisfied now that you could break this up
2:58
into six equilateral triangles.
3:01
So let's do that.
3:02
So this would be the base of one of those equilateral triangles.
3:06
And actually, let me move these.
3:08
Let me move this one out of the way.
3:10
I can move this one right over here.
3:12
Because I really just care about the hexagon itself.
3:15
And I can move this right over here.
3:17
But we know that these are all the lengths of the radius
3:20
anyway.
3:21
Actually, I'm not even having to change the length there.
3:23
Then, I have to just connect one more right down here.
3:26
So let me add another straight edge, connect those two points.
3:30
And I would have done it.

You'll hear people talking about different ways of looking at GDP and in general they will talk about the expenditure view of GDP.
0:07
The expenditure view of GDP vs. the income view of GDP and to realize why these get you to the same number for GDP
0:17
But why you're kind of conceptually looking at 2 different things, we're gonna revisit a very very simple economy- maybe slightly more complicated than that one island economy.
0:25
So in this economy, we have some households, and that's why it's slightly more complicated, because I am talking about households, not just one house on an island.
0:34
You have some households and you have some firms. And for the sake of simplicity, we're going to assume that households own all the factors of production.
0:45
And they essentially rent them out to firms to produce all the goods and services. The firms, and this is another assumption, produce all the goods and services.
0:58
These are two very strong assumptions and these really are not true in the real world. This just helps me draw the diagram.
1:10
Obviously in the real world, households do not own all the factors of production.
1:14
Many, if not most of the factors of production the factories and the ships and whatever else are actually owned by firms in the real world
1:22
but this is not that crazy an assumption because those firms, at the end of the day are owned by people, they are owned by households.
1:28
So in theory, that they could have been transferred to the households and then the households just rent the factors of production to the firms.
1:34
And this is also a hugely simplifying assumption because we know that in the real world, we know that firms don't produce all the goods and services, households also produce goods and services,
1:43
some of which, never get measured. The service for me taking the trash out at night, or doing the lawn, or making dinner
1:52
or the service of parents taking care of their children. None of that gets accounted for.
1:57
But for this, just for simplicity, we're going to make these two assumptions. All the factors of production and the system. The labor, the land, the capital, and if we wanna throw it in, the entrepreneurship, it's all loaned by households
2:14
and all goods and services are produced by firms.
2:17
So just like we saw with that first example of the island, the households do all of the expenditures, and these ends up being all of the revenue for the firms.
2:28
And then the firms spend a lot take that revenue and then spend it to rent many of these factors of production or some or all of these factors of production
2:38
so they hire the people, which is essentially they're renting labor, they might rent the land, they might rent the capital, so all of that ends up becoming income for the households.
2:49
And whatever else is left over, so this is expenses. So if we take this revenue, what it turns into is expenses and profit. Whatever's leftover after expenses is profit.
3:03
We're assuming all the firms are also owned by all the households so the expenses plus the profit end up all going to the households and becoming income, which then becomes expenditures for the households, which then become revenue for the firms.
3:19
So when people say the expenditure vs. the income view of GDP, they're saying ""look, I can measure GDP at any one of these points."" I could measure the expenditures at a time period by households, in this very simple model which would be the same as the revenue of firms
3:36
in this very simple model, which is the same as expenses plus profit of the firms in this simple model, which is same as the income of the household.
3:45
and so, the expenditure view of GDP would be looking in this very simple model, you see, it gets very complicated very fast, especially when we start thinking about expenditures, not just coming from households, but this is simplifying,
3:58
hugely simplified model to show you that these are the same thing, and say ""hey, look at GDP at this point, maybe at that point"".
4:06
If you wanna look at the income model, you can look at GDP at that point.
4:11
What we'll see as we go into future videos, as we break things between consumption and investment and government spending and net exports,
4:17
that it isn't quite this simple to diagram out, but when we do think about that, we are thinking when we are thinking about consumption and investment and government,
4:28
we are thinking about it from the expenditure point of view. There's another way of thinking about it, where you could have looked at the aggregate income in that country's point of view
4:34
making some adjustments for things like exports and imports and things like that.
4:38
But hopefully at least this clarifies why these come up with the same number from what you can see in this very simple model
4:44
and that there are two slightly different lenses on the same thing.","Suppose,in an ultra developed country,there is no space or sector left for more growth,then how the country grow its GDP further and why it is a must to grow GDP for that country?"

how the function that I just wrote
0:40
relates to the vectors that you're seeing.
0:42
So you see some of the vectors
0:43
are kind of pointing away from the origin.
0:45
Some are pointing in towards the origin.
0:50
So how can we understand this vector field
0:52
in terms of the function itself?
0:54
And a good step is to just zero in
0:55
on one of the components.
0:57
So in this case, I'll choose the z component
0:59
of the output
1:00
which is made up of x times y
1:03
and kind of start to understand
1:03
what that should be.
1:04
The z component will represent
1:06
how much the vector's pointing up or down.
1:08
This is the z axis
1:10
and the x-y plane here
1:11
so I'll point the z axis straight at our face.
1:13
This is the x axis, this is the y axis.
1:16
The values of x and y are going to completely determine
1:18
that z component.
1:20
So I'm going to go off to the side here
1:21
and just draw myself a little x-y plane for reference.
1:25
So this is my x value,
1:28
this is my y value.
1:30
And I want to understand the meaning
1:31
of the term ""x times y.""
1:35
So when both x and y are positive,
1:37
the product is positive.
1:39
And when both of them are negative,
1:40
the product is also positive.
1:43
If x is negative and y is positive,
1:45
the product is negative,
1:46
but if x is positive and y is negative,
1:48
the product is also negative.
1:50
So what this should mean,
1:51
in terms of our vector field,
1:52
is that when we're in this first quadrant,
1:54
vectors tend to point up in the z direction,
1:56
same over here in the third quadrant.
1:59
But over in the other two
1:59
they should tend to point down.
2:01
So let's focus in on that first quadrant
2:02
and try to look at what's going on.
2:04
So, you see like this vector here applies, this vector.
2:07
And all of them generally point upwards,
2:09
they have a positive z component.
2:11
So that seems in line with what we were predicting.
2:13
Whereas over here,
2:13
which corresponds to the fourth quadrant
2:15
of the x-y plane,
2:16
the z component of each vector tends to be down.
2:19
And they're doing other things
2:22
in terms of the x and y components,
2:23
it's not just z component action,
2:24
but right now we're just focusing on up and down.
2:26
And if you look over in the third quadrant,
2:29
they tend to be pointing up,
2:31
and that corresponds to the fact
2:32
that x times y will be positive.
2:34
And when you look at it,
2:35
it all starts to align that way.
2:36
And because I chose a rather symmetric function
2:38
you could imagine doing this where you,
2:40
you analyze also the y component here,
2:43
you analyze the x component in terms of y and z,
2:46
and it's actually going to look very similar
2:47
for understanding when the x component of a vector
2:50
tends to be positive,
2:51
like up here,
2:51
or when it turns out to be negative,
2:53
like over here,
2:54
and same with when the y component of the vector
2:55
tends to be negative,
2:56
or if the y component tends to be positive.
2:58
And overall, it's a very complicated image to look at,
3:02
but you can slowly piece by piece get a feel for it.
3:05
And just like with 2-dimensional vector fields,
3:07
the kind of neat thing to do
3:08
is imagine that this represents a fluid flow.
3:11
So you imagine like maybe air around you,
3:12
flowing in towards the origin here,
3:14
flowing out away from the origin there,
3:17
it would kind of be rotating around here,
3:19
and later on in multi-variable calculus,
3:21
you'll learn about various ways you can study
3:23
just the function itself and just the variables
3:25
and get a feel for how that fluid itself would behave,
3:28
even though it's a very complicated thing to think about,
3:30
it's even complicated to draw
3:31
or use graphic software with,
3:33
but just with analytic tools,
3:35
you can get very powerful results.
3:38
And these kind of things come up in physics all the time
3:40
because you're thinking in 3-dimensional space
3:42
and it doesn't just have to be fluid flow,
3:44
it could be a force field like an electric force field
3:47
or gravitational force field,
3:48
where each vector tells you
3:49
how a particle tends to get pushed.
3:52
And as we continue on with multi-variable calculus,
3:54
you'll get to see lots more examples.
3:56
But hopefully this helps give a small feel
3:57
for how you can go piece by piece
3:59
and understand something
4:00
that's kind of a complicated expression.",Can you tell me what programme you use to plot vector fields?

So, let's think about all the different ways that we can represent 7/9.
0:07
So let's just visualize 7/9.
0:10
So here I have 9 equal sections and 7 ninths you represent as 7 of those equal sections.
0:18
So let me get myself a bigger thing to draw with so that I can fill this in fast. I don't like how that looks, I'm going to use the paintbrush.
0:29
So here we go, so that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. So that's one way of representing 7 ninths, we already know that, that's not too interesting.
0:49
So let's see if we can represent it as the sum of other fractions.
0:53
So let's imagine, maybe we can represent it as, let's do it as 2 ninths (let me get another brush here) so let's represent it as 2 ninths.
1:05
2 over 9, plus ( I don't know) maybe 3 over 9, but that doesn't quite get us to 7 ninths yet.
1:20
2 over 9 plus 3 over 9, that's going to get us to 5 over 9 so we need 2 more, so that's going to be plus another 2 over 9.
1:28
Plus another 2/9, so what would this look like? So let's just draw another grid here, so this is going to look like (so I'm going to put it right below it so we can look at what it looks like).
1:46
So we have 2 ninths, this here is 2 ninths well we have nine equal sections.
1:53
So 2 ninths is going to be, 1 and 2.
2:02
And then we're going to add 3 more ninths, so one, two, three, so we add 3 ninths.
2:15
And then 2 more ninths, that's 1 and 2.
2:22
So notice, when I added 2 ninths to 3 ninths to 2 ninths, this equals 7 ninths.
2:30
And we know that when we add a bunch of fractions like this that have the same denominator, we can just add the numerators.
2:36
And this is why, this is 2/9 and 3/9 and 2/9 and they give me 7/9.
2:41
Actually, let's do this again, this is a lot of fun. So let me draw my grid again.
2:48
And then, let's see what we can do. So let me get my pen tool out and make sure my ink isn't too thick.
3:02
And let's add a couple of ninths. So let's add 1/9 and let's add 2/9 and then we could add (I dunno), maybe we could add 3/9.
3:22
And then we could add, that won't get us, let's see 1/9. I'm going to try to add 4 fractions here.
3:30
So first I'm going to try to add 1/9 and see where that get's us. 1/9 is going to get us right over here.
3:37
So that's 1/9, so let's say we add 2/9 to that. So that's 1 and 2, so that still doesn't get us there.
3:56
So that's 3/9, 1 plus 2 is 3. So let's add 4 ninths.
4:05
So 4/9. So let's see where this get's us. Actually, why not.
4:18
And so that's going to get us 1, 2, 3, 4. So that looks like it got us all the way. Because 1+2+4=7 so that's 7/9.
4:33
So what could we put here? We could actually put 0/9. Why not? So we could put in 0/9.
4:44
And how would we visualize that? Well we're saying none of these. So this is 1/9 plus 2/9 plus 4/9 equals 7/9.
4:53
So these are all different ways to decompose the exact same fraction.",Can you visualize improper fractions?

- [Voiceover] You often hear the phrase
0:01
like dissolves like when you're talking
0:03
about solubility and even though
0:05
this idea isn't perfect, it does allow
0:07
you to predict the solubility of compounds.
0:11
For example, a polar solvent will dissolve
0:14
a polar compound in general, so like dissolves like.
0:18
I also have here a polar solvent will dissolve
0:21
in ionic solute because you don't usually
0:24
describe ionic compounds as being polar.
0:28
Next, a nonpolar solvent will dissolve
0:31
a nonpolar compound, so like dissolves like,
0:35
but a polar solvent will not dissolve
0:39
a nonpolar compound, so this would
0:43
be like and unlike here.
0:46
An example of a polar solvent is water.
0:49
An example of a nonpolar compound
0:51
could be something like oil.
0:53
We know that water will not dissolve oil.
0:56
Let's go back to this first idea
0:58
of a polar solvent being able to
1:00
dissolve a polar compound or a
1:02
polar solvent dissolving an ionic compound
1:05
like sodium chloride.
1:07
We know from experience that sodium chloride,
1:09
or salt, is soluble in water.
1:12
Over here on the left we have part of a salt crystal.
1:17
We know that crystals are held together
1:20
by attractive forces, the positively charged
1:23
sodium cation is attracted to the
1:25
negatively charged chloride anion.
1:28
Opposite charges attract and our
1:31
crystal is held together by these attracted forces.
1:36
If we get some water molecules to come along,
1:38
we know that water is a polar solvent,
1:41
water is a polar molecule.
1:44
The oxygen is more electronegative
1:46
than this hydrogen, so the oxygen
1:48
pulls some of the electron density
1:49
in this bond closer to it giving it
1:51
a partial negative charge.
1:53
If we are withdrawing electron density
1:55
from this hydrogen, this hydrogen
1:57
gets a partial positive charge.
1:59
Since opposite charges attract, the partially positive
2:02
hydrogen in water is attracted to the
2:05
negatively charged chloride anion,
2:07
so there's an interaction here.
2:10
If we get a bunch of water molecules,
2:12
here's another one right here,
2:13
so partially negative oxygen, partially
2:15
positive hydrogen, so there's another attractive force.
2:18
We can pull off these chloride anions
2:20
from the solid and bring the anion into solution.
2:23
On the right here we have our chloride anion
2:26
in solution surrounded by a bunch of water molecules
2:30
and we have all these partially positive
2:33
hydrogens interacting with our
2:35
negatively charged chloride anion.
2:38
For the sodium cations let's go back
2:40
to our solid on the left.
2:42
Since the sodium cation is positively charged,
2:45
that's going to interact with the
2:46
partially negatively charged oxygen
2:49
in the water molecule, so opposite charges
2:51
attract and if you get enough water molecules
2:54
you can pull off these sodium cations
2:56
and bring the sodium cations into a solution.
2:59
We have the partially negative oxygens
3:02
on water interacting with our
3:04
positively charged sodium cations in our solution.
3:09
Our polar solvent, water, needs to be able to
3:13
interact with our solutes and in this case
3:17
the polar solvent attacks the solid
3:20
over here on the left and it replaces
3:22
these ion interactions of our crystal
3:26
with ion-dipole interactions in our solution.
3:30
By ion-dipole, I mean we have a cation right here,
3:33
so that's our ion and then our di-pole
3:35
would be water, water's a polar molecule,
3:38
it has di-pole moment, so we have all
3:40
of these ion di-pole interactions.
3:43
Ionic solutes that are able to participate
3:46
in these interactions will dissolve in water.
3:50
If you have a polar compound, right, a similar idea,
3:54
you have attractive forces that allow
3:56
the polar compounds to be dissolved
3:57
in a polar solvent like water.
4:00
Let's move on to a nonpolar compound,
4:03
so a nonpolar compound, something
4:05
like this molecule on the left here
4:08
and this molecule's called naphthalene.
4:10
Naphthalene is a solid with a
4:12
very distinctive smell to it.
4:14
The first time I smelled naphthalene in the lab
4:17
it reminded me of my grandparents' house
4:19
because my grandparents, when I was a kid,
4:20
had mothballs that were made of naphthalene,
4:23
so it's a very distinctive smell.
4:25
Now naphthalene is nonpolar because
4:27
it's composed of only carbons and hydrogens,
4:30
it's a hydrocarbon, so naphthalene is nonpolar
4:34
and you would need a nonpolar solvent
4:36
to get it to dissolve.
4:38
Toluene is a nonpolar solvent, again,
4:41
this is a hydrocarbon, so if you
4:43
take solid naphthalene and liquid toluene,
4:47
naphthalene will dissolve in toluene,
4:50
so like dissolves like, our nonpolar
4:53
solvent will dissolve our nonpolar compound.
4:57
Finally, let's look at this last idea here,
4:59
so a polar solvent, something like water,
5:02
should not dissolve a nonpolar compound,
5:05
something like naphthalene, and that's true,
5:08
naphthalene will not dissolve in water,
5:11
so water doesn't interact well enough
5:13
with the naphthalene molecules to
5:16
get them to dissolve and form a solution.
5:19
This concept of like dissolves like is important
5:22
because it allows you to predict whether
5:25
or not a compound will be soluble in water.
5:30
Let's look at several organic compounds
5:32
and determine whether or not those
5:33
compounds are soluble in water.
5:35
We'll start with ethanol.
5:37
Ethanol has a polar oxygen-hydrogen bond,
5:40
the oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen,
5:43
so the oxygen withdraws some electron density
5:45
making the oxygen partially negative
5:48
and leaving the hydrogen partially positive.
5:50
If water comes along, I'll draw in
5:52
a water molecule here, and we know that
5:56
water is a polar solvent, water is a polar molecule,
6:00
the oxygen has a partial negative and the
6:02
hydrogens have partial positive charges.
6:05
We can see that there's an opportunity
6:07
for an attractive force, opposite charges
6:09
attract, so the partially positive
6:12
hydrogen on ethanol is attracted
6:14
to the partially negatively charged oxygen on water.
6:17
This is an example of hydrogen bond density,
6:20
remember hydrogen bonding from earlier videos.
6:24
Here is a good example of that.
6:26
We can even have some more hydrogen bonding,
6:28
I could draw in another water molecule down here,
6:31
so let me go ahead and do that,
6:32
we know that the oxygen is partially negative,
6:35
hydrogens are partially positive,
6:37
so here's another opportunity for hydrogen bonding
6:40
between partially negative oxygen on ethanol
6:43
and the partially positive hydrogen on water.
6:46
This portion of the ethanol molecule is polar
6:49
and loves water, so this is the polar region
6:53
and this portion loves water, we call this
6:56
hydrophilic, so let me write that down here
6:59
so this portion of the molecule is hydrophilic,
7:02
or water loving.
7:04
Let's look at the other portion of the ethanol molecule,
7:06
so this portion on the left.
7:08
We have a CH2 here and a CH3 here,
7:11
so carbons and hydrogens which
7:13
we know are nonpolar, so this region
7:16
is nonpolar, this region doesn't like water,
7:20
it's scared of water, we call this hydrophobic,
7:24
or water fearing.
7:26
We know that ethanol is soluble in water
7:28
just by experience, so that must mean
7:31
this hydrophobic region doesn't
7:33
overcome the hydrophilic region,
7:36
so the hydrophilic region is polar region
7:38
of the ethanol molecule, it's enough
7:40
to make ethanol soluble in water.
7:42
If you think about that same concept
7:44
and look at a different molecule,
7:46
so on the right here's 1-octanol.
7:48
1-octanol has an opportunity for hydrogen bonding
7:51
we have this OH here, so it's the
7:53
same situation as the ethanol on the left,
7:56
so we have a polar or hydrophilic region of the molecule.
8:00
However, the difference is this time
8:02
we have extremely large nonpolar
8:05
hydrophobic portion of the molecule.
8:08
This nonpolar region overcomes
8:10
the slightly polar region making the
8:13
1-octanol molecule nonpolar overall,
8:17
so 1-octanol will not dissolve in water.
8:21
This one is a no and this one over here
8:24
was a yes, ethanol is a yes.
8:27
Next, let's look at cinnamaldehyde,
8:29
so down here on the left is cinnamaldehyde,
8:32
let's focus in on, let's focus in on
8:33
this carbon oxygen double bond first.
8:36
We know that oxygen is more
8:38
electronegative than this carbon here,
8:40
so the oxygen withdraws from the electron density
8:43
making it partially negative and this
8:45
carbon would be there for partially positive.
8:48
This very small portion of the molecule
8:50
is polar, this small portion could interact with water.
8:54
However, we have an extremely large,
8:56
nonpolar region of the molecule, all of these
8:59
carbons and hydrogens over here on the left.
9:03
This very hydrophobic region, or nonpolar region,
9:06
overcomes the small polar region
9:08
making cinnamaldehyde overall nonpolar.
9:12
Since it's overall nonpolar, cinnamaldehyde
9:14
will not dissolve in water.
9:17
If it's nonpolar, you would need a more nonpolar solvent
9:20
to get cinnamaldehyde to dissolve
9:22
and there are several examples of
9:23
nonpolar organic solvents that will do that.
9:27
Next let's look at sucrose, so over here
9:30
on the right is sucrose or one way
9:32
to draw or represent the sucrose compound.
9:36
Now we see lots of carbons and hydrogens,
9:39
so all of these right here, let me just
9:41
go ahead and highlight all these carbons in this ring
9:43
and so all these carbons in these rings,
9:45
all these hydrogens, so at first you might think
9:49
okay, there's lots of carbons and hydrogens,
9:51
this might be nonpolar, but of course we have
9:54
lots of these OH groups, so I'm gonna
9:57
go ahead and circle a few of them,
9:58
right, we have all of these OH groups
10:00
in the sucrose molecules, so lots of them.
10:03
That means opportunities for hydrogen bonding.
10:07
Because of all these opportunities
10:09
for hydrogen bonding, sucrose is soluble in water
10:13
which we know from experience.
10:14
Of course sucrose, or sugar, sugar will
10:16
dissolve in water, so the opportunity
10:19
for hydrogen bonding is the reason for that.
10:23
Benzoic acid is a solid at room temperature.
10:26
If you take some benzoic acid crystals
10:28
and you put them in some room temperature water,
10:30
the crystals won't dissolve.
10:32
We can explain that by looking
10:34
at the structure for benzoic acid.
10:36
While we do have this portion of the compound
10:39
which we know is polar and hydrophilic
10:41
due to the presence of the electronegative oxygens,
10:44
we also have this portion of the compound
10:47
on the left which is nonpolar and hydrophobic
10:50
due to the presence of all the carbons and hydrogens.
10:53
Since the benzoic acid crystals don't
10:55
dissolve at room temperature water,
10:57
the hydrophobic portion of the compound
10:59
must overcome the hydrophilic portion of the compound.
11:03
You actually can get benzoic acid
11:05
crystals to dissolve in water if you heat up the water,
11:08
if you increase the solubility of the compound
11:11
by increasing the temperature of the solvent.
11:14
Let's think about benzoic acid crystals
11:16
in room temperature water and let's add a base,
11:19
let's add sodium hydroxide.
11:22
The sodium hydroxide's going to react
11:24
with the most acidic proton on benzoic acid,
11:27
so benzoic acid is acidic, it will
11:29
donate this proton right here.
11:32
That means the electrons in red in this bond
11:34
are left behind on the oxygen,
11:36
so I'll show those electrons in red over here.
11:39
That's gives this oxygen a negative charge
11:41
and we form sodium benzoate.
11:44
I won't get too much into acid base chemistry,
11:47
but we took the most acidic proton off of benzoic acid
11:50
to give us the conjugate base sodium benzoate.
11:53
Sodium benzoate is highly soluble
11:56
in room temperature water.
11:58
That must mean we increase this
12:01
hydrophilic portion because now we have
12:04
a negative charge, so the hydrophilic portion
12:07
now is able to overcome the hydrophobic portion.
12:11
Sodium benzoate is soluble,
12:14
this negative charge is better able
12:16
to interact with our solvent which is water.",In cinemaldehyde ....Oxygen acquires a negative charge and the carbon atom bonded to it acquires a positive charge....k now what will happen to the hydrogen atom bonded to carbon atom?

China has been ruled by various dynasties
0:31
for multiple thousands of years.
0:34
But as you get into the 1900s, the dynastic rule,
0:38
in particular the Qing Dynasty, was getting weaker and weaker.
0:43
It had suffered at the hands of the Japanese
0:45
during the first Sino-Japanese War at the end of the 1800s.
0:50
There was growing discontent amongst the opposition
0:53
that the dynasty, that the emperors,
0:55
were not modernizing China enough.
0:57
Remember, this is the early 1900s.
0:59
The rest of the world was becoming a very, very modern
1:01
place.
1:02
China in the 1800s had suffered at the hands of Western powers
1:06
who were essentially exerting their own imperial influence
1:10
in China.
1:11
Many people felt that this was because China was not
1:14
as modernized economically, politically,
1:17
technologically as it needed to be.
1:20
And so you fast-forward to 1911.
1:22
You have what is known as the Wuchang Uprising, which
1:26
led to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty.
1:30
By 1912, a Republic of China was established in Nanjing.
1:35
So Nanjing right over here was where it was established.
1:38
Beijing was, of course, the seat of dynastic rule in China.
1:43
And the first provisional president
1:45
of the Republic of China was Dr. Sun Yat-sen, right over here.
1:51
And he actually did not directly participate
1:53
in this final uprising that finally
1:55
led to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty.
1:59
He was actually in Denver at the time, Denver, Colorado.
2:02
But he was a leading or one of the leading figures in the run
2:05
up to this uprising, one of the leading figures
2:07
who was providing opposition and had tried
2:10
multiple times to overthrow the dynasty.
2:13
Now along with Sun Yat-sen, he was essentially in cahoots
2:17
with Yuan Shikai, who was a general in the old dynasty.
2:21
And he has his own fascinating history.
2:24
And Sun Yat-sen struck a deal with Yuan Shikai,
2:27
who was very politically ambitious.
2:30
Yuan Shikai said, hey, if I can get the emperor Puyi, who
2:33
was the last emperor of China, if I can get him to officially
2:37
abdicate, I want to become the president.
2:40
So Sun Yat-sen agrees to this.
2:43
So Yuan Shikai becomes the president
2:48
of the Republic of China.
2:50
But that wasn't enough for him.
2:52
He declares himself emperor in 1915,
2:56
which you could imagine did not make many people happy
2:58
because they were tired of having emperors.
3:01
And by 1916, he abdicates and he passes away, actually.
3:06
And this actually begins a period
3:09
of extremely fragmented rule for China.
3:13
Even under imperial rule, the Chinese military
3:16
was not one consolidated body.
3:18
The military was controlled by various warlords
3:21
in various regions that all had allegiance to the emperor.
3:25
Once you have Yuan Shikai abdicating and then dying
3:29
in 1916, and even prior to that, when
3:31
he declared himself emperor, people
3:33
did not want to pledge allegiance to Yuan Shikai.
3:37
And so you had what is known as the beginning of the Warlord
3:40
Era in China.
3:42
And this is a fragmented period where you did not
3:44
have any centralized leadership.
3:47
This map over here shows kind of the rough picture
3:51
of what the Warlord Era looked like.
3:53
Each of these regions were controlled
3:55
by a different warlord who was in charge
3:57
of a different military.
3:59
When this was going on during the Warlord Era,
4:02
especially as we go back to the early '20s, in 1921
4:05
in particular, Sun Yat-sen hasn't given up.
4:09
He goes to the south in Guangzhou
4:12
and sets up, essentially, a revolutionary government,
4:16
essentially a desire from there to try
4:19
to consolidate power in China again and reestablish
4:23
the Republic of China.
4:25
So he goes there.
4:27
But unfortunately he passes away in 1925 from cancer.
4:32
And the hands or the power of the movement that he started,
4:38
which is now being referred to as the Kuomintang-- Let me
4:42
write that down.
4:53
Essentially, the power there passes on
4:56
to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.
5:00
And Chiang Kai-shek, the reason why
5:01
we say the power essentially goes to him
5:03
is because he was in control of the major part
5:05
of the military forces of the Kuomintang.
5:09
And this is essentially the very nascent early stages
5:13
of what would essentially be the Chinese Civil
5:15
War because in the period from 1921 until Sun Yat-sen's death,
5:22
you actually had a lot of collaboration
5:24
between the Chinese nationalists, the Kuomintang,
5:27
and the Soviet Union, and the Chinese Communist Party.
5:31
They were trying to collaborate in order
5:33
to think about how China would unify.
5:36
But then once Sun Yat-sen dies and the power of the Kuomintang
5:41
essentially goes into the hands of Generalissimo Chiang
5:44
Kai-shek, he starts to consolidate power.
5:48
And right from the get-go, he doesn't
5:50
antagonize the communists.
5:51
But by 1927, he's starting to consolidate,
5:56
he's starting to merge these various factions
6:01
in the rest of China.
6:02
So he's able to consolidate power.
6:04
But he also starts to go after the communists.
6:08
So Chiang Kai-shek, by '27, also starts
6:11
to go after the communists.
6:13
And the communists are saying, hey, we
6:14
are the ones that really represent the spirit of what
6:18
Sun Yat-sen represented, while the Kuomintang
6:21
under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek said, no, no, no.
6:23
We represent what Sun Yat-sen represented when he first
6:28
established the Republic of China.
6:31
And so in 1927, you have the beginning of the Chinese Civil
6:36
War.
6:37
This is when the Kuomintang, as part of its efforts
6:39
to consolidate power, not only tries
6:41
to consolidate power of the warlords,
6:43
but also goes after the Communist Party.
6:46
Now while all of this is happening,
6:48
as we get into the early 1930s, Japan once again
6:53
is trying to exert its imperial, its military,
6:56
might on the Chinese mainland.
6:58
They had already captured Formosa,
7:00
which is now known as Taiwan, and Korea
7:03
during the first Sino-Japanese War at the end of the 1800s.
7:07
And then in 1931, the Japanese start to encroach on Manchuria.
7:16
And this would essentially become a multi-year occupation
7:19
and infiltration of Japan into China.
7:23
And this continues all the way until 1937,
7:26
when it becomes an official all-out war
7:29
between the Japanese and the Chinese.
7:32
And I have a map here that shows kind
7:35
of the maximum Japanese control over this period.
7:40
And so in east Asia between the Chinese and the Japanese,
7:43
World War II was really just part of the Sino-Japanese War.
7:49
The Japanese had already encroached
7:51
on the mainland of China well before World War
7:56
II had officially begun.
7:58
Now while all this is happening, Japan
8:01
is encroaching into Manchuria, in 1934, you have to remember,
8:04
the Kuomintang, the Nationalist Party under Chiang Kai-shek
8:08
is going after the communists.
8:11
And in 1934, he almost has them, or he does.
8:16
The communists are nearly defeated.
8:20
They're surrounded by the Nationalist Party.
8:22
And this becomes what is a fairly famous event
8:25
in Chinese history, the famous Long March, where
8:28
the Chinese Communist Party, their military,
8:31
is marched through extremely tough terrain
8:34
all the way to the northwest of China.
8:38
So this right over here is a map of the Long March.
8:42
The Chinese Communist Party seemed to be on the ropes
8:46
here in 1934.
8:48
And it was during this Long March
8:50
that Mao Zedong really started to exert and show leadership.
8:55
The leadership during this Long March,
8:57
during this retreat to the northwest of China,
9:00
is really what allowed Mao Zedong to eventually take
9:02
control of the Chinese Communist Party.
9:06
Now as we fast forward, we know that the Sino-Japanese War--
9:10
you could view this as one theater, eventually, of World
9:12
War II-- eventually the US goes in on the side
9:16
of the Allies against Japan after Pearl Harbor.
9:19
And then in 1945, you have the attacks
9:25
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic weapons,
9:27
which essentially ends the Pacific theater.
9:30
It's defeat for Japan, and Japan has lost World War II.
9:36
And at this point, full-scale civil war
9:38
between the two parties break out again.
9:40
The Civil War started in 1927, and then it kept continuing.
9:45
But then once there was a common enemy in Japan that was clearly
9:48
aggressively trying to take over more and more of China's
9:53
people, resources, exert its imperial influence,
9:56
then you had the two parties kind of go into a low-grade war
9:59
and say, hey, we need to fight these Japanese.
10:01
But once World War II ended in 1945,
10:04
once the Japanese were defeated, then you
10:06
had full-scale civil war break out
10:08
again between the Chinese Communist
10:10
Party and the Kuomintang.
10:12
And this is probably one of the biggest comebacks in history.
10:14
This was the Chinese Communist Party that in 1934 and 1935
10:18
looked like they were on the ropes.
10:20
They were forced into, essentially, retreat.
10:23
They were able to come back.
10:25
And in 1949-- and there's a lot of theories
10:28
as to why they were able to pull this off.
10:31
That they were able to get much more of the support
10:33
from the rural population.
10:35
They were more savvy about getting support generally
10:37
than the Kuomintang.
10:38
But we could talk about that in a future video.
10:41
But by 1949, they were able to defeat
10:44
Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang,
10:46
force the Kuomintang to retreat to Taiwan,
10:53
establish government in Taiwan.
10:56
And ever since then, you had the establishment
10:58
by the Chinese Communist Party in 1949
11:02
of the People's Republic of China.",Was the Chinese Civil War of 1946-1949 a continuation of the Civil War of 1927-1936?

0:12
So this is an airplane here.
0:15
OK, so you probably already knew that.
0:18
If you've flown in one, or maybe just seen them fly.
0:22
But even if you've seen them or been in one,
0:24
do you know how they work?
0:26
Is it magic?
0:27
[CHANTS GIBBERISH]
0:29
Are there invisible fairies that hold the plane aloft?
0:32
All right, men.
0:33
We've got a busy morning and lots of flights to carry.
0:36
Or is it science?
0:39
Well, you can guess that the answer is indeed science.
0:43
That's ridiculous.
0:45
What?
0:47
So to discuss how an airplane flies,
0:50
we first have to talk about the forces
0:52
on an airplane which push it around
0:54
in all sorts of different directions.
0:56
Now we're going to focus on airplanes today
0:59
because they're awesome, but most of these forces
1:03
apply to any other vehicle.
1:05
The first force acts on all these vehicles-- really,
1:09
it acts on everything.
1:11
It's the weight force, which points down
1:14
towards the center of Earth.
1:17
Weights is equal to the mass of the airplane-- m
1:21
right here-- times the acceleration due to gravity.
1:25
Here on Earth, g is equal to 9.81 meters per second squared.
1:31
Now that's only for Earth.
1:33
The acceleration due to gravity really
1:36
depends on the mass of the planet that your are on.
1:39
The larger the planet, the higher the gravity.
1:41
So 9.81 meters per second squared here on Earth.
1:45
The moon, however-- it's smaller than Earth.
1:48
So the acceleration due to gravity is only 1/6
1:51
that on Earth-- 1.6 meters per second squared.
1:56
This is why astronauts can bounce high on the moon,
1:59
but not on Earth.
2:02
This isn't nearly as much fun.
2:04
Obviously, there has to be another force
2:06
opposing the weight and pushing the airplane up.
2:09
This force is called lift.
2:13
Lift operates perpendicular to the airplane's wings, which are
2:18
right here in this side view.
2:20
Now, if these are our only two forces,
2:22
our aircraft will be able to go up and down,
2:25
but it won't go anywhere.
2:27
So we have to have a force that pushes the airplane forward,
2:31
and this is called thrust.
2:36
All vehicles have thrust, otherwise
2:38
they wouldn't go anywhere like our airplane.
2:41
Why didn't you buy a car with thrust?
2:43
I'm sorry.
2:44
We can at least roll down the hill.
2:47
On an aircraft, this thrust is produced by engines.
2:51
There are two main types of engines.
2:54
We have propellers, like this little guy right here.
2:57
And jet engines, like our first model.
3:01
Whatever the type of engines, they all
3:03
work by the same principle.
3:05
Let's draw a little side view of an engine here.
3:09
The engines accelerate air out the back this direction.
3:14
And by Newton's third law, there's
3:17
an equal and opposite reaction, and that's
3:20
the thrust force pushing the aircraft forward.
3:24
This is really the same thing that happens when you blow up
3:26
a balloon and you let it go.
3:28
The air come out the back and the balloon moves forward.
3:32
We have a force that opposes the thrust.
3:36
It's called drag.
3:37
It points opposite the direction of flight.
3:41
The major type of drag is pressure drag,
3:43
which is the force caused by the air smacking into the airplane.
3:48
So we try to minimize this type of drag
3:50
by making the airplane as aerodynamic as possible.
3:54
That means that it has smooth lines
3:57
in the air flows nice and cleanly over the front here.
4:00
You can feel the pressure drag when you stick your hand
4:02
out the window of a moving car.
4:04
Uh, honey, honey.
4:06
Your hand-- your hand, please.
4:08
When your hand this horizontal, it's aerodynamic
4:11
and you really don't feel a lot of drag.
4:13
But if you slowly turn your hand vertical,
4:15
you really feel the drag increasing.
4:19
So these are our four forces on the airplane,
4:22
but perhaps you're thinking--
4:24
So this really cool and everything,
4:26
but how do we increase and decrease the airplanes lift
4:29
to move up and down?
4:30
That's a great question.
4:32
Let's look at the equation for the magnitude
4:34
of lift per unit wing area.
4:36
We'll call that L. L equals 1/2 times rho times
4:42
cl times v squared.
4:46
That simple.
4:48
OK, OK, I'll tell you what each of these things mean.
4:51
So rho-- it's not a P. It's the Greek letter, rho.
4:55
Rho is the density of the air, which
4:57
is a measure of the number of air
4:59
molecules in a certain volume.
5:01
Density of the air varies with altitude and temperature,
5:06
so you go higher up.
5:08
There, the air is thinner, and so the density is lower.
5:12
If we want to simplify things, we generally
5:13
use the standard density, which is 1.2754 kilograms per meters
5:21
cubed.
5:23
v here is the speed of the aircraft,
5:26
or how fast it's traveling.
5:28
And cl is something called the coefficient of lift.
5:32
It's a number that gives us some information
5:35
about the shape of the aircraft's wings-- these things
5:38
right here.
5:39
The coefficient of lift changes with the angle of attack.
5:44
Angle of what?
5:45
Aircraft can pitch up and down, and even if they're pitched up,
5:50
they're still traveling in a horizontal direction like that.
5:55
Now the angle formed here by the horizontal direction of travel
6:00
and the direction of the aircraft's nose
6:03
is called the angle of attack, and we
6:06
denote that with the Greek letter alpha.
6:10
So we can make a little plot here of that.
6:12
We're going to put coefficient of lift up on the y-axis,
6:16
and the angle of attack down on the x-axis.
6:20
So as the airplane starts to pitch up--
6:23
if I can get a little hand here-- thank you.
6:27
As the aircraft starts to pitch up, the coefficient of lift
6:30
increases.
6:31
This is a good thing because we have more lift.
6:35
As we continue to increase, we eventually
6:37
reach a point where we keep pitching up
6:40
but the lift starts decreasing.
6:43
This is something called stall, and it's not a good thing.
6:49
So we generally avoid try to pitching up this much.
6:53
There's a similar equation for the drag per unit wing area,
6:56
D. D equals 1/2 rho.
7:01
Not cl-- that wouldn't make any sense.
7:03
cd, as you can guess, is the coefficient of drag times
7:08
the velocity squared.
7:10
The coefficient of drag is-- it's
7:12
another number that tells us something about the wings,
7:15
and it also varies with the angle of attack.
7:18
So as the angle of attack increases--
7:21
oh, thank you-- the coefficient of drag increases as well.
7:26
Thank you very much.
7:28
This is because as the aircraft is pitching up,
7:33
there is more wing area perpendicular to the flow.
7:38
Now, this reminds me of something
7:41
that we talked about earlier.
7:44
Exactly.
7:45
This is very similar to whenever you hold your hand
7:49
out the window of a car.
7:51
And so, that's pretty much everything
7:55
you need know about how an aircraft flies.
7:59
So the next time you're on an airplane or you just see one,
8:03
you can really know exactly what it is that's keeping it up
8:05
in the air.
8:07
Nope.
8:08
No, it's not them either.
8:09
Ah, there you are.
8:11
Now you got it.",How does it work in War flights when the angle of attack is sometimes even 90 degrees?

Voiceover: The purpose of the immune system
0:03
is to fight things.
0:05
To fight bacteria and viruses and other things
0:07
that you don't want in your body.
0:10
That's what it does.
0:11
The question we can ask is
0:12
how does the immune system know not
0:14
to attack your own body,
0:16
and that might seem like a strange question
0:18
or an obvious question
0:19
but it's actually not obvious the answer to it.
0:23
In this video we're gonna go into why it's not obvious
0:26
and then how the body actually
0:28
does prevent its immune system from attacking itself.
0:31
Another way of saying is this
0:33
how does the body distinguish self versus non-self?
0:39
By that we mean how does it tell the difference
0:41
between your own body, your own proteins,
0:44
your own cells
0:45
and foreign proteins or cells
0:48
or things that shouldn't be in your body.
0:50
How does it know to attack these
0:52
and not to attack this.
0:54
To find out why the question itself is not obvious
0:57
let's go back to B cells and talk about B cells.
1:01
Here we have a B cell
1:02
and here is its nucleus with some DNA
1:04
and the most important part of the B cell
1:07
that we care most about is its B cell receptor
1:11
which later if it becomes active
1:13
can be released as an antibody.
1:17
Now this B cell receptor is what's gonna bind
1:19
to foreign, pieces of foreign bacteria or viruses
1:23
and these antibodies are gonna bind to those things
1:25
and help your body get rid of them.
1:28
The important thing to remember about B cells
1:30
is that these antibodies
1:31
or these B cell receptors are coded
1:33
in the DNA of the B cell,
1:35
but that they're different for every B cell.
1:38
Every B cell has a unique set of antibodies
1:42
and B cell receptors that it makes.
1:45
We'll give them slightly different colors
1:47
to make that obvious.
1:48
Here's one with slightly different DNA
1:50
and a slightly different B cell receptor.
1:53
The really critical point to remember
1:54
is that these B cell receptors that will become antibodies
1:58
are generated at random.
2:00
Your body kind of shuffles the DNA here
2:03
and creates a unique B cell receptor
2:05
and antibody for each B cell.
2:08
It's precisely that fact
2:10
which is that they're created at random
2:12
which means that your body is in danger of creating
2:15
B cell receptors and antibodies
2:17
that can react to your own body
2:19
because while this guy might be good,
2:21
while he might react to let's say
2:23
a bacteria out here that you want to get rid of,
2:26
while that's good.
2:28
This guy might easily create a B cell receptor
2:31
and later an antibody that can react
2:33
to something you don't want it to react to.
2:35
For example, let's say this is
2:37
an important protein in your body
2:39
maybe it's insulin.
2:41
You would not want a B cell to be created
2:43
which will react to insulin
2:45
because then maybe it will start creating antibodies
2:47
that bind all the insulin in your blood
2:50
and if you don't know what insulin does
2:51
don't worry about it but by binding to insulin
2:53
it will prevent insulin from doing its function
2:55
which is very important.
2:58
How can you keep your body from making B cells

that would react to yourself?
3:04
In fact there's no way to do it
3:06
because as I said,
3:07
this process of creating different
3:10
B cell receptors and antibodies is totally random.
3:12
There's no way to keep your body
3:14
from making B cell receptors
3:16
or B cells that will react to yourself.
3:19
What does that mean?
3:20
That means that you're gonna make them
3:21
but you need to find a way to figure out
3:23
which ones are reacting to you
3:25
and to get rid of them.
3:26
You need to figure out a way
3:27
to kill the ones you don't want.
3:30
By the way we're talking about B cells here.
3:33
B cells.
3:34
Everything we're saying is equally applicable to T cells.
3:38
Let me draw one here.
3:40
T cells it's equally applicable
3:42
because T cells also have a T cell receptor
3:45
that's generated at random
3:46
and you only want that T cell receptor
3:48
to react to foreign things.
3:50
To non-self things and not to self things.
3:55
The processes we're gonna talk about are
3:56
equally true, maybe even in some cases
3:58
more so true for T cells and B cells.
4:01
Let's go to the bone marrow
4:03
to figure out how this process works,
4:05
and we're going to the bone marrow
4:07
because that's where B cells come from.
4:09
It's where they get their unique antibody,
4:12
your B cell receptor.
4:14
They get that by changing their DNA
4:16
a tiny little bit by shuffling pieces around.
4:18
Let's look at a couple of these B cells
4:20
which are still young.
4:22
They haven't yet been allowed out of the bone marrow.
4:24
They haven't been vetted
4:25
to see if they should be allowed out.
4:28
Each one has its unique receptor.
4:31
Let's draw a few of those receptors here.
4:34
Let's say that one of these guys reacts to self.
4:39
One of them reacts to some protein in your own body
4:42
that you don't want it to.
4:44
Again, that just happened at random
4:46
because you're creating these receptors
4:47
really at random.
4:49
Let's say that the guy
4:51
that we're gonna want to get rid of this one
4:53
because he reacts to let's say it's insulin again
4:55
like up there.
4:56
Really we should have drawn insulin in yellow
4:59
to show that it goes with this receptor.
5:02
Let's say this guy reacts to insulin.
5:04
How can you figure out that this guy reacts to self?
5:08
The answer is actually quite simple.
5:09
The answer is that you just need to keep around
5:11
the various proteins that your body uses.
5:15
You need to keep them around in the bone marrow
5:16
while these B cells are being vetted.
5:20
For example here you'll have a little insulin.
5:23
Very small amount but it will be there.
5:26
You'll have a little bit of some other protein.
5:29
Let's say maybe hemoglobin.
5:32
You'll have some other protein here.
5:35
You'll have yet another protein over here.
5:39
All these proteins will be around.
5:42
What your body does at this stage and development
5:45
is it says whatever B cell binds to something,
5:49
wherever B cell binds to something
5:50
with its B cell receptor
5:52
in the bone marrow will be killed.
5:57
This B cell right here
5:59
that recognizes this insulin protein
6:03
the fact that it recognizes it,
6:04
it means that it will bind
6:05
and that will cause a little bit of a chemical change
6:08
in the B cell or something,
6:09
and one thing will lead to another
6:11
and the whole system will be programmed
6:12
so that as a result this guy will die.
6:16
Every B cell that recognizes self
6:20
if it sees that self molecule in the bone marrow
6:24
it will be killed.
6:27
This works because your bone marrow
6:28
will have most of the abundant proteins in your body.
6:32
They'll be present there so that you can make sure
6:35
that you weed out all the B cells that react to self.
6:39
Now what happens after this step is that
6:41
these guys who have been vetted
6:43
they can proceed onwards to maybe a lymph node.
6:47
Somewhere where they can begin to actually be active
6:50
now that they've sort of gone through
6:53
basic training here in the bone marrow.
6:56
You might ask yourself, well, what about here?
6:58
What about here when one of these B cells
7:01
that doesn't react to self,
7:02
what about when it interacts with a bacteria
7:05
that you actually want it to fight?
7:08
Is the same thing gonna happen?
7:09
Is it going to die just because it recognizes
7:12
the molecule that its made to bind to?
7:17
The answer is obviously not.
7:18
You don't want this guy to die because you need him.
7:21
Because you want to fight this bacteria.
7:23
The reason why he doesn't die is because
7:25
well, we're in a different environment.
7:27
There are different rules,
7:28
there are different other cells around
7:29
and this B cell has matured and become different.
7:33
The rules are different
7:34
and he's not going to die.
7:35
This weeding out of B cells
7:37
that react to self proteins is
7:41
sort of the first of two mechanisms
7:44
that I'd like to talk about that the body uses
7:47
to not react to self.
7:49
Actually the same thing exact thing happens for T cells
7:53
except it doesn't happen in the bone marrow,
7:55
it happens in the thymus
7:56
because that's where T cells mature.
8:00
In the thymus we have really the identical process
8:03
where T cells differentiate
8:05
and each one has a unique receptor
8:07
and the ones that reacts to self in the thymus
8:10
too strongly are killed.
8:13
It's not a foolproof method
8:14
or else we wouldn't need step two.
8:16
Every once in a while a B cell will get out there.
8:20
A B cell will escape which reacts to self.
8:25
It's just because every process has its mistakes
8:28
and maybe you don't have
8:29
every single protein here in the bone marrow
8:32
and enough abundance to find the B cells
8:35
that reacts to a protein of your own body.
8:38
Let's say this is a B cell that escaped the bone marrow
8:40
even though it reacts to self.
8:42
What's gonna happen now?
8:44
It's gonna find that protein
8:47
that it was sort of made at random to react with.
8:50
It's gonna find that protein
8:51
that your body makes and that your body needs
8:53
and it's going to bind to it.
8:55
What's it gonna do now?
8:56
If you remember it's now going to take that protein
9:00
ingest it, break it up into little pieces
9:03
and then present it on an MHC II molecule.
9:12
If you recall it will just present
9:13
a small piece of that protein on the MHC II molecule.
9:16
Maybe it will present a different piece of protein
9:18
on a different MHC II molecule over here,
9:21
something like that.
9:22
The reason it does this is
9:25
because it needs a T cell to come along.
9:28
Here's a T cell.
9:30
It needs a T cell to come along
9:31
that will recognize that same piece
9:35
that is put there on its surface.
9:38
It needs that in order to activate it.
9:40
It's going to sit there
9:40
and wait for this T cell to come along
9:42
who has the perfect receptor.
9:45
Here's that T cell.
9:47
They're going to interact
9:49
and they're gonna have some kind of
9:51
intracellular kiss
9:53
that's going to finally allow this B cell to activate.
9:57
Usually without the T cell coming
10:00
and recognizing the antigen that the B cell reacts to
10:04
the B cell cannot activate.
10:06
It needs this T cell to recognize it.
10:08
This is exactly the second mechanism of defense
10:12
that I'd like to bring to your attention
10:15
which is that even if a B cell escapes
10:18
that reacts to self.
10:20
Almost always it's also going to need a T cell
10:23
that reacts to self to come and activate it.
10:26
You need both the B cell to escape
10:28
the weeding out in the bone marrow
10:31
and the T cell to escape the weeding out in the thymus
10:35
for you to get an active B cell
10:37
that's now going to start putting out antibodies
10:40
that react to self.
10:43
By the way, this cellular kiss here
10:46
is usually going on in the lymph node.
10:49
Looking at this whole process
10:51
you might have a few complaints.
10:53
I encourage you think about how it might go wrong.
10:57
One way you might think it could go wrong is
10:59
what if bacteria got into the bone marrow
11:02
and certainly that's very, very possible
11:04
because when you get infections
11:05
the thing that's infecting you
11:06
can move around your body.
11:08
If this bacterium gets into your bone marrow
11:11
does that mean that now this B cell
11:13
is going to bind to it
11:15
and therefore it's going to be killed?
11:17
Because at this stage whenever the B cells
11:18
bind to something they're killed.
11:20
The answer is yes.
11:21
This is exactly what happens.
11:23
The reason why it's not too much of a problem is that
11:26
even if you have this bacterium here in the bone marrow
11:29
for a week or two or maybe a month,
11:33
after that once this bacterium goes away or it's killed
11:36
then it won't be there anymore
11:37
and you can start producing these B cells
11:39
that react to that bacterium again.
11:42
Hopefully you already had a bunch of these B cells
11:44
that could react to this bacterium
11:46
that you had made previously
11:48
and that were already out in the lymph nodes.
11:51
Those guys will be there to fight the infection
11:54
while maybe the infection might be in your bone marrow
11:56
preventing you from making more of those B cells
11:59
to kill it.
12:00
You already have some of those B cells
12:01
out there in the lymph nodes
12:03
and they can proliferate out there
12:04
and sort of lead the battle from there.
12:07
Now even though your body has these mechanisms
12:09
to keep your immune system
12:11
from reacting to yourself
12:12
it still happens sometimes.
12:15
The process still goes wrong sometimes
12:16
and the result is autoimmune disease.
12:23
It's called autoimmune because you're immune to yourself.
12:27
Your immune system basically starts attacking your own body
12:30
and some pretty terrible disease can result.
12:33
To kind of bring it to life
12:34
where I'd like to tell you about one example of this.
12:38
This is a muscle fiber
12:40
and the way your muscle fibers are activated
12:45
because you don't want to be flexing
12:46
all of your muscles all the time
12:48
the way that they're activated is that
12:49
they have a little receptor which I'll draw here.
12:53
This receptor is ready to receive
12:57
little molecules from a neuron, part of a nerve.
13:03
It receives little molecules from this neuron
13:05
that activate this receptor
13:07
and therefore activate the muscle fiber.
13:10
If you want to tighten this muscle fiber
13:12
you just need to send the signal down a neuron
13:15
and they'll release the little molecules
13:16
which will activate the muscle fiber.
13:19
In one example of autoimmune disease
13:21
you get antibodies against this receptor here on the muscle.
13:27
They bind to it
13:29
and that either stops it from functioning.
13:31
It makes it impossible for it to react to the neuron signals
13:35
or causes that receptor to be destroyed.
13:38
Those are two mechanisms that have been seen.
13:42
In this autoimmune disease what do you think will happen?
13:45
What happens is that
13:47
your body can no longer
13:49
activate muscle fibers as easily.
13:51
The disease is called myasthenia gravis
13:58
and the etymology of that is ""my"" it means muscle
14:03
and ""asthenia"" means weakness.
14:06
Muscle weakness and gravis just means it's serious
14:09
because it gets serious over time.
14:11
If you can't activate the muscle fibers in your body
14:13
you slowly become paralyzed.
14:16
You don't need to remember this exact mechanism.
14:20
That's not really important
14:21
but I just wanted to give an example of
14:23
one kind of autoimmune disease and how it works.",can any auto-immune diseases be treated by injecting auto-antigens into the bone marrow or thymus?

0:00
For those of you who are curious
0:01
and have a little bit of a background in calculus,
0:03
I thought I would do a very optional and
0:05
when I say it's optional, you don't have to
0:07
understand this in order to progress with the
0:09
economics playlist, but a very optional proof
0:12
showing you that in general,
0:14
the slope of the marginal revenue curve for a monopolist is
0:17
twice the slope of the demand curve,
0:20
assuming that the demand curve is a line.
0:21
So if the demand curve looks like that, this is price.
0:25
This is quantity. That is demand right over there.
0:28
I'm going to show that the marginal revenue curve
0:30
has twice the slope. It is twice as steep as this.
0:33
It's really twice the negative slope.
0:36
So let me just write price as a function of quantity.
0:39
We know we get price.
0:41
Since this is a line, we can essentially write it in
0:44
our traditional slope y-intercept form.
0:46
In algebra class, you would write
0:48
if this was y and this was x,
0:49
you would write y = mx+b
0:53
where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.
0:56
I'll do something very similar, but instead of y and x
0:58
we have P and Q.
1:00
So, if P = m x Q where m is the slope
1:05
plus ... plus the P-intercept + b.
1:10
So this right over here is b
1:12
and if you were to ... If you were to take your,
1:15
If you were to take your change in P,
1:18
if you were to take your change in P
1:19
and divide it by your change in Q ... your change in Q,
1:23
you would get m. That is your slope,
1:26
change in P / change in Q.
1:30
Now what is going to be our total revenue?
1:33
And this is kind of ... We're just kind of almost doing
1:35
what we've done in the last few videos,
1:36
but we're doing it in general terms.
1:38
So if this is total revenue,
1:40
total revenue as a function of quantity.
1:43
Well, total revenue is just price x quantity.
1:46
Total revenue is just price x quantity.
1:49
We've already written ... We've already written price as a
1:52
function of quantity right over here, so we could take that
1:55
and substitute it ... and substitute it in right over there.
1:58
So we get total revenue is equal to and I'll write it all in blue.
2:03
We have mQ + b and then we're going to multiply that x Q.
2:09
We're going to multiply that x Q or we get
2:12
total revenue = mQ^2.
2:16
mQ^2 + b x Q
2:20
And this is a parabola and it's actually going to be a
2:23
downward sloping parabola because
2:24
m is going to be negative.
2:26
This is downward sloping.
2:27
m has a negative slope, so m is negative.
2:30
So we know ... We know that M < 0 over here.
2:34
That's one of the assumptions we'll make.
2:35
If m < 0, this is going to be a downward opening parabola.
2:40
Total revenue will look something,
2:41
total revenue will look something like that.
2:45
That is our total revenue.
2:46
Now, the marginal revenue as a function of quantity is
2:50
just the derivative and this is the calculus part.
2:52
It's the slope of the tangent line at any given point
2:54
and that is what the derivative is.
2:57
It's the slope of the tangent line at any point as a function
3:00
as a function of quantity. So you give me a quantity,
3:03
I will tell you what the slope of the tangent line of the
3:06
total revenue function is at that point.
3:09
So we essentially just have to take the derivative of this
3:11
with respect to Q.
3:13
So we get D, TR/DQ.
3:18
So how much does total revenue change with a very, very
3:21
small change in quantity, infinitely small, infinitesimal
3:25
change in quantity and this comes straight out of calculus.
3:29
m is a constant. Q^2, the derivative of Q^2 with respect
3:33
to Q is 2Q. So it's going to be 2Q x the constant.
3:38
So it's going to be 2m ... 2mQ.
3:42
And then b is a constant. We're assuming it's given.
3:46
b is a constant.
3:47
The derivative of bQ with respect to Q is just going to be b.
3:53
It's just going to be b.
3:55
And so right over here, this is our marginal revenue curve.
3:58
or I should say our marginal line.
4:00
It is 2mQ + b.
4:03
So notice, it has the same y-intercept as our demand curve
4:08
so definitely starts right over there,
4:10
but it has twice the slope.
4:12
The slope of our demand curve is m.
4:14
The slope of our marginal revenue curve is 2m, is 2m
4:19
and this is a negative slope, so this will be twice as negative.
4:22
So it will look something like this.
4:24
It will look something like this, just like that.
4:27
So no matter what your demand curve is,
4:29
if you assume it's a line like this,
4:32
the marginal revenue curve will be a line with twice the
4:35
slope and in this case, it's twice the negative slope which
4:38
is kind of ... what's going to be generally true.
4:40
Anyway, if you understood that, great.
4:42
You now feel good that this is always the case for a
4:44
linear demand curve like this.
4:46
If you did not understand it, don't worry.
4:48
You can proceed with the economics playlist.
4:50
You don't need to know calculus for this playlist.",Why is calculus so important?
khan_video_aubZU0iWtgI_379,Science,ESSAY,"•
0:00
In this video, I want to cover several topics
0:02
that are all related.
0:03
And on some level, they're really simple, but on a whole
0:05
other level, they tend to confuse people a lot.
0:07
So hopefully we can make some headway.
0:10
So a good place to start-- let's just imagine that I have
0:12
some type of container here.
0:15
Let's say that's my container and inside of that container,
0:18
I have a bunch of water molecules.
0:21
It's just got a bunch of water molecules.
0:24
They're all rubbing against each other.
0:25
It's in its liquid form, this is liquid water.
0:27
and inside of the water molecules, I
0:30
have some sugar molecules.
0:33
Maybe I'll do sugar in this pink color.
0:35
So I have a bunch of sugar molecules right here.
0:40
I have many, many more water molecules though.
0:43
I want to make that clear.
0:49
Now in this type of situation, we call the thing that there's
0:55
more of, the solvent.
1:00
So in this case, there's more water molecules and you can
1:03
literally just view more as the number of molecules.
1:07
I'm not going to go into a whole discussion of moles and
1:10
all of that because you may or may not have been exposed to
1:13
that yet, but just imagine whatever there's more of,
1:15
that's what we're going to call the solvent.
1:17
So in this case, water is the solvent.
1:24
And whatever there is less of-- in this case, that is the
1:30
sugar-- that is considered the solute.
1:36
It doesn't have to be sugar.
1:37
It can be any molecule that there's less of, in the water,
1:40
in this case.
1:45
And we say that the sugar has been dissolved into the water.
2:03
And this whole thing right here, the combination of the
2:06
water and the sugar molecules, we call a solution.
2:10
We call this whole thing a solution.
2:14
And a solution has the solvent and the solute.
2:16
The solvent is water.
2:18
That's the thing doing the dissolving and the thing that
2:21
is dissolved is the sugar.
2:23
That's the solute.
2:24
Now all of this may or may not be review for you, but I'm
2:27
doing it for a reason-- because I want to talk about
2:32
the idea of a diffusion.
2:39
And the idea is actually pretty straightforward.
2:43
If I have, let's say, the same container.
2:46
Let me do it in a slightly different container here, just
2:49
to talk about diffusion.
2:50
We'll go back to water and sugar--
2:52
especially back to water.
2:54
Let's say we have a container here and let's say it just has
2:58
a bunch of-- let's say it just has some air particles in it.
3:00
It could be anything-- oxygen or carbon dioxide.
3:03
So let me just draw a couple of air molecules here.
3:07
So let's say that that is a gaseous-- just for the sake of
3:11
argument-- gaseous oxygen.
3:12
So each of this is an O2-- each of those, right?
3:14
And let's say that this is the current configuration, that
3:16
all of this is a vacuum here and that there's some
3:19
temperatures.
3:20
So these water molecules, they have some
3:22
type of kinetic energy.
3:25
They're moving in some type of random directions right there.
3:29
So my question is, what is going to happen in this type
3:34
of container?
3:35
Well, any of these guys are going to be randomly bumping
3:38
into each other.
3:39
They're more likely to bump into things in this down-left
3:43
direction than they are in the up-right direction.
3:45
So if this guy was happening to go in this down-left
3:47
direction, he's going to bump into something and then
3:50
ricochet into the up-right direction.
3:52
But in the up-right direction, there's
3:53
nothing to bounce into.
3:55
So in general, everything is moving in random directions,
3:57
but you're more likely to be able to move in
4:00
the rightward direction.
4:01
When you go to the left, you're more likely to bump
4:02
into something.
4:04
So it's almost common sense.
4:06
Over time, if you just let this system come to some type
4:09
of equilibrium-- I'm not going to go into detail
4:11
on what that means.
4:12
You can watch the thermodynamics videos if you'd
4:14
like to see that.
4:15
You'll eventually see the container will look
4:18
something like this.
4:19
I can't guarantee it.
4:20
There's some probability it would actually stay like this,
4:22
but very likely that those five particles are going to
4:25
get relatively spread out.
4:27
This is diffusion and so it's really just the spreading of
4:32
particles or molecules from high concentration to low
4:36
concentration areas, right?
4:39
In this case, the molecules are going to spread in that
4:41
direction from a high concentration to a low
4:43
concentration area.
4:45
Now you're saying, Sal, what is concentration?
4:47
And there's many ways to measure concentration and you
4:51
can go into molarity and molality and all of that.
4:54
But the very simple idea is, how much of that particle do
4:57
you have per unit space?
4:59
So here, you have a lot of those particles per unit space
5:02
and here you have very few of those
5:04
particles per unit space.
5:05
So this is a high concentration and that's a low
5:09
concentration.
5:09
So you could imagine other experiments like this.
5:12
You could imagine a solution like-- let's do
5:17
something like this.
5:21
Let's say I have two containers.
5:25
Let's go back to the solution situation.
5:27
This was a gas, but I started off with that example so let's
5:29
stay with that example.
5:31
So let's say that I have a door right there that's larger
5:35
than either the water or the sugar molecules.
5:38
On either side, I have a bunch of water molecules.
5:52
So I have a lot of water molecules.
5:53
So if I just had water molecules here-- they're all
5:55
bouncing around in random directions-- and so the odds
5:58
of a water molecule going this way, equivalent to odds of a
6:01
water molecule going that way, assuming that both sides have
6:04
the same level of water molecule, otherwise the
6:06
pressures would be different.
6:07
But let's say that the top of this is the same
6:10
as the top of this.
6:11
So there's no more pressure going in one
6:12
direction or another.
6:13
So if for whatever reason, a bunch more water molecules
6:17
were going in the rightward direction, then all of a
6:18
sudden this would fill up with more water and we know that
6:20
that isn't likely to occur.
6:22
So this is just two containers of water.
6:28
Now let's put some solute in it.
6:30
Let's dissolve some solute in it and let's say we do all the
6:33
dissolving on the left-hand side.
6:35
So we put some sugar molecules on the left-hand side.
6:40
And these are small enough to fit through this little pipe.
6:42
That's one assumption that I'm making.
6:44
So what's going to happen?
6:45
All of these things have some type of kinetic energy.
6:47
They're all bouncing around.
6:52
Well, over time, the water's going back and forth.
6:56
This water molecule might go that way.
6:57
That water molecule might go that way, but they net each
7:00
other out, but over time one of these big sugar molecules
7:03
will be going in just the right direction to go
7:06
through-- maybe this guy's, instead of going that
7:08
direction, he starts off going in that direction.
7:10
He goes just through this tunnel connecting the two
7:15
containers and he'll end up there, right?
7:18
And this guy will still be bouncing around.
7:20
There's some probability he goes back, but there's still
7:23
more sugar particles here than there.
7:25
So there's still more probability that one of these
7:31
guys will go to that side than one of these guys
7:33
will go to that side.
7:34
So you can imagine if you're doing this with gazillions of
7:36
particles-- I'm only doing it with four-- over time, the
7:40
particles will have spread out so that their concentrations
7:43
are roughly equal.
7:44
So that maybe you'll have two here over time.
7:46
But when you're only dealing with three or four or five
7:49
particles, there's some probability it doesn't happen,
7:51
but when you're doing it with a gazillion and they're super
7:53
small, it's a very, very, very high likelihood.
7:56
But anyway, this whole process-- we went from a
7:59
container of high concentration to a container
8:02
of low concentration and the particles would have spread
8:06
from the low concentration container to the high
8:08
concentration container.
8:09
So they diffused.
8:11
This is diffusion.
8:16
And just so that we learn some other words that tend to be
8:18
used with the idea of diffusion-- when we started
8:21
off, this had a higher concentration.
8:24
The left-hand side container had higher concentration.
8:33
It's all relative, right?
8:34
It's higher than this guy.
8:37
And this right here had a lower concentration.
8:42
And there are words for these things.
8:44
This solution with a high concentration is called a
8:47
hypertonic solution.
8:50
Let me write that in yellow.
8:58
Hyper, in general, meaning having a lot of something,
9:01
having too much of something.
9:02
And this lower concentration is hypotonic.
9:13
You might have heard maybe one of your relatives, if they
9:16
haven't had a meal in awhile say, I'm hypoglycemic.
9:20
That means that they have not-- they're feeling
9:22
lightheaded.
9:22
There's not enough sugar in their bloodstream and they
9:24
want to pass out so they want a meal.
9:26
If you just had a candy bar, maybe you're hyperglycemic--
9:29
or maybe you're just hyper in general.
9:32
So these are just good prefixes to know, but
9:35
hypertonic-- you have a lot of the solute.
9:38
You have a high concentration.
9:40
And then in hypotonic, not too much of the solute so you have
9:44
a low concentration.
9:46
These are good words to know.
9:47
So in general, diffusion-- if there's no barriers to the
9:51
diffusion like we had here, you will have the solute go
9:54
from a high concentration or hypertonic solution if they
9:58
can travel to a hypotonic solution, to a hypo, where the
10:03
concentration is lower.
10:05
Now let's do an interesting experiment here.
10:08
We've talked about diffusion and so far we've been talking
10:10
about the diffusion of the solute, right?
10:14
And in general-- and this is not always the case-- if you
10:17
want to be as general as possible, the solute is
10:19
whatever you have less of, the solvent is whatever
10:22
you have more of.
10:23
And the most common solvent tends to be water, but it
10:26
doesn't have to be water.
10:27
It could be some type of alcohol.
10:28
It could be mercury.
10:31
It could be a whole set of molecules, but water in most
10:34
biological or chemical systems tends to be the
10:38
most typical solvent.
10:39
It's what other things are dissolved into.
10:41
But what happens if we have a tunnel where the solute is too
10:46
big to travel, but water is small enough to travel?
10:51
Let's think about that situation.
10:55
In order to think about it, I'm going to do something
10:57
interesting.
10:58
Let's say we have a container here.
11:02
Actually, I won't even draw a container.
11:03
Let's just say we have an outside environment that has a
11:07
bunch of water.
11:09
This is the outside environment and then you have
11:12
some type of membrane.
11:19
Water can go in and out of this membrane.
11:22
So it's semi-permeable.
11:23
Well, it's permeable to water, but the solute cannot go
11:26
through the membrane.
11:27
So let's say that the solute is sugar.
11:28
So we have water on the outside and
11:33
also inside the membrane.
11:36
So these are little small water molecules.
11:39
This is a membrane right here.
11:43
And let's say that we have some sugar molecules again--
11:46
I'm just picking on sugar.
11:47
It could have been anything.
11:48
So we have some sugar molecules here that are just a
11:51
little bit bigger-- or they could be a lot bigger.
11:55
Actually, they're a lot bigger than water molecules.
11:57
You have a bunch of-- and I only draw four, but you have a
11:59
gazillion of them, right?
12:01
You have that much more water molecules.
12:03
I'm just trying to show you have more water molecules than
12:05
sugar molecules.
12:06
And this membrane is semi-permeable.
12:13
Permeable means it allows things to pass.
12:15
Semi-permeables means it's not completely permeable.
12:18
So semi-permeable-- in this context, I'm saying I allow
12:20
water to pass through the membrane.
12:22
So water can pass, but sugar cannot.
12:28
Sugar is too large.
12:35
So if we were to zoom in on the actual membrane itself--
12:39
maybe the membrane looks like this.
12:40
I'm going to zoom in on this membrane.
12:44
So it has little holes in the membrane, just like that.
12:48
And maybe the water molecules are about that size.
12:51
So they can go through those holes.
12:53
So the water molecules can go back and forth through the
12:56
holes, but the sugar molecules are about that big.
13:01
So they cannot go through that hole.
13:04
They're too big for this opening right here to go back
13:07
and forth between them.
13:08
Now what do you think is going to happen in this situation?
13:12
So first of all, let's use our terminology.
13:14
Remember, sugar is our solute.
13:15
Water is our solvent.
13:17
Semi-permeable membrane.
13:18
Which side of the membrane has a higher or lower
13:21
concentration of solute?
13:24
Well, the inside does.
13:25
The inside is hypertonic.
13:32
The outside has a lower
13:33
concentration so it's hypotonic.
13:44
Now, if these openings were big enough, based on what we
13:47
just talked about-- these guys are bouncing around, water is
13:51
travelling in either direction, and equal
13:53
probability or-- actually I'm going to talk
13:56
about that in a second.
13:58
If everything was wide open, it would be equal probability,
14:01
but if it was wide open, these guys eventually would bounce
14:03
their ways over to this side and you'd probably end up with
14:06
equal concentrations eventually.
14:08
And so you would have your traditional diffusion, where
14:10
high concentration of solute to low
14:13
concentrations of solute.
14:14
But in this case, these guys-- they can't
14:17
fit through the hole.
14:18
Only water can go back and forth.
14:20
If these guys were not here, water would have an equal
14:25
likelihood of going in this direction as they would be
14:28
going in that direction, a completely equal likelihood.
14:33
But because these guys are on the right-hand side of-- or in
14:40
this case, on the inside of our membrane.
14:42
This is our inside of our membrane zoomed up-- it's less
14:47
likely because these guys might be in the approach
14:50
position of the holes-- that's slightly less likely for water
14:55
to be in the approach position for the holes so it's actually
14:58
more probable that water could enter than water exit.
15:02
And I want to make that very clear.
15:04
If these sugar molecules were not here, obviously it's
15:07
equally likely for water to go in either direction.
15:09
Now that these sugar molecules are there, these sugar
15:12
molecules might be on the right-hand side.
15:15
They might be blocking-- I guess the best way to think
15:18
about it is blocking the approach to the hole.
15:20
They'll never be able to go through the hole themselves
15:22
and might not even be blocking the hole, but they're going in
15:24
some random direction.
15:25
So if a water molecule was approaching-- it's all
15:29
probabilistic and we're dealing with gazillions of
15:31
molecules-- it's that much more likely to be blocked to
15:34
get outside.
15:35
But the water molecules from the outside-- there's nothing
15:37
blocking them to get in so you're going to have a flow of
15:40
water inside.
15:41
So in this situation, with a semi-permeable membrane,
15:44
you're going to have water.
15:45
You're going to have a net inward flow of water.
15:49
And so this is kind of interesting.
15:51
We have the solvent flowing from a hypotonic situation to
15:56
a hypertonic solution, but it's only
15:59
hypotonic in the solute.
16:07
But water-- if you flip it the other way-- if you've used
16:11
sugar as the solvent, then you could say, we're going from a
16:15
high concentration of water to a low concentration of water.
16:19
I don't want to confuse you too much.
16:20
This is what tends to confuse people, but just think about
16:23
what's going to happen.
16:24
No matter in what situation, the solution is going to do
16:27
what it can to try to equilibriate the
16:30
concentration.
16:30
To make the concentrations on both
16:32
sides as close as possible.
16:33
And it's not just some magic.
16:35
It's not like the solution knows.
16:36
It's all based on probabilities and these things
16:38
bumping around, but in this situation, water is more
16:41
likely to flow into the container.
16:43
So it's actually going to go from the hypotonic side when
16:46
we talk about low concentration of solute to the
16:50
side that has high concentrations of solute, of
16:53
sugar-- and actually, if this thing is stretchable, more
16:57
water will keep flowing in and this membrane
17:01
will stretch out.
17:04
I won't go to too much detail here, but this idea of water--
17:08
of the solvent-- if in this case, water is the solvent--
17:12
of water as a solvent diffusing through a
17:15
semi-permeable membrane, this is called osmosis.
17:22
You've probably heard learning by osmosis-- if you put a book
17:25
against your head, maybe it'll just seep into your brain.
17:27
Same idea.
17:28
That's where the word comes from.
17:29
This idea of water seeping through membranes to try to
17:33
make concentrations more equal.
17:35
So if you say, well, I have high concentration here, low
17:38
concentration here.
17:39
If there was no membrane here, these big molecules would
17:43
exit, but because there's this semi-permeable membrane here,
17:48
they can't.
17:48
So the system just probabilistically-- no magic
17:52
here-- more water will enter to try to equilibriate
17:56
concentration.
17:57
Eventually-- if maybe there's a few molecules out here-- not
18:01
as high concentration here-- eventually if everything was
18:06
allowed to happen fully, you'll get to the point where
18:08
you have just as many-- you have just as high
18:11
concentration on this side as you have on the right-hand
18:13
side because this right-hand side is going to fill with
18:16
water and also probably become a larger volume.
18:19
And then, once again, the probabilities of a water
18:21
molecule going to the right and to the left will be the
18:23
same and you'll get to some type of equilibrium.
18:25
But I want to make it very clear-- diffusion is the idea
18:29
of any particle going from higher concentration and
18:33
spreading into a region that has a lower concentration and
18:35
just spreading out.
18:36
Osmosis is the diffusion of water.
18:41
And usually you're talking about the diffusion of water
18:44
as a solvent and usually it's in the context of a
18:47
semi-permeable membrane, where the actual solute cannot
18:51
travel through the membrane.
18:53
Anyway, hopefully you've found that useful and
18:55
not completely confusing.","Wouldn't the concentration of substances be equal since Sal said that the molecules would continue to diffuse into each other until equilibrium is reached, and doesn't equilibrium mean equal?"
khan_video_aubZU0iWtgI_47954,Science,ESSAY,"•
0:00
In this video, I want to cover several topics
0:02
that are all related.
0:03
And on some level, they're really simple, but on a whole
0:05
other level, they tend to confuse people a lot.
0:07
So hopefully we can make some headway.
0:10
So a good place to start-- let's just imagine that I have
0:12
some type of container here.
0:15
Let's say that's my container and inside of that container,
0:18
I have a bunch of water molecules.
0:21
It's just got a bunch of water molecules.
0:24
They're all rubbing against each other.
0:25
It's in its liquid form, this is liquid water.
0:27
and inside of the water molecules, I
0:30
have some sugar molecules.
0:33
Maybe I'll do sugar in this pink color.
0:35
So I have a bunch of sugar molecules right here.
0:40
I have many, many more water molecules though.
0:43
I want to make that clear.
0:49
Now in this type of situation, we call the thing that there's
0:55
more of, the solvent.
1:00
So in this case, there's more water molecules and you can
1:03
literally just view more as the number of molecules.
1:07
I'm not going to go into a whole discussion of moles and
1:10
all of that because you may or may not have been exposed to
1:13
that yet, but just imagine whatever there's more of,
1:15
that's what we're going to call the solvent.
1:17
So in this case, water is the solvent.
1:24
And whatever there is less of-- in this case, that is the
1:30
sugar-- that is considered the solute.
1:36
It doesn't have to be sugar.
1:37
It can be any molecule that there's less of, in the water,
1:40
in this case.
1:45
And we say that the sugar has been dissolved into the water.
2:03
And this whole thing right here, the combination of the
2:06
water and the sugar molecules, we call a solution.
2:10
We call this whole thing a solution.
2:14
And a solution has the solvent and the solute.
2:16
The solvent is water.
2:18
That's the thing doing the dissolving and the thing that
2:21
is dissolved is the sugar.
2:23
That's the solute.
2:24
Now all of this may or may not be review for you, but I'm
2:27
doing it for a reason-- because I want to talk about
2:32
the idea of a diffusion.
2:39
And the idea is actually pretty straightforward.
2:43
If I have, let's say, the same container.
2:46
Let me do it in a slightly different container here, just
2:49
to talk about diffusion.
2:50
We'll go back to water and sugar--
2:52
especially back to water.
2:54
Let's say we have a container here and let's say it just has
2:58
a bunch of-- let's say it just has some air particles in it.
3:00
It could be anything-- oxygen or carbon dioxide.
3:03
So let me just draw a couple of air molecules here.
3:07
So let's say that that is a gaseous-- just for the sake of
3:11
argument-- gaseous oxygen.
3:12
So each of this is an O2-- each of those, right?
3:14
And let's say that this is the current configuration, that
3:16
all of this is a vacuum here and that there's some
3:19
temperatures.
3:20
So these water molecules, they have some
3:22
type of kinetic energy.
3:25
They're moving in some type of random directions right there.
3:29
So my question is, what is going to happen in this type
3:34
of container?
3:35
Well, any of these guys are going to be randomly bumping
3:38
into each other.
3:39
They're more likely to bump into things in this down-left
3:43
direction than they are in the up-right direction.
3:45
So if this guy was happening to go in this down-left
3:47
direction, he's going to bump into something and then
3:50
ricochet into the up-right direction.
3:52
But in the up-right direction, there's
3:53
nothing to bounce into.
3:55
So in general, everything is moving in random directions,
3:57
but you're more likely to be able to move in
4:00
the rightward direction.
4:01
When you go to the left, you're more likely to bump
4:02
into something.
4:04
So it's almost common sense.
4:06
Over time, if you just let this system come to some type
4:09
of equilibrium-- I'm not going to go into detail
4:11
on what that means.
4:12
You can watch the thermodynamics videos if you'd
4:14
like to see that.
4:15
You'll eventually see the container will look
4:18
something like this.
4:19
I can't guarantee it.
4:20
There's some probability it would actually stay like this,
4:22
but very likely that those five particles are going to
4:25
get relatively spread out.
4:27
This is diffusion and so it's really just the spreading of
4:32
particles or molecules from high concentration to low
4:36
concentration areas, right?
4:39
In this case, the molecules are going to spread in that
4:41
direction from a high concentration to a low
4:43
concentration area.
4:45
Now you're saying, Sal, what is concentration?
4:47
And there's many ways to measure concentration and you
4:51
can go into molarity and molality and all of that.
4:54
But the very simple idea is, how much of that particle do
4:57
you have per unit space?
4:59
So here, you have a lot of those particles per unit space
5:02
and here you have very few of those
5:04
particles per unit space.
5:05
So this is a high concentration and that's a low
5:09
concentration.
5:09
So you could imagine other experiments like this.
5:12
You could imagine a solution like-- let's do
5:17
something like this.
5:21
Let's say I have two containers.
5:25
Let's go back to the solution situation.
5:27
This was a gas, but I started off with that example so let's
5:29
stay with that example.
5:31
So let's say that I have a door right there that's larger
5:35
than either the water or the sugar molecules.
5:38
On either side, I have a bunch of water molecules.
5:52
So I have a lot of water molecules.
5:53
So if I just had water molecules here-- they're all
5:55
bouncing around in random directions-- and so the odds
5:58
of a water molecule going this way, equivalent to odds of a
6:01
water molecule going that way, assuming that both sides have
6:04
the same level of water molecule, otherwise the
6:06
pressures would be different.
6:07
But let's say that the top of this is the same
6:10
as the top of this.
6:11
So there's no more pressure going in one
6:12
direction or another.
6:13
So if for whatever reason, a bunch more water molecules
6:17
were going in the rightward direction, then all of a
6:18
sudden this would fill up with more water and we know that
6:20
that isn't likely to occur.
6:22
So this is just two containers of water.
6:28
Now let's put some solute in it.
6:30
Let's dissolve some solute in it and let's say we do all the
6:33
dissolving on the left-hand side.
6:35
So we put some sugar molecules on the left-hand side.
6:40
And these are small enough to fit through this little pipe.
6:42
That's one assumption that I'm making.
6:44
So what's going to happen?
6:45
All of these things have some type of kinetic energy.
6:47
They're all bouncing around.
6:52
Well, over time, the water's going back and forth.
6:56
This water molecule might go that way.
6:57
That water molecule might go that way, but they net each
7:00
other out, but over time one of these big sugar molecules
7:03
will be going in just the right direction to go
7:06
through-- maybe this guy's, instead of going that
7:08
direction, he starts off going in that direction.
7:10
He goes just through this tunnel connecting the two
7:15
containers and he'll end up there, right?
7:18
And this guy will still be bouncing around.
7:20
There's some probability he goes back, but there's still
7:23
more sugar particles here than there.
7:25
So there's still more probability that one of these
7:31
guys will go to that side than one of these guys
7:33
will go to that side.
7:34
So you can imagine if you're doing this with gazillions of
7:36
particles-- I'm only doing it with four-- over time, the
7:40
particles will have spread out so that their concentrations
7:43
are roughly equal.
7:44
So that maybe you'll have two here over time.
7:46
But when you're only dealing with three or four or five
7:49
particles, there's some probability it doesn't happen,
7:51
but when you're doing it with a gazillion and they're super
7:53
small, it's a very, very, very high likelihood.
7:56
But anyway, this whole process-- we went from a
7:59
container of high concentration to a container
8:02
of low concentration and the particles would have spread
8:06
from the low concentration container to the high
8:08
concentration container.
8:09
So they diffused.
8:11
This is diffusion.
8:16
And just so that we learn some other words that tend to be
8:18
used with the idea of diffusion-- when we started
8:21
off, this had a higher concentration.
8:24
The left-hand side container had higher concentration.
8:33
It's all relative, right?
8:34
It's higher than this guy.
8:37
And this right here had a lower concentration.
8:42
And there are words for these things.
8:44
This solution with a high concentration is called a
8:47
hypertonic solution.
8:50
Let me write that in yellow.
8:58
Hyper, in general, meaning having a lot of something,
9:01
having too much of something.
9:02
And this lower concentration is hypotonic.
9:13
You might have heard maybe one of your relatives, if they
9:16
haven't had a meal in awhile say, I'm hypoglycemic.
9:20
That means that they have not-- they're feeling
9:22
lightheaded.
9:22
There's not enough sugar in their bloodstream and they
9:24
want to pass out so they want a meal.
9:26
If you just had a candy bar, maybe you're hyperglycemic--
9:29
or maybe you're just hyper in general.
9:32
So these are just good prefixes to know, but
9:35
hypertonic-- you have a lot of the solute.
9:38
You have a high concentration.
9:40
And then in hypotonic, not too much of the solute so you have
9:44
a low concentration.
9:46
These are good words to know.
9:47
So in general, diffusion-- if there's no barriers to the
9:51
diffusion like we had here, you will have the solute go
9:54
from a high concentration or hypertonic solution if they
9:58
can travel to a hypotonic solution, to a hypo, where the
10:03
concentration is lower.
10:05
Now let's do an interesting experiment here.
10:08
We've talked about diffusion and so far we've been talking
10:10
about the diffusion of the solute, right?
10:14
And in general-- and this is not always the case-- if you
10:17
want to be as general as possible, the solute is
10:19
whatever you have less of, the solvent is whatever
10:22
you have more of.
10:23
And the most common solvent tends to be water, but it
10:26
doesn't have to be water.
10:27
It could be some type of alcohol.
10:28
It could be mercury.
10:31
It could be a whole set of molecules, but water in most
10:34
biological or chemical systems tends to be the
10:38
most typical solvent.
10:39
It's what other things are dissolved into.
10:41
But what happens if we have a tunnel where the solute is too
10:46
big to travel, but water is small enough to travel?
10:51
Let's think about that situation.
10:55
In order to think about it, I'm going to do something
10:57
interesting.
10:58
Let's say we have a container here.
11:02
Actually, I won't even draw a container.
11:03
Let's just say we have an outside environment that has a
11:07
bunch of water.
11:09
This is the outside environment and then you have
11:12
some type of membrane.
11:19
Water can go in and out of this membrane.
11:22
So it's semi-permeable.
11:23
Well, it's permeable to water, but the solute cannot go
11:26
through the membrane.
11:27
So let's say that the solute is sugar.
11:28
So we have water on the outside and
11:33
also inside the membrane.
11:36
So these are little small water molecules.
11:39
This is a membrane right here.
11:43
And let's say that we have some sugar molecules again--
11:46
I'm just picking on sugar.
11:47
It could have been anything.
11:48
So we have some sugar molecules here that are just a
11:51
little bit bigger-- or they could be a lot bigger.
11:55
Actually, they're a lot bigger than water molecules.
11:57
You have a bunch of-- and I only draw four, but you have a
11:59
gazillion of them, right?
12:01
You have that much more water molecules.
12:03
I'm just trying to show you have more water molecules than
12:05
sugar molecules.
12:06
And this membrane is semi-permeable.
12:13
Permeable means it allows things to pass.
12:15
Semi-permeables means it's not completely permeable.
12:18
So semi-permeable-- in this context, I'm saying I allow
12:20
water to pass through the membrane.
12:22
So water can pass, but sugar cannot.
12:28
Sugar is too large.
12:35
So if we were to zoom in on the actual membrane itself--
12:39
maybe the membrane looks like this.
12:40
I'm going to zoom in on this membrane.
12:44
So it has little holes in the membrane, just like that.
12:48
And maybe the water molecules are about that size.
12:51
So they can go through those holes.
12:53
So the water molecules can go back and forth through the
12:56
holes, but the sugar molecules are about that big.
13:01
So they cannot go through that hole.
13:04
They're too big for this opening right here to go back
13:07
and forth between them.
13:08
Now what do you think is going to happen in this situation?
13:12
So first of all, let's use our terminology.
13:14
Remember, sugar is our solute.
13:15
Water is our solvent.
13:17
Semi-permeable membrane.
13:18
Which side of the membrane has a higher or lower
13:21
concentration of solute?
13:24
Well, the inside does.
13:25
The inside is hypertonic.
13:32
The outside has a lower
13:33
concentration so it's hypotonic.
13:44
Now, if these openings were big enough, based on what we
13:47
just talked about-- these guys are bouncing around, water is
13:51
travelling in either direction, and equal
13:53
probability or-- actually I'm going to talk
13:56
about that in a second.
13:58
If everything was wide open, it would be equal probability,
14:01
but if it was wide open, these guys eventually would bounce
14:03
their ways over to this side and you'd probably end up with
14:06
equal concentrations eventually.
14:08
And so you would have your traditional diffusion, where
14:10
high concentration of solute to low
14:13
concentrations of solute.
14:14
But in this case, these guys-- they can't
14:17
fit through the hole.
14:18
Only water can go back and forth.
14:20
If these guys were not here, water would have an equal
14:25
likelihood of going in this direction as they would be
14:28
going in that direction, a completely equal likelihood.
14:33
But because these guys are on the right-hand side of-- or in
14:40
this case, on the inside of our membrane.
14:42
This is our inside of our membrane zoomed up-- it's less
14:47
likely because these guys might be in the approach
14:50
position of the holes-- that's slightly less likely for water
14:55
to be in the approach position for the holes so it's actually
14:58
more probable that water could enter than water exit.
15:02
And I want to make that very clear.
15:04
If these sugar molecules were not here, obviously it's
15:07
equally likely for water to go in either direction.
15:09
Now that these sugar molecules are there, these sugar
15:12
molecules might be on the right-hand side.
15:15
They might be blocking-- I guess the best way to think
15:18
about it is blocking the approach to the hole.
15:20
They'll never be able to go through the hole themselves
15:22
and might not even be blocking the hole, but they're going in
15:24
some random direction.
15:25
So if a water molecule was approaching-- it's all
15:29
probabilistic and we're dealing with gazillions of
15:31
molecules-- it's that much more likely to be blocked to
15:34
get outside.
15:35
But the water molecules from the outside-- there's nothing
15:37
blocking them to get in so you're going to have a flow of
15:40
water inside.
15:41
So in this situation, with a semi-permeable membrane,
15:44
you're going to have water.
15:45
You're going to have a net inward flow of water.
15:49
And so this is kind of interesting.
15:51
We have the solvent flowing from a hypotonic situation to
15:56
a hypertonic solution, but it's only
15:59
hypotonic in the solute.
16:07
But water-- if you flip it the other way-- if you've used
16:11
sugar as the solvent, then you could say, we're going from a
16:15
high concentration of water to a low concentration of water.
16:19
I don't want to confuse you too much.
16:20
This is what tends to confuse people, but just think about
16:23
what's going to happen.
16:24
No matter in what situation, the solution is going to do
16:27
what it can to try to equilibriate the
16:30
concentration.
16:30
To make the concentrations on both
16:32
sides as close as possible.
16:33
And it's not just some magic.
16:35
It's not like the solution knows.
16:36
It's all based on probabilities and these things
16:38
bumping around, but in this situation, water is more
16:41
likely to flow into the container.
16:43
So it's actually going to go from the hypotonic side when
16:46
we talk about low concentration of solute to the
16:50
side that has high concentrations of solute, of
16:53
sugar-- and actually, if this thing is stretchable, more
16:57
water will keep flowing in and this membrane
17:01
will stretch out.
17:04
I won't go to too much detail here, but this idea of water--
17:08
of the solvent-- if in this case, water is the solvent--
17:12
of water as a solvent diffusing through a
17:15
semi-permeable membrane, this is called osmosis.
17:22
You've probably heard learning by osmosis-- if you put a book
17:25
against your head, maybe it'll just seep into your brain.
17:27
Same idea.
17:28
That's where the word comes from.
17:29
This idea of water seeping through membranes to try to
17:33
make concentrations more equal.
17:35
So if you say, well, I have high concentration here, low
17:38
concentration here.
17:39
If there was no membrane here, these big molecules would
17:43
exit, but because there's this semi-permeable membrane here,
17:48
they can't.
17:48
So the system just probabilistically-- no magic
17:52
here-- more water will enter to try to equilibriate
17:56
concentration.
17:57
Eventually-- if maybe there's a few molecules out here-- not
18:01
as high concentration here-- eventually if everything was
18:06
allowed to happen fully, you'll get to the point where
18:08
you have just as many-- you have just as high
18:11
concentration on this side as you have on the right-hand
18:13
side because this right-hand side is going to fill with
18:16
water and also probably become a larger volume.
18:19
And then, once again, the probabilities of a water
18:21
molecule going to the right and to the left will be the
18:23
same and you'll get to some type of equilibrium.
18:25
But I want to make it very clear-- diffusion is the idea
18:29
of any particle going from higher concentration and
18:33
spreading into a region that has a lower concentration and
18:35
just spreading out.
18:36
Osmosis is the diffusion of water.
18:41
And usually you're talking about the diffusion of water
18:44
as a solvent and usually it's in the context of a
18:47
semi-permeable membrane, where the actual solute cannot
18:51
travel through the membrane.
18:53
Anyway, hopefully you've found that useful and
18:55
not completely confusing.","When you talk about making the concentration equal on both sides, does that refer to making the ratio of solute to the solvent equal, or does it mean making the density of molecules on each sides equal?"
khan_video_aubZU0iWtgI_48388,Science,ESSAY,"•
0:00
In this video, I want to cover several topics
0:02
that are all related.
0:03
And on some level, they're really simple, but on a whole
0:05
other level, they tend to confuse people a lot.
0:07
So hopefully we can make some headway.
0:10
So a good place to start-- let's just imagine that I have
0:12
some type of container here.
0:15
Let's say that's my container and inside of that container,
0:18
I have a bunch of water molecules.
0:21
It's just got a bunch of water molecules.
0:24
They're all rubbing against each other.
0:25
It's in its liquid form, this is liquid water.
0:27
and inside of the water molecules, I
0:30
have some sugar molecules.
0:33
Maybe I'll do sugar in this pink color.
0:35
So I have a bunch of sugar molecules right here.
0:40
I have many, many more water molecules though.
0:43
I want to make that clear.
0:49
Now in this type of situation, we call the thing that there's
0:55
more of, the solvent.
1:00
So in this case, there's more water molecules and you can
1:03
literally just view more as the number of molecules.
1:07
I'm not going to go into a whole discussion of moles and
1:10
all of that because you may or may not have been exposed to
1:13
that yet, but just imagine whatever there's more of,
1:15
that's what we're going to call the solvent.
1:17
So in this case, water is the solvent.
1:24
And whatever there is less of-- in this case, that is the
1:30
sugar-- that is considered the solute.
1:36
It doesn't have to be sugar.
1:37
It can be any molecule that there's less of, in the water,
1:40
in this case.
1:45
And we say that the sugar has been dissolved into the water.
2:03
And this whole thing right here, the combination of the
2:06
water and the sugar molecules, we call a solution.
2:10
We call this whole thing a solution.
2:14
And a solution has the solvent and the solute.
2:16
The solvent is water.
2:18
That's the thing doing the dissolving and the thing that
2:21
is dissolved is the sugar.
2:23
That's the solute.
2:24
Now all of this may or may not be review for you, but I'm
2:27
doing it for a reason-- because I want to talk about
2:32
the idea of a diffusion.
2:39
And the idea is actually pretty straightforward.
2:43
If I have, let's say, the same container.
2:46
Let me do it in a slightly different container here, just
2:49
to talk about diffusion.
2:50
We'll go back to water and sugar--
2:52
especially back to water.
2:54
Let's say we have a container here and let's say it just has
2:58
a bunch of-- let's say it just has some air particles in it.
3:00
It could be anything-- oxygen or carbon dioxide.
3:03
So let me just draw a couple of air molecules here.
3:07
So let's say that that is a gaseous-- just for the sake of
3:11
argument-- gaseous oxygen.
3:12
So each of this is an O2-- each of those, right?
3:14
And let's say that this is the current configuration, that
3:16
all of this is a vacuum here and that there's some
3:19
temperatures.
3:20
So these water molecules, they have some
3:22
type of kinetic energy.
3:25
They're moving in some type of random directions right there.
3:29
So my question is, what is going to happen in this type
3:34
of container?
3:35
Well, any of these guys are going to be randomly bumping
3:38
into each other.
3:39
They're more likely to bump into things in this down-left
3:43
direction than they are in the up-right direction.
3:45
So if this guy was happening to go in this down-left
3:47
direction, he's going to bump into something and then
3:50
ricochet into the up-right direction.
3:52
But in the up-right direction, there's
3:53
nothing to bounce into.
3:55
So in general, everything is moving in random directions,
3:57
but you're more likely to be able to move in
4:00
the rightward direction.
4:01
When you go to the left, you're more likely to bump
4:02
into something.
4:04
So it's almost common sense.
4:06
Over time, if you just let this system come to some type
4:09
of equilibrium-- I'm not going to go into detail
4:11
on what that means.
4:12
You can watch the thermodynamics videos if you'd
4:14
like to see that.
4:15
You'll eventually see the container will look
4:18
something like this.
4:19
I can't guarantee it.
4:20
There's some probability it would actually stay like this,
4:22
but very likely that those five particles are going to
4:25
get relatively spread out.
4:27
This is diffusion and so it's really just the spreading of
4:32
particles or molecules from high concentration to low
4:36
concentration areas, right?
4:39
In this case, the molecules are going to spread in that
4:41
direction from a high concentration to a low
4:43
concentration area.
4:45
Now you're saying, Sal, what is concentration?
4:47
And there's many ways to measure concentration and you
4:51
can go into molarity and molality and all of that.
4:54
But the very simple idea is, how much of that particle do
4:57
you have per unit space?
4:59
So here, you have a lot of those particles per unit space
5:02
and here you have very few of those
5:04
particles per unit space.
5:05
So this is a high concentration and that's a low
5:09
concentration.
5:09
So you could imagine other experiments like this.
5:12
You could imagine a solution like-- let's do
5:17
something like this.
5:21
Let's say I have two containers.
5:25
Let's go back to the solution situation.
5:27
This was a gas, but I started off with that example so let's
5:29
stay with that example.
5:31
So let's say that I have a door right there that's larger
5:35
than either the water or the sugar molecules.
5:38
On either side, I have a bunch of water molecules.
5:52
So I have a lot of water molecules.
5:53
So if I just had water molecules here-- they're all
5:55
bouncing around in random directions-- and so the odds
5:58
of a water molecule going this way, equivalent to odds of a
6:01
water molecule going that way, assuming that both sides have
6:04
the same level of water molecule, otherwise the
6:06
pressures would be different.
6:07
But let's say that the top of this is the same
6:10
as the top of this.
6:11
So there's no more pressure going in one
6:12
direction or another.
6:13
So if for whatever reason, a bunch more water molecules
6:17
were going in the rightward direction, then all of a
6:18
sudden this would fill up with more water and we know that
6:20
that isn't likely to occur.
6:22
So this is just two containers of water.
6:28
Now let's put some solute in it.
6:30
Let's dissolve some solute in it and let's say we do all the
6:33
dissolving on the left-hand side.
6:35
So we put some sugar molecules on the left-hand side.
6:40
And these are small enough to fit through this little pipe.
6:42
That's one assumption that I'm making.
6:44
So what's going to happen?
6:45
All of these things have some type of kinetic energy.
6:47
They're all bouncing around.
6:52
Well, over time, the water's going back and forth.
6:56
This water molecule might go that way.
6:57
That water molecule might go that way, but they net each
7:00
other out, but over time one of these big sugar molecules
7:03
will be going in just the right direction to go
7:06
through-- maybe this guy's, instead of going that
7:08
direction, he starts off going in that direction.
7:10
He goes just through this tunnel connecting the two
7:15
containers and he'll end up there, right?
7:18
And this guy will still be bouncing around.
7:20
There's some probability he goes back, but there's still
7:23
more sugar particles here than there.
7:25
So there's still more probability that one of these
7:31
guys will go to that side than one of these guys
7:33
will go to that side.
7:34
So you can imagine if you're doing this with gazillions of
7:36
particles-- I'm only doing it with four-- over time, the
7:40
particles will have spread out so that their concentrations
7:43
are roughly equal.
7:44
So that maybe you'll have two here over time.
7:46
But when you're only dealing with three or four or five
7:49
particles, there's some probability it doesn't happen,
7:51
but when you're doing it with a gazillion and they're super
7:53
small, it's a very, very, very high likelihood.
7:56
But anyway, this whole process-- we went from a
7:59
container of high concentration to a container
8:02
of low concentration and the particles would have spread
8:06
from the low concentration container to the high
8:08
concentration container.
8:09
So they diffused.
8:11
This is diffusion.
8:16
And just so that we learn some other words that tend to be
8:18
used with the idea of diffusion-- when we started
8:21
off, this had a higher concentration.
8:24
The left-hand side container had higher concentration.
8:33
It's all relative, right?
8:34
It's higher than this guy.
8:37
And this right here had a lower concentration.
8:42
And there are words for these things.
8:44
This solution with a high concentration is called a
8:47
hypertonic solution.
8:50
Let me write that in yellow.
8:58
Hyper, in general, meaning having a lot of something,
9:01
having too much of something.
9:02
And this lower concentration is hypotonic.
9:13
You might have heard maybe one of your relatives, if they
9:16
haven't had a meal in awhile say, I'm hypoglycemic.
9:20
That means that they have not-- they're feeling
9:22
lightheaded.
9:22
There's not enough sugar in their bloodstream and they
9:24
want to pass out so they want a meal.
9:26
If you just had a candy bar, maybe you're hyperglycemic--
9:29
or maybe you're just hyper in general.
9:32
So these are just good prefixes to know, but
9:35
hypertonic-- you have a lot of the solute.
9:38
You have a high concentration.
9:40
And then in hypotonic, not too much of the solute so you have
9:44
a low concentration.
9:46
These are good words to know.
9:47
So in general, diffusion-- if there's no barriers to the
9:51
diffusion like we had here, you will have the solute go
9:54
from a high concentration or hypertonic solution if they
9:58
can travel to a hypotonic solution, to a hypo, where the
10:03
concentration is lower.
10:05
Now let's do an interesting experiment here.
10:08
We've talked about diffusion and so far we've been talking
10:10
about the diffusion of the solute, right?
10:14
And in general-- and this is not always the case-- if you
10:17
want to be as general as possible, the solute is
10:19
whatever you have less of, the solvent is whatever
10:22
you have more of.
10:23
And the most common solvent tends to be water, but it
10:26
doesn't have to be water.
10:27
It could be some type of alcohol.
10:28
It could be mercury.
10:31
It could be a whole set of molecules, but water in most
10:34
biological or chemical systems tends to be the
10:38
most typical solvent.
10:39
It's what other things are dissolved into.
10:41
But what happens if we have a tunnel where the solute is too
10:46
big to travel, but water is small enough to travel?
10:51
Let's think about that situation.
10:55
In order to think about it, I'm going to do something
10:57
interesting.
10:58
Let's say we have a container here.
11:02
Actually, I won't even draw a container.
11:03
Let's just say we have an outside environment that has a
11:07
bunch of water.
11:09
This is the outside environment and then you have
11:12
some type of membrane.
11:19
Water can go in and out of this membrane.
11:22
So it's semi-permeable.
11:23
Well, it's permeable to water, but the solute cannot go
11:26
through the membrane.
11:27
So let's say that the solute is sugar.
11:28
So we have water on the outside and
11:33
also inside the membrane.
11:36
So these are little small water molecules.
11:39
This is a membrane right here.
11:43
And let's say that we have some sugar molecules again--
11:46
I'm just picking on sugar.
11:47
It could have been anything.
11:48
So we have some sugar molecules here that are just a
11:51
little bit bigger-- or they could be a lot bigger.
11:55
Actually, they're a lot bigger than water molecules.
11:57
You have a bunch of-- and I only draw four, but you have a
11:59
gazillion of them, right?
12:01
You have that much more water molecules.
12:03
I'm just trying to show you have more water molecules than
12:05
sugar molecules.
12:06
And this membrane is semi-permeable.
12:13
Permeable means it allows things to pass.
12:15
Semi-permeables means it's not completely permeable.
12:18
So semi-permeable-- in this context, I'm saying I allow
12:20
water to pass through the membrane.
12:22
So water can pass, but sugar cannot.
12:28
Sugar is too large.
12:35
So if we were to zoom in on the actual membrane itself--
12:39
maybe the membrane looks like this.
12:40
I'm going to zoom in on this membrane.
12:44
So it has little holes in the membrane, just like that.
12:48
And maybe the water molecules are about that size.
12:51
So they can go through those holes.
12:53
So the water molecules can go back and forth through the
12:56
holes, but the sugar molecules are about that big.
13:01
So they cannot go through that hole.
13:04
They're too big for this opening right here to go back
13:07
and forth between them.
13:08
Now what do you think is going to happen in this situation?
13:12
So first of all, let's use our terminology.
13:14
Remember, sugar is our solute.
13:15
Water is our solvent.
13:17
Semi-permeable membrane.
13:18
Which side of the membrane has a higher or lower
13:21
concentration of solute?
13:24
Well, the inside does.
13:25
The inside is hypertonic.
13:32
The outside has a lower
13:33
concentration so it's hypotonic.
13:44
Now, if these openings were big enough, based on what we
13:47
just talked about-- these guys are bouncing around, water is
13:51
travelling in either direction, and equal
13:53
probability or-- actually I'm going to talk
13:56
about that in a second.
13:58
If everything was wide open, it would be equal probability,
14:01
but if it was wide open, these guys eventually would bounce
14:03
their ways over to this side and you'd probably end up with
14:06
equal concentrations eventually.
14:08
And so you would have your traditional diffusion, where
14:10
high concentration of solute to low
14:13
concentrations of solute.
14:14
But in this case, these guys-- they can't
14:17
fit through the hole.
14:18
Only water can go back and forth.
14:20
If these guys were not here, water would have an equal
14:25
likelihood of going in this direction as they would be
14:28
going in that direction, a completely equal likelihood.
14:33
But because these guys are on the right-hand side of-- or in
14:40
this case, on the inside of our membrane.
14:42
This is our inside of our membrane zoomed up-- it's less
14:47
likely because these guys might be in the approach
14:50
position of the holes-- that's slightly less likely for water
14:55
to be in the approach position for the holes so it's actually
14:58
more probable that water could enter than water exit.
15:02
And I want to make that very clear.
15:04
If these sugar molecules were not here, obviously it's
15:07
equally likely for water to go in either direction.
15:09
Now that these sugar molecules are there, these sugar
15:12
molecules might be on the right-hand side.
15:15
They might be blocking-- I guess the best way to think
15:18
about it is blocking the approach to the hole.
15:20
They'll never be able to go through the hole themselves
15:22
and might not even be blocking the hole, but they're going in
15:24
some random direction.
15:25
So if a water molecule was approaching-- it's all
15:29
probabilistic and we're dealing with gazillions of
15:31
molecules-- it's that much more likely to be blocked to
15:34
get outside.
15:35
But the water molecules from the outside-- there's nothing
15:37
blocking them to get in so you're going to have a flow of
15:40
water inside.
15:41
So in this situation, with a semi-permeable membrane,
15:44
you're going to have water.
15:45
You're going to have a net inward flow of water.
15:49
And so this is kind of interesting.
15:51
We have the solvent flowing from a hypotonic situation to
15:56
a hypertonic solution, but it's only
15:59
hypotonic in the solute.
16:07
But water-- if you flip it the other way-- if you've used
16:11
sugar as the solvent, then you could say, we're going from a
16:15
high concentration of water to a low concentration of water.
16:19
I don't want to confuse you too much.
16:20
This is what tends to confuse people, but just think about
16:23
what's going to happen.
16:24
No matter in what situation, the solution is going to do
16:27
what it can to try to equilibriate the
16:30
concentration.
16:30
To make the concentrations on both
16:32
sides as close as possible.
16:33
And it's not just some magic.
16:35
It's not like the solution knows.
16:36
It's all based on probabilities and these things
16:38
bumping around, but in this situation, water is more
16:41
likely to flow into the container.
16:43
So it's actually going to go from the hypotonic side when
16:46
we talk about low concentration of solute to the
16:50
side that has high concentrations of solute, of
16:53
sugar-- and actually, if this thing is stretchable, more
16:57
water will keep flowing in and this membrane
17:01
will stretch out.
17:04
I won't go to too much detail here, but this idea of water--
17:08
of the solvent-- if in this case, water is the solvent--
17:12
of water as a solvent diffusing through a
17:15
semi-permeable membrane, this is called osmosis.
17:22
You've probably heard learning by osmosis-- if you put a book
17:25
against your head, maybe it'll just seep into your brain.
17:27
Same idea.
17:28
That's where the word comes from.
17:29
This idea of water seeping through membranes to try to
17:33
make concentrations more equal.
17:35
So if you say, well, I have high concentration here, low
17:38
concentration here.
17:39
If there was no membrane here, these big molecules would
17:43
exit, but because there's this semi-permeable membrane here,
17:48
they can't.
17:48
So the system just probabilistically-- no magic
17:52
here-- more water will enter to try to equilibriate
17:56
concentration.
17:57
Eventually-- if maybe there's a few molecules out here-- not
18:01
as high concentration here-- eventually if everything was
18:06
allowed to happen fully, you'll get to the point where
18:08
you have just as many-- you have just as high
18:11
concentration on this side as you have on the right-hand
18:13
side because this right-hand side is going to fill with
18:16
water and also probably become a larger volume.
18:19
And then, once again, the probabilities of a water
18:21
molecule going to the right and to the left will be the
18:23
same and you'll get to some type of equilibrium.
18:25
But I want to make it very clear-- diffusion is the idea
18:29
of any particle going from higher concentration and
18:33
spreading into a region that has a lower concentration and
18:35
just spreading out.
18:36
Osmosis is the diffusion of water.
18:41
And usually you're talking about the diffusion of water
18:44
as a solvent and usually it's in the context of a
18:47
semi-permeable membrane, where the actual solute cannot
18:51
travel through the membrane.
18:53
Anyway, hopefully you've found that useful and
18:55
not completely confusing.",why is the water the solvent and the sugar molecules the solute?

DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Art historians generally
0:05
like to discuss, things that they do know,
0:07
things that they discovered, things that they're sure of,
0:10
but so often, we don't know much.
0:13
DR. BETH HARRIS: And that's certainly the case
0:14
with this stunning portrait by Petrus Christus
0:17
called only, ""Portrait of a Young Woman.""
0:20
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So let's start with what we do know.
0:22
We know that this is a young woman.
0:24
We know who the artist is.
0:25
We know that the artist is Flemmish,
0:27
and the portrait was made around 1470.
0:29
We, of course, know its dimensions.
0:30
It's quite small.
0:32
It's made out of oil, and it's on panel.
0:34
And we know that it's exquisite.
0:36
And we also know that this portrait
0:38
is somewhat revolutionary.
0:40
Petrus Christus was the first artist in Flanders
0:43
to place his subjects in an actual space.
0:45
And although there's not much, we
0:47
do see a bit of molding, a rear wall,
0:51
and that it does place her in space.
0:53
DR. BETH HARRIS: So what do we want
0:55
to know that we don't know about her?
0:56
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: I'm really hungry for information.
0:58
I want to know so much.
1:00
I want to know, who she is.
1:02
DR. BETH HARRIS: I want to know what she's thinking about.
1:04
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: I want to know where she's looking.
1:06
DR. BETH HARRIS: I want to know what, if anything,
1:08
she's holding in her hands.
1:10
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: I want to know
1:12
who this portrait was made for.
1:14
Who commissioned it?
1:15
And what was its purpose?
1:16
DR. BETH HARRIS: I want to know if this is the first time she's
1:18
ever worn this fabulous dress.
1:20
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: I want to know what that little loop is
1:22
just over her forehead that peeks out from under her hat.
1:26
DR. BETH HARRIS: I want to know what she dreams about at night.
1:28
I want to know if she has any ambitions.
1:31
I want to know how old she is.
1:32
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: But you know what?
1:34
Even though we know so little about this,
1:36
I still love looking at it.

- [Voiceover] Let's explore the Fluid Mosaic Model
0:03
of cell membranes.
0:05
Now, why is it called the Fluid Mosaic Model?
0:08
Well, if we were to look at a cell membrane
0:11
and just to be clear what we're looking at,
0:12
if this is a cell right over here,
0:16
and this is its membrane,
0:18
it's kind of what keeps the cell, the inside of the cell,
0:21
separated from whatever is outside the cell.
0:24
We're looking at a cross-section of its surface,
0:29
Where down here, this is inside the cell.
0:33
If we look at it relative to this diagram,
0:35
this is inside the cell, and this is outside.
0:39
And when you zoom in,
0:42
and this little part right over here,
0:44
this is actually a phospholipid bilayer that forms it.
0:49
And so when you hear that you might say,
0:50
well, what is a phospholipid?
0:53
And that's a good question.
0:54
Because when you understand what a phospholipid is,
0:56
it starts to make sense why it would form
0:58
a bilayer like this, and why it's the basis
1:01
for so many membranes in biological systems.
1:04
So this is indicative of a phospholipid
1:07
and as its name implies, and let me write that down,
1:10
this is a phospholipid.
1:14
It's a lipid that involves a phosphate group.
1:17
And in general the word lipid,
1:19
and we have a whole video on lipids,
1:20
means something that doesn't dissolve so well in water.
1:25
And that's true, as the case of this phospholipid,
1:27
you have these hydrocarbon tails
1:30
that are coming from fatty acids,
1:32
and so these hydrocarbon tails,
1:34
they have no obvious charge or no obvious polarity.
1:37
We know that water's a polar molecule
1:39
that's what gives it its hydrogen bonds,
1:41
and it's attracted to itself.
1:43
But these don't have those, and so
1:45
they're not going to be attracted to the water
1:47
and the water's not going to be attracted to it, to them,
1:49
and so these tails are hydrophobic.
1:52
So you have hydrophobic tails,
1:58
and these are really kind of
1:59
the lipid part of the phospholipids.
2:02
And then you have the phosphate head
2:08
right over here,
2:10
and as you can clearly see, this has some charge.
2:13
Charged molecules do well in polar substances like water.
2:18
They're going to dissolve well, and so this part
2:20
right over here, is going to be hydrophilic.
2:26
And actually molecules that have a hydrophilic part
2:29
and a hydrophobic part,
2:31
there's a special word for them.
2:33
Amphipathic, a word that I sometimes have trouble saying.
2:37
So phospholipids are Amphipathic,
2:44
which means that they have both a hydrophilic end,
2:47
a part that is attracted to water,
2:48
and a hydrophobic end, that is not attracted to water.
2:51
And hopefully that starts to explain
2:53
why they organize themselves in this way.
2:56
Because you could image,
2:57
the hydrophilic heads are going to want to be
3:00
where the water is, which is going to be either
3:02
outside the cell or inside the cells.
3:04
And the tails are hydrophobic,
3:07
the water's going to go away from them
3:08
or they're going to go away from the water
3:09
and so they're just going to face each other
3:11
and they're going to be on the inside of the membrane.
3:14
But the really cool thing is, a structure like this,
3:16
having this Amphipathic molecule,
3:19
allows things like these bilipid,
3:21
these lipid bilayers, I should say, to form.
3:25
And it's actually fascinating.
3:27
You would think that if you go far back enough,
3:29
even before life in cellular form, formed,
3:33
that you might have had phospholipids spontaneously forming
3:36
these spheres where you have a bilayer, a lipid bilayer.
3:41
So you could imagine something, let me see,
3:43
if I drew a cross-section,
3:45
let me see if I can draw it relatively neatly.
3:48
So, I think I'll draw half of it, just because you get,
3:53
well I'll draw the whole thing
3:54
and hopefully you get the idea.
3:56
So that would be one layer
3:59
of the phosphate heads facing the outside.
4:02
This is the inner layer,
4:04
and I'm doing a cross-section right over here.
4:07
And then you have your hydrophobic tails,
4:11
let me do that in a different color.
4:14
So your hydrophobic tails, I think you get the picture.
4:18
We have a bunch of hydrophobic tails on either end
4:22
and then you could spontaneously form a structure like this
4:24
which starts to feel like, hey,
4:25
well maybe there's a protocell forming.
4:27
And obviously to actually have real life you have to have
4:30
some form of information that can be passed on,
4:33
and you have to have some type of metabolism,
4:35
and the cell is living, and all of the definitions of life.
4:37
But at least this basic structure of the cellular membrane
4:39
you could imagine how it forms in a pre-life state even,
4:45
by virtue of Amphipathic molecules like a phospholipid.
4:50
So fair enough.
4:51
We're able to form this phospholipid bilayer,
4:54
but what are all these other things that I have drawn here?
4:57
Well, these are proteins and these are examples of,
5:02
this is a protein right over here,
5:03
this is a protein, this is a protein,
5:05
and I just drew some blobs
5:08
to be indicative of the variety of proteins.
5:10
But the important thing to realize is,
5:12
if we think of cells, there's all of this diversity.
5:15
There's all of this complexity that is on,
5:18
or embedded, inside of its membrane.
5:20
So instead of just thinking of it as just kind of
5:21
as a uniform phospholipid bilayer,
5:24
there's all sorts of stuff,
5:28
maybe if we view this as a cross-section,
5:29
there's all sorts of stuff embedded in it
5:32
and we see it right over here in this diagram.
5:36
You could say there's a mosaic of things embedded in it.
5:38
A mosaic is a picture made up of a bunch of
5:41
different components of all different colors,
5:43
and you can see that you have all different components here,
5:45
different types of proteins.
5:47
You have proteins like this, that go across the membrane.
5:50
We call these transmembrane proteins,
5:53
they're a special class of integral protein.
5:55
You have integral proteins like this,
5:57
that might only interact with one part of the bilayer
6:00
while these kind of go across it.
6:03
You have things like glycolipids.
6:06
So this right over here, this is a glycolipid,
6:13
which is fascinating.
6:14
It lodges itself in the membrane
6:16
because it has this lipid end,
6:17
so that's going to be hydrophobic.
6:19
It's going to get along
6:20
with all of the other hydrophobic things,
6:22
but then it has an end that's really a chain of sugars
6:28
and that part is going to be hydrophilic,
6:29
it's going to sit outside of the cell.
6:31
And these chains of sugars,
6:33
these are actually key for cell-cell recognition.
6:36
Your immune system uses these to differentiate
6:38
between which cells are the ones
6:40
that are actually from my body,
6:41
the ones I don't want to mess with,
6:43
the ones I want to protect
6:44
and which cells are the ones that are foreign,
6:46
the ones that I might want to attack.
6:47
When people talk about blood type,
6:49
they're talking about, well, what type of
6:51
specific glycolipids do you have on cells.
6:55
And there's all sorts of, that's not all we're talking about
6:58
when we talk about glycolipids as a way
7:02
for cells to be recognized,
7:04
or to be tagged in different ways.
7:06
So it's a fascinating thing that these chains of sugars
7:10
can lead to such complex behavior, and frankly,
7:12
such useful behavior, from our point of view.
7:15
But you don't just want to have sugar chains on lipids,
7:18
you also have sugar chains on proteins.
7:21
This, right over here, is an example of a glycoprotein.
7:27
And as you can see, when you put all this stuff together,
7:29
you get a mosaic, and I'm actually not even done.
7:31
You have things like cholesterol embedded.
7:33
Cholesterol is a lipid, so it's going to sit in the
7:35
hydrophobic part of the membrane
7:37
and that actually helps with the fluidity of the membrane,
7:40
making sure it's not too fluid or not too stiff.
7:44
So this is cholesterol, right over there.
7:49
So you see this mosaic of stuff,
7:51
but what about the fluid part?
7:53
And I just talked about cholesterol's value
7:55
in making sure that it's just the right amount of fluidity.
7:58
What's neat about this, is this isn't a rigid structure.
8:01
If this thing were to be jostled around a little bit
8:04
or maybe it would be plucked-out somehow,
8:06
the phospholipids would just spontaneously re-arrange
8:09
to fill in the gap.
8:10
You could imagine these things are all flowing around.
8:12
That this membrane actually has a consistency
8:16
of oil or salad dressing.
8:19
So it isn't like a rubbery texture,
8:24
like you might imagine, or a membrane, like a balloon.
8:26
It's actually fluid. These things can move around,
8:30
but even though it's fluid,
8:33
it's good enough to separate the two environments.
8:35
The environment inside the cell
8:37
from the environment outside of the cell.
8:41
And that's where the name Fluid Mosaic Model comes from.","So at 7:46, when he says that cholesterol helps the fluidity, is that what makes the cell membrane ""fluid mosaic""?"

- All right now we have another combustion reaction.
0:03
Instead of ethylene, we now have ethane, C2H6,
0:08
has two carbons and six hydrogen
0:11
atoms in each molecule of ethane,
0:15
and it is reacting.
0:16
It's ethane gas, it is reacting with molecular oxygen
0:19
in gaseous form and they combust to
0:22
form carbon dioxide gas and liquid water,
0:26
and like we've seen in previous examples,
0:28
this chemical equation is not balanced.
0:31
How can we tell?
0:32
Well here on the left hand side we have two carbons.
0:35
Here on the right hand side we have one carbon.
0:37
Here on the left hand side we have six hydrogens.
0:38
Here on the right hand side we only have two hydrogens.
0:42
Here on the left hand side we have two oxygens.
0:46
On the right hand side we have two plus, three oxygens,
0:49
so none of the elements here are balanced.
0:53
But like we did in the example of ethylene,
0:56
whenever you see this where you have several
0:58
somewhat complex molecules involved,
1:01
it's good to save the element that
1:05
is in a molecule by itself for last,
1:08
because you can just tweak this
1:10
to change the number of oxygens
1:11
without it having any other side effects
1:13
on the number of carbons or hydrogens.
1:15
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to first balance,
1:17
like we've done before,
1:18
the carbons and the hydrogens,
1:20
which are going to have implications on the oxygens
1:22
because if I change the number here,
1:23
it's going to change the number of oxygens.
1:25
If I change the number here it's going to
1:26
change the number of oxygens.
1:28
But lucky for me I have this dioxygen molecule
1:30
on the left hand side that I can just tweak at the end
1:33
to balance the entire chemical equation.
1:36
So let's start with, you know last time
1:38
we started with carbon, let's start with hydrogen this time.
1:40
Just for kicks.
1:42
So over here I have six hydrogens
1:44
on the left hand side, of the entire left hand side
1:46
I only have six hydrogen atoms.
1:48
On the right hand side I only have two right now,
1:50
so if I want to have six I would multiply these two by three
1:55
so now I have three water molecules,
1:57
each of them have two hydrogen atoms,
1:59
so I'm going to have six, six hydrogen atoms
2:03
on the right hand side.
2:04
Fair enough.
2:06
Now let's go to the carbon.
2:07
Remember I'm saving oxygen for last.
2:09
Carbon on the left hand side I have two carbons.
2:12
How many carbons do I have on the right hand side?
2:14
Well right now I only have one,
2:16
but I can change that very easily.
2:18
Instead of having one molecule of carbon dioxide,
2:20
I can have two molecules of carbon dioxide.
2:23
And so now my carbons are balanced,
2:24
two carbons, two carbons.
2:26
And now let's go to the oxygens.
2:29
So right now, right now on, I'll do this in a mauve color,
2:34
right now on the left hand side I have two oxygens,
2:38
but on the right hand side what do I have?
2:40
Let's see, I have two times two,
2:42
so this right over here is four oxygens,
2:45
and then I have three water molecules,
2:47
each of them have one oxygen atom,
2:49
so three times one, so this is going to be three
2:52
right over here.
2:54
So on the entire right hand side I have seven oxygen atoms
2:58
and on the left I only have two.
3:00
So what can I do here?
3:01
What can multiply by two to get to seven?
3:05
Two times what is equal to seven?
3:07
Well two times three-and-a-half is equal to seven.
3:11
So two times three-and-a-half is equal to seven.
3:14
Remember I have two here, I'm saying two times
3:17
something is equal to seven.
3:19
I want to get to the four plus the three.
3:22
Well I multiply it by three point five,
3:25
and now I have seven, seven oxygen atoms
3:29
on both sides of my chemical equation.
3:32
But like we've seen in previous videos,
3:34
it is not standard to just leave a three-and-a-half here,
3:37
it's kind of this weird notion of
3:38
three-and-a-half molecules,
3:40
we like to have whole numbers here.
3:42
So how do we make sure we have all whole number
3:45
coefficients in front of our molecules?
3:48
Well we could just multiply everything by two,
3:50
then this thing is going to become a seven,
3:52
this thing is going to become a two,
3:53
this is going to become a four,
3:55
this is going to become a six,
3:57
so let's just do that.
3:58
I'll write the whole reaction over again.
4:00
So I have my ethane, and I won't write
4:03
actually what state it's in just to save some time,
4:06
plus some molecular oxygen.
4:09
They combust, they yield,
4:11
so these are the reactants,
4:12
the products are carbon dioxide gas
4:15
and liquid water, and liquid water.
4:19
So let's see, you multiply, if you say that there
4:22
was a one out here before,
4:24
we're going to multiply that by two to get two.
4:26
We had a three point five here, multiply that by two,
4:30
you get a seven here.
4:32
We had a two right over here, multiply that by two
4:36
you get a four.
4:38
Once again I'm just multiplying all the coefficients
4:40
by two just like you did in algebraic equations
4:41
in your algebra classes.
4:43
And then finally three times two is six.
4:47
And we're all balanced.
4:48
We were balanced here but we didn't
4:50
have whole number coefficients.
4:51
Multiplying everything by two gave us
4:53
the whole number coefficients and we are much happier.",why do we multiply the entire equation by 2 to remove decimals?

The only thing plants need to make themselves a delicious

0:23
Paula Deen can't do that, and she makes
0:25
fried egg bacon doughnut burgers.
0:32
I'm telling you, this is surprisingly good.
0:34
This is a different kind of magic, but part of this is plants.
0:39
Everything in it, in fact everything that is in this [McDonalds],
0:42
in fact, everything you have ever eaten in your life
0:44
is either made from plants or made from something that ate plants.
0:47
So let's talk about plants.
0:49
(cheerful music)
0:58
Plants probably evolved more than 500 million years ago.
1:01
The earliest land plant fossils date back
1:03
to more than 400 million years ago.
1:05
These plants were lycophytes,
1:06
which are still around today and which reproduce
1:09
through making a bunch of spores, shedding them,
1:11
saying a couple of Hail Marys, and hoping for the best.
1:14
Some of these lycophytes went on to evolve
1:15
into scale trees, which are now extinct, but huge,
1:18
swampy forests of them used to cover the earth.
1:21
Some people call these scale tree forests coal forest
1:23
because there were so many of them,
1:25
they were so dense and they covered the whole earth,
1:26
that they eventually fossilized into giant seams of coal,
1:30
which are very important to our lifestyles today.
1:32
This is now called the Carboniferous Period.
1:34
See what we did there?
1:35
Because coal is made of carbon, so they named
1:37
the epoch of geological history over how face-meltingly
1:40
intense and productive these forests were.
1:42
I would give my left eyeball,
1:46
three fingers on my left hand, the middle ones so that
1:50
I could hang loose, and my pinky toe,
1:54
if I were able to go back and see these scale forests,
1:56
because they would be freaking awesome.
1:58
Anyway, angiosperms, or plants that used flowers
2:01
to reproduce, didn't develop until the end of
2:03
the Cretaceous Period, about 65 million years ago,
2:06
just as the dinosaurs were dying out.
2:08
Which makes you wonder if, in fact,
2:10
the first angiosperms assassinated all the dinosaurs.
2:13
I'm not saying that's definitely what happened.
2:15
I'm just, it's a little bit suspicious.
2:16
Anyway, on a cellular level, plant and animal cells
2:19
are actually pretty similar.
2:21
They're called eukaryotic cells, which means they have
2:24
a good kernel, and that kernel is the nucleus.
2:27
Not ""nuculus"".
2:30
The nucleus can be found in all sorts of cells:
2:32
animal cells, plant cells, algae cells.
2:34
Basically, all the popular kids.
2:36
Eukaryotic cells are way more advanced than prokaryotic cells.
2:40
We have the eukaryotic cell and we have the prokaryotic cell.
2:43
Prokaryotic basically means before the kernel, pro-kernel.
2:48
Then we have the eukaryotic, which means good kernel.
2:50
The prokaryotes include your bacteria and your archea,
2:53
which you've probably met before in your lifetime.
2:56
Every time you've had strep throat, for example.
2:58
Or if you've ever been in a hot spring,
2:59
or an oil well or something, they're everywhere:
3:02
they cover the planet; they cover you.
3:05
Like I said, eukaryotes have that separately enclosed nucleus,
3:08
that is, that all-important nucleus that contains its DNA
3:12
and is enclosed by a separate membrane,
3:14
because a eukaryotic cell is a busy place.
3:15
There's chemical reactions going on in all different parts of the cell.
3:18
It's important to keep those places divided up.
3:21
Eukaryotic cells also have these little stuff-doing
3:23
factories called organelles, because we decided that
3:25
we'd name everything something weird.
3:27
But organelles, and they're suspended in cytoplasm,
3:30
continuing with the really esoteric terminology
3:33
that you're going to have to know.
3:34
Cytoplasm is mostly just water, but it's some other stuff, too.
3:36
Well, basically, if you want to know about
3:38
the structure of the eukaryotic cell,
3:40
you should watch my video on animal cells,
3:42
which let's just link to it right here.
3:45
Plant and animal cells are very similar environments.
3:47
They control themselves in very similar ways.
3:50
But obviously plants and animals are very different things,
3:53
so what are the differences in a plant cell
3:55
that makes it so different from an animal?
3:59
That's what we're going to go over now.
4:00
First, plants are thought to have evolved from green algae,
4:03
which evolved from some more primitive prokaryotes.
4:05
Something plants inherited from their ancestors was a rigid
4:08
cell wall surrounding the plasma membrane of each cell.
4:11
This cell wall of plants is mainly made out of cellulose
4:13
and lignin, which are two really tough compounds.
4:16
Cellulose is by far the most common and
4:19
easy to find complex carbohydrate in nature,
4:21
though if you were to include simple carbohydrates
4:23
as well, glucose would win that one.
4:25
This is because, fascinating fact, cellulose is in fact
4:29
just a chain of glucose molecules.
4:30
You're welcome.
4:31
If you want to jog your memory about
4:33
carbohydrates and other organic molecules,
4:34
you can watch this episode right here.
4:37
Anyway, as it happens, you know who
4:38
needs carbohydrates to live?
4:40
Animals.
4:41
But you know what's a real pain in the ass to digest?
4:43
Cellulose.
4:44
Plants weren't born yesterday.
4:45
Cellulose is a far more complex structure
4:47
than you'll generally find in a prokaryotic cell,
4:50
and it's also one of the main things that
4:51
differentiates a plant cell from an animal cell.
4:54
Animals do not have this rigid cell wall.
4:56
They have a flexible membrane that frees them up to
4:58
move around and eat plants and stuff.
4:59
However, the cell wall gives structure
5:01
to a plant's leaves, roots and stems,
5:04
and also protects it, to a degree.
5:06
Which is why trees aren't squishy,
5:07
and they don't giggle when you poke them.
5:10
The combination of lignin and cellulose
5:11
is what makes trees, for example,
5:13
able to grow really, really freaking tall.
5:15
Both of these compounds are extremely strong
5:18
and resistant to deterioration.
5:19
When we eat food, lignin and cellulose
5:22
is what we call roughage because we can't digest it.
5:25
It's still useful for us on certain aspects
5:29
of our digestive system, but it's not nutritious.
5:32
Which is why eating a stick
5:33
is really unappetizing and like your shirt.
5:37
This is a 100% plant shirt, but it doesn't taste good.
5:41
We can't go around eating wood like a beaver,
5:43
or grass like a cow, because our digestive systems
5:46
just aren't set up for that.
5:48
A lot of other animals that don't have access
5:49
to delicious donut burgers have either
5:52
developed gigantic stomachs, like sloths,
5:54
or multipe stomachs, like goats,
5:56
in order to make a living eating cellulose.
5:58
These animals have a kind of bacteria in their stomachs
5:59
that actually does the digestion of the cellulose for it.
6:02
It breaks the cellulose into individual
6:04
glucose molecules which can then be used for food.
6:07
Other animals, like humans, mostly carnivores,
6:09
don't have any of that kind of bacteria,
6:11
which is why it's so difficult for us to digest sticks.
6:14
But there is another reason why cellulose and lignin
6:17
are very, very useful to us as humans.
6:20
It burns, my friends.
6:23
This is basically what would happen in our stomachs.
6:25
It's oxidizing.
6:26
It's producing the energy that we would get out of it if
6:28
we were able to, except it's doing it very, very quickly.
6:31
This is the kind of energy,
6:33
like this energy that's coming out of it right now,
6:35
is the energy that would be useful to us if we were cows.
6:39
But we're not, so instead, we just use it
6:42
to keep ourselves warm on the cold winter nights.
6:46
(blows air)
6:47
Ow; it's on me; ow.
6:50
Anyway, while we animals are walking around,
6:52
spending our lives searching for ever more digestable
6:55
plant materials, plants don't have to do any of that.
6:58
They just sit there and they make their own food.
7:00
We know how they do that.
7:01
They do it with photosynthesis.
7:03
Another thing that plant cells have
7:05
that animal cells just don't have are plastids,
7:08
the organelles that plants use to
7:10
make and store compounds that they need.
7:12
You want to know something super interesting about plastids?
7:14
They and their fellow organelles, the mitochondria,
7:16
that generate energy for the cell,
7:18
actually started as bacteria that were absorbed
7:21
into plant cells very early in their evolution.
7:24
Like maybe some [produ-select] cell absorbed a bacteria
7:27
and it found that instead of just digesting that bacteria
7:29
for the energy that it had, it could use that bacteria.
7:32
That bacteria could create energy for the cell
7:34
or convert light into lovely glucose compounds,
7:37
which is crazy.
7:39
Nobody's really precisely sure how this happened,
7:41
but they know that it did happen because plastids
7:43
and mitochondria have double membranes:
7:45
one from the original bacteria,
7:46
and one from the cell as it wrapped around it.
7:49
Cool, huh?
7:50
Anyway, the most important of the plastids are
7:52
the chloroplasts, which convert light energy
7:54
from the sun into sugar and into oxygen,
7:57
which the plant doesn't need, so it just gets rid of it.
8:00
All of the green parts of a plant that you see:
8:01
the leaves, the non-woody stems, the unripened oranges,
8:05
are all filled with cells that are filled with chloroplasts,
8:08
which are making food and oxygen for you.
8:11
You're very welcome, I'm sure.
8:12
Another big difference between plant cell and
8:15
an animal cell is the large central vacuole.
8:18
Plant cells can push water into vacuoles,
8:20
which provides turgor pressure from inside the cell,
8:24
which reinforces the already stiff cellulose wall
8:26
and makes the plant rigid,
8:27
like a crunchy piece of celery or something.
8:30
Usually, when the soil dries out or the celery stalk
8:32
sits in your refrigerator for too long,
8:34
the cells lose some water, turgor pressure drops,
8:37
and the plant wilts or gets all floppy.
8:39
So the vacuole is also a kind of storage container for the cell.
8:41
It can contain water, which plants need to save up, just in case,
8:45
and also other compounds that the cell might need.
8:47
It can also contain an export stuff that
8:49
the cell doesn't need anymore, like wastes.
8:51
Some animal cells also have vacuoles,
8:53
but they aren't as large, and they don't have
8:56
this very important job of giving the animal shape.
8:58
Now, let's do this.
8:59
Let's just go over the basics of plant cell anatomy.
9:02
One, they have a cell wall that's made out of cellulose,
9:04
and so it's really rigid and not messing around.
9:07
Two, they've got a nucleus in its own little baggie
9:10
that's separate from all the other organelles.

This is basically the headquarters of any eukaryotic cell.

Animal cells have this kind of nucleus, too,

which are awesome, green, food-making machines.
9:36
Four, they have a central vacuole that stores water and
9:39
other stuff, and helps give the cell structural support.
9:42
And so, stack these cells on top of one another,
9:46
like apartments in an apartment building, and you had a plant.
9:48
All of these unique features are what makes it possible
9:50
for plants to put food on our table and air in our lungs.
9:54

9:55
just go ahead and shake its hand.

Which of the following real numbers are irrational?
0:03
Well, irrational just means it's not rational.
0:07
It means that you cannot express it as the ratio of two
0:10
integers.
0:11
So let's see what we have here.
0:12
So we have the square root of 8 over 2.
0:15
If you take the square root of a number that is not
0:18
a perfect square, it is going to be irrational.
0:21
And then if you just take that irrational number
0:23
and you multiply it, and you divide it by any other numbers,
0:26
you're still going to get an irrational number.
0:28
So square root of 8 is irrational.
0:30
You divide that by 2, it is still irrational.
0:33
So this is not rational.
0:34
Or in other words, I'm saying it is irrational.
0:38
Now, you have pi, 3.14159-- it just
0:40
keeps going on and on and on forever without ever repeating.
0:44
So this is irrational, probably the most famous
0:47
of all of the irrational numbers.
0:50
5.0-- well, I can represent 5.0 as 5/1.
0:55
So 5.0 is rational.
0:57
It is not irrational.
1:00
0.325-- well, this is the same thing as 325/1000.
1:08
So I can clearly represent it as a ratio of integers.
1:11
So this is rational.
1:12
Just as I could represent 5.0 as 5/1, both of these
1:16
are rational.
1:17
They are not irrational.
1:19
Here I have 7.777777, and it just
1:22
keeps going on and on and on forever.
1:23
And the way we denote that, you could just
1:25
say these dots that say that the 7's keep going.
1:28
Or you could say 7.7.
1:29
And this line shows that the 7 part, the second 7,
1:32
just keeps repeating on forever.
1:35
Now, if you have a repeating decimal-- in other videos,
1:38
we'll actually convert them into fractions--
1:40
but a repeating decimal can be represented
1:44
as a ratio of two integers.
1:47
Just as 1/3 is equal to 0.333 on and on and on.
1:52
Or I could say it like this.
1:54
I could say 3 repeating.
1:56
We can also do the same thing for that.
1:57
I won't do it here, but this is rational.
2:01
So it's not irrational.
2:03
8 and 1/2?
2:05
Well, that's the same thing.
2:06
8 and 1/2 is the same thing as 17/2.
2:09
So it's clearly rational.
2:11
So the only two irrational numbers
2:13
are the first two right over here.",Is it because the square root of a number is an estimation if it doesn't have a perfect square?

Despite the fact that Wilson had just won reelection in 1916
0:04
based on a platform of keeping the United States out of war,
0:07
by April of 1917, the administration
0:13
had decided that Germany had gone too far.
0:16
And in particular, had gone too far
0:17
with the unrestricted submarine warfare.
0:20
So this right over here is a picture
0:22
of President Wilson on April 2, 1917, giving a war
0:28
message to Congress as to why the US needs
0:31
to declare war on Germany.
0:34
And April 4, Congress passes the resolution to declare war.
0:39
And then the President approves it on April 6.
0:42
So by early April, the United States was at war with Germany.
0:47
Which is a good time to start thinking about,
0:49
why did all of this happen.
0:51
Now, the things that are typically
0:52
cited, and these are the things that
0:54
are inflamed public opinion in the US and that many of which
0:57
were cited by President Woodrow Wilson.
1:00
And in this tutorial that this is
1:01
part of on khanacademy.org, I put
1:03
the entire text of his speech, which I highly recommend
1:06
reading to see all of the things the President Wilson
1:09
cited in his speech.
1:10
But just as a summary of that, the things that tend to get
1:13
cited most often are the unrestricted submarine warfare
1:17
on the part of Germany.
1:22
And particular cases or the most cited
1:24
example of that is the sinking of the Lusitania.
1:27
The Germans had stopped doing that for a little
1:29
under two years.
1:30
But then, as we enter into 1917, they began doing it again.
1:35
And it also made the Americans quite angry
1:38
to realize that the Germans were trying
1:40
to incite the Mexicans against them.
1:42
So you have the Zimmerman telegram.
1:47
Zimmerman telegram is also a reason
1:50
that the Wilson administration, and why people in general,
1:53
were fairly angry about things.
1:56
Now, on top of that, there were atrocities
2:00
committed by the Germans in their march
2:02
through Belgium as they were trying
2:04
to execute on the Schlieffen Plan.
2:07
So Belgian atrocities.
2:10
And these were earlier in the war in 1914, which immediately
2:13
made many Americans not like what's going on.
2:16
Belgian atrocities.
2:18
And to put on top of that, the British
2:20
were able to leverage the Belgian atrocities to fairly,
2:24
to execute a fairly effective propaganda campaign in America.
2:31
Now on top of that-- and this is something
2:33
that Wilson speaks very strongly about in his speech--
2:36
is the notion of fighting for democracy.
2:44
And what you have here, in the First World War, the Central
2:47
Powers.
2:48
You're talking about the German Empire,
2:49
you're talking about the Austro-Hungarians.
2:51
These are monarchies.
2:52
These are emperors who are controlling it.
2:54
And even though the UK, the United Kingdom,
2:56
was nominally a kingdom, it was really a democracy.
3:00
At least for those who could vote.
3:02
We're not talking about the entire British Empire.
3:04
So UK is functionally a democracy, democratic.
3:09
And so was the Third French Republic.
3:13
And so was France.
3:15
So there's this argument that the US
3:16
is fighting for the representation of people.
3:22
Now, there is a more cynical argument
3:24
that some people have made.
3:25
And I think it's reasonable to give that to due time.
3:28
And one of the cynical arguments,
3:30
or more cynical arguments, is that the US
3:32
had close financial and trade ties to Britain,
3:34
not to mention cultural ties.
3:36
Financial ties to the British.
3:41
On top of that, you had very successful British propaganda.
3:45
One, talking about the atrocities in Belgium,
3:48
which did actually happen.
3:49
But the British were able to exploit
3:51
this as a propaganda machine.
3:53
Successful propaganda.
3:54
But they also spread rumors that after the sinking
3:57
of the Lusitania that the Germans
3:59
had their school children celebrating.
4:01
And these were all made up propaganda.
4:07
And then, more cynical view of why
4:10
the US entered the war-- and this is true
4:12
of probably most wars-- is that there
4:14
was a lot of lobbying on the part of war profiteers.
4:20
In fact, in ""Little Orphan Annie,"" Daddy Warbucks,
4:23
the name, the reason why his last name is Warbucks
4:25
is because he made his fortune as a war profiteer
4:29
during World War I. And war profiteers,
4:31
these are people who might be selling arms to the Allies.
4:35
Or who might sell arms to the US government
4:37
if the US were to get into a war that might somehow
4:39
supply the troops.
4:40
And it includes, potentially, folks on Wall Street.
4:43
There were significant lending to the Allies,
4:46
and mainly the Allies, not the Central Power.
4:49
And so the view is if the Allies win,
4:50
those loans are going to be made good.
4:53
And I had the entire text of the speech
4:56
from Senator George Norris who was one of five senators,
5:00
or sorry, one of six senators to vote against the resolution
5:04
to go to war.
5:04
There were 50 representatives who also voted against it.
5:09
This is a little excerpt but also in this tutorial,
5:11
I have the full text of his speech.
5:12
And I highly, highly, highly recommend reading that
5:15
along with Wilson's text of his speech to Congress in his war
5:20
message.
5:21
But I'll just read this part because it does, I think,
5:23
point out that the US, from the beginning,
5:26
did have biases that were more pro-British.
5:30
And so this is part of his speech.
5:31
""The reason given by the President
5:33
in asking Congress to declare war against Germany
5:36
is that the German government has declared certain war zones,
5:39
within which by the use of submarines,
5:41
she sinks, without notice, American ships
5:43
and destroys American lives.
5:45
The first war zone was declared by Great Britain.
5:49
She gave us and the world notice of it
5:51
on the 4th day of November 1914.
5:54
The zone became effective November 5, 1914.
5:58
This zone, so declared by Great Britain,
6:00
covered the whole of the North Sea.
6:02
The first German war zone was declared
6:04
on the 4th day of February, 1915,
6:07
just three months after the British war zone was declared.
6:10
Germany gave 15 days notice of the establishment
6:13
of her zone, which became effective
6:15
on the 18th day of February, 1915.
6:18
The German war zone cover the English Channel
6:21
and the high seawaters around the British Isles.
6:24
It is unnecessary to cite authority
6:26
to show that both of these orders declaring military zones
6:30
were illegal and contrary to international law.
6:34
It is sufficient to say that our government has officially
6:37
declared both of them to be illegal
6:40
and has officially protested against both of them.
6:43
The only difference is that, in the case of Germany
6:46
we have persisted in our protest,
6:48
while in the case of England, we have submitted.""
6:51
And I encourage you, once again, to read
6:54
the text of both Wilson's speech and Senator Norris' speech
7:00
and come up to your, with your own decisions.
7:02
And it might be a little bit of both.",How is making military war zones like Great Britain and Germany did illegal?

Voiceover: So let's talk a little bit about
0:02
how we all came into being.
0:04
What we see right over here, this is a picture
0:08
of a sperm cell fusing with an egg cell.
0:14
So that's a sperm cell and this is an egg cell
0:17
or we could call this an ovum.
0:21
And even this scene depicted right over here,
0:23
this is the end of an epic competition because
0:28
this sperm cell is one of one of two to three
0:30
hundred million that is vying for this ovum.
0:36
So there's two to three hundred million of these characters
0:38
and they're all vying for this ovum and the one
0:43
that you see that's about to fuse for it,
0:45
this is the winner of this incredibly -
0:47
remember two to three hundred,
0:49
200 million to 300 million sperm are trying to get here
0:54
so this is a major victory and to some degree
0:57
we should all feel pretty good about ourselves
1:00
because we are all the by-product of that
1:03
one in 200 to 300 million sperm cells
1:07
that won this race getting to our mother's ovum.
1:11
So the sperm cell came from our father and the egg cell,
1:15
this is all happening inside of our mothers,
1:18
the egg cell is from our mother.
1:21
Now, once this happens,
1:22
let's talk a little bit about the terminology.
1:24
So once these two fuse, or the process of them fusing,
1:29
we call that fertilization.
1:33
Fertilization.
1:39
And it produces a cell that then differentiates
1:42
into all of the cells of our body,
1:45
so you can imagine that this is an important process.
1:47
So let's make sure that we understand the different
1:49
terminology, the different words for the different things
1:53
that are acting in this process.
1:56
So each of these sex cells, I guess we could say,
2:01
the sperm cell and the ovum, these are each called gametes.
2:05
So this right over here is a gamete
2:11
and the ovum is a gamete,
2:13
the egg cell is also a gamete.
2:17
And as we'll see, each gamete has half the number
2:21
of chromosomes as your body cells or most of
2:26
the somatic cells of your body so outside of your sex cells
2:30
that might be in your ovaries or your testes,
2:35
depending on whether you're male or female,
2:38
these have half the number
2:40
so let's dig a little bit deeper into what I mean there.
2:43
So let's just do a blow up
2:46
of this sperm cell right over here,
2:51
so a blow up of a sperm cell and I'm not
2:54
going to draw it to scale, you see the sperm cell
2:56
is much smaller than the egg cell but just
2:58
to get a sense, so let me draw the nucleus
3:01
of this sperm cell, so just like that.
3:05
If we're talking about a human being, and I'm assuming
3:08
you are a human being, so that might be
3:10
of interest to you, this will have 23
3:13
chromosomes from your father so let's do them.
3:16
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
3:18
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
3:22
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22
3:25
and for the 23rd one, that's going to be
3:29
your sex-determining chromosome
3:31
so if your father contributes an x,
3:34
you are going to be female,
3:36
if your father contributes a y,
3:39
you are going to be male.
3:42
So these are the chromosomes in
3:44
the male gamete or I guess I should say the gamete
3:47
that your father's contributing, the sperm.
3:50
So this is a gamete right over here and that's going to
3:53
fuse with the egg, the ovum that your mother is contributing
3:57
and once again, I'm not drawing that to scale.
4:00
So this is the egg, and let me draw it's nucleus.
4:06
So that's it's nucleus, once again
4:07
none of this is drawn to scale.
4:09
And your mother is also going to contribute 23 chromosomes.
4:12
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
4:15
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
4:17
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22
4:21
and then she will contribute an x chromosome
4:25
for the sex determining so your sex determining
4:28
chromosomes are going to be xy, you're going to be male,
4:30
if this was xx, you're going to be female
4:33
so this is also a gamete here.
4:36
So a gamete is the general term for either a sperm or an egg.
4:41
Now once these two things are fused, what do we have?
4:49
Once they're fused, then we're going to have
4:53
you could say a fertilized egg
4:55
but we are going to call that a zygote
4:57
so let me draw that.
4:58
I'm going to do this in a new color,
5:00
and I'm running out of space and I want this all to fit
5:02
on the same screen so I'll draw it not quite at scale
5:09
and so let me draw the nucleus of the zygote,
5:11
I'm going to make the nucleus fairly large so that we can
5:13
focus on the chromosomes in it,
5:15
once again none of this is drawn to scale.
5:17
So you're going to have the 23 chromosomes
5:19
from your father, so let me do that.
5:22
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
5:28
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
5:31
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23,
5:38
and then the 23 chromosomes from your mother.
5:40
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
5:48
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
5:53
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23
6:02
so you got that x chromosome from your mother.
6:05
And as you might have notice, I've drawn them in pairs
6:08
so you now have a total, let me make it clear,
6:10
you have 23 chromosomes here,
6:13
23 chromosomes in the sperm,
6:18
you have 23 chromosomes in the egg
6:25
and now you have 46 chromosomes in the fertilized egg,
6:30
46 chromosomes, and now that we have
6:33
a full contingent of chromosomes
6:36
and then this cell can now keep replicating,
6:39
keep splitting and differentiating into all of what
6:41
makes you, you, we call this right over here,
6:44
we call this a zygote.
6:49
So one way to think about it, the gametes are the sex cells
6:53
that have half the number of chromosomes
6:55
and the zygote is the cell that's now ready to differentiate
6:58
into an actual organism that has double the number
7:01
or that has a full contingency of chromosomes,
7:04
that has 46 chromosomes, and you see that
7:07
I've made them in pairs and these pairs,
7:09
we call these homologous pairs
7:11
and in each of these pairs,
7:12
this is a pair of homologous chromosomes.
7:25
So what does that mean?
7:26
Well that means that in general, these two chromosomes,
7:29
you got one from your father, one from your mother,
7:32
they code for the same things, they code for the same
7:36
proteins but there are different variants of how they code
7:39
for those proteins, those traits that you have
7:43
so gross oversimplification is,
7:46
let's say that there is a gene on,
7:52
that one from your father that helps code for hair color
7:56
well there would be a similar,
7:57
there would be another variant of that gene
8:00
on the chromosome from your mother
8:02
that helps code for hair color as well.
8:05
So these are homologous chromosomes,
8:06
these two chromosomes code, in general,
8:10
for the same things and so the zygote now has,
8:13
you could say it has 46 chromosomes or you could say
8:16
it has 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes.
8:20
And this is, once again, this is the case for human beings.
8:23
If we're talking about some other species, instead of
8:25
23 pairs of homologous chromosomes or 46 chromosomes
8:29
in total, you might be talking about 10 pairs of
8:31
homologous chromosomes with 20 chromosomes in general.
8:36
Now to help biologists, to help clarify when they're
8:41
talking about the number of chromosomes for
8:43
a given species, they introduce two words,
8:46
haploid and diploid.
8:49
And haploid is referring to when you have half
8:52
the full contingency of chromosomes.
8:56
So for human beings, the haploid number is 23.
9:01
So, this is the haploid number, it is 23.
9:11
For another species it would be something else
9:14
and haploid is based on the prefix ""hapl"",
9:18
that's the prefix for single, so you have a single member
9:24
I guess you could think of it,
9:25
of each of the pairs and now you have both
9:29
of each pair, you have both chromosomes in each
9:32
pair or you have the full contingency and this 46 chromosomes,
9:37
this is called the diploid number for humans.
9:45
The diploid number right over here.
9:47
And when people talk in general, and we will speak in general
9:49
when we start talking about mitosis and meiosis
9:52
for a given species they will refer to the haploid number,
9:55
they will refer to the haploid number as n chromosomes
9:59
and they will refer to the diploid number as just twice that,
10:01
as two n chromosomes.
10:04
So hopefully this gets you familiar with some of the vocabulary
10:08
around fertilization and haploid and diploid
10:11
and zygotes and gametes and also makes you feel
10:14
a little bit better about yourself that, just to exist,
10:17
at least half of your chromosomes had to win
10:20
an incredibly competitive race.","So all gametes are haploid and contain half the number of chromosomes- they are only sperm and egg cells, or sex cells, correct?"

And I'd mentioned that the key first step for both of them
0:06
is this change in volume, going up in volume
0:09
or going down in volume.
0:10
But I didn't really talk about how that happens exactly,
0:13
so I thought I would jump into that now.
0:16
And let me begin by telling you that in the middle
0:18

But you can go ahead and feel on your own body
0:29
this bone, which we call either the breastbone,
0:32
or the more technical name is the sternum.
0:35
So I'll write that down here.
0:37
The sternum is this middle bone, and all the ribs on both sides
0:41
attach there.
0:42
So you've got a total of 12 ribs and seven pairs of them.
0:48
Actually, I should say 12 pairs of ribs.
0:51
I don't want you to think there are 12 total.
0:53
We actually have 24 total and seven pairs of the ribs.
0:57
So 14 ribs actually attach directly to this sternum bone.
1:04
So in white, these are the ribs.
1:05
And between the ribs, you actually have muscle.
1:07
So I'm going to draw in some of these muscles between the ribs.
1:11
And these muscles are all going to have their own nerve that
1:16
allows them to contract.
1:18
So these muscles are controlled by your brain,
1:23
and their name-- let me just jot down here
1:26
on the side-- is intercostal muscle.
1:29
And inter just means between, so this is the name of the muscle.
1:33
And costal refers to the ribs.
1:35
So when you see that word costal,
1:37
you'll know we're talking about the ribs.
1:39
So what's between the ribs is these muscles,
1:42
intercostal muscles.
1:44
And they are going to start moving outwards when
1:48
your brain says, hey, I want to take a deep breath.
1:51
So these muscles are going to contract.
1:54
The ribs, I should say, are going to move outwards.
1:57
So these go out.
1:59
And you also have-- let me just make
2:01
a little bit of space on this canvas-- another muscle
2:04
that kind of rides down here and has
2:07
kind of an upside down U shape to it.
2:11
So I'm drawing it kind of like a dome.
2:14
You can think of it as a dome.
2:16
And this dome is the floor-- if you remember,
2:19
we talked about the floor of the thorax.
2:20
So this is, of course, our diaphragm muscle.
2:24
So we've got our diaphragm muscle.
2:25
And this one when it contracts, instead of going out,
2:29
it's going to go down.
2:31
So it's going to kind of flatten out.
2:33
And I can actually draw this.
2:34
If you can now just stick with me for a moment,
2:38
I'm going to erase this dome-like shape.
2:41
And I'm going to draw what it looks like as it contracts.
2:44
So when it contracts, it's actually going to be more flat.
2:47
And this flat diaphragm, as you can see,
2:53
is now further down than it used to be.
2:56
And as it goes down, all of the structures that
2:59
are inside this space-- so the two lungs.
3:01
And of course, I didn't draw the heart here.
3:03
But the heart would be kind of in this cardiac notch.
3:06
If you want, maybe I could even draw that heart here.
3:10
They're all going to kind of physically move down.
3:13
So this is our heart and our lungs.
3:15
They're physically going to be kind of drawn
3:18
downwards and out.
3:20
They are going to also move out as the intercostal muscles move
3:25
out.
3:26
So you have expansion of these lungs.
3:28
That's basically the idea.
3:30
And if you were to kind of zoom in on this to kind of see
3:32
exactly what this expansion looks
3:34
like, when I say you have more volume in the lungs,
3:38
really what I should be saying, if I wanted to be more exact,
3:42
is that all the alveoli-- if these are the alveoli,
3:45
let's say this is another branch.
3:46
And this is another alveoli right here.
3:48
All these alveoli, they are actually expanding.
3:52
And you have about 500 million alveoli.
3:56
If you can just kind of fathom how big a number that is.
3:59
It's an enormous number of alveoli.
4:01
And if I was actually drawing them,
4:02
I would be here drawing forever.
4:05
It would take forever to write out
4:07
this many different alveoli.
4:09
But basically what happens is that when the ribs go out
4:12
and the diaphragm moves down, these alveoli are actually
4:15
being pulled out.
4:18
They're actually being pulled outwards,
4:20
so they are actually going to be getting larger in size.
4:23
They literally look like they've grown in size,
4:26
and this is what they look like.
4:28
And actually, if you were to take an even closer look,
4:31
you'd see that these alveoli have around them
4:35
a bunch of protein.
4:36
The cells around them have a bunch of protein,
4:38
and this protein is called elastin.
4:42
And you can guess what elastin might do.
4:45
It has kind of a similar sound to the word elastic.
4:49
And elastin is basically kind of like a rubber band,
4:52
so you can kind of think of elastin as a rubber band.
4:56
And when the muscles move down and out
5:00
and the alveoli are pulled open--
5:03
let me actually now scroll up, because you can kind of go back
5:06
to the idea of inhaling-- what is happening, then?
5:09
Well, you have a couple things happening.
5:11
One, you have muscles-- I'll just write muscles contracting.
5:17
And when I say muscles, you know I'm
5:19
talking about all those intercostal muscles
5:21
in your diaphragm.
5:22
And as a result of the muscles contracting,
5:24
you have now the alveoli are stretched open.
5:30
So those rubber bands, those elastin proteins,
5:33
are literally physically being stretched opened.
5:40
And keep that in mind, because what's going to happen then
5:44
is when the muscles relax, which is
5:47
what happens when you exhale, what do you
5:51
think is going to happen to that elastin?
5:53
Well, if it's like a rubber band,
5:55
if that's what I'm saying it's going to be like,
5:57
then the alveoli are going to recoil.
6:01
And that's actually the driving force
6:04
for why the volume goes back down.
6:07
So if you have a bunch of rubber bands
6:08
that you're stretching out-- let me actually
6:09
bring up the picture.
6:10
You'll see it really clearly.
6:12
If you're physically kind of using your muscles to help
6:16
pull this stuff open, then the moment
6:18
that you stop pulling open, the moment
6:21
that you stop contracting those muscles now
6:24
that you have a nice big volume, what's going to happen?
6:27
Well, all these elastin molecules
6:30
are going to snap back.
6:32
Let me do it with a different color.
6:33
Let's do this color.
6:34
They're going to snap back like this.
6:38
All that protein is going to want
6:39
to snap back into the original size.
6:43
And when they do, this thing gets smaller.
6:45
So my alveoli goes back to its original size,
6:48
which was much smaller than this.
6:49
Let me actually just quickly show that and show you
6:53
that even though contraction is what opened up things,
6:57
it's the recoil that brings things
6:59
back down to their normal size.
7:02
And let me erase this to make it kind of a neater drawing.
7:05
So you can see it now.
7:06
Inhaling, the way that we actually increase the volume,
7:09
is by pulling things open through contraction.
7:13
And this actually requires energy.
7:16
Remember, you can't contract a muscle
7:18
without spending chemical energy.
7:21
So this takes chemical energy, and we usually
7:24
think of this molecule ATP as the specific type of chemical
7:28
energy we're going to use.
7:30
And to exhale, when you reduce the volume,
7:34
it's going to be driven by this elastic recoil.
7:37
So that's a type of elastic potential energy.
7:43
So this process of inhaling and exhaling
7:48
is really a little different from each other.
7:50
On the one hand, you're using ATP.
7:52
You're actually burning through these molecules.
7:54
And then when you exhale, you're actually
7:56
not using chemical energy anymore.
7:59
You're just using that elastic potential energy,
8:01
kind of the same sort of energy that you
8:03
can imagine you would have if you snap a rubber band.
8:07
So let's stop there, and we'll pick up in the next video.",How do the alveoli go outwards?
khan_video_eEUK_ThrHuQ_131032,Math,ESSAY,"•
0:00
I've got a 2 by 2 matrix here.
0:02
Let's say A is equal to a, b, c, d.
0:07
So I'm going to keep it really general.
0:08
So this is really any 2 by 2 matrix.
0:11
What I want to do is use our technique for finding an
0:15
inverse of this matrix to essentially find a formula for
0:18
the inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix.
0:21
So I want to essentially find a inverse, and I want to do it
0:25
just using a formula that it just applies to this matrix
0:28
right here.
0:28
So how can I do that?
0:30
Well, we know a technique.
0:31
We just create an augmented matrix.
0:33
So let's just create an augmented matrix right here.
0:37
So we have a, b, c, d, and then we augment it with the
0:43
identity in R2, so 1, 0, 0, 1.
0:47
And we know if we perform a series of row operations on
0:50
this augmented matrix to get the left-hand side in reduced
0:53
row echelon form.
0:54
The right-hand side, if the reduced row echelon form here
0:57
gets to the identity, then the right-hand side is going to be
1:00
the inverse.
1:01
So let's do it in this general case, not dealing with
1:04
particular numbers here.
1:06
So the first thing I want to do, or I would like to do, is
1:08
I would like to zero this guy out.
1:11
What we want to do is we want to zero that out, zero that
1:13
out, and then these two terms have to become equal to 1.
1:15
So the best way to zero this out, let's perform a little
1:20
transformation here.
1:22
So if I perform the transformation on the columns,
1:29
C1, so those are the entries of a column-- this would be
1:32
one column right here, that would be another column right
1:35
there, that's the third column,
1:37
that's the fourth column.
1:38
But the transformation I'm going to perform on each of
1:40
these columns, and we know this is equivalent to a row
1:41
operation, is going to be equal to-- since I want to
1:44
zero this one out, I'm going to keep my first row the same,
1:49
so it's going to be C1, and I'm going to replace my second
1:52
row with a times my second row minus c times my first row.
1:59
Now why am I doing that?
2:00
Because a times c minus c times a is going to be 0.
2:04
So this guy's going to be 0.
2:05
That's the row operation I'm going to perform.
2:07
And I'm doing this so we can kind of keep track, account
2:10
for what we're doing because the algebra's going to get
2:12
hairy in a little bit.
2:13
So let me perform this operation.
2:15
So if I perform that operation on our matrix, what do we
2:18
have.
2:19
So our first row's going to be the same.
2:22
Let me start with our second row because that's a little
2:24
bit more complicated.
2:25
So I'm going to replace c with a times c minus c times a.
2:31
That's ac-- so let me put it this way-- so that's going to
2:34
be 0 right there.
2:36
I'm going to replace d with d times a or a times d minus c
2:45
times C1 in this column vector.
2:48
So minus c times b.
2:50
Let me write this as bc.
2:52
And then let me augment it.
2:55
And then this guy's going to be a times 0, because he's C2
2:58
minus c times C1.
3:00
So it's going to be minus c.
3:03
And then finally, this guy right here is going to be a
3:07
times 1-- a times this 1 right here-- minus c times 0.
3:12
So that's just going to be an a.
3:14
And then the first row is pretty straightforward.
3:17
We know that the first row or the first entries in our
3:19
column vectors just stay the same through this
3:21
transformation.
3:23
So it's a, b, 1, 0.
3:27
And just to make sure you're clear what we're doing, when
3:30
you perform this transformation on this column
3:32
vector right here, you got this column
3:35
vector right there.
3:36
When you perform the transformation on this column
3:38
vector right there, you get this column
3:40
vector right there.
3:41
Now I just want to make that clear because I did all of the
3:44
second entries of all of the column vectors at once because
3:48
we all were essentially performing the same row
3:50
operation, so that just helped me simplify at least my
3:52
thinking a little bit.
3:53
Let me stay in this mode.
3:55
So let's continue to get this in reduced row echelon form.
3:58
The next thing we want to do is, let's make another
4:00
transformation, we'll call this T1.
4:02
That was our first transformation.
4:03
Let's do another transformation.
4:05
T2, or another set of row operations.
4:08
So if I start with the column vector C1, C2, what I want to
4:13
do now is I want to keep my second row the same and I want
4:16
to zero out this character right here.
4:19
I want to zero him out.
4:20
I know I'm going to keep my second row the same, so C2 is
4:24
just going to still be C2.
4:27
But in order to zero this out, what I can do is I can replace
4:30
the first row with this scaling factor times the first
4:35
row minus this scaling factor times the second row.
4:38
So it'll be ad minus bc times your first entry in your
4:44
column vector minus b times your second entry.
4:50
And the whole reason why I'm doing that is so that this guy
4:53
zeroes out.
4:55
So if we apply that to this matrix up here-- let's do the
4:59
first row first.
5:01
So this first entry right here is going to be ad minus bc
5:05
times a, because that's C1-- let me write that down.
5:08
So it's ad minus bc times a minus b times C2 minus 0.
5:20
So it's just going to be-- that second term
5:22
just becomes 0.
5:24
Fair enough.
5:25
Now what is this guy going to be?
5:26
He's going to be-- I'll write it out.
5:28
He's going to be ad minus bc times b minus b times your C2
5:40
in this column vector, minus b times ad minus bc.
5:47
And you can see immediately that these two guys are going
5:49
to cancel out and you're going to get a 0 there.
5:52
And then we've got to augment it.
5:54
I want to make sure I don't run out of space, I should've
5:56
started to the left a little bit more.
5:58
So what's this guy going to be?
5:59
Well I'm going to have this guy times ad minus bc-- I'll
6:03
do it in pink-- so you're going to have ad minus bc
6:07
times 1, which is just ad minus bc minus b times C2, so
6:13
minus b times minus c.
6:16
So that's plus bc.
6:20
So 1 times ad minus bc minus b times minus
6:25
c is equal to that.
6:26
And you can immediately see that these two guys will
6:28
cancel out.
6:28
You're just [INAUDIBLE]
6:29
ad.
6:30
And then this guy over here, you're going to have 0 times
6:34
ad minus bc, which is just a 0, minus b times a.
6:39
So you have minus ab-- just squeeze it in there.
6:44
And we know that our second row just stays the same.
6:47
Our second row just stays the same in this transformation.
6:50
So we had a 0 here, we're still going to have a 0.
6:52
We had an ad minus bc.
6:54
We'll still have an ad minus bc.
6:56
We had a minus c.
6:58
Then we had an a.
7:01
Just like that.
7:02
Now let me re-write this matrix just so it gets cleaned
7:05
up a little bit.
7:06
So let me re-write it right here.
7:09
I'll do it in my orange-- well, let me
7:11
do it in this yellow.
7:14
So I have ad minus bc times a.
7:21
And then this term right here just became a 0.
7:24
This term right here is a 0.
7:26
This term right here is an ad minus bc.
7:31
And then our augmented part, this part was just an ad.
7:35
This was a minus ab.
7:38
This is a minus c.
7:40
And then this is an a.
7:43
Now we're almost at reduced row echelon form right here.
7:46
These two things just have to be equal to 1 in order to get
7:49
reduced row echelon form.
7:50
So let's define a transformation that'll make
7:53
both of these equal to 1.
7:54
So if this was T2 let me define my transformation T3.
8:02
You give it a column vector, C1, C2.
8:06
And it's just going to scale each of the column vectors.
8:08
So what I want to do is I want to divide my first entries by
8:13
this scaling factor right here so that this becomes a 1.
8:16
So I'm essentially going to multiply 1 over ad minus bc
8:25
times a, so 1 over ad, bc, a times my first entry in each
8:30
of my column vectors.
8:33
And then my second one I want to divide by this.
8:34
So that this guy becomes a 1.
8:36
So I'm doing two scalar divisions in one
8:39
transformation.
8:40
So this one's going to be 1 over ad minus bc times C2.
8:47
So I'm just scaling everything by these two scaling factors.
8:50
So if you apply this transformation to that right
8:52
there, what do we get?
8:54
We get a matrix.
8:56
And this guy, I'm going to divide him by ad minus bc
9:01
times a, so I'm dividing it by itself, so that
9:04
guy's going to be 1.
9:05
I'm going to divide 0 by this, but 0 divided by
9:08
anything is just 0.
9:12
Then we're in an augmented part.
9:13
ad divided by-- so let me write it like this.
9:17
So ad-- I'm going to divide by this-- so it's going to be ad
9:22
minus bc times a-- you immediately see that the a's
9:26
cancel out.
9:27
This is going to be minus ab divided by ad
9:34
minus bc times a.
9:36
Once again, the a's cancel out.
9:38
And then in my second row are my second entries in my column
9:42
vectors, 0 divided by anything is 0.
9:45
So 0 divided by this thing is going to be 0, assuming we can
9:49
divide by that, and we're going to talk
9:51
about that in a second.
9:53
This guy divided by this guy, we're just dividing by
9:55
himself, so it's going to be equal to 1.
9:58
Now we have minus c divided by this, or ad minus bc.
10:06
And then we have an a.
10:08
a divided by ad, ad minus bc.
10:13
And we're done.
10:14
We put the left-hand side of our augmented matrix into
10:18
reduced row echelon form.
10:20
And now this is going to be our inverse.
10:22
So let me clean it up a little bit.
10:25
So, so far we started off with a matrix-- I'll do it in
10:28
purple-- we started off with a matrix a is
10:31
equal to a, b, c, d.
10:35
And now just using our technique we figured out that
10:38
a inverse is equal to this thing right here.
10:42
And just to simplify-- well let me just write it the way I
10:45
have it there, because I don't want to skip any steps-- this
10:46
is equal to d over ad minus bc.
10:52
Right, this guy and that guy canceled out.
10:55
And then we have a minus b over ad minus bc because that
11:02
guy and that guy canceled out.
11:04
Then you have a minus c over ad minus bc.
11:09
And then finally you have an a over ad minus bc,
11:14
which is our inverse.
11:15
But one thing might just pop out at you immediately is that
11:18
everything in our inverse is being divided by this.
11:21
So maybe an easier way to write our inverse.
11:24
We could also write our inverse like this.
11:26
We could just write it as 1 over ad minus bc times the
11:31
matrix d minus b minus c and a.
11:38
And just like that we have come up with a formula for the
11:42
inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix.
11:44
You give me any real numbers here and I'm going to give you
11:48
its inverse.
11:48
That straightforward.
11:50
Now one thing you might be saying, hey, but not all 2 by
11:53
2 matrices are invertible.
11:55
How can this be the case for all of them.
11:58
And I'll give you a question, when will this thing right
12:00
here not be defined?
12:02
When is this thing not defined?
12:06
Every operation I did, I can do with any real numbers, and
12:09
this applies to any real numbers.
12:10
But when is this thing not defined?
12:16
Well it's not defined when I divide by 0.
12:19
And when would I divide by 0?
12:20
Everything else you can multiply and subtract and add
12:23
a zero to anything, but you just can't divide by 0.
12:26
We've never defined what it means when you divide
12:28
something by 0.
12:30
So it's not defined if ad minus bc is equal to 0.
12:38
So this is an interesting thing.
12:39
I can always find the inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix as long as
12:44
ad minus bc is not equal to 0.
12:48
We came up with all of these fancy things for
12:50
invertability, you've got to put it into reduced row
12:52
echelon form, and before that we talked being
12:54
on 2 and 1 to 1.
12:56
For at least a 2 by 2 matrix we've
12:57
really simplified things.
12:59
As long as ad minus bc does not equal 0, we can use this
13:07
formula and then we know that a-- and it goes both ways-- a
13:11
is invertible.
13:13
And not only is it invertible, but we can just apply this
13:16
formula to it.
13:18
So immediately something interesting might-- you might
13:20
say hey, this is an interesting number.
13:24
We should come up with some name for it.
13:25
And lucky for us, we have come up with a name for it.
13:29
This is called the determinant.
13:33
Let me write it in pink.
13:35
Determinant.
13:39
So the determinant of a, and it's also written like this
13:45
with these little straight lines around a, and you could
13:49
also write it like this, a, b, c, d.
13:54
But most people kind of think this is redundant to have
13:57
brackets and these lines.
13:58
So then they just write it like this, this is equal to
14:01
just, they just write the lines, a, b, c, d.
14:04
I want to make this very clear.
14:05
If you have the brackets you're dealing with a matrix.
14:08
If you have just these straight lines you're talking
14:10
about the determinant of the matrix.
14:12
But this is defined for the 2 by 2 case to be
14:16
equal to ad minus bc.
14:20
This is a definition of the determinant.
14:28
So we can re-write, if we have some matrix here, we have some
14:32
matrix a which is equal to a, b, c, d.
14:37
We can now write its inverse, a inverse is equal to 1 over
14:43
this thing, which we've defined as the determinant of
14:45
a times-- and let's just see a good way of kind
14:54
of memorizing this.
14:55
We're swapping these two guys, right, the a
14:59
and the d get swapped.
15:01
So you get a d and an a.
15:03
And then these two guys stay the same,
15:05
they just become negative.
15:06
So minus b and minus c.
15:09
So that's the general formula for the
15:11
determinant of a 2 by 2 matrix.
15:13
Let's try to do a couple.
15:15
Let's try to find the determinant of the
15:20
matrix 1, 2, 3, 4.
15:26
Easy enough.
15:27
So the determinant of-- let's say this is the matrix B.
15:30
So the determinant of B, or we could write it like that,
15:33
that's equal to the determinant of B.
15:36
That is just equal to-- that's this thing right here-- 1
15:39
times 4 minus 3 times 2, which is equal to 4 minus 6, which
15:49
is equal to minus 2.
15:50
So the determinant is minus 2, so this is invertible.
15:55
Not only is it invertible, but it's very easy to find its
15:57
inverse now.
15:58
We can apply this formula.
16:00
The inverse of B in this case-- let me do it in this
16:04
color-- B inverse is equal to 1 over the determinant, so
16:07
it's 1 over minus 2 times the matrix where we swap-- well,
16:12
this is the determinant of B.
16:14
I want to be careful.
16:15
B is the same thing, but with brackets.
16:18
1, 2, 3, 4.
16:22
So B inverse is going to be 1 over the determinant of B,
16:25
which is equal to minus 2.
16:27
So 1 over minus 2.
16:28
We swap these two guys, so they get a 4 and a 1, and then
16:32
these two guys become negative-- minus 2
16:35
and then minus 3.
16:36
And then if we were to multiply this out it would be
16:39
equal to minus 1/2 times 4 is minus 2.
16:43
Minus 1/2 times minus 2 is 1.
16:46
Minus 1/2 times minus 3 is 3/2, minus 1/2
16:51
times 1 is minus 1/2.
16:53
So that there is the inverse of B.
16:56
Now let's say we have another matrix.
16:57
Let's say we have the matrix C, and C is
17:00
equal to 1, 2, 3, 6.
17:05
What is the determinant of C?
17:09
It is equal to-- we could write this way-- 1, 2, 3, 6.
17:15
And it is equal to 1 times 6 minus 3 times 2, which is
17:21
equal to 6 minus 6, which is equal to 0.
17:25
And there you see it's equal to 0, so you cannot find-- so
17:29
this is not invertible.
17:35
So we can't find its inverse because if we would try to
17:37
apply this formula right here you'd have a 1 over 0.
17:40
But we know this formula just comes out-- that attempt to
17:43
put it into reduced row echelon form, and in that last
17:45
step we just had to essentially divide everything
17:48
by these terms. So these terms would be 0 in this matrix C
17:52
that I just constructed for you.
17:55
And the reason why I knew-- I just pulled this out of my
17:58
brain-- I knew this wasn't going to be invertible because
18:00
I constructed a situation where I have columns that are
18:03
linear combinations of each other.
18:04
I have 1, 3-- you multiply that by 2 you get 2 and 6.
18:08
So I knew that these aren't linearly independent columns.
18:11
So you know that its rank wasn't going to be equal to,
18:14
so I knew it wasn't going to be invertible, but we see that
18:16
here by just computing its determinant.",The transformations at the beginning are quite nuanced and actually use elementary matrix multiplication - am I right?

0:00
Right now, the prevailing theory of how the universe came about
0:04
is commonly called the Big Bang theory.
0:11
And really is just this idea that the universe started
0:14
as kind of this infinitely small point, this infinitely
0:17
small singularity.
0:19
And then it just had a big bang or it just expanded
0:23
from that state to the universe that we know right now.
0:26
And when I first imagined this-- and I
0:28
think if it's also a byproduct of how it's named-- Big Bang,
0:31
you kind of imagine this type of explosion,
0:37
that everything was infinitely packed in together
0:40
and then it exploded.
0:42
And then it exploded outward.
0:44
And then as all of the matter exploded outward,
0:47
it started to condense.
0:48
And then you have these little galaxies
0:51
and super clusters of galaxies.
0:53
And they started to condense.
0:54
And then within them, planets condensed and stars condensed.
0:58
And then we have the type of universe
1:00
that we have right now.
1:01
But this model for visualizing the Big Bang
1:05
has a couple of problems.
1:06
One is when we talk about the Big Bang,
1:08
we're not talking about the matter, just the mass or just
1:12
the matter in the universe being in one point.
1:14
We're talking about actual space expanding.
1:18
So we're not just talking about something inside of space,
1:21
like the physical mass, the physical matter expanding.
1:23
We're talking about space itself.
1:25
And so when you have this type of model,
1:27
you have all of this stuff expanding.
1:29
But you're like, whoa, look, isn't it
1:30
expanding into something else?
1:32
Maybe if the furthest out parts of this matter
1:36
is right over here, what's this stuff over here?
1:40
And so you say, well, wouldn't that be space?
1:43
So how can you say space itself is expanding?
1:46
And another idea that a Big Bang also
1:49
implies is if this is the furthest stuff out there,
1:51
would this be the edge of the universe?
1:55
Does the universe have an edge?
1:58
And the answer to either of those questions,
2:00
and that's what we're going to try to tackle in this,
2:02
is that, one, the universe does not have an edge.
2:05
And two, there is no outside space.
2:09
We are not expanding into another space.
2:11
And I'm going to explain that.
2:12
Hopefully, we'll see why that is the case right now.
2:15
So the best way to view it-- and we're
2:16
going to view it by analogy.
2:19
If I were tell you that I have a two-dimensional space that
2:31
has a finite area, so it has a finite area--
2:37
so it's not infinite.
2:38
And it also has no edge.
2:43
This once again, when you first look at it, seems difficult.
2:47
How do I just construct something
2:49
that has a finite area, but still has no edge?
2:51
Every time I try to draw an area,
2:53
it looks like I have to have some edges.
2:55
And then you might remember, what
2:57
if that two-dimensional space is curved, what happens?
3:00
And I think the easiest example of that
3:02
is the surface of a sphere.
3:06
Let me draw a sphere over here.
3:09
So this right here is a sphere.
3:11
Let me draw some longitude and latitudinal
3:16
lines on this sphere.
3:18
On this sphere, all of a sudden-- and I'll
3:20
shade it in a little bit, make it
3:21
look nice-- this type of a sphere, you have a finite area.
3:25
You could imagine the surface of a balloon,
3:27
or the surface of a bubble, or the surface of the Earth.
3:30
You have a finite area, but you have no edge.
3:33
If you keep going forever in one direction,
3:39
you're going to go all the way around and come back
3:42
to the other side.
3:44
Now, to imagine a three-dimensional space
3:47
that has these same properties, a finite area
3:50
and-- and I don't want to say finite area anymore,
3:52
because we're not talking about a three-dimensional space.
3:55
Let me draw it over here.
3:56
So let's think about a three-dimensional space, so
4:00
a three-dimensional space.
4:07
Instead of area, since we're in three dimensions now,
4:10
I want to talk about a finite volume and no edge.
4:20
How do I do that?
4:21
And when you think about it superficially,
4:23
well, look, if I have a finite volume,
4:25
maybe it'll be contained in some type of a cube.
4:29
And then we clearly have edges in those situations.
4:32
Or you could even think about a finite volume
4:34
as being the inside of a sphere.
4:36
And that clearly has an edge, this entire surface over there.
4:39
So how do you construct a three-dimensional space
4:41
that has a finite volume and no edge?
4:43
And that I'm going to tell you right now,
4:45
it's very hard for us to visualize it.
4:48
But in order to visualize it, I'm
4:49
essentially going to draw the same thing
4:51
as I drew right here.
4:52
What you have to imagine, and you almost
4:54
have to imagine it by analogy, unless you
4:56
have some type of a profound brain wired
4:59
for more than three spatial dimensions, is a sphere.
5:06
So let me make it clear.
5:08
This is a two-dimensional surface.
5:15
On the surface of the sphere, you
5:17
can only move into directions, two perpendicular directions.
5:20
You could move like that or you could move like that.
5:23
You could move left and right or you could move up and down.
5:25
So it's a two-dimensional surface
5:29
of a three-dimensional sphere.
5:35
So if we take it by analogy, let's imagine,
5:38
and it's hard to imagine, a three-dimensional surface.
5:45
And you can do it mathematically.
5:46
The math here is actually not that difficult.
5:48
It's a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere.
6:00
And I'm going to draw it the same way.
6:02
So if we kind of view those three dimensions
6:04
are just these two dimensions of the surface, the same thing.
6:07
It's the same thing.
6:09
And if you imagine that-- I'm not
6:10
saying that this is actually the shape of the universe.
6:12
We don't know the actual shape.
6:15
But we do know that it does have a slight curvature.
6:17
We don't know the actual shape, but a sphere is the simplest.
6:20
There's other ones we could do.
6:22
A toroid would also fit the bill of having a finite volume
6:25
with no edge.
6:26
And another thing, I want to make it clear,
6:28
we actually don't even know whether it
6:29
has just a finite volume.
6:31
That's still an open question.
6:32
But what I want to do is show you
6:34
that it can have a finite volume and also have no edge.
6:38
And most people believe-- and I want to say ""believe"" here
6:43
because we can just go based on evidence and all
6:45
that-- that we are talking about something with a finite volume,
6:49
especially when you talk about the Big Bang theory.
6:52
That kind of, on some dimension, implies a finite volume,
6:56
although it could be a super large, unfathomably large
6:59
volume, it is finite.
7:01
Now, if you have this, let's imagine this sphere.
7:05
Let's imagine this sphere.
7:06
Once again, if you're on this surface
7:09
of this four-dimensional sphere--
7:11
I obviously can not draw a four-dimensional sphere.
7:14
But if you're on the surface of this four-dimensional sphere,
7:17
if you go in any direction, you'll come back out
7:20
and come back to where you started.
7:22
If you go that way, you'll come back around here.
7:25
Now, the universe is super huge.
7:26
So even light, maybe light itself
7:29
will take an unbelievable amount of time to traverse it.
7:32
And if this sphere itself is expanding,
7:35
it might be expanding so fast that light might not ever
7:39
be able to come back around it.
7:40
But in theory, if something were fast enough,
7:42
if something were to keep going around,
7:44
it could eventually go back to this point.
7:47
Now, when we talk about a three-dimensional surface--
7:50
it's a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere--
7:53
that means that any of the three dimensions-- over here,
7:56
on the surface, I can only draw two.
7:57
But that means if this is true, if the universe is
8:01
a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere, that
8:06
means that if you go up and you just keep going up,
8:09
you'll eventually come back from the bottom.
8:12
So if you keep going all the way up,
8:16
you'll eventually come back to the point that you were.
8:18
It might be an unbelievably large distance,
8:20
but you'll eventually get back where you were.
8:23
If you go to the right, you'll eventually
8:25
come back all the way around to the point where you were.
8:28
And if you were to go into the page--
8:29
so if you were to go into the page--
8:31
let me draw it that way-- if you go into the page,
8:33
you would eventually come back from above the page
8:36
and come back to the point that you are.
8:38
So that's what this implication would be.
8:41
That you would eventually get back to where you are.
8:43
So let's go back to the question of an expanding universe,
8:46
a expanding universe that's not expanding into any other space.
8:50
That is all of the space, but it's still expanding.
8:53
Well, this is the model.
8:54
So you could imagine shortly after the Big Bang,
8:57
our four-dimensional sphere looked like this.
9:01
Maybe it was a little small four-dimensional sphere.
9:05
Maybe right at the Big Bang, it was
9:07
like this little unbelievably small sphere.
9:09
Then a little bit later, it's this larger sphere.
9:12
Let me just shade it in to show you
9:15
that it's kind of popping out of the page, that's it's a sphere.
9:18
And then at a later time, the sphere might look like this.
9:21
The sphere might look like this.
9:25
Now, your temptation might be to say, wait,
9:28
Sal, isn't this stuff outside of this sphere,
9:31
isn't that some type of a space that it's expanding into?
9:34
Isn't that somehow part of the universe?
9:37
And I would say if you're talking in three dimensions,
9:40
no, it's not.
9:41
The entire universe is this surface.
9:44
It is this surface of this four-dimensional sphere.
9:47
If you start talking about more dimensions,
9:49
then, yes, you could talk about maybe things outside
9:52
of our three-dimensional universe.
9:56
So as this expands in space/time--
9:59
so one way to view the fourth dimension
10:01
is it is time itself-- things are just
10:03
getting further and further apart.
10:05
And I'll talk about more evidence in future videos
10:07
for why the Big Bang is the best theory we have out there right
10:11
now.
10:12
But as you could imagine, if you have
10:14
two points on this sphere that are that far apart,
10:17
as this sphere expands, this four-dimensional sphere, as
10:20
this bubble blows up or this balloon blows up,
10:23
those two points are just-- let me draw three points.
10:25
Let's say those are three points.
10:26
Those three points are just going
10:28
to get further and further apart.
10:30
And that's actually one of the main points that-- or one
10:35
of the first reasons why it made sense to believe the Big Bang--
10:37
is that everything is expanding, not from some central point.
10:40
But everything is expanding from everything.
10:43
That if you go in any direction from any point in the universe,
10:46
everything else is expanding away.
10:47
And the further away you go, it looks
10:48
like the faster it's expanding away from you.
10:52
So I'll leave you there, something for you
10:53
to kind of think about a little bit.
10:55
And then we'll build on some of this
10:57
to think about what it means to kind of observe
11:00
the observable universe.","So anywhere you go, you are standing in the center of the universe?"
khan_video_eVme7kuGyuo_8132,Math,ESSAY,"•
0:00
So I've got this crazy discontinuous function here,
0:03
which we'll call f of x.
0:05
And my goal is to try to draw its derivative right over here.
0:11
So what I'm going to need to think about
0:13
is the slope of the tangent line,
0:15
or the slope at each point in this curve,
0:17
and then try my best to draw that slope.
0:21
So let's try to tackle it.
0:23
So right over here at this point, the slope is positive.
0:28
And actually, it's a good bit positive.
0:32
And then as we get larger and larger x's, the slope
0:34
is still positive, but it's less positive-- and all the way up
0:39
to this point right over here, where it becomes 0.
0:44
So let's see how I could draw that over here.
0:46
So over here we know that the slope
0:48
must be equal to 0-- right over here.
0:50
Remember over here, I'm going to try
0:52
to draw y is equal to f prime of x.
0:58
And I'm going to assume that this
1:00
is some type of a parabola.
1:02
And you'll learn shortly why I had to make that assumption.
1:05
But let's say that, so let's see, here
1:08
the slope is quite positive.
1:10
So let's say the slope is right over here.
1:13
And then it gets less and less and less positive.
1:15
And I'll assume it does it in a linear fashion.
1:17
That's why I had to assume that it's some type of a parabola.
1:20
So it gets less and less and less positive.
1:21
Notice here, for example, the slope is still positive.
1:26
And so when you look at the derivative,
1:29
the slope is still a positive value.
1:31
But as we get larger and larger x's up to this point,
1:34
the slope is getting less and less positive,
1:36
all the way to 0.
1:37
And then the slope is getting more and more negative.
1:41
And at this point, it seems like the slope is just as negative
1:46
as it was positive there.
1:47
So at this point right over here,
1:49
the slope is just as negative as it
1:52
was positive right over there.
1:54
So it seems like this would be a reasonable view
1:58
of the slope of the tangent line over this interval.
2:04
Now let's think about as we get to this point.
2:07
Here the slope seems constant.
2:10
Our slope is a constant positive value.
2:13
So once again, our slope here is a constant positive line.
2:17
Let me be careful here because at this point,
2:20
our slope won't really be defined, because our slope,
2:23
you could draw multiple tangent lines
2:26
at this little pointy point.
2:28
So let me just draw a circle right over there.
2:33
But then as we get right over here,
2:34
the slope seems to be positive.
2:40
So let's draw that.
2:41
The slope seems to be positive, although it's
2:45
not as positive as it was there.
2:47
So the slope looks like it is-- I'm just trying to eyeball it--
2:53
so the slope is a constant positive this entire time.
2:56
We have a line with a constant positive slope.
2:59
So it might look something like this.
3:02
And let me make it clear what interval I am talking about.
3:08
I want these things to match up.
3:11
So let me do my best.
3:13
So this matches up to that.
3:17
This matches up over here.
3:21
And we just said we have a constant positive slope.
3:25
So let's say it looks something like that over this interval.
3:30
And then we look at this point right over here.
3:32
So right at this point, our slope is going to be undefined.
3:34
There's no way that you could find the slope over--
3:36
or this point of discontinuity.
3:38
But then when we go over here, even
3:39
though the value of our function has gone down,
3:41
we still have a constant positive slope.
3:43
In fact, the slope of this line looks
3:45
identical to the slope of this line.
3:47
Let me do that in a different color.
3:49
The slope of this line looks identical.
3:51
So we're going to continue at that same slope.
3:53
It was undefined at that point, but we're
3:55
going to continue at that same slope.
3:59
And once again, it's undefined here
4:01
at this point of discontinuity.
4:03
So the slope will look something like that.
4:06
And then we go up here.
4:07
The value of the function goes up,
4:09
but now the function is flat.
4:11
So the slope over that interval is 0.
4:13
The slope over this interval, right over here, is 0.
4:17
So we could say-- let me make it clear
4:21
what interval I'm talking about-- the slope
4:24
over this interval is 0.
4:27
And then finally, in this last section--
4:32
let me do this in orange-- the slope becomes negative.
4:37
But it's a constant negative.
4:40
And it seems actually a little bit more negative
4:42
than these were positive.
4:43
So I would draw it right over there.
4:48
So it's a weird looking function.
4:50
But the whole point of this video
4:51
is to give you an intuition for thinking about what
4:53
the slope of this function might look like at any point.
4:57
And by doing so, we have essentially
4:59
drawn the derivative over that interval.",Why is the derivative of second and third function a horizontal line?
khan_video_erjMiErRgSQ_102310,Math,ESSAY,"•
0:00
In the last video we hopefully learned the intuition
0:04
behind the ideal gas equation, that pressure times volume is
0:09
equal to the number of molecules we have
0:12
times some constant times the temperature.
0:17
And that's all nice and it hopefully it makes sense to you
0:20
how all of these fit together.
0:21
That pressure should be inverse to volume
0:23
and that's why you're multiplying both sides by each other.
0:27
You could take volume and put it on this side of the equation.
0:29
Or that pressure should be proportional
0:31
to the number of particles and the temperature.
0:33
But now let's apply it and actually do some problems.
0:36
Because just knowing this isn't good enough.
0:39
So let's say that I have a two liter container,
0:47
or let's say a two liter balloon, containing hydrogen gas.
1:03
And that's hydrogen as a diatomic molecule.
1:06
So each molecule has two hydrogens in it.
1:08
And let's say I'm measuring it at 30 degrees Celsius.
1:13
Use different color. 30 degrees Celsius.
1:18
My brain is really malfunctioning.
1:20
30 degrees, not 30 percent, 30 degrees Celsius.
1:27
And let's say that the pressure on the outside of the balloon,
1:33
we've measuredat two atmospheres.
1:39
So my question to you is
1:42
how many moles of hydrogen do we have? How many moles...
1:55
So let's apply our ideal gas equation.
1:59
And since we're dealing with liters and atmospheres,
2:02
we have to make sure we use the right proportionality constant.
2:05
But in general, if we keep pressure.
2:07
So our pressure is given in atmospheres.
2:09
Let me write down all the units, actually.
2:11
So we have 2 atmospheres times our volume is 2 liters,
2:24
is equal to n.
2:26
n is the number of particles we care about,
2:28
and we care about it in moles,
2:30
but let's just write n there for now.
2:31
Is equal to n times R.
2:37
I'll do R in a second times.
2:40
R times T.
2:43
Now you might be atempted to just put 30 degrees in there.
2:46
But in all of these problems--
2:48
in fact in general, whenever you're doing
2:49
any of these gas problems or thermodynamics problems,
2:53
or any time you're doing math with temperature--
2:56
you should always convert into Kelvin.
2:58
And just as a bit of review as to what Kelvin is,
3:01
it's just a different scale.
3:03
So for example, the lowest possible temperature
3:06
that can be achieved in the universe,
3:09
when you think about it in Celsius,
3:11
let me draw a little temperature scale here.
3:13
So if that's the temperature scale.
3:16
I'll draw two, one for Celsius and one for Kelvin.
3:20
So the lowest possible temperature
3:22
that can be achieved in the universe,
3:25
and when we say the lowest possible temperature that means that
3:32
the average kinetic energy of the molecules or the atoms are zero.
3:36
They're just not moving.
3:38
They're just stationary.
3:40
So in Celsius, it's minus 273.15 degrees Celsius.
3:49
So zero might be some place over here.
3:52
Zero, that's where water freezes.
3:55
And then 100 degrees, that's where water boils.
3:59
And you can immediately see, the whole Celsius scale
4:03
was made based on the freezing point
4:05
and the boiling point of water. Now, Kelvin.
4:08
So look at this and you say, if I have something that's 5 degrees
4:13
and I have another thing that's 10 degrees,
4:15
when you look at the Celsius scale, you're like,
4:17
oh, maybe the 10 degree thing it has twice
4:19
as much energy as the 5 degree thing.
4:21
It has twice the temperature.
4:22
But when you look at it from the absolute distance to zero.
4:25
Let me see if I can draw this.
4:30
So the 10 degree is all the way over here
4:33
and the 5 degree is almost as far, that far.
4:36
So the 10 degrees Celsius is only a slight increment
4:39
over 5 degrees Celsius, if you were to divide the two.
4:42
It's not twice as hot.
4:43
And that's why they came up with the Kelvin scale.
4:45
Because in the Kelvin scale, absolute zero is defined as 0.
4:49
Zero Kelvin. So this right here is zero degrees Kelvin.
4:56
And so zero degrees Kelvin is absolute zero.
4:58
So what is zero degrees Celsius?
5:00
And the increments are the same.
5:04
One degree change in Celsius
5:05
is one degree change in Kelvin.
5:07
So at least they keep it, it's just a shift.
5:09
So this is going to be plus 273 degrees Kelvin.
5:14
And then 5 degrees would be plus 278
5:17
10 degrees would be plus 283 Kelvin.
5:21
And then you see that 5 and 10 degrees
5:23
really aren't that different from each other.
5:25
But in general, if you want to convert from Celsius to Kelvin
5:27
you just add 273 degrees.
5:30
So 30 degrees Celsius is what?
5:34
Well, this 5 and 10 I drew too close to 100.
5:36
But let's say it's sitting here.
5:37
It would be 303 degrees Kelvin.
5:42
So this is equal to 303 degrees Kelvin.
5:48
All right, so now for our temperature,
5:51
that's what we were worried about.
5:52
We wanted to put in the temperature there.
5:54
So now we can put in our 303 degrees Kelvin.
5:59
Now we have to figure out what constant to use here.
6:03
And I've written a couple of down here.
6:05
Remember, we're dealing with atmospheres and liters.
6:08
So I wrote down a couple of versions of R right here.
6:13
Let's see we're dealing with atmospheres and liters.
6:16
And in the denominator we're always dealing
6:17
with mole and Kelvin no matter what.
6:19
So those are always going to be there.
6:20
So we should use this proportionality constant.
6:22
R is equal to 0.082 liter atmospheres per mole Kelvin.
6:28
Let me write that down.
6:30
So let me rewrite our whole equation actually.
6:34
So I have 2 atmospheres times 2 liters is equal to n times,
6:41
I have a bad memory, 0.082 liter atmospheres per mole Kelvin,
6:52
times 303 degrees Kelvin.
6:56
So let's see what we can do.
6:59
Let's see if all of the units work out.
7:01
So we can always, when you do dimensional analysis,
7:04
you can treat units like numbers.
7:06
So if you divide both sides of this equation by atmospheres,
7:09
the atmospheres cancel out.
7:11
Divide both sides of this equation by liters,
7:13
liters cancel out.
7:15
You have a Kelvin in the numerator,
7:17
Kelvin in the denominator, that cancels out.
7:19
And so we have 2 times 2 is
7:24
equal to n times 0.082 times 303.
7:34
And then we have just a per mole and a 1 over the mole.
7:39
So to solve for n, or the number of moles, what we do is
7:43
we divide both sides of this equation by all of this stuff.
7:47
So we get 2 times 2 is 4.
7:53
4 divided by 0.082 divided by 303.
8:01
I'm just taking this and putting it on the left-hand side,
8:03
dividing both sides by it.
8:05
And when you divide by a per mole,
8:06
if you put a 1 over a mole here,
8:08
that's the same thing as multiplying by a mole.
8:13
So it's good, the units all worked out.
8:15
We're getting n in terms of moles.
8:17
And so we just have to get the calculator out
8:19
and figure out how many moles we're dealing with.
8:21
So we have 4 divided by 0.082
8:27
divided by 303 is equal to 0.16.
8:33
If we wanted to go more digits, 0.161,
8:35
but we'll just round.
8:36
So this is equal to 0.16 moles of H2.
8:43
I am telling you actually here,
8:46
the exact number of hydrogen molecules.
8:51
But if you wanted a number,
8:54
you'd just multiply this times 6.02 times 10 to the 23
8:58
and then you would have a number in kind of the traditional sense.
9:00
And of course, if you wanted to know
9:02
what is the mass of the hydrogen you have.
9:05
You'd say, OK well one mole of H2 has a mass of what?
9:12
The mass of one hydrogen is one atomic mass unit.
9:18
The mass of two hydrogen when it's in its molecular form,
9:21
is two atomic mass units.
9:23
So a mole of it is going to be 2 grams.
9:26
So in this case, we have 0.16 moles.
9:30
So if we wanted to convert that to grams, this in the case
9:34
of these hydrogen gas molecules would be 0.32 grams.
9:41
And I just multiplied it by 2 because each mole is 2 grams.
9:45
Anyway, I hope you found that
9:46
there's a bunch more of these problems.
9:48
Because I think the math is pretty straightforward here.
9:51
The thing that always makes it daunting, I think,
9:54
is the units and making sure you're using the right units.
9:56
What is they are using meters cubed instead of liters,
9:59
or kilopascals instead of atmospheres.
10:01
So I'll try to do a bunch of examples
10:02
where we use all the different units
10:04
and you're able to pick our constants appropriately.",why we used the pressure on outside of balloon at 1:34.......shouldn't we use the pressure of the gas inside the balloon in the equation?
khan_video_fif5ghe8JM0_18,Science,MCQ,"•
0:01
This is Sal here and I'm at Stanford Medical School with Dr. Andy Connelly.
0:05
Hi there Sal, I'm here to discuss with you histology today.
0:10
Histology! And, and forgive me, for what is probably a simple question, but what is histology?
0:14
So it will be the -ology, the study of, in this case the histo-, means tissues.
0:20
We're going to be looking up the cellular components of organs.
0:28
Cool... yeah.
0:29
So what we're going to be looking at today is the histology of the colon.
0:32
And so for the colon we often have colon specimens coming in from pathology.
0:39
And so the colon, like you were saying before, is the large intestine.
0:45
So if you have this piece of large intestine, and its removed from the patient because there is an area
0:53
of cancer.
0:54
It might be cancer, they're actually pretty good now about doing colonoscopy.
1:01
Looking from the inside--
1:03
They'll often have looked inside think it looks like cancer
1:09
take a little piece and send it to us before hand, and then they remove it.
1:12
And the reason why they want to send it to you is
1:15
even if they know its cancer how severe is this cancer?
1:18
How severe is the cancer? They also want to get a really good tissue diagnosis
1:22
to make sure if they're going to go remove a piece of your colon, that they really know that its cancer
1:28
rather than it just looks like cancer.
1:30
So its the definitive proof before they remove it.
1:32
So then if this is the cancer that's removed they clearly want to be able to check the margins
1:38
to make sure its removed in its entirety.
1:41
But often inside of there, they'll find other pieces of tissues, like here's a polyp
1:46
And when we say check the margins, this is literally, just making sure
1:50
you've covered enough material so that you've gotten all the cancer in it
1:53
that you're not kind of cutting through the cancer and that you've missed something.
1:56
That's right, because this is actually one of the traditional
1:58
surgical cures of cut it out to cure.
2:01
Colon cancer, that tends to still be the case.
2:04
Because you cut it out to make sure you cure it.
2:07
There are many other kinds of cancers that which spread so widely early on
2:09
that you don't usually cut out.
2:12
So then the polyp can be found in a piece of colon removed
2:17
a polyp is something that just sticks up.
2:20
Any tissue that sticks up. It's not necessarily cancer.
2:23
No, so for instance another common place you hear about is
2:28
some people in the sinuses might have sinus trouble
2:30
and they'll have a sinus polyp
2:32
those are almost always just inflamed.
2:34
And then we'll find areas in which it's just the lining
2:40
that's been roughened, and we'll take sections of those.
2:43
And that can happen from just someone being allergic to food
2:46
Yeah, irritations of such.
2:48
Yes, irritations of certain sites.
2:51
So we're going to have the areas where its kind of irritated
2:54
some in which there's a polyp sticking out
2:56
and we'll look at it under a microscope
2:59
and then that's the thing that we're mainly worried about
3:02
So that's what we're going to cover in the slides
3:06
that we look at today.
3:08
So this first one we're looking at is an example of
3:11
a normal margin
3:12
And so it's from a little piece
3:14
from the edge
3:16
So they actually call the tissue margin?
3:18
Yeah, tissue margin
3:20
Normal tissue.
3:21
So this is the edge of the specimen, and [the surgeons will] say, ""Is the margin clear?""
3:25
Dr: In this case this is an example where the margin IS clear.
3:29
This is normal-looking colon.
3:30
S: This is a cross-section, crossing the boundary of the colon,
3:34
this area at the top right here, would be the inside of the colon, where the poop is...
3:43
Dr: Doctors say stool. That's the stool in the middle, and the supportive tissue is underneath.
3:51
S: Part of the structural tissue of the tube?
3:53
Dr: Right. Now let's drive around the slide.
3:59
This is a virtual slide where we took the typical glass microscope slide, and put it in a special
4:04
machine which took lots and lots of photographs at high power, then stitched them all together
4:09
as one massive image. So that allows you to zoom in and look around.
4:13
S: To let me get my own bearings, this polyp...
4:16
Dr: No, this is just regular tissue--a little bit of a fold, not a polyp.
4:20
S: So how large is this, about a centimeter?
4:25
Dr: About like that. If I had to guess, about 5-6mm.
4:31
So, now to drive around, these are the controls for zooming in and out.
4:43
So I can look at something more closely, and this is the mucosa.
4:55
S: Mucosa. Sounds very similar to mucus.
4:57
Dr: Right. The mucosa is the lining that makes the mucus, it's the slimy part.
5:03
S: This white stuff up here?
5:07
Dr: This suff is the slimy mucus. So, it keeps the insides from drying out--
5:16
because it's a very hydrated gel. It also means that things can glide along without
5:21
abrading the surface. When you look at it, it has architecture in which
5:25
these glands, they're like test-tubes sticking down, and the purpose is to increase the surface area.
5:36
S: And the term gland, is any structure containing fluid and releases the fluid?
5:42
Dr: A gland is an epithelial structure, so it's made of cells that are packed tightly,
5:49
and the cells have a top and a bottom, and they're formed into some sort of enfolding
5:54
or structure, so that there is a middle and an outside.
5:57
S: When we say something is epithelial, it's the stuff facing the outside world?
6:04
Dr: Yes. The epithelium is a special class of cells in which they are facing the outside world,
6:09
again, tightly packed, and there's a top and a bottom.
6:13
S: And even though to a layperson this area right here does not seem like the outside world,
6:19
it seems like it's inside of you, we're kind of like big donuts.
6:21
Dr: That's right. And the colonoscopist proves that it's connected to the outside world.
6:27
S: MUAHAHA!! I guess they do prove that! XD
6:29
Dr: So that's still the outside world. This is the architecture where you have enfoldings to increase
6:40
the surface area. And it's creating this mucus.
6:42
Let me look at the highest power. Look at these cells! When we look at these cells,
6:50
there are two main types of cells. There's this one here, which is the goblet cell.
6:56
S: Goblet cell. It's not just this white part, it goes all the way down there?
7:05
Dr: Yeah...let me have that pen! It has a top like that, and you see this wine glass?
7:13
S: It's literally shaped like a goblet! I was circling the wrong handle.
7:20
Dr: That nucleus belonged to some other cell.
7:23
What's next to it is these thin cells here, which do not have all the mucus inside of them.
7:32
These guys are the tall ones.
7:35
S: Where you see only the nucleus? The white part is just the mucus inside the cell.
7:39
Dr: Yes. Mucus is the term for either the overall structure or the material that is elaborated up here,
7:52
chemically it is called mucin, and mucin is almost like that goo runners eat,
7:59
it is just a lot of sugar holding a lot of water.
8:02
S: I see. I guess it would be bad branding to call it Mucus-In-A-Bag. MUAHAHA!! >:-}
8:08
Dr: Exactly! So they stick with ""goo"". But this one has a lot of sugar, takes in lots of water,
8:13
that is released and it forms this surface here.
8:16
S: To let stuff flow by.
8:19
Dr: What the other cell does is the other main thing in addition to letting things flow through,
8:23
is to absorb water. So the idea is you do not want to release the 2L of fluid you have
8:29
around every one of your meals. You want to get a lot of that back.
8:32
S: That's one of the main functions of the large intestine?
8:35
Dr: It is. It is a consolidation process to the stool. So you're going to absorb a lot of water
8:38
and doing it through these cells.
8:44
S: The mucin comes out here, and the water absorbed by parts without mucin, so right there.
8:54
Dr: Yupperz. That's right. The two main functions of the colon are right there with those two cells.
9:02
S: To get a perspective of where we are, the whole thing is about .5cm, what's our scale here?
9:13
Dr: Our favorite scale-bar here is to look for blood vessels, for red blood cells,
9:26
One right there, is 7micro- m in diameter.
9:30
S: 7micro-m. A micrometer is a millionth of a meter, or 1/1000th of 1mm.
9:36
Dr: That's right. Let's round off to 1/100th of 1mm.
9:41
S: You put 100 of these next to each other you get 1mm. So 1mm would be bigger than our entire screen.
9:47
Dr: Right. You see with these glands, 1mm would be this span, which we're saying is about like that,
9:54
That's why from here to here it might be about 7mm.
9:57
Dr: RBCs are found in just about every microscopic field, and they're always 7micro-m.
10:03
When looking here, this is very well formed. You can see these tubular glands,
10:16
just a hint over here, because they are like test-tubes, sometimes they're not going straight up and
10:20
down, sometimes they look a little on an angle...
10:22
S: They actually are reaching the surface, we just don't see it based on the way it's cut?
10:28
So this one right here, it was cut at an angle, so it looks embedded there in 2D,
10:34
but in 3D we would see a full tube.
10:37
Dr: Just to go back to the microscopy, we're seeing this because it's only 4microns thick,
10:43
and we're sending light through this tissue.
10:48
So that's why you can get a cross-section that doesn't show you 3D. Very much 2D.
10:53
S: Cool! So this is what a healthy margin tissue would look like?
11:03
Dr: Yes, this is a healthy colon, so you would thankfully say on the proximal margin,
11:08
which is up more towards the mouth, that's clear. You take another section like this from the distal
11:13
margin, more towards the end, and you say that's clear, so that means they removed the cancer.
11:17
S: When you say proximal margin is close to the mouth,
11:20
you're saying the mouth of that cut of the tube, not mouth of the person.
11:27
Dr: That's right. So the proximal and distal margins are clear, if they look like this.","Which is the colon ""cell""?"

0:06
Instead, they're more likely to say something like
0:08
the patient has acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.
0:11
So, what do all of those other words mean?
0:13
Well, to understand that we'd have to
0:15
go back to this diagram, which at this point
0:18
is probably showing up in your dreams,
0:20
because of how many times I've used it,

So, you'd end up with a row of cells on top that has
0:43
the most immature blood cells
0:45
that you could possibly have and a row of cells
0:48
at the bottom which has some still immature cells,
0:51
but these cells are a little bit more developed,
0:54
a little bit further along.
0:56
So, this is actually the first way that
0:58
you can split up the leukemias.
1:00
If a leukemia comes from one of these cells up here,
1:02
it's called an acute leukemia, and if it comes from
1:07
one of these cells down here,
1:08
it's called a chronic leukemia.
1:10
So, the first way to split up the leukemias
1:13
is by how immature the originating cell is.
1:17
So, what do the words acute and chronic
1:19
have to do with maturity?
1:21
That seems like a really random word choice, right?
1:24
Well, it's actually not, because acute leukemias,
1:27
turns out they grow very fast, they grow very fast.
1:31
So, a person with an acute leukemia
1:33
can start to feel sick, can start to show signs and symptoms
1:36
within weeks, not years but weeks of the leukemia forming.
1:41
So, it's a very acute onset of disease, okay?
1:46
Now, chronic leukemias, turns out they grow very slowly.
1:49
So, a patient with a chronic leukemia can sometimes
1:53
go years without having any symptoms at all.
1:56
So, it's a very chronic onset of disease.
2:01
So, I just want to clarify, guys, that the whole process
2:04
by which the leukemia occurs is still the same.
2:07
So, we still have this immature blood cell
2:09
that loses the ability to mature and then starts
2:12
dividing rapidly and out of control.
2:15
That's still going on, but what we're doing now is
2:17
we're fine-tuning what we mean by the word, immature.
2:21
So, we're asking the question,
2:22
just how immature is that blood cell?
2:25
And so, I want to go back to the diagram
2:29
that we used to show how leukemias occur.
2:31
So, we said that this is what normal blood cell
2:34
maturation looks like, right?
2:36
And this is what happens when leukemia occurs.
2:39
So, you have this blood cell that's stuck.
2:41
It's arrested in the immature state,
2:44
and it can't move any further, and then it starts
2:46
to divide really rapidly and out of control.
2:49
So, look at the leukemia cells.
2:51
Since they're in the first stage of development,
2:53
they're the most immature blood cells
2:55
that you could possibly have.
2:56
This must be a picture of acute leukemia.
2:59
So, let's compare that with what
3:01
chronic leukemias look like.
3:03
So, a chronic leukemia picture looks more like this,
3:07
where you still have these blood cells,
3:09
these immature blood cells that are arrested
3:11
in their maturation, they can't move forward,
3:14
and they start dividing really rapidly.
3:15
The only difference is, is that this time
3:18
the leukemia cells are a little bit more developed.
3:20
They're at the next stage of maturation,
3:22
and not only do these chronic leukemia cells
3:25
divide really rapidly, but they also live longer
3:29
than the average normal blood cell does.
3:32
So, there's a degree of immortality
3:34
that these chronic leukemia cells have.
3:36
So, this is a picture of chronic leukemia.
3:42
Now, something else that I think this diagram
3:45
does a pretty decent job of illustrating is that
3:47
when you have an acute leukemia,
3:49
your leukemia cells look nothing like your
3:51
mature specialized cells.
3:52
I mean, they bear no resemblance whatsoever,
3:55
and we said before that these cells
3:57
perform almost no function.
3:59
They're just kind of like a waste of space
4:01
versus if you look at your chronic leukemia cells,
4:03
they don't look exactly like your
4:06
mature specialized cells, but they certainly
4:07
resemble them just a little bit more, right?
4:10
And in terms of their function, they leave a lot
4:14
to be wanted, but it's not unreasonable to say that
4:17
they can do a couple of things correctly.
4:20
You know, they won't do everything,
4:21
but they can do a couple of things correctly.
4:24
So, this is the first way you can split up
4:26
the leukemias, acute versus chronic,
4:28
where acute leukemias come from the most immature cells,
4:31
chronic a little bit more developed,
4:33
a little bit more mature cells.
4:34
Acute leukemias grow very rapidly.
4:37
Chronic leukemias grow slowly.
4:39
And acute leukemia cells bear no resemblance
4:41
in appearance or in function to the
4:43
mature specialized cells versus chronic leukemia cells
4:47
resemble the mature specialized cells
4:49
a little bit more, in terms of appearance
4:51
and what they're able to do, okay?
4:55
So, now let's talk about the second way
4:56
you can split up the leukemias.
4:57
And so, this time we're going to take this diagram,
4:59
and we're going to split it in half vertically,
5:02
and if we did that, we drew a line down the middle,
5:05
we'd be splitting up the cells not according to
5:07
how mature they are but according to what cell type,
5:10
what type of cell they are.
5:12
So, you'd end up with the myeloid cells over here
5:15
and the lymphoid cells over here, and you can leave
5:17
things as broad as myeloid versus lymphoid, or you can
5:20
specify a little bit more about what cell lineage,
5:24
particular cell lineage you're talking about.
5:26
So, this is the second way that the leukemias
5:28
are split up, according to cell type.
5:30
So, I want to go back to that first example
5:33
that I gave you in the beginning of the video,
5:35
acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.
5:38
What cell does that leukemia develop from?
5:40
Well, if we're talking about acute, it must come from
5:44
this row over here, right?
5:45
And we said acute megakaryoblastic,
5:48
so that must be this cell right here, this cell right here.
5:52
So, an acute megakaryoblastic leukemia
5:54
comes from this cell right here.
5:56
So, let's take another example.
5:57
What about chronic lymphocytic leukemia?
6:00
So, chronic means that it must come from
6:02
one of these cells down here.
6:03
Lymphocytic must be pointing to either
6:05
this cell or this cell, right, one of the lymphocytes.
6:09
And you can leave it as broad as that
6:11
or you can specify whether you're talking about a
6:12
B lymphocyte or a T lymphocyte, okay?
6:15
So, that's how all the leukemias are split up.
6:17
Now, we're ready to go into the details
6:19
about the different leukemias.",So couldn't someone treat this mutation simply by further mutating these immature fast producing cells into a fast producing mature cell and manipulating them to die off more quickly?

So I have a three-dimensional solid right over here.
0:03
And I want to imagine what type of a shape
0:05
I would get if I were to make a vertical cut.
0:09
And just to refresh ourselves, or give us
0:12
a sense of what a vertical cut is,
0:14
imagine if this was made out of jello or something
0:18
kind of fairly soft.
0:19
But it's still a three-dimensional solid.
0:21
And I were to make a cut-- let's say
0:23
I were to make a cut right over here.
0:25
So let's say I had this big, sharp metal
0:29
thing-- let me draw it like that.
0:31
So you have this big, sharp metal thing.
0:33
Let me draw it a little bit neater.
0:36
So you have this big, sharp metal thing
0:39
that I'm going to cut right over here.
0:42
So this is the thing that I'm going to make the cut.
0:44
And I'm going to go straight down.
0:45
This is a vertical cut that we're talking about.
0:47
So this is the thing that I'm going to cut with.
0:52
Let me make it big enough so that it
0:53
can capture the shape that will result.
0:57
So this thing right over here, it's right in front.
1:00
And I'm going to cut-- I'm going to make it go straight
1:03
down and cut through this jello, or whatever
1:06
you want to call it, this rectangular pyramid of jello.
1:10
And what would be the resulting shape of the intersection
1:13
between the jello and this thing that I'm using to cut it?
1:17
And now I encourage you to pause your video
1:19
and think about what the resulting shape would be.
1:21
And the shape would be in two dimensions.
1:23
Because this purple surface is a two-dimensional--
1:27
you could view it as part of a plane.
1:29
And so where this intersects when you cut down
1:32
this rectangular pyramid is the shape we're looking for.
1:35
So I encourage you to pause the video and think about it
1:38
or try to come up with it on your own.
1:41
So let's think about it.
1:42
And let me draw the rectangular pyramid again.
1:48
So that's the same one.
1:50
And now let me see what it would look like once
1:52
I've done my cut, once I've brought this thing down.
1:58
So then this is where I cut.
2:00
So I cut it right over here.
2:05
And then it'll exit the bottom.
2:07
It'll cut along this side like that,
2:12
cut along that side like that.
2:14
And then it'll exit the bottom right over there.
2:19
And so let me draw my whole thing.
2:23
And so once I slice it down, it will look like this.
2:30
My best shot at drawing it-- it will look like this.
2:37
This is a vertical cut.
2:38
So I've brought this thing down.
2:40
And now the intersection between the thing that I'm cutting with
2:42
and this pyramid is going to be this shape right over here.
2:47
It cut into the top right over there.
2:49
It would get all the way to the bottom right over there.
2:51
And along this side, it would cut right there.
2:54
And along that side, it would cut right over there.
2:56
So what's the resulting shape in two dimensions
2:59
of essentially the intersection between the slicer
3:01
and the jello?
3:03
Well, it would be this thing.
3:05
It would look like a trapezoid.
3:06
Let me do that in a new color.
3:07
I'm overusing that one color.
3:12
It would look like a trapezoid.
3:14
So this would be the resulting shape.
3:19
So the resulting shape would look like this.
3:25
Just like that, if you made the cut right over there.","Is there a reason that if a 3-D figure has x faces and you take a 2-D slice of it, the maximum number of sides of the shape are the same as the number of faces of the figure?"

In the last video, we left off with the assassination
0:03
of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the heir
0:08
to the Austro-Hungarian empire.
0:11
And so you could imagine, the Austro-Hungarian empire
0:15
did not take that well.
0:16
They already did not enjoy the kingdom of Serbia trying to,
0:21
essentially, provoke this nationalistic movement.
0:24
And they viewed them as this small, little, weak country
0:27
right below them.
0:29
And so they use this to, essentially,
0:31
issue an ultimatum.
0:32
Essentially say, look, immediately
0:34
bring all the people who did this to justice,
0:37
all the people who might have conspired with the Gavrilo
0:40
Princips to allow this assassination
0:43
attempt to occur, and do it or else,
0:46
and accept full responsibility.
0:48
And actually, the kingdom of Serbia
0:51
was in no mood to get into a war with Austria-Hungary,
0:55
and so they tried their best to comply,
0:57
but their best wasn't enough.
0:59
So then July 28, a month later, you
1:03
have the Austrians declaring war on the Serbians.
1:15
Now up until this point, the Austro-Hungarian empire
1:19
is thinking, OK, Serbia is a small, little kingdom here.
1:21
It has some ties and obviously, it's a Slavic nation
1:24
so it has some linguistic ties with the Russian empire.
1:27
The Russian empire also had some political ties to it,
1:29
but Russia is not going to get into a war with us over this.
1:32
We're justified in attacking them.
1:33
They've just killed the heir to our throne.
1:36
So we're going to go in there and Russia is probably not
1:38
interested in actually creating a larger skirmish here.
1:43
That was a severe miscalculation on the part of the Austrians.
1:48
The Russians were not happy about this.
1:50
They felt close ties to the Serbians
1:52
and they felt a need to protect the Serbians,
1:55
or you could argue, that maybe they
1:57
wanted to mobilize just to scare the Austrians.
2:00
Whatever it might be, whether it was Russia
2:02
wanted to get into a war, whether they were really
2:03
looking to protect the Serbians, or whether they were looking
2:06
to mobilize to scare the Austrians from actually
2:09
attacking, the Russians began to mobilize.
2:12
So the Russians began to gather their troops.
2:16
So the Russians mobilize.
2:23
And now, this is where all of the alliances
2:25
start to come into effect.
2:28
If you remember about the alliances
2:30
we talked about several videos ago, if you go to 1879,
2:36
you have the Dual Alliance Treaty
2:38
between Germany and Austria-Hungary
2:40
to protect each other if Russia attacks and actually,
2:42
if Russia attacks or mobilizes.
2:45
So now, Germany is like, hey, maybe I
2:47
am obligated to protect Austria-Hungary from Russia.
2:50
You also have to remember in 1892, the Franco-Russian
2:54
Military Convention.
2:55
Military assistance both ways in the event of attack.
2:59
So Germany is thinking, look, we signed this treaty
3:02
and we, to some degree, are maybe eager for war
3:05
because we've been militarizing so much.
3:08
And I can't just fight Russia.
3:10
I also know that France and Russia
3:11
have this alliance right over here.
3:14
So Germany in quite surprising quickness
3:17
decides to declare war on both.
3:19
So on August 1, Germany declares war on Russia.
3:31
And then on August 3, Germany declares war on France
3:42
because they know or at least they
3:44
feel that they can't declare war on only one of them.
3:46
And they wanted to do it very quickly because they didn't
3:48
want Russia a chance to mobilize too much.
3:51
And the fact that they were able to do this so quickly--
3:53
we're talking three days after Austria declares war on Serbia
3:57
and then another two days declare war
3:59
on France-- kind of shows that Germany was already
4:01
in a war footing.
4:02
It's not a joke to all of a sudden invade
4:04
or declare war on countries.
4:06
So Germany was, essentially, preparing for this.
4:08
And this right over here gave them
4:11
the excuse to, essentially, declare war.
4:15
So they declare war on both of these characters, Germany
4:18
against Russia.
4:19
Germany is declaring war on France.
4:22
Now, the easiest way for them to move into France--
4:25
so they're literally going on the offense
4:27
here-- is for them to go through Belgium.
4:34
But the Germans were aware.
4:36
They're aware that there's this 75-year-old treaty, the Treaty
4:39
of London in 1839, Article 7 said
4:42
that Britain was to protect the neutrality of Belgium.
4:46
And Germany was in no interest to get
4:48
into a war with the British.
4:49
The British had a powerful military,
4:52
especially a very powerful navy.
4:55
The Germans said, hey, let's just
4:56
take on the Russians and the French for now.
4:58
And so they actually reached out to the British
5:00
and said, hey, this little treaty that you got here
5:03
from 1839, this 75-year-old treaty,
5:04
you don't really take this seriously, right?
5:06
I mean if we have to go through Belgium,
5:08
you're not really going to hold true to this treaty?
5:11
And the British said, no, we actually
5:13
take that very seriously.
5:15
Obviously, the British didn't want
5:17
the Germans to be aggressive here.
5:18
The British didn't want the Germans
5:20
to be able to invade France.
5:22
And so on August 4 when Germany, essentially,
5:31
rolls through Belgium, Germany invades
5:33
Belgium to get to France, this gave the legal justification
5:40
for the British to declare war on Germany.
5:52
And so in a matter of only-- I mean not even, we're
5:54
talking a few months here from the assassination of Franz
5:58
Ferdinand of Austria, you essentially
6:01
have all of the major powers of Europe.
6:03
And then as we'll see because they had these empires, in not
6:07
too long most of the world is at war with each other.","How did Germany prepare so quickly for war, and why was it so eager for war?"

Let's imagine we have a huge cloud
0:02
of hydrogen atoms floating in space.
0:05
Huge, and when I say huge cloud, huge both in distance
0:08
and in mass.
0:09
If you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,
0:11
it would just be this really, really massive thing.
0:15
So you have this huge cloud.
0:16
Well, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually
0:20
attracted to each other.
0:21
It's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.
0:25
But it would slowly affect these atoms.
0:27
And they would slowly draw close to each other.
0:30
It would slowly condense.
0:31
They'd slowly move towards the center
0:34
of mass of all of the atoms.
0:37
They'd slowly move in.
0:39
So if we fast forward, this cloud's
0:42
going to get denser and denser.
0:46
And the hydrogen atoms are going to start
0:48
bumping into each other and rubbing up against each other
0:51
and interacting with each other.
0:53
And so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.
0:56
Now remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.
0:58
So the temperature is going up.
1:03
And it'll-- they'll keep condensing.
1:05
They'll just keep condensing and condensing
1:07
until something really interesting happens.
1:09
So let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here
1:12
in the center.
1:16
And there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.
1:19
It's really dense.
1:20
I could never draw the actual number of atoms here.
1:22
This is really to give you an idea.
1:24
There's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,
1:28
from everything that wants to get
1:29
to that center of mass of our entire cloud.
1:32
The temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.
1:38
And at that point, something neat happens.
1:40
And to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,
1:43
let's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.
1:46
A hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just
1:48
going to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.
1:49
So the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.
1:50
If you want to think about a hydrogen atom,
1:52
it also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.
1:57
And let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.
1:59
And obviously this distance isn't to scale.
2:02
This distance is also not to scale.
2:04
Atoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms
2:05
are actually much, much, much, much smaller
2:07
than the actual radius of an atom.
2:10
And so is the electron.
2:11
But anyway, this just gives you an idea.
2:13
So we know from the Coulomb forces,
2:14
from electromagnetic forces, that these two positively
2:17
charged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere
2:20
near each other.
2:22
But we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four
2:25
forces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,
2:28
that if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures
2:31
and huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close
2:35
enough to each other, then all of a sudden,
2:37
the strong force will overtake.
2:39
It's much stronger than the Coulomb force.
2:41
And then these two hydrogens will actually--
2:43
these nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?
2:48
Well, anyway, they would actually fuse together.
2:50
And so that is what actually happens
2:53
once this gets hot and dense enough.
2:57
You now have enough pressure and enough temperature
2:59
to overcome the Coulomb force and bring
3:02
these protons close enough to each other for fusion
3:05
to occur, for fusion ignition.
3:12
And the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.
3:14
It's not ignition.
3:15
It's not combustion in the traditional sense.
3:16
It's not like you're burning a carbon molecule
3:20
in the presence of oxygen.
3:22
It's not combustion.
3:23
It's ignition.
3:24
And the reason why it's called ignition
3:25
is because when two of these protons,
3:27
or two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus
3:32
has a slightly smaller mass.
3:35
And so in the first stage of this,
3:36
you actually have two protons under enough pressure--
3:42
obviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--
3:44
with enough pressure they get close enough.
3:46
And then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.
3:51
One of these guys degrades into a neutron.
3:56
And the resulting mass of the combined protons
3:59
is lower than the mass of each of the original.
4:01
By a little bit, but that little bit of mass
4:04
results in a lot of energy-- plus energy.
4:11
And this energy is why we call it ignition.
4:13
And so what this energy does is it provides
4:16
a little bit of outward pressure,
4:17
so that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.
4:21
So once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.
4:24
And then that energy provides outward pressure
4:26
to balance what is now a star.
4:30
So now we are at where we actually
4:32
have the ignition at the center.
4:35
We have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying
4:39
to get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.
4:43
Now, what is the hydrogen being fused into?
4:46
Well, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just
4:50
kind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens
4:54
in stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.
5:00
I have trouble spelling.
5:01
Which is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.
5:03
This is still hydrogen because it
5:04
has one proton and one neutron now.
5:07
It is not helium yet.
5:08
This does not have two-- it does not have two protons.
5:12
But then the deuterium keeps fusing.
5:14
And then we eventually end up with helium.
5:19
And we can even see that on the periodic table.
5:21
Oh, I lost my periodic table.
5:22
Well, I'll show you the next video.
5:23
But we know hydrogen in its atomic state
5:30
has an atomic number of 1.
5:32
And it also has a mass of 1.
5:34
It only has one nucleon in its nucleus.
5:38
But it's being fused.
5:39
It goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,
5:42
which is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.
5:46
And then that eventually gets fused--
5:48
and I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--
5:50
into helium.
5:51
And by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.
5:56
So it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,
5:58
in particular, that isotope of helium--
6:00
it has an atomic mass of 4.
6:03
And this process releases a ton of energy.
6:06
Because the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced
6:09
is slightly lower than four times the atomic mass
6:15
of each of the constituent hydrogens.
6:17
So all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it
6:21
needs super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--
6:24
keeps the star from collapsing.
6:28
And once a star is in this stage,
6:31
once it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen
6:35
in its core, where the pressure and the temperature
6:37
is the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.
6:41
This is now a main sequence star.
6:48
And that's actually where the sun is right now.
6:50
Now there's questions of, well, what if there just
6:53
wasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?
6:56
And there actually are things that
6:57
never get to quite that threshold
6:59
to fuse all the way into helium.
7:00
There are a few things that don't quite
7:02
make the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.
7:05
So they are generating some of their heat.
7:06
Or there are even smaller objects
7:08
that just get to the point there's
7:10
a huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually
7:13
occurring inside of the core.
7:15
And something like Jupiter would be an example.
7:17
And you could go several masses above Jupiter
7:20
where you get something like that.
7:21
So you have to reach a certain threshold
7:23
where the mass, where the pressure and the temperature
7:25
due to the heavy mass, get so large that you
7:27
start this fusion.
7:28
And-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,
7:31
the slower the fusion will occur.
7:33
But if you're super massive, the fusion
7:35
will occur really, really fast.
7:37
So that's the general idea of just how stars get formed
7:40
and why they don't collapse on themselves
7:43
and why they are these kind of balls
7:45
of fusion reactions existing in the universe.
7:48
In the next few videos, we'll talk
7:50

7:54
starts to run out.","And, speculating further, would it be possible for that binary system to have terrestrial planets within the orbits of the two stars?"

Let's imagine we have a huge cloud
0:02
of hydrogen atoms floating in space.
0:05
Huge, and when I say huge cloud, huge both in distance
0:08
and in mass.
0:09
If you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,
0:11
it would just be this really, really massive thing.
0:15
So you have this huge cloud.
0:16
Well, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually
0:20
attracted to each other.
0:21
It's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.
0:25
But it would slowly affect these atoms.
0:27
And they would slowly draw close to each other.
0:30
It would slowly condense.
0:31
They'd slowly move towards the center
0:34
of mass of all of the atoms.
0:37
They'd slowly move in.
0:39
So if we fast forward, this cloud's
0:42
going to get denser and denser.
0:46
And the hydrogen atoms are going to start
0:48
bumping into each other and rubbing up against each other
0:51
and interacting with each other.
0:53
And so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.
0:56
Now remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.
0:58
So the temperature is going up.
1:03
And it'll-- they'll keep condensing.
1:05
They'll just keep condensing and condensing
1:07
until something really interesting happens.
1:09
So let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here
1:12
in the center.
1:16
And there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.
1:19
It's really dense.
1:20
I could never draw the actual number of atoms here.
1:22
This is really to give you an idea.
1:24
There's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,
1:28
from everything that wants to get
1:29
to that center of mass of our entire cloud.
1:32
The temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.
1:38
And at that point, something neat happens.
1:40
And to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,
1:43
let's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.
1:46
A hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just
1:48
going to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.
1:49
So the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.
1:50
If you want to think about a hydrogen atom,
1:52
it also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.
1:57
And let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.
1:59
And obviously this distance isn't to scale.
2:02
This distance is also not to scale.
2:04
Atoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms
2:05
are actually much, much, much, much smaller
2:07
than the actual radius of an atom.
2:10
And so is the electron.
2:11
But anyway, this just gives you an idea.
2:13
So we know from the Coulomb forces,
2:14
from electromagnetic forces, that these two positively
2:17
charged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere
2:20
near each other.
2:22
But we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four
2:25
forces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,
2:28
that if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures
2:31
and huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close
2:35
enough to each other, then all of a sudden,
2:37
the strong force will overtake.
2:39
It's much stronger than the Coulomb force.
2:41
And then these two hydrogens will actually--
2:43
these nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?
2:48
Well, anyway, they would actually fuse together.
2:50
And so that is what actually happens
2:53
once this gets hot and dense enough.
2:57
You now have enough pressure and enough temperature
2:59
to overcome the Coulomb force and bring
3:02
these protons close enough to each other for fusion
3:05
to occur, for fusion ignition.
3:12
And the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.
3:14
It's not ignition.
3:15
It's not combustion in the traditional sense.
3:16
It's not like you're burning a carbon molecule
3:20
in the presence of oxygen.
3:22
It's not combustion.
3:23
It's ignition.
3:24
And the reason why it's called ignition
3:25
is because when two of these protons,
3:27
or two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus
3:32
has a slightly smaller mass.
3:35
And so in the first stage of this,
3:36
you actually have two protons under enough pressure--
3:42
obviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--
3:44
with enough pressure they get close enough.
3:46
And then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.
3:51
One of these guys degrades into a neutron.
3:56
And the resulting mass of the combined protons
3:59
is lower than the mass of each of the original.
4:01
By a little bit, but that little bit of mass
4:04
results in a lot of energy-- plus energy.
4:11
And this energy is why we call it ignition.
4:13
And so what this energy does is it provides
4:16
a little bit of outward pressure,
4:17
so that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.
4:21
So once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.
4:24
And then that energy provides outward pressure
4:26
to balance what is now a star.
4:30
So now we are at where we actually
4:32
have the ignition at the center.
4:35
We have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying
4:39
to get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.
4:43
Now, what is the hydrogen being fused into?
4:46
Well, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just
4:50

5:08
This does not have two-- it does not have two protons.
5:12
But then the deuterium keeps fusing.
5:14
And then we eventually end up with helium.
5:19
And we can even see that on the periodic table.
5:21
Oh, I lost my periodic table.
5:22
Well, I'll show you the next video.
5:23
But we know hydrogen in its atomic state
5:30
has an atomic number of 1.
5:32
And it also has a mass of 1.
5:34
It only has one nucleon in its nucleus.
5:38
But it's being fused.
5:39
It goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,
5:42
which is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.
5:46
And then that eventually gets fused--
5:48
and I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--
5:50
into helium.
5:51
And by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.
5:56
So it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,
5:58
in particular, that isotope of helium--
6:00
it has an atomic mass of 4.
6:03
And this process releases a ton of energy.
6:06
Because the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced
6:09
is slightly lower than four times the atomic mass
6:15
of each of the constituent hydrogens.
6:17
So all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it
6:21
needs super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--
6:24
keeps the star from collapsing.
6:28
And once a star is in this stage,
6:31
once it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen
6:35
in its core, where the pressure and the temperature
6:37
is the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.
6:41
This is now a main sequence star.
6:48
And that's actually where the sun is right now.
6:50
Now there's questions of, well, what if there just
6:53
wasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?
6:56
And there actually are things that
6:57

7:00
There are a few things that don't quite
7:02
make the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.
7:05
So they are generating some of their heat.
7:06
Or there are even smaller objects
7:08
that just get to the point there's
7:10
a huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually
7:13
occurring inside of the core.
7:15
And something like Jupiter would be an example.
7:17
And you could go several masses above Jupiter
7:20
where you get something like that.
7:21
So you have to reach a certain threshold
7:23
where the mass, where the pressure and the temperature
7:25
due to the heavy mass, get so large that you
7:27
start this fusion.
7:28
And-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,
7:31
the slower the fusion will occur.
7:33
But if you're super massive, the fusion
7:35
will occur really, really fast.
7:37
So that's the general idea of just how stars get formed

They'd slowly move in.
0:39
So if we fast forward, this cloud's
0:42
going to get denser and denser.
0:46
And the hydrogen atoms are going to start
0:48
bumping into each other and rubbing up against each other
0:51
and interacting with each other.
0:53
And so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.
0:56
Now remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.
0:58
So the temperature is going up.
1:03
And it'll-- they'll keep condensing.
1:05
They'll just keep condensing and condensing
1:07
until something really interesting happens.
1:09
So let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here
1:12
in the center.
1:16
And there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.
1:19
It's really dense.
1:20
I could never draw the actual number of atoms here.
1:22
This is really to give you an idea.
1:24
There's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,
1:28
from everything that wants to get
1:29
to that center of mass of our entire cloud.
1:32
The temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.
1:38
And at that point, something neat happens.
1:40
And to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,
1:43
let's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.
1:46
A hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just
1:48
going to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.
1:49
So the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.
1:50
If you want to think about a hydrogen atom,
1:52
it also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.
1:57
And let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.
1:59
And obviously this distance isn't to scale.
2:02
This distance is also not to scale.
2:04
Atoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms
2:05
are actually much, much, much, much smaller
2:07
than the actual radius of an atom.
2:10
And so is the electron.
2:11
But anyway, this just gives you an idea.
2:13
So we know from the Coulomb forces,
2:14
from electromagnetic forces, that these two positively
2:17
charged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere
2:20
near each other.
2:22
But we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four
2:25
forces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,
2:28
that if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures
2:31
and huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close
2:35
enough to each other, then all of a sudden,
2:37
the strong force will overtake.
2:39
It's much stronger than the Coulomb force.
2:41
And then these two hydrogens will actually--
2:43
these nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?
2:48
Well, anyway, they would actually fuse together.
2:50
And so that is what actually happens
2:53
once this gets hot and dense enough.
2:57
You now have enough pressure and enough temperature
2:59
to overcome the Coulomb force and bring
3:02
these protons close enough to each other for fusion
3:05
to occur, for fusion ignition.
3:12
And the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.
3:14
It's not ignition.
3:15
It's not combustion in the traditional sense.
3:16
It's not like you're burning a carbon molecule
3:20
in the presence of oxygen.
3:22
It's not combustion.
3:23
It's ignition.
3:24
And the reason why it's called ignition
3:25
is because when two of these protons,
3:27
or two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus
3:32
has a slightly smaller mass.
3:35
And so in the first stage of this,
3:36
you actually have two protons under enough pressure--
3:42
obviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--
3:44
with enough pressure they get close enough.
3:46
And then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.
3:51
One of these guys degrades into a neutron.
3:56
And the resulting mass of the combined protons
3:59
is lower than the mass of each of the original.
4:01
By a little bit, but that little bit of mass
4:04
results in a lot of energy-- plus energy.
4:11
And this energy is why we call it ignition.
4:13
And so what this energy does is it provides
4:16
a little bit of outward pressure,
4:17
so that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.
4:21
So once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.
4:24
And then that energy provides outward pressure
4:26
to balance what is now a star.
4:30
So now we are at where we actually
4:32
have the ignition at the center.
4:35
We have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying
4:39
to get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.
4:43
Now, what is the hydrogen being fused into?
4:46
Well, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just
4:50
kind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens
4:54
in stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.
5:00
I have trouble spelling.
5:01
Which is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.
5:03
This is still hydrogen because it
5:04
has one proton and one neutron now.
5:07
It is not helium yet.
5:08
This does not have two-- it does not have two protons.
5:12
But then the deuterium keeps fusing.
5:14
And then we eventually end up with helium.
5:19
And we can even see that on the periodic table.
5:21
Oh, I lost my periodic table.
5:22
Well, I'll show you the next video.
5:23
But we know hydrogen in its atomic state
5:30
has an atomic number of 1.
5:32
And it also has a mass of 1.
5:34
It only has one nucleon in its nucleus.
5:38
But it's being fused.
5:39
It goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,
5:42
which is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.
5:46
And then that eventually gets fused--
5:48
and I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--
5:50
into helium.
5:51
And by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.
5:56
So it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,
5:58
in particular, that isotope of helium--
6:00
it has an atomic mass of 4.
6:03
And this process releases a ton of energy.
6:06
Because the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced
6:09
is slightly lower than four times the atomic mass
6:15
of each of the constituent hydrogens.
6:17
So all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it
6:21
needs super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--
6:24
keeps the star from collapsing.
6:28
And once a star is in this stage,
6:31
once it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen
6:35
in its core, where the pressure and the temperature
6:37
is the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.
6:41
This is now a main sequence star.
6:48
And that's actually where the sun is right now.
6:50
Now there's questions of, well, what if there just
6:53
wasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?
6:56
And there actually are things that
6:57
never get to quite that threshold
6:59
to fuse all the way into helium.
7:00
There are a few things that don't quite
7:02
make the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.
7:05
So they are generating some of their heat.
7:06
Or there are even smaller objects
7:08
that just get to the point there's
7:10
a huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually
7:13
occurring inside of the core.
7:15
And something like Jupiter would be an example.
7:17
And you could go several masses above Jupiter
7:20
where you get something like that.
7:21
So you have to reach a certain threshold
7:23
where the mass, where the pressure and the temperature
7:25
due to the heavy mass, get so large that you
7:27
start this fusion.
7:28
And-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,
7:31
the slower the fusion will occur.
7:33
But if you're super massive, the fusion
7:35
will occur really, really fast.
7:37
So that's the general idea of just how stars get formed
7:40
and why they don't collapse on themselves
7:43
and why they are these kind of balls
7:45
of fusion reactions existing in the universe.
7:48
In the next few videos, we'll talk
7:50
about what happens once that hydrogen fuel in the core
7:54
starts to run out.",Why will the Hydrogen atoms be attracted towards the center of mass if they are being attracted by each other's gravitational pull?
khan_video_i-NNWI8Ccas_77,Science,ESSAY,"•
0:00
Let's imagine we have a huge cloud
0:02
of hydrogen atoms floating in space.
0:05
Huge, and when I say huge cloud, huge both in distance
0:08
and in mass.
0:09
If you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,
0:11
it would just be this really, really massive thing.
0:15
So you have this huge cloud.
0:16
Well, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually
0:20
attracted to each other.
0:21
It's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.
0:25
But it would slowly affect these atoms.
0:27
And they would slowly draw close to each other.
0:30
It would slowly condense.
0:31
They'd slowly move towards the center
0:34
of mass of all of the atoms.
0:37
They'd slowly move in.
0:39
So if we fast forward, this cloud's
0:42
going to get denser and denser.
0:46
And the hydrogen atoms are going to start
0:48
bumping into each other and rubbing up against each other
0:51
and interacting with each other.
0:53
And so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.
0:56
Now remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.
0:58
So the temperature is going up.
1:03
And it'll-- they'll keep condensing.
1:05
They'll just keep condensing and condensing
1:07
until something really interesting happens.
1:09
So let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here
1:12
in the center.
1:16
And there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.
1:19
It's really dense.
1:20
I could never draw the actual number of atoms here.
1:22
This is really to give you an idea.
1:24
There's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,
1:28
from everything that wants to get
1:29
to that center of mass of our entire cloud.
1:32
The temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.
1:38
And at that point, something neat happens.
1:40
And to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,
1:43
let's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.
1:46
A hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just
1:48
going to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.
1:49
So the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.
1:50
If you want to think about a hydrogen atom,
1:52
it also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.
1:57
And let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.
1:59
And obviously this distance isn't to scale.
2:02
This distance is also not to scale.
2:04
Atoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms
2:05
are actually much, much, much, much smaller
2:07
than the actual radius of an atom.
2:10
And so is the electron.
2:11
But anyway, this just gives you an idea.
2:13
So we know from the Coulomb forces,
2:14
from electromagnetic forces, that these two positively
2:17
charged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere
2:20
near each other.
2:22
But we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four
2:25
forces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,
2:28
that if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures
2:31
and huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close
2:35
enough to each other, then all of a sudden,
2:37
the strong force will overtake.
2:39
It's much stronger than the Coulomb force.
2:41
And then these two hydrogens will actually--
2:43
these nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?
2:48
Well, anyway, they would actually fuse together.
2:50
And so that is what actually happens
2:53
once this gets hot and dense enough.
2:57
You now have enough pressure and enough temperature
2:59
to overcome the Coulomb force and bring
3:02
these protons close enough to each other for fusion
3:05
to occur, for fusion ignition.
3:12
And the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.
3:14
It's not ignition.
3:15
It's not combustion in the traditional sense.
3:16
It's not like you're burning a carbon molecule
3:20
in the presence of oxygen.
3:22
It's not combustion.
3:23
It's ignition.
3:24
And the reason why it's called ignition
3:25
is because when two of these protons,
3:27
or two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus
3:32
has a slightly smaller mass.
3:35
And so in the first stage of this,
3:36
you actually have two protons under enough pressure--
3:42
obviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--
3:44
with enough pressure they get close enough.
3:46
And then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.
3:51
One of these guys degrades into a neutron.
3:56
And the resulting mass of the combined protons
3:59
is lower than the mass of each of the original.
4:01
By a little bit, but that little bit of mass
4:04
results in a lot of energy-- plus energy.
4:11
And this energy is why we call it ignition.
4:13
And so what this energy does is it provides
4:16
a little bit of outward pressure,
4:17
so that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.
4:21
So once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.
4:24
And then that energy provides outward pressure
4:26
to balance what is now a star.
4:30
So now we are at where we actually
4:32
have the ignition at the center.
4:35
We have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying
4:39
to get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.
4:43
Now, what is the hydrogen being fused into?
4:46
Well, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just
4:50
kind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens
4:54
in stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.
5:00
I have trouble spelling.
5:01
Which is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.
5:03
This is still hydrogen because it
5:04
has one proton and one neutron now.
5:07
It is not helium yet.
5:08
This does not have two-- it does not have two protons.
5:12
But then the deuterium keeps fusing.
5:14
And then we eventually end up with helium.
5:19
And we can even see that on the periodic table.
5:21
Oh, I lost my periodic table.
5:22
Well, I'll show you the next video.
5:23
But we know hydrogen in its atomic state
5:30
has an atomic number of 1.
5:32
And it also has a mass of 1.
5:34
It only has one nucleon in its nucleus.
5:38
But it's being fused.
5:39
It goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,
5:42
which is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.
5:46
And then that eventually gets fused--
5:48
and I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--
5:50
into helium.
5:51
And by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.
5:56
So it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,
5:58
in particular, that isotope of helium--
6:00
it has an atomic mass of 4.
6:03
And this process releases a ton of energy.
6:06
Because the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced
6:09
is slightly lower than four times the atomic mass
6:15
of each of the constituent hydrogens.
6:17
So all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it
6:21
needs super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--
6:24
keeps the star from collapsing.
6:28
And once a star is in this stage,
6:31
once it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen
6:35
in its core, where the pressure and the temperature
6:37
is the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.
6:41
This is now a main sequence star.
6:48
And that's actually where the sun is right now.
6:50
Now there's questions of, well, what if there just
6:53
wasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?
6:56
And there actually are things that
6:57
never get to quite that threshold
6:59
to fuse all the way into helium.
7:00
There are a few things that don't quite
7:02
make the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.
7:05
So they are generating some of their heat.
7:06
Or there are even smaller objects
7:08
that just get to the point there's
7:10
a huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually
7:13
occurring inside of the core.
7:15
And something like Jupiter would be an example.
7:17
And you could go several masses above Jupiter
7:20
where you get something like that.
7:21
So you have to reach a certain threshold
7:23
where the mass, where the pressure and the temperature
7:25
due to the heavy mass, get so large that you
7:27
start this fusion.
7:28
And-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,
7:31
the slower the fusion will occur.
7:33
But if you're super massive, the fusion
7:35
will occur really, really fast.
7:37
So that's the general idea of just how stars get formed
7:40
and why they don't collapse on themselves
7:43
and why they are these kind of balls
7:45
of fusion reactions existing in the universe.
7:48
In the next few videos, we'll talk
7:50
about what happens once that hydrogen fuel in the core
7:54
starts to run out.","I thought that helium and hydrogen where both created once the plasma of the universe cooled
Also, if the sun is just a giant ball of gas, why is it that if you where suddenly going to cool a star, metals would be left behind?"

- Let's delve into the world of mitochondria
0:03
which are probably my favorite organelle.
0:07
So let's just have a little review of what mitochondria are
0:10
and then we can delve a little bit deeper
0:11
into their structure.
0:13
So let's just think about a cell
0:15
and not just any cell, but a eukaryotic cell.
0:18
So that's the cellular membrane
0:20
and when people say a eukaryote or a eukaryotic cell
0:23
they most typically say, ""Oh! That must have its nuclear DNA
0:27
""in a membrane-bound nucleus."" and that would be true,
0:31
so let's draw our membrane-bound nucleus.
0:33
That's our nuclear membrane.
0:35
You have your DNA in here,
0:38
so let's draw some DNA.
0:39
But when we talk about eukaryotic cells,
0:42
we're not just talking about a membrane-bound nucleus,
0:44
we're also talking about other membrane-bound organelles
0:47
and in a close second place for a membrane-bound structure
0:51
that is very important to the cell
0:52
would be the mitochondria.
0:55
So let's draw some mitochondria right over here.
0:58
So I'll talk a little bit more about
1:00
what these little squiggly lines that I'm drawing
1:02
inside of the mitochondria are
1:04
and this is actually a little bit more
1:05
of a textbook visualization, as we'll learn
1:06
in a few minutes or seconds that we now have more
1:09
sophisticated visualizations of what's actually going on
1:12
inside of a mitochondria, but we haven't actually
1:13
answered all of our questions,
1:15
but you might have already learned that,
1:17
so let me make it clear, these are mitochondria.
1:20
That's the plural.
1:21
If we're just talking about one of them,
1:22
we're talking about a mitochondrion.
1:24
That's the singular of mitochondria.
1:26
But you might have already learned,
1:27
some time in your past or in another Khan Academy video,
1:31
that these are viewed as the ATP factories for cells.
1:35
So let me right it this way.
1:38
So ATP factories.
1:40
A-T-P factories and if you watched the videos on ATP
1:45
or cellular respiration or other videos,
1:48
I'd repeatedly talk about how ATP is really the currency
1:51
for energy in the cell that when it's in its ATP form
1:55
you have adenosine triphosphate.
1:57
If you pop one of the phosphate groups off,
2:00
you pop one of the P's off, it release energy
2:02
and that's what your body uses to do all sort of things
2:05
from movement to thinking to all sorts of things
2:08
that actually go on in your bodies,
2:10
so you can imagine mitochondria are really important
2:12
for energy, for when the cell has to do things.
2:16
And that's why you'll find more mitochondria
2:18
in things like muscle cells, things that have to use
2:21
a lot of energy.
2:22
Now before I get into the structure of mitochondria,
2:25
I wanna talk a little bit about its fascinating past
2:28
because we think of cells as the most basic unit of life
2:31
and that is true, that comes straight out of cell theory,
2:33
but it turns out the most prevalent theory
2:36
of how mitochondria got into our cells
2:39
is that at one time the predecessors,
2:43
the ancestors to our mitochondria,
2:45
were free, independent organisms, microorganisms.
2:49
So they're descendent from bacterial-like microorganisms
2:54
that might have been living on their own
2:57
and they were maybe really good at processing energy
2:59
or maybe they were even good at other things,
3:01
but at some point in the evolutionary past,
3:04
they got ingested by what the ancestors of our cells
3:08
and instead of just being engulfed and being torn to shreds
3:10
and kind of being digested and eaten,
3:12
it was like, ""Hey, wait, if these things stick around,
3:15
""those cells are more likely to survive
3:17
""because they're able to help process glucose
3:19
""or help generate more energy out of things.""
3:24
And so the cells that were able to kind of live
3:27
in symbiosis have them kind of give a place
3:30
for the mitochondria to live or the pre-mitochondria,
3:33
the ancestor mitochondria, those survived
3:35
and then through kind of the processes of natural selection,
3:38
this is what we now associate,
3:41
we now associate eukaryotic cells
3:43
as having mitochondria,
3:44
so I find this whole idea of one organism being inside
3:47
of another organism in symbiosis even at the cellular level,
3:52
that's kind of mind-boggling, but anyway,
3:55
I'll stop talking about that and now let's just talk
3:57
about the present, let's talk about
3:59
what the actual structure of mitochondria are.
4:03
And I'll first draw kind of a simplified drawing
4:06
of a mitochondion and I'll draw a cross section.
4:10
So, I'm gonna draw a cross section.
4:13
So if we were to kind of cut it in half.
4:15
So what I've drawn right over here
4:16
this would be its outer membrane.
4:18
This is the outer membrane right over here
4:24
and we label that.
4:25
Outer membrane.
4:28
And all of these membranes that I'm gonna draw,
4:30
they're all going to be phospholipid bilayers.
4:34
So if I were to zoom in right over here,
4:38
so let me, if I were to zoom in,
4:41
we would see a bilayer of phospholipids.
4:44
So you have your
4:47
hydrophilic heads facing outwards,
4:50
hydrophilic heads facing outwards
4:53
and your hydrophobic tails facing inwards.
4:57
So.
5:00
You see something just like that,
5:02
so they're all phospholipid bilayers.
5:05
But they aren't just phospholipids.
5:07
All of these membranes have all sorts of proteins imbedded,
5:10
I mean cells are incredibly complex structures,
5:13
but even organelles like mitochondria have a fascinating,
5:16
I guess you would say sub-structure to them.
5:18
They themselves have all sorts of interesting proteins,
5:21
enzymes imbedded in their membranes
5:23
and are able to help regulate what's going on
5:25
inside and outside of these organelles.
5:28
And one of the proteins that you have in the outer membrane
5:34
of mitochondria, they're called porins
5:38
and porins aren't found only in mitochondria,
5:40
but they're kind of tunnel proteins,
5:41
they're structured so they kind of form a hole
5:44
in the outer membrane.
5:46
So I'm drawing them the best that I can.
5:49
These are porins
5:51
and what's interesting about porins is they don't allow
5:54
large molecules to pass through passively,
5:57
but small molecules like sugars or ions can pass passively
6:02
through the porins.
6:04
And so, because of that, your ion concentration
6:06
and well, I should actually say,
6:07
your small molecule concentrations tend
6:09
to be similar on either side of this membrane,
6:12
on either side of this outer membrane.
6:15
But that's not the only membrane involved
6:17
in a mitochondrion.
6:18
We also have a inner membrane.
6:20
I'll do that in yellow.
6:22
We also have a inner membrane
6:24
and I'm gonna draw it with a textbook model first
6:27
and then we'll talk a little bit about,
6:28
since we think this model is not quite right,
6:32
but in this, so we have this inner membrane,
6:36
inner membrane,
6:41
and this inner membrane has these folds in it
6:45
to increase their surface area
6:46
and the surface area is really important
6:48
for the inner membrane because that's
6:50
where the processes of the electron transport chain
6:53
occur across, essentially, these membranes.
6:55
So you want this extra surface area
6:57
so you can essentially have more of that going on.
7:00
And these folds have a name.
7:02
So if you're talking about one of them,
7:04
if you're talking about one of these folds,
7:05
you're talking about a crista,
7:10
but if you're talking about more than one of them,
7:14
you would call that a cristae, cristae.
7:18
Sometimes I've seen the pronunciation of this
7:20
as cristae, cristae or cristae, that's plural for crista.
7:24
These are just folds in the inner membrane
7:27
and once again the inner membrane is also
7:30
a phospholipid bilayer.
7:33
Now inside of the inner membranes,
7:36
so between the outer membrane and the inner membrane
7:40
you could imagine what this is gonna be called.
7:42
That space is called the intermembrane space,
7:46
not too creative of a name, intermembrane space
7:51
and because of the porins,
7:53
the small molecule concentration
7:56
of the intermembrane space and then outside
7:58
of the mitochondria,
8:02
out in the cytosol,
8:03
those concentrations are gonna be similar,
8:05
but then the inner membrane does not have the porins
8:08
in it and so you can actually have a different concentration
8:11
on either side and that is essential
8:12
for the electron transport chain.
8:14
The electron transport chain really culminates
8:16
with hydrogen, a hydrogen ion gradient
8:19
being built between the two sides
8:20
and then they flow down that gradient through a protein
8:24
called ATP synthase which helps us synthesize ATP,
8:28
but we'll talk more about that maybe in this video
8:29
or in a future video,
8:31
but let's finish talking about the different parts
8:33
of a mitochondrion.
8:36
So inside the inner membrane you have
8:40
this area right over here is called the matrix.
8:42
It's called, let me use this in a different color,
8:45
this is
8:48
the matrix
8:49
and it's called the matrix 'cause it actually has
8:50
a much higher protein concentration,
8:53
it's actually more viscous than the cytosol
8:58
that would be outside of the
9:03
mitochondria.
9:05
So this right over here is the matrix.
9:07
When we we talk about cellular respiration,
9:09
cellular respiration has many phases in it.
9:11
We talk about glycolysis.
9:13
Glycolysis is actually occurring in the cytosol.
9:15
So glycolysis can occur in the cytosol.
9:20
Glycolysis.
9:22
But the other major phases of cellular respiration.
9:26
Remember we talk about the citric acid cycle
9:28
also known as the Krebs cycle,
9:29
that is occuring in the matrix.
9:32
So Krebs cycle
9:35
is occuring in the matrix
9:37
and then I said the electron transport chain
9:40
which is really what's responsible for producing
9:42
the bulk of the ATP, that is happening through proteins
9:46
that are straddling the inner membrane
9:49
or straddling the cristae right over here.
9:55
Now we're just done.
9:56
Probably one of the most fascinating parts of mitochondria,
9:59
we said that we think that they are descendent
10:01
from these ancient independent lifeforms
10:04
and in order to be an ancient independent life form,
10:06
they'd would have to have some information,
10:09
some way to actually transmit their genetic information
10:13
and, it turns out, mitochondria actually have
10:16
their own genetic information.
10:18
They have mitochondrial DNA
10:19
and they often don't just even have one copy of it,
10:21
they have multiple copies of it
10:23
and they're in loops very similar to bacterial DNA.
10:28
In fact, they have a lot in common
10:29
with bacterial DNA and that's why we think
10:30
that the ancestor to mitochondria that live independently
10:34
was probably a form of bacteria or related to bacteria
10:38
in some way.
10:39
So this is, this right over there,
10:41
that is the loop of mitochondrial DNA.
10:43
So all the DNA that's inside of you, the bulk of it,
10:46
yes, it is in your nuclear DNA, but you still have
10:50
a little bit of DNA in your mitochondria
10:52
and what's interesting is your mitochondrial DNA,
10:55
your mitochondria, are inherited, essentially,
10:59
from your mother's side, because when a egg is fertilized,
11:05
a human egg has tons of mitochondria in it
11:09
and I'm obviously not drawing all of the things
11:11
in the human egg.
11:12
It obviously has a nucleus and all of that.
11:14
The sperm has some mitochondria in it,
11:17
you could imagine it needs to be able
11:20
to win that very competitive fight
11:22
to get to fertilize the egg,
11:24
but the current theory is all or most of that
11:26
gets digested or dissolved once it actually gets
11:30
into the egg.
11:31
And anyway, the egg itself has way more mitochondria,
11:34
so the DNA in your mitochondria is
11:38
from your mother or is essentially from your mother's side
11:42
and that's actually used, mitochondrial DNA,
11:43
when people talk about kind of an ancient Eve
11:45
or tracing back to having kind
11:47
of one common mother,
11:48
people are looking at the mitochondrial DNA,
11:52
so it is actually quite, quite fascinating.
11:56
Now I said a little bit earlier,
11:58
and you know, obviously, it has its own DNA
12:00
and then because it has its own DNA
12:02
it's able to synthesize some of its own RNA,
12:04
its own ribosomes, so it also has ribosomes here.
12:07
But it doesn't synthesize all of the proteins
12:10
that are sitting in mitochondria.
12:11
A lot of those are still synthesized by
12:14
or encoded for by your nuclear DNA
12:17
and are actually synthesized outside of the mitochondria
12:19
and then make their way into the mitochondria,
12:22
but mitochondria are these fascinating, fascinating things.
12:25
They're these little creatures living in symbiosis
12:29
in our cells and they're able to replicate themselves
12:32
and I don't know, I find all of this mind boggling.
12:34
But anyway.
12:35
I said that this was the textbook model
12:37
because it turns out, when you look
12:39
at a micrograph, a picture of mitochondria,
12:43
it seems to back up this textbook model
12:45
of these folds, these cristae just kind of folding in,
12:49
but when we've been able to have more sophisticated
12:51
visualizations it actually turns out
12:53
that it's not just these simple folds
12:55
that the inner membrane essentially hooks
12:59
into the matrix and it turns out it has
13:02
these little tunnels that connect the space
13:05
inside of the cristae to the intermembrane space.
13:10
So I like to think about this because it makes you realize,
13:12
you know, we look in textbooks and we take these things
13:14
like mitochondria for granted, like, ""Oh yeah, of course.
13:17
""That's where ATP factories are,""
13:18
but it's still an area for visualization research
13:21
to fully understand exactly how they work
13:24
and even how they are structured
13:25
that this Baffle Model where you see these cristae
13:28
kind of just coming in and out of the different sides.
13:31
This is actually no longer the accepted model
13:33
for the actual visualization, the structure of mitochondria.
13:36
Something more like this, something more where
13:39
you have this cristae junction model
13:42
where you have, if I were to draw a cross section
13:46
where this is the,
13:50
I drew the outer membrane and the inner membrane,
13:52
I'll just draw has these little tunnels
13:54
to the actual space inside of the cristae.
13:59
This is actually now the more accepted visualization,
14:03
so I want you to appreciate
14:04
that when in Biology, you read something in a textbook
14:06
you kind of say, ""Oh, people have figured all
14:08
""of this stuff out,"" but people are still think about,
14:10
""Well, how does this structure work?
14:11
""What is the actual structure?"" and then,
14:12
""How does it actually let this organelle,
14:14
""this fascinating organelle do all of the things
14:16
""that it needs to do?""",Why phospholipids are facing outward by their hydrophilic instead of hydrophobic parts?

- [Voiceover] In the last videos, we constructed
0:01
a little bit of a conundrum for us.
0:03
We had the situation where I'm drifting through space,
0:07
and right at time equal zero,
0:09
one of my friends, she passes me by
0:13
in a spaceship going half the speed of light
0:15
in the positive x direction, relative to me.
0:18
And at time equal zero,
0:20
is exactly where she is at my position.
0:23
And then she keeps traveling, and so I draw
0:26
the path that she is taking.
0:28
So after one second, she would be here,
0:30
after two seconds, she would be there,
0:32
and we set up our scales
0:33
so that on our time axis,
0:36
one second is the same length
0:39
as on our space axis, or on our path axis,
0:42
three times ten to the eighth meters.
0:44
And we did that so that at least in my frame of reference,
0:47
the speed of light would be at a 45 degree angle,
0:50
or would have a slope of one.
0:52
But the conundrum we hit was
0:54
is that the speed of light would be perceived,
0:56
based on this model I set up,
0:57
would be perceived differently
0:59
based on which frame of reference you're in.
1:01
The photon that I emit from my flashlight,
1:04
right at time equals zero,
1:05
well sure I'm going to see that as moving
1:08
at the speed of light in the positive x direction.
1:10
But my friend, since she's already moving
1:13
in that positive x direction at half of the speed of light,
1:16
if we assumed a Newtonian world,
1:18
she would see that photon going at half the speed of light.
1:21
And likewise, if she emitted a photon from her flashlight,
1:26
to her, it would look like it's going at the speed of light,
1:28
but to me, it would look like it's going faster
1:31
than the speed of light.
1:33
And the reason why that is a conundrum
1:35
is we know from observation of the universe around us,
1:39
and this is profound, this is a little mind-blowing,
1:41
this is counterintuitive to our everyday experience,
1:44
but we know from observation
1:46
that the speed of light is absolute,
1:49
that it doesn't matter your inertial frame of reference.
1:52
As long as you're in an inertial frame of reference,
1:54
it doesn't matter your relative velocity
1:56
relative to another inertial frame of reference.
1:59
You will always measure the speed of light
2:01
at three times ten to the eighth meters per second.
2:04
But that's at a direct contradiction
2:06
with what our model just set up.
2:08
So it really forces us to question all of our assumptions.
2:12
So what are the assumptions that we made
2:14
in this Newtonian world?
2:15
Well, we assumed that time is absolute.
2:19
Time is absolute.
2:21
And what do I mean by that?
2:22
Well, we assumed that one second passing for me
2:25
is going to be one second passing for my friend.
2:28
That's just our everyday notion.
2:30
If I'm in a car and you're not in a car,
2:33
and we both have watches, and we synchronize our watches,
2:35
they seem to say synchronized.
2:38
But maybe we need to loosen this assumption.
2:42
We also assumed that space is absolute.
2:45
Space is absolute.
2:49
And what do I mean by that?
2:50
Well in our everyday experience,
2:52
regardless of what our relative frames of reference are,
2:55
we seem to agree that, well if that meter stick over there,
2:59
that's riding on that train,
3:01
that is a meter stick, whether I'm sitting on the train
3:03
or whether I'm not.
3:04
But maybe things start to break down a little bit
3:07
as we think about higher velocities.
3:11
And maybe they break down even at the slower velocities,
3:13
but we just don't notice them
3:14
because it's a very small error.
3:15
And maybe there's something even more interesting.
3:18
In our everyday experience,
3:19
we just assume that time is somehow
3:23
something very different than space,
3:26
that you can move in the time direction
3:28
without moving in the space direction,
3:30
or you can move in the space direction
3:32
without moving in the time direction,
3:33
and that they're independent regardless
3:35
of which inertial frame of reference you're in.
3:38
But maybe they aren't separate things.
3:40
In fact, maybe they're all one continuum of spacetime,
3:45
and I don't mean space dash time,
3:47
I mean spacetime.
3:48
I mean the word spacetime,
3:53
where space and time really aren't different things.
3:54
It's just one continuum, spacetime.
3:57
And I keep saying it fast like that,
3:59
because it's not space dash time,
4:03
like thinking about the different dimensions,
4:05
or thinking about two different things.
4:07
We're renaming one thing called spacetime.
4:11
So these are the things that we're going to start
4:13
to hold into question.
4:14
So what if we loosen these, and we assume the thing
4:18
that we have observed in the universe,
4:20
that the speed of light is absolute,
4:22
regardless of your inertial frame of reference.
4:26
So let's word from there, do a little thought experiment,
4:28
and then think about what type of a model we can construct,
4:31
in which case the speed of light is absolute.
4:35
And to do that, we're still going to use
4:36
our little model here,
4:38
and we're going to focus on my friend's frame of reference,
4:41
my friend who's on a spaceship,
4:42
who right at time equal zero, is passing me by
4:45
at half the speed of light.
4:47
And we assumed that she's in this train of spaceships.
4:50
So we assumed already that she's,
4:52
there are these spaceships that are all moving
4:54
at half the speed of light in the positive x direction,
4:56
relative to me,
4:57
and they're all three times ten to the eighth meters apart.
5:01
So they're like that.
5:02
So let's say, and I did these axes in blue,
5:05
because we're assuming this is my friend's
5:07
frame of reference, so you could say
5:08
this is the S prime frame of reference,
5:10
this is Sally's frame of reference
5:12
from a couple of videos ago.
5:14
Let's say a second before she gets to me,
5:16
and I'm also assuming, the way I've drawn these axes,
5:18
and we're going to modify them in the future
5:20
where we're actually going to use the same units
5:22
for space and time.
5:22
Right now, I'm still sticking to what we've classically done
5:25
where we use seconds for time
5:26
and meters for our path or our space,
5:29
but in the future, we'll actually use meters for both.
5:31
But we'll get to that, I don't want to do
5:33
too many things at once.
5:34
But the way I've drawn it
5:37
along my space axis,
5:39
three times ten to the eighth meters
5:41
is going to be the exact same length as one second,
5:44
and I'm doing that so that the path of light
5:47
on my diagram
5:49
can be a 45 degree angle.
5:51
So this is three times ten to the eighth meters
5:55
right over there.
5:56
So let's say a second before Sally gets to me,
5:59
she releases a photon from her spaceship
6:03
in the direction of the spaceship that is in front of her.
6:06
How far is it in front of her?
6:07
It's three times ten to the eighth meters in front of her.
6:10
And let's say on the back of that spaceship,
6:12
there is a mirror.
6:14
So she's pointing her flashlight at that mirror.
6:17
So what's going to happen from her frame of reference
6:19
after one second?
6:21
So for one second, from her frame of reference,
6:23
she is stationary, so this is Sally still here.
6:26
She is going to be still at x prime equals zero
6:30
in her frame of reference,
6:31
and that ship is still going to be
6:34
three times ten to the eighth meters in front of her.
6:36
They're all moving, relative to me, at the same velocity,
6:39
but relative to each other, they seem to be stationary.
6:41
And so what would be the path of that photon?
6:43
Well that photon will have gone from Sally's flashlight
6:47
from her headlamp, or whatever it is,
6:49
to that spaceship in front of her
6:50
would've just reached that mirror
6:52
on the back of that spaceship.
6:54
And so we can draw the path of light.
6:56
It will be, so let me,
6:59
so that path of light
7:01
will look like that on this diagram.
7:05
And then right at this moment,
7:07
right at t prime equals zero seconds,
7:10
the photon will be reflected back to Sally.
7:13
Well how long will it take to get back to Sally?
7:16
Well Sally's gonna receive the reflection of that photon
7:19
after one second, because that's how long
7:20
it's going to take it to go
7:21
three times ten to the eighth meters.
7:23
So the path of that very first photon,
7:26
the path of that very first photon
7:28
is going to look like that.
7:31
All right, well hopefully this is pretty
7:33
straightforward here.
7:35
This is what would happen from Sally's frame of reference.
7:37
A second before she reaches me,
7:39
at t prime equals negative one seconds,
7:43
emits a photon at t equals zero seconds,
7:45
and gets to the spaceship
7:47
that's three times ten to the eighth meters in front of her,
7:50
essentially one light-second in front of her,
7:53
and then a second later,
7:54
it's reflecting back, a second later,
7:56
she gets the reflection.
7:58
And so that's what this diagram is describing.
8:01
But now let's draw it projected on top
8:03
of my frame of reference.
8:05
And this is when things are going to get
8:06
really, really, really, really interesting.
8:09
So I've drawn my frame of reference here,
8:10
and I've intentionally not marked off the seconds
8:13
or the meters on my frame of reference,
8:14
because once again, I'm not going to assume
8:16
that a second in my frame of reference
8:18
is a second in hers, or a meter in my frame of reference
8:20
is a meter in hers.
8:22
I have drawn her t prime axis at the same angle
8:25
as I did before,
8:27
because for every second
8:31
we move into the future,
8:34
she's going to move half a light-second in distance,
8:37
in the positive x direction.
8:39
So this slope right here, one way to think about it,
8:41
the way I've drawn it,
8:42
this is a slope of two.
8:47
For every unit she moves in the x direction,
8:50
she will move two in the time direction.
8:54
And what we're going to do again
8:55
is assume that on her axis,
8:58
I haven't drawn the x prime axis.
8:59
In fact, this is an exercise to think about
9:00
where should the x prime axis be.
9:03
Should it be coincident with the x axis
9:04
like we assumed before?
9:05
Or is it going to be in a different place?
9:07
But we're going to assume that the lengths I draw
9:10
for one second on, let's say,
9:12
in the S prime frame of reference,
9:15
is going to be the same as the length I would draw
9:17
for three times ten to the eighth meters.
9:20
And we're also going to assume
9:21
that the speed of light is absolute,
9:22
so it's always going to moving at a 45 degree angle
9:25
with respect to either frame of reference.
9:29
So that's where things are going to get a little bit whacky,
9:31
but let's see what's going to happen.
9:32
So at negative one seconds,
9:35
we still have Sally turning on her flashlight.
9:38
She wants to bounce it off of the spaceship in front of her.
9:41
And so that photon's going to move with the speed of light
9:44
in either frame of reference.
9:46
And so let me draw that.
9:48
Let me draw that,
9:49
so it's going to look like this.
9:53
I'm drawing at a 45 degree angle.
9:55
So actually, I don't know where it gets reflected.
9:57
It's gonna get reflected where it hits that x prime axis,
9:59
but I don't know where that is.
10:01
But we do know that it then gets reflected,
10:03
and then it gets back to Sally at one second in the future.
10:06
So the return path of that photon
10:09
is going to look something
10:11
is going to look something like this.
10:13
And that point that it changes direction,
10:14
I could have,
10:16
let me,
10:16
I could have done it like this,
10:18
whoops,
10:19
I could've done it like this.
10:20
But the interesting point is where it changes direction
10:22
because that's where that spaceship in front of her
10:25
must be at that point in spacetime.
10:28
Because now we're going to start thinking of mixing up
10:30
space and time,
10:31
but I'm not going to get too much involved in that.
10:33
Now why is this interesting?
10:35
Because from Sally's point of view,
10:38
from Sally's point of view,
10:39
this point here where the light changes direction,
10:44
from Sally's frame of reference,
10:45
is happening simultaneously with when she reaches me.
10:50
This is happening at t prime
10:52
is equal to zero for Sally.
10:55
So anything that is t prime is equal to zero for Sally
10:59
must be on the x prime axis.
11:02
So this must sit on the x prime axis.
11:05
Once again, why do I know that?
11:06
Because everything on the x prime axis,
11:08
any event on the x prime axis,
11:11
let me do it in a different color,
11:13
I keep doing black.
11:15
Any event on the x prime axis
11:18
is going to be at t prime is equal to zero seconds,
11:22
and from Sally's frame of reference
11:24
is going to be simultaneous with when she passes me up.
11:27
So based on that, we know that this is going to be,
11:32
we know that this point,
11:34
which is where Sally is,
11:36
that's going to be the origin from her frame of reference.
11:38
And we know that this point sits on the x prime axis,
11:43
so based on that, we can draw the x prime axis.
11:45
You just need two points to define a line,
11:47
and so let me try to do it.
11:50
So let me try to draw.
11:52
I can do a better job than that.
11:54
Let me try to draw
11:55
the x prime axis.
11:57
It's going to look like,
12:00
it's going to look like this.
12:02
That right over there is the x prime axis.
12:04
Now at this point, you should find this mildly mind-blowing.
12:07
Actually, even more than mildly mind-blowing.
12:10
'Cause it's saying some pretty, pretty crazy things.
12:12
First of all, let's just make sure we know how to read this.
12:15
So for any event,
12:17
and now we're going to start thinking
12:18
in terms of spacetime,
12:20
although I'm still using different units for space and time,
12:23
but we'll address that in the future.
12:25
If I want to read its coordinates in my frame of reference,
12:27
well if I want to read its x coordinate,
12:29
I go parallel to the t axis,
12:31
and if I wanna read its t coordinate,
12:33
I go parallel to the x axis.
12:35
But for Sally's frame of reference,
12:36
well I essentially do the same thing.
12:38
If I want its x prime coordinates,
12:40
I go parallel to the t prime axis,
12:43
and if I want the t prime coordinates,
12:46
I go parallel to the x prime axis.
12:49
But what's really interesting,
12:51
and I'll go even deeper into this into the next videos,
12:55
that moment,
12:56
that moment right over here,
12:58
that from Sally's frame of reference,
13:01
it looks like it's simultaneous with her passing me up.
13:04
It looks like it's happening at t prime equals zero.
13:07
In fact, it is happening at t prime equals zero.
13:08
From her frame of reference,
13:09
it's happening at t prime equals zero.
13:12
From our frame of reference,
13:14
it is happening after Sally passes us up.
13:17
Notice, it is happening at t equals some positive value.
13:20
It's not happening at t equals zero.
13:23
So this is starting to get a little bit whacky.
13:25
One second, and simultaneous, time, and space,
13:30
and things being simultaneous,
13:33
we're not going to agree on those,
13:35
depending on which frame of reference we're in.
13:37
The thing we will agree on is the speed of light.","I know this might be off topic a little but what if light, instead of spreading on the three-dimensional space part of spacetime spread on the known dimension of time?"

I want to figure out how blood gets from my heart, which
0:05
I'm going to draw here, all the way to my toe.
0:08
And I'm going to draw my foot over here and show you
0:11
which toe I'm talking about.
0:13
Let's say this toe right here.
0:16
Now, to start the journey, it's going
0:19
to have to go out of the left ventricle
0:20
and into the largest artery of the body.
0:24
This is going to be the aorta.
0:25
And the aorta is very, very wide across.
0:29
And that's why I say it's a large artery.
0:31
And from the aorta-- I'm actually
0:34
not drawing all the branches of the aorta.
0:35
But from the aorta, it's going to go down into my belly.
0:39
And it's going to branch towards my left leg and my right leg.
0:45
So let's say we follow just the left leg.
0:48
So this artery over here on the top,
0:50
it's going to get a little bit smaller.
0:52
And maybe I'd call this a medium-sized artery
0:55
by this point.
0:56
This is actually now getting down towards my ankle.
1:00
Let's say we've gone quite a distance down in my ankle.
1:04
And then there are, of course, little branches.
1:06
And let's just follow the branch that
1:08
goes towards my foot, which is this top one.
1:10
Let's say this one goes towards my foot,
1:12
and this is going to be now an even smaller artery.
1:15
Let's call it small artery.
1:20
From there, we're actually going to get
1:23
into what we call arterioles, so it's going to get even tinier.
1:27
It's going to branch.
1:28
Now, these are very, very tiny branches
1:31
coming off my small artery.
1:33
And let's follow this one right here,
1:34
and this one is my arteriole.
1:38
So these are all the different branches I have to go through.
1:42
And finally, I'm going to get into tiny little branches.
1:46
I'm going to have to draw them very, very skinny
1:48
just to convince you that we're getting smaller and smaller.
1:51
Let me draw three of them.
1:53
No.
1:53
Let's draw four just for fun.
1:57
And this is actually going to now get
1:59
towards my little toe cells.
2:01
So let me draw some toes cells in here
2:03
to convince you that I actually have gotten there.
2:05
Let's say one, two over here, and maybe one over here.
2:09
These are my toes cells.
2:12
And after the toe cells have kind of
2:14
taken out whatever they need-- maybe they need glucose
2:17
or maybe they need some oxygen.
2:19
Whatever they've taken out, they're
2:22
also going to put in their waste.
2:24
So they have, of course, some carbon dioxide
2:25
waste that we need to drag back.
2:29
This is now going to dump into what we call a venule.
2:34
And this venule is going to basically then feed
2:37
into many, many other venules.
2:38
Maybe there's a venule down here coming in,
2:41
and maybe a venule up here coming in maybe
2:43
from the second toe.
2:45
And it's going to basically all kind of gather
2:47
together, and again, to a giant, giant set of veins.
2:50
Maybe veins are dumping in here now, maybe another vein
2:53
dumping in here.
2:55
And these veins are all going to dump into an enormous vein
2:58
that we call the inferior vena cava.
3:01
I'll write that right here, inferior vena cava.
3:06
And this is the large vein that brings back all the blood
3:10
from the bottom half of the body.
3:12
There's also another one over here called the superior vena
3:15
cava, and this is bringing back blood from the arms and head.
3:20
So these two veins, the superior vena cava and the inferior vena
3:23
cava, are dragging the blood back to the heart.
3:26
And generally speaking, these are all
3:28
considered, of course, veins.
3:30
Let's back up now and start with the large and medium arteries.
3:33
These guys together are sometimes
3:36
referred to as elastic arteries.
3:40
And the reason they're called elastic arteries, one
3:43
of the good reasons why they're called
3:45
that is that they have a protein in the walls of the blood
3:48
vessel called elastin.
3:49
They have a lot of this elastin protein.
3:53
And if you think about the word elastin or elastic-- obviously
3:57
very similar words-- you might think of something
4:00
like a rubber band or a balloon.
4:02
And that's probably the easiest way to think about it.
4:04
If you have a blood vessel, one of these large arteries,
4:07
for example, and let's say blood is under a lot of pressure
4:12
because the heart is squeezing out a lot of high pressure
4:16
blood, this artery is literally going to balloon out.
4:19
And if you actually looked at it from the outside,
4:22
it would look like a little sausage, something
4:24
like this where it's puffed out.
4:26
So what's happened there between the first and second picture
4:31
is that the pressure energy-- so the heart
4:34
is squeezing out a lot of pressurized blood.
4:36
And, of course, there's energy in that blood.
4:39
That pressure energy has been converted over
4:42
into elastic energy.
4:44
It's actually converting energy.
4:46
We don't really always think about it that way,
4:47
but that's exactly what's happening.
4:49
And when you convert from pressure energy
4:51
to elastic energy, what you're really then doing
4:54
is you're balancing out those high pressures.
4:57
So you're balancing out high pressures.
5:02
And this is actually very important,
5:03
because the blood that's coming into our arteries
5:07
is under, let's not forget, high pressure.
5:10
So the arterial system we know is a high-pressure system.
5:14
So this makes perfect sense that the first few arteries,
5:17
those large arteries and even those medium-sized arteries,
5:21
are going to be able to deal with the pressure really well.
5:23
Now, let me draw a little line here just to keep it straight.
5:26
The small artery and the arteriole,
5:29
these two are actually sometimes called the muscular arteries.
5:35
And the reason, again, if you just
5:37
want to look at the wall of the artery, you'll get the answer.
5:42
The wall of the artery is actually very muscular.
5:45
In fact, specifically, it's smooth muscle.
5:48
So not the kind of muscle you have in your heart
5:50
or in your biceps, but this is smooth muscle
5:54
that's in the wall of the artery.
5:56
And there's lots of it.
5:57
So again, if you have a little blood vessel like this,
6:00
if you imagine tons and tons of smooth muscle on the outside--
6:03
so let's draw it like this, little bands of smooth muscle.
6:07
If those bands decide that they want to contract down,
6:10
that they want to squeeze down, you're
6:11
going to get something that looks like a little straw,
6:14
because those muscles are now tight.
6:16
They're tightly wound, so you're going
6:19
to create like a little straw.
6:20
And this process is called vasoconstriction.
6:24
Vaso just means blood vessel.
6:25
And constriction is kind of tightening down.
6:29
So vasoconstriction, tightening down of the blood vessel.
6:32
And what that does is it increases resistance.
6:36
Just like if you're trying to blow
6:37
through a tiny, tiny little straw,
6:40
there's a lot of resistance.
6:41
Well, it's the same idea here.
6:43
And actually, a lot of that resistance and change
6:46
in the vasoconstriction is happening
6:49
at the arteriole level.
6:51
So that's why they're very special
6:52
and I want you to remember them.
6:54
From there, blood is going to go through the capillaries.
6:56
I didn't actually label them the first time,
6:57
but let me just write that here.
6:59
Some, as they call them, capillary beds.
7:02
I'll write that out.
7:03
And then it's going to go and get collected in the venules
7:06
and eventually into the veins.
7:07
And the important thing about the veins--
7:09
I'm going to stop right here and just
7:11
talk about it very briefly-- is that they
7:13
have these little valves.
7:14
And these valves make sure that the blood continues
7:16
to flow in one direction.
7:19
So one important thing here is the valves.
7:22
And remember, the other important thing
7:24
is that they are able to deal with large volumes.
7:27
So unlike the arterial side where
7:29
it was all about large pressure, down here with the vein side,
7:33
we have to think about large volumes.
7:34
Remember about 2/3 of your blood at any point in time
7:38
is sitting in some vein or venule somewhere.","Are capillaries any blood vessel that is small, and contains blood right next to the individual cells, or are capillaries only vessels that deliver blood to the cells?"
khan_video_j_kSmmEpvQk_22390,Science,ESSAY,"•
0:00
In the very first immunology video, where we talked about
0:02
nonspecific defense mechanisms, we said if we had
0:05
some type of a pathogen-- let's say it's a bacteria--
0:09
that our phagocytes can recognize either proteins on
0:14
the bacteria or maybe it was some other type of pathogen--
0:16
some other marker on the pathogen.
0:18
It doesn't know what type of pathogen it is, but that's
0:20
enough for the phagocyte.
0:23
It'll engulf the pathogen.
0:25
So let's say this is the phagocyte.
0:28
Somehow one of their receptors touches one of the proteins
0:32
that's on the surface of this bacteria in this case and
0:36
says, gee, that's not a good thing to have around and so
0:38
it'll engulf it.
0:39
So the membrane is just going to surround the pathogen-- and
0:44
this part is going to go in.
0:46
It's going to kind of pinch in and the pathogen is going to
0:48
get surrounded and get engulfed--
0:50
phagocytozed by the phagocyte.
0:53
So the end product-- we saw this on the first video where
0:56
I talked about phagocytes-- is we're going to end up-- so
1:00
then the membrane's going to be completely around.
1:02
This is going to pinch in and bubble around this thing and
1:05
so we're going to have the pathogen sitting
1:08
inside of the phagocyte.
1:11
It's going to be surrounded by a membrane.
1:13
That membrane's called a phagosome.
1:16
And we learned there's different types of
1:17
phagocytes-- could be a macrophage, could be a
1:22
neutrophil, could be a dendritic cell-- and we have
1:28
it like this and then we also saw in that video, it's not
1:30
just done-- the macrophage doesn't
1:32
just digest this thing.
1:34
That by itself is very useful.
1:35
It got this bacteria out of the way.
1:38
If this was a virus, it got that virus out of the way.
1:40
But it does even more than that.
1:42
It takes that and then it lyses it-- or it breaks it up.
1:45
It doesn't have to actually use-- well, it breaks it up.
1:50
There's several ways it can do it, but the bottom line is, it
1:53
processes it.
1:58
It'll break up the pathogen-- and we saw that first video on
2:01
phagocytes that we'll actually have a lysosome bond to it and
2:05
dump all sorts of particles that are going to break up and
2:08
cut up this bacteria, in this case, into
2:10
its constituent molecules.
2:18
And then some subset of the leftovers, particular chains
2:24
of the peptides-- and remember, proteins are long
2:27
chains of amino acids.
2:28
Polypeptides are short chains.
2:30
So you take short chains of those and they're going to
2:32
bond to special proteins.
2:37
And this is essentially the topic of this video.
2:39
So let's say they bond to that special protein, bond to that
2:42
special protein.
2:43
And then those proteins get transported or get to the
2:47
membrane or the outer surface of the cell and they present
2:49
themselves along with the piece of the pathogen.
2:53
So the end product after phagocytozed this pathogen is
2:57
that the phagocyte will look something like this and it
3:01
will have these antigen presenting proteins, I guess
3:08
we can call them, that had bound to parts of that
3:11
original pathogen.
3:13
Let me do it right here.
3:16
So it has a little bit of the original pathogen on it that I
3:20
drew in green right here.
3:23
And these proteins right here, these are called-- it's a
3:26
fancy word and I talked about it in the previous video--
3:29
these are called major histocompatibility complexes,
3:47
or MHC for short.
3:53
And when we're talking about phagocytes or macrophages or
3:58
dendritic cells that are particular cases of
4:00
phagocytes, the major histocompatibility complexes
4:03
that they present after they've digested this
4:05
molecule-- this is an MHC class II.
4:09
Let me write this down.
4:11
This is an MHC class II protein.
4:16
It might seem like I'm really going into the minutiae of
4:18
what these proteins are, but we're going to see this is key
4:21
for activating other parts of the immune system, especially
4:25
the cell mediated parts of the immune system.
4:27
So this was the case with a macrophage or a dendrite.
4:30
They engulf something, they chew it all up, and then parts
4:34
of the chewed up thing that they ate, they attach to these
4:36
MHC II proteins and these MHC proteins go to the
4:41
surface of the cell.
4:42
The same thing-- or actually not the quite the same thing--
4:45
a very similar thing happens with B cells.
4:49
So if we have a B cell-- that's a good color.
4:52
B for blue.
4:53
We know B stands for bursa, but it could stand for bone
4:57
marrow just as well.
4:58
Let's say we have a B cell and it's got its membrane bound
5:02
antibody on it.
5:03
Remember, it's very specific to that B cells.
5:07
So all of the membrane bound antibodies, all 10,000 or so
5:10
of them on this B cell, they all expressed the same
5:14
variable part.
5:16
So this is a particular B cell.
5:18
So remember, this was nonspecific.
5:20
When we talked about phagocytosis, these guys just
5:23
say, you're a bacteria.
5:24
You're a virus.
5:24
I don't know what kind you are.
5:25
I'm just going to eat you up.
5:26
You look shady.
5:27
I'm going to eat you up.
5:28
I don't know what type you are or whether
5:29
I've seen you before.
5:30
When we're talking about B cells, we're talking about the
5:32
adaptive or the specific immune system.
5:35
And so these-- the variable ends of these membrane bound
5:39
antibodies are specific to certain parts of certain
5:43
pathogens, to certain epitopes.
5:45
Remember, epitopes were the parts of certain pathogens
5:49
that these specific chains can recognize and bond to.
5:53
So let's say that we're dealing with a
5:55
virus in this situation.
5:57
And let's say the virus just happens to
5:59
bond to this B cell.
6:01
Remember, there might be other-- in fact, there
6:02
definitely are tons of other B cells around, but their
6:08
variable portions are all different.
6:17
And that's what I always find amazing about B cells is that
6:19
they come from the same genetic line, their genes have
6:23
been shuffled around in their development so that they can
6:26
produce billions of combinations of these
6:29
proteins, or the variable ends of their antibodies.
6:34
So let's say we have some virus.
6:37
Let me say it's a bacteria.
6:38
When I did the other B cell example, I said we're dealing
6:40
with viruses.
6:41
But let's say some new bacteria and just some part of
6:46
its surface just happens to bind to only this B cell--
6:50
because this B cell has just the right combination.
6:52
So some part of his surface binds just to that B cell
6:57
right there.
6:57
That part of the surface that binds, remember, that was
6:59
called the epitope.
7:01
That's that part of the pathogen that binds to our
7:05
variable sequencer.
7:06
It won't bind to this B cell or this B cell because they
7:09
have different sequences here, but it binds to this B cell
7:12
and then that starts the activation process.
7:15
We'll go into-- sometimes this by itself can get the B cell
7:19
activated, but you normally need help from helper T
7:22
cells-- and we'll talk more about that.
7:24
And we said, once this happens, once you get
7:27
activated or the activation process starts, this guy
7:30
actually gets engulfed-- and I didn't talk about that in the
7:32
last video just because I didn't want to go into too
7:34
much detail.
7:35
So this whole thing gets engulfed by the B cell.
7:42
And then when it gets activated, it proliferates
7:46
itself and you normally need the T cells there and some
7:49
part of them become plasma B cells, some part of them
7:52
become memory B cells.
7:58
Remember, the plasma B cells say, gee, I've been activated.
8:02
I'm just going to produce a ton of these antibodies.
8:05
So the plasma B cell will just produce tons of these
8:07
antibodies and start spitting them out so that they can
8:10
attach to more and more of that pathogen and just mess
8:14
them up in different ways, either tag them so that other
8:18
macrophages or phagocytes eat them up-- or tag two of them
8:23
so you bundle them up so that they can't operate properly.
8:25
Whatever.
8:25
I'm not going to go into detail on that.
8:27
That's when it gets activated.
8:28
But the interesting thing is that the B cell will also do
8:31
what the phagocytes do.
8:33
The B cell will also take this guy into the cell.
8:41
Maybe he's initially attached to the antibody-- and break
8:47
him up, take pieces of this pathogen and attach it to MHC
8:55
II proteins and then present them on the surface.
8:59
So a B cell will also present the antigen.
9:06
So this is also an MHC II complex-- a major
9:11
histocompatibility complex-- and just so you know, histo
9:13
means tissue.
9:14
So this is related to whether something is compatible with
9:17
the tissue in your body and we'll talk more about that and
9:19
how it relates to transplants and all of that.
9:21
So this is also an MHC class II.
9:25
In both cases, whether we're talking about B cells that
9:28
recognize a very specific pathogen-- and it could be a
9:31
specific virus, a specific protein, a specific bacteria,
9:37
or in the cases of phagocytes, they'll just say,
9:40
oh, you look shady.
9:41
Let me take you in.
9:42
I don't know what type of bacteria or virus or protein
9:44
you are, but in either case, they both engulf them, take
9:47
pieces of them, cut them up, and present them on their
9:50
surface in a complex with the major
9:52
histocompatibility complexes.
9:57
So cells that do this are called professional antigen
10:01
presenting cells.
10:05
This is what they do for a living, although they do other
10:07
things, as we've seen.
10:09
The phagocytes eat things.
10:10
The B cells generate antibodies or memories so that
10:14
they can later be activated to generate antibodies, but these
10:17
are called professional antigen presenting cell.
10:25
And the antigen in question is this little piece of the
10:29
actual thing that you're trying to track, that little
10:35
piece-- the actual part of the pathogen, that's what the
10:38
antigen-- so it's presenting the antigen.
10:40
It's professional because it takes pathogens from in the
10:48
fluid of our system and then engulfs them, breaks them up,
10:51
and then presents them.
10:53
Now there are also nonprofessional antigen
10:57
presenting cells.
10:58
And in fact, most cells are this.
11:00
In fact, even these guys.
11:02
Actually, I'm going to wait for the next video.
11:03
I realize all of my videos are getting long.
11:05
So you're probably thinking, these guys in either case
11:10
engulf them, cut them up, present them,
11:12
what is it good for?
11:13
You'll see these MHC II, these are what are recognized by
11:18
helper T cells.
11:20
It'll all form part of the puzzle of how our immune
11:23
system works.
11:24
So in the next video, I'll talk about MHC I presenting
11:28
cells, which is pretty much all body cells.","So when the pathogen gets chewed up and a piece gets presented on the outside of the cell, does it matter what kind of piece?"

A function-- and I'm going to speak about it
0:02
in very abstract terms right now-- is something that
0:06
will take an input, and it'll munch on that input,
0:11
it'll look at that input, it will do something
0:13
to that input.
0:14
And based on what that input is, it will produce a given output.
0:20
What is an example of a function?
0:22
I could have something like f of x-- and x
0:27
tends to be the variable most used for an input
0:30
into the function.
0:31
And the name of a function, f tends
0:34
to be the most-used variable.
0:35
But we'll see that you can use others-- is equal to,
0:41
let's say, x squared, if x is even.
0:48
And let's say it is equal to x plus 5, if x is odd.
0:59
What would happen if we input 2 into this function?
1:03
The way that we would denote inputting 2
1:05
is that we would want to evaluate f of 2.
1:10
This is saying, let's input 2 into our function f.
1:14
And everywhere we see this x here,
1:16
this variable-- you can kind of use as a placeholder-- let's
1:19
replace it with our input.
1:21
So let's see.
1:21
If 2 is even, do 2 squared.
1:24
If 2 is odd, do 2 plus 5.
1:27
Well, 2 is even, so we're going to do 2 squared.
1:31
In this case, f of 2 is going to be 2 squared, or 4.
1:36
Now what would f of 3 be?
1:40
Well, once again, everywhere we see this variable,
1:42
we'll replace it with our input.
1:48
So f of 3, 3 squared if 3 is even, 3 plus 5 if 3 is odd.
1:54
Well, 3 is odd, so it's going to be 3 plus 5.
1:57
It is going to be equal to 8.
2:02
You might say, OK, that's neat, Sal.
2:04
This was kind of an interesting way
2:05
to define a function, a way to kind of munch on these numbers.
2:09
But I could have done this with traditional equations
2:12
in some way, especially if you allowed
2:13
me to use the squirrelly bracket thing.
2:16
What can a function do that maybe my traditional toolkits
2:19
might have not been as expressive about?
2:22
Well, you could even do a function like this.
2:25
Let me not use f and x anymore, just
2:27
to show you that the notation is more general than that.
2:30
I could say h of a is equal to the next largest number that
2:47
starts with the same letter as variable a.
3:00
And we're going to assume that we're dealing in English.
3:03
Given that, what is h of 2 going to be?
3:09
Well, 2 starts with a T. What's the next largest
3:12
number that starts with a T?
3:14
Well, it's going to be equal to 3.
3:18
Now what would h of-- I don't know, let's think about this,
3:25
h of 8 be equal to?
3:27
Well, 8 starts with an E. The next largest number
3:31
that starts with an E-- it's not 9, 10-- it would be 11.
3:37
And so now you see it's a very, very, very general tool.
3:42
This h function that we just defined, we'll look at it.
3:44
We'll look at the letter that the number
3:46
starts with in English.
3:47
So it's doing this really, really, really, really
3:49
wacky thing.
3:50
Now not all functions have to be this wacky.
3:53
In fact, you have already been dealing with functions.
3:55
You have seen things like y is equal to x plus 1.
4:02
This can be viewed as a function.
4:04
We could write this as y is a function
4:07
of x, which is equal to x plus 1.
4:11
If you give as an input-- let me write
4:16
it this way-- for example, when x is 0 we could say f of 0
4:23
is equal to, well, you take 0.
4:25
You add 1.
4:26
It's equal to 1.
4:28
f of 2 is equal to 2.
4:30
You've already done this before.
4:31
You've done things where you said, look,
4:33
let me make a table of x and put our y's there.
4:37
When x is 0, y is 1.
4:40
I'm sorry.
4:42
I made a little mistake.
4:44
Where f of 2 is equal to 3.
4:46
And you've done this before with tables where you say,
4:48
look, x and y.
4:51
When x is 0, y is 1.
4:53
When x is 2, y is 3.
4:57
You might say, well, what was the whole point of using
4:59
the function notation here to say
5:01
f of x is equal to x plus 1?
5:03
The whole point is to think in these more general terms.
5:07
For something like this, you didn't really
5:09
have to introduce function notations.
5:11
But it doesn't hurt to introduce function notations because it
5:14
makes it very clear that the function takes an input,
5:17
takes my x-- in this definition it munches on it.
5:21
It says, OK, x plus 1.
5:23
And then it produces 1 more than it.
5:26
So here, whatever the input is, the output is 1 more
5:29
than that original function.
5:31
Now I know what you're asking.
5:32
All right.
5:32
Well, what is not a function then?
5:35
Well, remember, we said a function
5:36
is something that takes an input and produces only one
5:39
possible output for that given input.
5:43
For example-- and let me look at a visual way
5:46
of thinking about a function this time, or a relationship,
5:49
I should say-- let's say that's our y-axis,
5:53
and this right over here is our x-axis.
5:58
Let me draw a circle here that has radius 2.
6:05
So it's a circle of radius 2.
6:07
This is negative 2.
6:09
This is positive 2.
6:11
This is negative 2.
6:12
So my circle, it's centered at the origin.
6:15
It has radius 2.
6:17
That's my best attempt at drawing the circle.
6:20
Let me fill it in.
6:21
So this is a circle.
6:23
The equation of this circle is going
6:25
to be x squared plus y squared is equal to the radius squared,
6:28
is equal to 2 squared, or it's equal to 4.
6:31
The question is, is this relationship between x and y--
6:34
here I've expressed it as an equation.
6:35
Here I've visually drawn all of the x's and y's that satisfy
6:40
this equation-- is this relationship between x
6:43
and y a function?
6:45
And we can see visually that it's not
6:47
going to be a function.
6:48
You pick a given x.
6:49
Let's say x is equal to 1.
6:53
There's two possible y's that are associated with it,
6:57
this y up here and this y down here.
7:00
We could even solve for that by looking at the equation.
7:02
When x is equal to 1, we get 1 squared plus y squared
7:06
is equal to 4.
7:07
1 plus y squared is equal to 4.
7:11
Or subtracting 1 from both sides, y squared is equal to 3.
7:15
Or y is equal to the positive or the negative square root of 3.
7:20
This right over here is the positive square root of 3,
7:23
and this right over here is the negative square root of 3.
7:26
So this situation, this relationship
7:28
where I inputted a 1 into my little box here,
7:34
and associated with the 1, I associate
7:36
both a positive square root of 3 and a negative square root
7:40
of 3, this is not a function.
7:47
I cannot associate with my input two different outputs.
7:51
I can only have one output for a given input.",What is a relation that is not a function?

0:00
When you get into higher mathematics,
0:02
you might see a professor write something
0:03
like this on a board, where it's just
0:05
this R with this extra backbone right over here.
0:08
And maybe they write R2.
0:10
Or if you're looking at it in a book,
0:12
it might just be a bolded capital
0:14
R with a 2 superscript like this.
0:17
And if you see this, they're referring
0:19
to the two-dimensional real coordinate
0:22
space, which sounds very fancy.
0:30
But one way to think about it, it's
0:31
really just the two-dimensional space
0:33
that you're used to dealing with in your coordinate plane.
0:37
To go a little bit more abstract,
0:39
this isn't necessarily this visual representation.
0:42
This visual representation is one way
0:45
to think about this real coordinate space.
0:47
If we were to think about it a little bit more abstractly,
0:50
the real R2, the two-dimensional real coordinate space--
0:54
let me write this down-- and the two-dimensional real coordinate
1:00
space.
1:01
And just to break down the notation,
1:03
the 2 tells us how many dimensions we're dealing with,
1:05
and then the R tells us this is a real coordinate space.
1:09
The two-dimensional real coordinate space
1:11
is all the possible real-valued 2-tuples.
1:15
Let me write that down.
1:17
This is all possible real-valued 2-tuples.
1:30
So what is a 2-tuple?
1:33
Well, a tuple is an ordered list of numbers.
1:37
And since we're talking about real values,
1:38
it's going to be ordered list of real numbers,
1:41
and a 2-tuple just says it's an ordered list of 2 numbers.
1:44
So this is an ordered list of 2 real-valued numbers.
1:47
Well, that's exactly what we did here
1:49
when we thought about a two-dimensional vector.
1:51
This right over here is a 2-tuple,
1:53
and this is a real-valued 2-tuple.
1:55
Neither of these have any imaginary parts.
1:58
So you have a 3 and a 4.
2:00
Order matters.
2:01
We view this as a different 2-tuple than, say, 4, 3.
2:08
And even if we were trying to represent them in our axes
2:12
right over here, this vector, 4, 3,
2:15
would be 4 along the horizontal axis,
2:18
and then 3 along the vertical axis.
2:22
And so it would look something like this.
2:24
And remember, we don't have to draw it just over there.
2:26
We just care about its magnitude and direction.
2:28
We could draw it right over here.
2:32
This would also be 4, 3, the column vector, 4 3.
2:38
So when we're talking about R2, we're
2:40
talking about all of the possible real-valued 2-tuples.
2:43
So all the possible vectors that you can have,
2:47
where each of its components-- and the components
2:50
are these numbers right over here--
2:52
where each of its components are a real number.
2:56
So you might have 3, 4.
2:57
You could have negative 3, negative 4.
2:59
So that would be 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4,
3:04
might look something like-- actually,
3:06
I should make the scale a little bit bigger,
3:08
so it looks the same-- 1, 2, 3, 4.
3:12
So it might look something like that.
3:16
So that would be the vector, negative 3--
3:18
let me write a little bit better than that-- negative 3,
3:22
and negative 4.
3:24
So if you were to take all of the possible 2-tuples,
3:27
including the vector 0, 0-- so it has no magnitude,
3:30
and you could debate what its direction is right over there--
3:34
you take all of those combined, and then
3:36
you have created your two-dimensional real coordinate
3:39
space.
3:40
And that is referred to as R2.
3:43
Now, as you can imagine, the fact
3:44
that we wrote this 2 here-- we had
3:46
to specify-- it's like, hey, well, could I put a 3 there?
3:48
And I would say, absolutely, you could put a 3 there.
3:51
So R3 would be the three-dimensional real
3:54
coordinate space.
3:56
So 3D real coordinate space.
4:02
And so you would view this as all
4:04
the possible real-valued 3-tuples.
4:13
So, for example, that would be a member of R3.
4:20
And let me actually label these vectors
4:22
just so we get in the habit of it.
4:23
So let's say we call this vector x.
4:26
Let's say we have a vector b, that looks like this.
4:31
Negative 1, 5, 3.
4:34
Both of these would be members of R3.
4:38
And if you want to see some fancy notation, a member
4:41
of a set-- so this is a member of R3--
4:47
it is a real-valued 3-tuple.
4:51
Now you say, well, what would not be a member of R3?
4:53
Well, this right over here isn't a 3-tuple.
4:55
This right over here is a member of R2.
4:57
Now, you might be able to extend it in some way,
4:59
add a zero or something, but formally,
5:01
this is not a 3-tuple.
5:03
Another thing that would not be a member of R3-- let's say
5:06
someone wanted to make some type of vector that
5:11
had some imaginary parts in it.
5:12
So let's say it had i, 0, 1.
5:15
This is no longer real-valued.
5:18
We have put an imaginary-- this number up here
5:22
has an imaginary part.
5:23
So this is no longer a real-valued 3-tuple.
5:28
And what's neat about linear algebra is,
5:30
we don't have to stop there.
5:31
R3 we can visualize, we can plot these things.
5:35
In your previous mathematical career,
5:37
especially if you have some type of a hologram or something,
5:39
it's not hard to visualize things in three dimensions.
5:42
But what's neat is that we can keep extending this.
5:44
We can go into 4, 5, 6, 7, 20, 100 dimensions.
5:48
And obviously there it becomes much harder, if not impossible,
5:51
to visualize it.
5:52
But then we can at least represent it mathematically
5:55
with an n-tuple of vectors.
5:57
And so if we were to talk about a real coordinate space
6:00
generally, you'll often see the notation Rn,
6:04
with n as a superscript.
6:06
So this right over here is an n-dimensional real coordinate
6:12
space.","Why is (1,0) different from (1,0,0) if both vectors can be represented on the x axis as an arrow pointing to the right with a magnitude of 1?"

0:00
What I want to do in this video is give you
0:02
a bunch of properties of limits.
0:03
And we're not going to prove it rigorously here.
0:05
In order to have the rigorous proof of these properties,
0:07
we need a rigorous definition of what a limit is.
0:09
And we're not doing that in this tutorial,
0:11
we'll do that in the tutorial on the epsilon delta
0:13
definition of limits.
0:14
But most of these should be fairly intuitive.
0:17
And they are very helpful for simplifying limit problems
0:19
in the future.
0:21
So let's say we know that the limit of some function
0:24
f of x, as x approaches c, is equal to capital L.
0:28
And let's say that we also know that the limit
0:32
of some other function, let's say g of x, as x approaches c,
0:36
is equal to capital M.
0:39
Now given that, what would be the limit of f
0:43
of x plus g of x as x approaches c?
0:49
Well-- and you could look at this visually,
0:51
if you look at the graphs of two arbitrary functions,
0:53
you would essentially just add those two functions--
0:55
it'll be pretty clear that this is going to be equal to--
0:57
and once again, I'm not doing a rigorous proof,
0:59
I'm just really giving you the properties here--
1:01
this is going to be the limit of f of x as x approaches c,
1:06
plus the limit of g of x as x approaches c.
1:11
Which is equal to, well this right over here
1:14
is-- let me do that in that same color--
1:17
this right here is just equal to L.
1:20
It's going to be equal to L plus M. This right over here
1:26
is equal to M.
1:27
Not too difficult.
1:28
This is often called the sum rule, or the sum property,
1:33
of limits.
1:35
And we could come up with a very similar one with differences.
1:37
The limit as x approaches c of f of x minus g of x,
1:44
is just going to be L minus M. It's just
1:47
the limit of f of x as x approaches
1:49
c, minus the limit of g of x as x approaches c.
1:52
So it's just going to be L minus M.
1:58
And we also often call it the difference
2:00
rule, or the difference property, of limits.
2:02
And these once again, are very, very, hopefully, reasonably
2:05
intuitive.
2:06
Now what happens if you take the product of the functions?
2:08
The limit of f of x times g of x as x approaches c.
2:16
Well lucky for us, this is going to be
2:18
equal to the limit of f of x as x approaches
2:22
c, times the limit of g of x, as x approaches c.
2:28
Lucky for us, this is kind of a fairly intuitive property
2:31
of limits.
2:32
So in this case, this is just going
2:33
to be equal to, this is L times M. This is just
2:41
going to be L times M. Same thing,
2:45
if instead of having a function here, we had a constant.
2:47
So if we just had the limit-- let
2:50
me do it in that same color-- the limit of k times
2:56
f of x, as x approaches c, where k is just some constant.
3:00
This is going to be the same thing as k times the limit
3:03
of f of x as x approaches c.
3:06
And that is just equal to L. So this whole thing
3:13
simplifies to k times L.
3:20
And we can do the same thing with difference.
3:22
This is often called the constant multiple property.
3:25
We can do the same thing with differences.
3:28
So if we have the limit as x approaches
3:31
c of f of x divided by g of x.
3:35
This is the exact same thing as the limit
3:37
of f of x as x approaches c, divided
3:41
by the limit of g of x as x approaches c.
3:46
Which is going to be equal to-- I think you get it now--
3:49
this is going to be equal to L over M.
3:56
And finally-- this is sometimes called the quotient property--
3:59
finally we'll look at the exponent property.
4:01
So if I have the limit of-- let me
4:07
write it this way-- of f of x to some power.
4:09
And actually, let me even write it
4:10
as a fractional power, to the r over s
4:12
power, where both r and s are integers, then the limit of f
4:16
of x to the r over s power as x approaches c,
4:23
is going to be the exact same thing as the limit of f
4:28
of x as x approaches c raised to the r over s power.
4:33
Once again, when r and s are both integers, and s
4:36
is not equal to 0.
4:37
Otherwise this exponent would not make much sense.
4:40
And this is the same thing as L to the r over s power.
4:46
So this is equal to L to the r over s power.
4:54
So using these, we can actually find
4:56
the limit of many, many, many things.
4:58
And what's neat about it is the property of limits kind of
5:01
are the things that you would naturally want to do.
5:03
And if you graph some of these functions,
5:05
it actually turns out to be quite intuitive.",Does the x value of the respective functions of both limits have to approach the same value for the properties to apply?

There's a classic story out there
0:04
and it has to do with a character named Jack.
0:06
And you may have heard this story,
0:08
but I'm sure that there is parts of that story
0:10
that you have not heard.
0:11
And so I'm actually going to just try to fill in those parts
0:14
that you get a complete idea of what happened.
0:18
Now Jack came across, a long time ago, a famous, now famous
0:24
beanstalk.
0:25
So this beanstalk was growing and growing
0:29
and had these huge leaves.
0:31
And actually Jack used these leaves
0:34
to make his way up this beanstalk.
0:36
And so, this is how this beanstalk became very famous.
0:40
Because it basically allowed Jack to use it like a ladder.
0:44
Now the part that we don't hear about
0:46
is what was going on between Jack and the beanstalk.
0:48
He was exercising, right?
0:49
So he was actually making a lot of carbon dioxide.
0:54
He was making a lot of this gas, this carbon dioxide gas,
0:58
as kind of a waste product as he was running,
1:01
scampering up the beanstalk.
1:03
And the beanstalk was helping him physically, but also
1:07
was actually providing him with very precious oxygen.
1:11
In fact, if the beanstalk didn't do that,
1:13
he may not have even made it.
1:15
And we also, we don't know for sure,
1:18
but we think that perhaps some of this story
1:20
may have taken place during the day.
1:23
And in fact, we know that sunlight
1:25
is quite important for this process.
1:27
And we think that this process, the name that we give it
1:31
for the beanstalk anyway, is photosynthesis.
1:35
And so what is really happening-- we're actually
1:38
going to kind of write it out here-- between Jack
1:42
and the beanstalk, and really between all plants and animals?
1:45
What is this process between them?
1:47
We know that on the one hand, you
1:48
have beanstalks doing photosynthesis,
1:51
and on the other hand, you have folks like Jack
1:54
doing cellular respiration.
1:57
And there's this really kind of interesting symbiosis.
2:01
And by that I just mean that the two are
2:03
kind of relying on each other to really work.
2:07
So you kind of need both of them to work well.
2:09
And so let's actually take a moment
2:11
to write out these processes that
2:13
are happening between Jack and the beanstalk.
2:16
So let's start with the process of photosynthesis,
2:19
the beanstalk.
2:20
So on the one hand, you've got what?
2:23
You've got water because, of course,
2:25
the beanstalk needs water, and you've got carbon dioxide.
2:31
And I'm going to do carbon oxide in orange.
2:34
So it's taking in water and carbon dioxide.
2:37
And it's going to put out, it's going
2:41
to actually take these ingredients
2:43
if you want to think of it as kind of cooking,
2:45
it's going to take these ingredients
2:46
and it's going to put out.
2:49
It's going to put out what?
2:51
Oxygen and glucose.
2:54
So I'll put glucose up top and oxygen down below.
2:59
So these are the inputs and outputs of photosynthesis.
3:04
And on the other side, you've got something very similar.
3:07
You've got inputs.
3:08
You've got glucose and oxygen going in.
3:11
You're going to start seeing some serious similarities here.
3:16
You've got glucose and oxygen going in.
3:18
So Jack is taking in those two things.
3:21
And he is again, of course, processing them.
3:25
And he's putting out water and carbon dioxide.
3:31
So this looks really, really nice, right?
3:34
Looks perfect actually.
3:35
Because everything is nice and balanced.
3:38
And you can see how it makes perfect sense that,
3:41
not only did Jack need the beanstalk,
3:42
but actually it sounds like the beanstalk needed Jack,
3:45
based on how I've drawn it.
3:46
Now remember, none of this would even
3:48
happen if there was no sunlight.
3:50
So we actually need light energy.
3:52
In fact, that's the whole purpose of this, right?
3:54
Getting energy.
3:56
So you have to have some light energy.
3:58
I'm going to put a big plus sign,
4:00
and I might even circle it because it's so important.
4:02
I don't want you to lose track of it.
4:04
And on the other side, of course,
4:05
Jack is getting something as well.
4:08
He's getting chemical energy.
4:11
In fact, he's using the chemical energy
4:14
to help him climb the beanstalk.
4:16
And so the chemical energy comes in the form
4:18
of what we call ATP, which is just a molecule of high energy.
4:24
And so Jack and the beanstalk are basically
4:28
going from light energy to chemical energy using these two
4:33
equations.
4:33
Now here's the part that people don't always appreciate.
4:36
And I'm actually going to take just a moment to show you
4:39
that this isn't the full story.
4:41
There's actually something else going on as well.
4:44
And that is that there's actually
4:47
some cellular respiration happening on the plant's side.
4:51
So remember, not only does the human, or the Jack,
4:55
need energy, but so does the plant.
4:58
The plant needs energy as well.
5:00
And in fact, if it takes in light energy right here,
5:03
it needs to find a way to actually,
5:04
eventually get some chemical energy itself,
5:07
so that it can do all the things it needs to do.
5:10
It doesn't need to run because plants don't
5:12
move in that sense, but it might need to make new roots,
5:15
and may need to make a flower, and all these things
5:18
take energy.
5:20
So actually, photosynthesis is happening during the day,
5:26
but at all times plants are also capable of doing
5:31
cellular respiration, just like humans are.
5:34
So humans and plants have actually more
5:37
in common than you might think.
5:39
So, this brings up an obvious question.
5:41
Why in the world would a plant send its glucose and oxygen
5:48
this way, when it needs it itself?
5:51
You know, why would it actually get rid of it?
5:54
Well, the truth is, that the glucose ends up oftentimes
5:57
in fruits and vegetables that we eat.
5:59
But as far as the oxygen goes, it makes an excess of oxygen.
6:04
So there is actually enough oxygen
6:06
to go both to us, or to Jack and to be used by itself.
6:12
So it actually has an excess of oxygen that it's making.
6:15
So this is actually kind of interesting and good to know.
6:17
Now if you think about it, if I was to,
6:19
let's say sketch out a planet.
6:22
Let's draw a little planet over here, and ask you the question.
6:27
If this was your planet Earth, and you've
6:29
got thousands, instead of just one Jack, let's say now
6:32
you have thousands of Jacks and thousands of beanstalks,
6:36
in fact, not even thousands.
6:37
Let's say billions, because really, that's what we have.
6:41
We have a planet full of humans, and full of other animals,
6:44
and full of plants.
6:46
What would the atmosphere look like?
6:48
This is the atmosphere.
6:50
What would the atmosphere look like?
6:52
Well you'd guess that the atmosphere is gas.
6:57
And so what would those gases be?
6:59
Well, the way I've drawn things again,
7:02
it looks like I've got lots of oxygen and lots
7:05
of carbon dioxide.
7:06
So I would say well, I guess there must be, I don't know,
7:09
maybe 50-50 carbon dioxide and oxygen
7:12
based on what we know so far.
7:15
And the truth is, that's actually not true.
7:17
That if you actually look at air, if you actually break down
7:21
the atmosphere or air-- I'm just going to write ""air"" here--
7:25
if you actually break it down, turns out
7:27
that the ratios are actually a little different.
7:30
So for example, oxygen makes up about 21% of our air.
7:35
This is our air breakdown.
7:40
And carbon dioxide makes up about less than 1%.
7:44
So, that leaves you wondering, what the heck is making up
7:47
all that other parts of air?
7:50
What is it made of?
7:51
And in truth, it's about 78% nitrogen.
7:57
Now you know, you've got nitrogen in your proteins,
8:00
we've got nitrogen in our DNA.
8:03
So nitrogen is part of us and is part of many, many living
8:07
things.
8:08
But nitrogen gas, specifically, is actually N2.
8:13
And N2, this nitrogen gas, really is not too reactive.
8:18
It kind of just hangs out by itself,
8:20
does not like to react with things.
8:22
So, looking at our little atmosphere graph,
8:25
if you want to now think about it,
8:26
knowing that we've got very little carbon dioxide and about
8:30
21% oxygen-- you could think of oxygen being,
8:34
let's say, something like that-- well then relative
8:36
to that nitrogen would be much more.
8:40
You have much more nitrogen hanging out.
8:45
And so this is really what our atmosphere looks like.
8:47
It looks more filled with nitrogen than anything else.
8:52
And in terms of carbon dioxide, it's
8:54
just got a little smidge of carbon dioxide.
8:56
Maybe right there.
8:58
That could be carbon dioxide, maybe even less than that.
9:01
So this is really what our atmosphere looks like,
9:03
visually.
9:04
And the nitrogen again, it's making up the majority.
9:07
And if you actually wonder where all that nitrogen is coming
9:10
from, because I didn't mention it in any of the equations,
9:13
most of that nitrogen has been around,
9:15
scientists think, since the beginning
9:17
of when earth even had an atmosphere.
9:20
And that nitrogen, we're just kind
9:21
of carrying with us at all times.
9:24
And that's why it just remains around 78%,
9:27
and will probably remain there for many, many years to come.","At around 4:50 when you said plants also do cellular respiration, do you mean that the oxygen they make, they will break it down themselves into carbon dioxide and and then absorb it?"
khan_video_meibWcbGqt4_73772,Math,ESSAY,"•
0:00
Like we've done in the last several videos, let's assume
0:03
that we have some set of basis vectors B.
0:07
And let's say our basis is going to be v1 v2
0:11
all the way to vk.
0:14
So this will span a subspace of dimension k.
0:18
And let's assume that each of these guys are members of Rn.
0:22
So v1 v2 all the way to vk.
0:27
They're all members of Rn.
0:30
Now in the last video, we saw that we can define a change of
0:33
basis matrix.
0:35
And it's a fancy word, but all it means is a matrix that has
0:39
these basis vectors as its columns.
0:41
So v1, v2 all the way to vk as its columns.
0:48
So we're going to have k columns and we're going to
0:52
have n rows.
0:53
Because each of these guys are members of Rn, so they're
0:55
going to have n entries.
0:56
So we're going to have n rows.
0:58
So it's going to be an n by k matrix.
1:01
And we saw in the last video that if I have some vector a
1:08
that is a member of Rn-- and assuming that a is in the span
1:14
of B-- I can represent a.
1:16
I could say that a is equal to the change of basis matrix
1:22
times the coordinates of a with respect to our basis.
1:28
This is what we saw in the last video.
1:30
If I have the coordinates of a with respect to B, I can
1:34
multiply it by the change of basis matrix and I'll get my
1:36
vector a in standard coordinates.
1:38
Or if I have my vector a in standard coordinates, then I
1:41
can solve for my vector a in coordinates with respect to B.
1:45
We saw that in the last video.
1:47
Now let's take a special case.
1:50
Let's assume that C is invertible.
2:02
What does that mean?
2:03
Or what does that tell us about C?
2:05
Well if C is invertible, it's two things.
2:07
It means that C is a square matrix or has the same number
2:11
rows and columns.
2:12
And that its rows or columns-- You can pick either of them--
2:15
have to be linearly independent.
2:16
So linearly independent, let's just pick columns.
2:20
Now the second statement is a bit redundant.
2:21
We know that C has linearly independent columns, because
2:24
its columns are bases for a subspace.
2:28
So a basis, by definition, all of the vectors have to be
2:31
linearly independent.
2:32
So we know this is a bit redundant.
2:37
But what's interesting is if we know that C is invertible,
2:39
C has to be square.
2:41
And if all of these vectors are members of Rn, then k has
2:44
to be equal to n.
2:48
So C is square means that k is equal to n or that we have n
2:55
basis vectors.
2:59
Now if that's the case, what is the span of B?
3:03
Think about it.
3:04
We have n linearly independent vectors in Rn.
3:20
So any time you have n linearly independent vectors
3:23
in Rn, those guys are a basis for Rn.
3:27
Because any basis that has n entries-- and they're all
3:30
linearly independent-- is going to be a basis for Rn.
3:35
So then B is a basis for Rn.
3:42
So if we know that C is invertible, we also know that
3:45
you can get to any vector in Rn by some linear combination
3:50
of your basis vectors right there.
3:54
In the last video, we had to make sure that this guy was in
3:59
the span of these vectors.
4:01
But now we don't have to make sure, because if C is
4:03
invertible, then the span of B is going to be equal to Rn.
4:17
Or another way you could say it is if the span of B is
4:19
equal to Rn.
4:21
If we have n vectors here, if k was equal to n, then we know
4:25
that the span of B would be equal to Rn.
4:28
And so we'd have n vectors here, n linearly independent
4:31
columns here, and it would be an n by n matrix with all of
4:34
the columns linearly independent.
4:35
So then C would be invertible.
4:37
So we could write if and only if.
4:39
And we could write it the other way.
4:41
If the span of B is Rn, then C is invertible.
4:53
And that's useful, because if either of these things are
4:56
true, then we can rewrite the same equation.
5:00
So let's say if we know this and we're looking for that, we
5:03
can just multiply C times that.
5:05
Let's say we know this and we're looking for that.
5:07
Before we had to do that augmented matrix and solve for
5:10
it, whatnot.
5:10
But if we know C is invertible, then one, we know
5:15
that any vector here can be represented in
5:19
the span of our basis.
5:20
So any vector here can be represented as linear
5:22
combinations of these guys.
5:23
So you know that any vector can be represented in these
5:27
coordinates or with coordinates with
5:28
respect to our basis.
5:30
We can multiply both sides of this equation times C inverse.
5:34
And what do you get if you multiply?
5:35
So it becomes C inverse C times our coordinates of a
5:40
with respect to B is equal to C inverse times a.
5:45
This is just the identity matrix right there.
5:50
Another way of writing this is that the coordinates of a,
5:54
with respect to our basis B, which spans all of Rn, is
5:59
equal to C inverse times our vector a.
6:04
Let's apply this a little bit.
6:06
Let's apply this.
6:07
Let's use this information, what we've done in this video.
6:11
Let's do some concrete examples.
6:13
So let's say I have some basis.
6:20
Let me define two vectors.
6:21
I'll do it this way.
6:22
So let's say I have v1 is equal to the vector 1, 3.
6:28
And let's say v2 is equal to the vector 2, 1.
6:35
And I have a basis that is equal to the set of v1 and v2.
6:43
Now I'll leave it for you to verify that these guys are
6:45
linearly independent.
6:46
But if I have two linearly independent vectors in R2,
6:49
then B is a basis for R2.
6:59
And if we write the change of basis matrix, if we say C is
7:05
equal to 1, 3, 2, 1, we know that C is invertible.
7:10
And actually to show that C is invertible, we can just
7:12
calculate its inverse.
7:14
So what's the determinant of C?
7:16
The determinant of C is equal to 1 times 1 minus 2 times 3.
7:24
So it's equal minus 5.
7:27
That's the determinant of C.
7:28
And so C inverse-- We figured out a general formula for
7:31
doing this for 2 by 2 matrices-- is equal to 1 over
7:35
the determinant of C, so 1 over minus 5 times-- You
7:42
switch these two guys, so you switch the 1's, and you make
7:45
these two guys negative.
7:47
So minus 2, and then minus 3.
7:50
And the very fact that this guy, the determinant of C, was
7:54
non-zero told us that this was invertible.
7:57
But anyway, this is C inverse.
7:59
So let's say that I have some vector a that
8:04
is a member of R2.
8:09
I'm just going to pick some random numbers.
8:10
Let's say that a is equal to 7, 2.
8:13
And I want to find out what the coordinates of a are with
8:17
respect to my basis B.
8:24
Well we go to this situation.
8:26
We know what a is, so we just multiply a times C inverse to
8:32
get this guy right here, to get the coordinates of a with
8:35
respect to B.
8:37
So let me write that down.
8:38
So what is C?
8:39
So C is that.
8:40
C inverse is that.
8:41
So we could write the coordinates of a with respect
8:46
to B is equal to C inverse times the standard
8:50
coordinates of a.
8:51
Or this is the same thing.
8:53
Let me put the actual numbers here.
8:54
The coordinates of a with respect to B are going to be
8:58
equal to C inverse, which is minus 1/5 times 1 minus 3
9:05
minus 2, 1, times a, times 7, 2.
9:15
And what is this equal to?
9:15
This is equal to minus 1/5.
9:19
And then we're going to get 1 times 7 plus minus 2 times 2.
9:24
So it's minus 4.
9:25
So 7 minus 4 is 3.
9:27
And then we're going to get minus 3 times 7, which is
9:30
minus 21, plus 1 times 2.
9:33
So minus 21 plus 2 is minus is 19.
9:39
So the coordinates of a with respect to the basis B are
9:46
going to be equal to-- Let me just multiply the negative
9:48
1/5-- you get minus 3/5.
9:52
And then you get plus 19/5.
9:55
So 19 over 5.
10:00
Just like that.
10:00
And let's verify that.
10:03
This means that a is equal to minus 3/5 times our first
10:06
basis vector plus 19/5 times our second basis vector.
10:10
Let's verify that that's the case.
10:12
So let's see, minus 3/5 times 1, 3, plus 19/5 times 2, 1.
10:25
Let's see what this is going to be equal to.
10:31
Let me write the two vectors.
10:33
This is minus 3/5 times 3 is minus 9/5.
10:42
And there we're going to add it to this guy.
10:45
So this guy is 2 times 19 is 38/5.
10:51
Right?
10:52
And then 19/5 times 1 is 19/5.
10:56
And then if you add these two vectors
10:58
together, what do we get?
11:00
We get minus 3/5 plus 38/5.
11:04
That's 35/3.
11:06
35/5 is 7, minus 9/5 plus 19/5.
11:13
That's 10/5 or 2.
11:16
And there you have it.
11:17
That was our original a.
11:19
So we see that a can definitely be represented as
11:21
minus 3/5 times our first basis vector plus 19/5 times
11:26
our second basis vector.
11:28
Now that was a case where we had some vector a and we
11:31
wanted to represent it in coordinates with respect to B.
11:34
What if we had the other way?
11:36
What if we said that some vector w's coordinates with
11:43
respect to B are-- I'll do something simple-- are 1, 1.
11:50
Then what is w in standard coordinates?
11:54
Well there we can just multiply.
11:58
Remember w is just equal to the change of basis matrix
12:01
times w's coordinates with respect to the basis B.
12:05
So w is going to be equal to the change of basis matrix,
12:10
which is just 1, 3, 2, 1, times the coordinates of w
12:19
with respect to B times 1, 1.
12:22
Which is equal to 1 times 1 plus 2 times 1 is 3.
12:27
And then 3 times 1 plus 1 plus 1.
12:31
So 3 times 1 is 3, plus 1 is 4.
12:35
So w is just equal to the vector 3, 4.
12:38
So there you see if our change of basis matrix is invertible,
12:41
which is really just another way of saying that are basis
12:44
spans Rn-- in this example it was R2-- then you can easily
12:49
go back and forth between coordinate representations in
12:52
our standard coordinates and coordinate representations
12:59
with respect to our basis.
13:02
Right?
13:02
This is with respect to the basis.
13:03
This is in standard coordinates.
13:08
And you can do that just simply by either using this
13:12
information or just saying, oh, the coordinates with
13:16
respect to the basis equal to C inverse times a, or the
13:18
inverse of our change of basis matrix times a.
13:21
Or saying our coordinates with respect to the standard basis
13:27
is just equal to the change of basis matrix times the
13:30
coordinates with respect to the basis.","I mean, if it is in R^n, shouldn't it has always n basis vectors?"

Let's say I'm over here.
0:01
I'm going to do two scenarios.
0:03
So I'm an observer over here.
0:04
This is me.
0:06
And then maybe even better, I should just draw my eyeball
0:10
because we're going to be observing light.
0:12
So I'm just going to draw my eyeball.
0:15
So this is me in the first scenario or this
0:18
is one of my eyeballs.
0:20
And then this is one of my eyeballs
0:21
in the second scenario.
0:24
Now in the first scenario-- so let me draw it--
0:26
so in both scenarios, we're going to have an object.
0:28
We're going to have some type of source of light.
0:31
But in the first scenario, relative to me,
0:35
the source of light will not be moving.
0:37
While in the second scenario, the source
0:38
of light-- just for the sake of discussion, just for fun--
0:43
will be moving at half the speed of light.
0:45
Unimaginably fast speed, but let's just assuming that it is.
0:49
So it's moving at-- it has a velocity of 1/2
0:52
the speed of light, 1/2 light speed away from me
1:02
who is the observer.
1:05
Now let's just imagine what would happen.
1:07
They're both emitting light.
1:08
So and they're both going to start
1:09
emitting light at the exact same time.
1:12
And when they start emitting light,
1:14
they're both at the exact same distance from my eye.
1:18
The only difference is is that this
1:19
is stationary, relative to me, while this is moving away
1:23
from me at half the speed of light.
1:26
So let's say that after some period of time,
1:29
that the light wave from this source reaches my eye.
1:35
And then it looks something like this.
1:36
I'll try my best to draw it.
1:40
So let's say I have-- I want to draw a couple of wavelengths
1:42
here.
1:43
So let's say that's half a wavelength.
1:45
That's a full wavelength.
1:47
That's another half, a full wavelength, another half,
1:51
full wavelength, and then a half, and then
1:53
a full wavelength.
1:54
So let me see if I can draw that.
1:55
So it would look like full wavelength,
2:00
full wavelength, full wave length.
2:04
This is not easy to do.
2:05
And then you got another full wavelength.
2:07
So it would look something like that, the actual waveform.
2:11
And so the front of the wave form is just getting to my eye.
2:16
And then as the wave forms keep going past my eye,
2:20
my eye will perceive some type of a wave length or frequency
2:23
and perceive it to be some type of color,
2:25
assuming that we're in the visible part
2:27
of the electromagnetic spectrum.
2:28
Now let's think about what's going
2:30
to happen with this source.
2:31
So the first thing is is that the front of the wave form
2:34
is going to reach me at the exact same time.
2:36
One of those neat and amazing things about light travelling
2:41
in general, or especially in a vacuum,
2:43
it doesn't matter that this is moving away from me at half
2:47
the speed of light.
2:48
The light will still move towards me
2:50
at the speed of light.
2:52
It's absolute.
2:53
It doesn't matter if this is going away at 0.9
2:55
the speed of light.
2:56
The light will still travel to me at the speed of light.
3:00
And it's very unintuitive.
3:01
Because in our everyday sense, if I'm moving away from you
3:05
at half the speed of a bullet and I shoot a bullet,
3:07
the bullet will only move towards you
3:09
at-- it'll kind of-- that half of its velocity
3:12
will be subtracted.
3:13
And it'll only move towards me at half of its normal velocity,
3:17
relative to whether it was stationary,
3:18
but not the case with the light.
3:20
So with that out of the way, let's think
3:22
about what the wave form would look like.
3:24
So by the time the light reached here,
3:27
we need to think of-- let me actually redraw this over here.
3:29
Let me redraw this eyeball right over here.
3:37
So this is me again.
3:38
So by the time the light reaches my eye-- so they both started
3:42
emitting the light at the exact same time--
3:44
this guy has traveled half this distance.
3:47
If it took light a certain amount of time to get this far,
3:52
this guy will get half as far in that same amount of time.
3:54
So by the time the light reaches my eye,
3:57
this guy will have traveled about half that distance.
4:00
So he would have traveled about that far.
4:03
They started emitting the light at the same time.
4:06
So that very first photon, if you view light as a particle,
4:10
will reach my eye at the very same time
4:13
as the very first photon from this guy.
4:16
So the wave form is going to essentially be stretched.
4:19
So instead of having-- so we're still
4:22
going to have one, two, three, four full wavelengths,
4:28
but they'll now be stretched.
4:29
Let me see if I can draw four full wavelengths.
4:31
So let me cut this in half over here.
4:34
And let me cut each of those in half.
4:37
So each of these are going to be a full wavelength.
4:40
And then they're going to have a half wavelength in between.
4:47
And so the wave form is going to look like this.
4:52
Let me try my best to draw it.
4:55
This is the hardest part, drawing the stretched out wave
4:58
form.
5:00
And there you go.
5:01
It's going to look like this.
5:02
And so when it gets to my eye, my eye
5:04
is going to perceive it as having a longer wavelength,
5:07
even though from the perspective of each
5:09
of these objects, if you're traveling with each of them,
5:12
the frequency and the wavelength of the light emitted
5:15
is the same.
5:16
The only difference is this guy's moving away from me--
5:18
or I'm moving away from it, depending
5:20
on how you want to view it-- while I am stationary,
5:23
while in this first case, the observer and the source
5:26
are both stationary.
5:27
Now, in this situation, what's my eye going to say?
5:29
Well, my eye will get each of these successive pulses,
5:33
or each of these successive wave trains.
5:35
And it's going to say, hey, there's a longer wavelength
5:37
here, a perceived longer wavelength--
5:46
let me write that-- perceived longer wavelength here,
5:51
and also, a perceived lower frequency.
6:00
So what would that do to the perception of the light?
6:03
Let's say that this is green light.
6:06
So if you are stationary with the observer,
6:08
it would be green light.
6:09
So let's look at the electromagnetic spectrum.
6:11
I got this off of Wikipedia.
6:13
So if I were stationary towards-- with the observer,
6:16
we'd be in the green light part of the spectrum,
6:20
so a 500 nanometer wavelength.
6:23
But if all of a sudden, because the object
6:26
is moving away from me at this huge velocity,
6:29
the perceived wavelength becomes wider.
6:32
So from my perception, it is going
6:34
to have a wider wavelength.
6:36
And you can see what's happening.
6:37
It will look redder.
6:39
It will move towards the red part of the spectrum.
6:42
And this phenomenon is called redshift.
6:53
And I've done a bunch of videos of the physics playlist
6:55
on the Doppler effect.
6:56
And over there, I talk about sound waves and the perceived
6:59
frequency of sound-- if something travels towards you
7:02
verses away from you-- as the exact same idea.
7:05
This is the Doppler effect applied to light.
7:07
And the reason why the Doppler effect
7:09
works for light traveling through space
7:12
and for sound traveling through air
7:15
is because the sound wave in air, regardless
7:17
of whether the source is moving away
7:19
or towards you, the sound wave is
7:21
going to move at the speed of sound in air
7:23
at a certain pressure and all of that.
7:25
And light is the same thing.
7:27
But in a vacuum, It will always, regardless of the source,
7:32
regardless of what the source is doing,
7:34
the actual light wave itself will always
7:36
travel at the same velocity.
7:39
The only difference is is that its perceived frequency
7:42
and wavelength will change.
7:43
And now the whole reason why I'm talking about this
7:45
is you can use this property of light,
7:49
that it gets redshift, to see whether things are traveling
7:52
away or towards you.
7:55
And people talk about redshift because, frankly, most things
7:57
are traveling away from us.
7:59
And that's one of the reasons why
8:00
we tend to believe in the Big Bang.
8:02
The opposite, if something is traveling towards me
8:05
at super high velocities, then we
8:07
would have something called-- you
8:09
don't hear the word-- it would be violetshift.
8:11
The frequency would increase.
8:15
So it would look bluer or more purple.
8:17
Now the other thing I want to highlight
8:19
is this redshift phenomenon, this idea,
8:21
it doesn't apply only to visible light.
8:24
So it could even apply the things that we can't even see.
8:27
So it would only-- it would become redder.
8:29
But it's not like you can even see.
8:31
It could even be applied to things
8:32
that are even more red than red.
8:34
So maybe it's a microwave that is being emitted.
8:37
But because the source is moving away from us so fast,
8:40
it could be perceived as an actual radio wave.
8:44
And actually, I should have talked about this in the video
8:46
on the microwave background radiation
8:49
is that we're perceiving it as microwaves.
8:52
But these sources were moving away from us.
8:55
They were being redshift.
8:57
So they were not actually emitting microwave radiation.
9:00
It's just what we observe-- and this is actually
9:03
what would be predicted based on the Big Bang-- is actually
9:07
microwave radiation.
9:08
So anyway, hopefully, that gives you
9:10
a sense of what redshift is.
9:11
And now we can use this tool to explain
9:16
why we think many, many things are moving away from us.
9:19
And now let me just actually make sure you get that idea.
9:22
If I have two objects, let's say that these are suns.
9:25
Let's say that these are both suns, or both galaxies,
9:29
either way.
9:30
And because of other properties--
9:32
and I won't talk about them right now--
9:33
we know that they are probably emitting
9:37
light of the same color.
9:39
They're probably emitting light of the same color
9:41
because we know other properties of that star or of that galaxy.
9:45
Now, if what we actually perceive
9:48
is that this one looks redder to us than this one,
9:51
then we know that it is traveling away from us.
9:55
And the redder it looks, the more its wavelength
9:57
is spread out relative to this other star, the faster we know
10:00
that this is moving away from us.","If I see a tomato, does that mean that the light reflects at 700 nm towards me?"

Voiceover:Which of the following
0:01
can represent a vector?
0:03
A vector is something that
0:05
has both a magnitude and a direction.
0:09
Let's see which one of these could represent something
0:10
that has a magnitude and a direction.
0:12
The first choice right over here is the number 5.
0:16
5 could represent a magnitude,
0:19
you could say, essentially, how large something is.
0:21
That's all the information has.
0:23
It doesn't say 5 in a certain direction.
0:25
This one by itself would not be a
0:28
or it couldn't represent a vector.
0:30
You need to specify a direction as well.
0:32
The angle measure 5 degrees.
0:36
Well the angle measure 5 degrees
0:37
could represent a direction.
0:39
If you say it's 5 degrees.
0:40
Let's say that's the positive X axis
0:43
that's the positive Y axis.
0:45
If you said it's 5 degrees relative
0:47
to the positive X axis.
0:49
If you said something like this,
0:52
so if you had 5 degrees over there,
0:54
that would be specifying a direction,
0:56
but it's not giving us a magnitude.
0:58
It's not saying how far in that direction
1:00
or how large in that direction.
1:02
An angle measure of 5 degrees,
1:04
you're giving us a direction,
1:06
but no magnitude.
1:07
Let's just cross these out.
1:09
The point (5,5). Now this is interesting.
1:13
If we say that the point is the end point of a vector
1:17
that starts at the origin,
1:20
so lets draw that out.
1:22
That's the positive X axis, positive Y axis.
1:25
This is 1,2,3,4,5 in the horizontal direction.
1:31
1,2,3,4,5 in the positive vertical direction.
1:35
The .5,5 is going to be right over there.
1:40
If you said that this represents the head of a vector
1:46
who's tail is at the origin.
1:50
The vector would look something like this.
1:53
Now, you're giving both a magnitude and a direction.
1:56
What's the magnitude?
1:58
What's the distance between the origin
1:59
and this point, right over here.
2:01
You could solve using the Pythagorean theorem
2:04
and the direction, it's this general direction.
2:12
This could specify a magnitude and a direction.
2:16
This could represent a vector.
2:19
The outcome of 5+5, obviously that's just 10.
2:23
That's just a number.
2:24
For the same reason, this first choice,
2:26
if I just have a number,
2:27
that could be a magnitude,
2:28
but we don't have a direction as well.

khan_video_o5iot_ZsoV0_8,Math,MCQ,"•

Male: What I want to do in this video is introduce you
0:02
to the idea of a consumption function.
0:05
It's a very simple idea.
0:07
It's really just the notion that income,
0:09
income in aggregate in an economy
0:11
can drive consumption in aggregate in an economy.
0:17
Just to make things tangible, I will construct
0:19
a consumption function for a hypothetical economy,
0:24
and we can debate whether we can construct a better one.
0:27
All the numbers don't have to be exactly
0:29
what I'm about to do, but this is just
0:30
to make things concrete in your mind.
0:32
Maybe we have a hypothetical economy
0:33
where consumption is going to be equal to ...
0:36
well, maybe there's some base level of consumption
0:38
even if there's no aggregate income in our economy.
0:41
It's hard to image, but let's say there isn't.
0:42
There will still be consumption.
0:44
Maybe people can do it by digging into their savings.
0:47
They're essentially using resources
0:49
that they've already accumulated in some way.
0:51
Let's say that base level of consumption,
0:53
let's call that 500.
0:55
It could be billions of dollars or gold coins
0:58
or clamshells or whatever the unit
1:01
of measuring economic activity is in our economy.
1:03
That's our base level of consumption.
1:06
Then let's say if there is some aggregate income,
1:10
people will spend 60% of it.
1:12
I'm just picking these numbers somewhat arbitrarily.
1:14
Let's say if there's some above and beyond
1:17
the base level, they're going to spend 0.6
1:20
of any aggregate income they have.
1:22
Actually, to be a little bit more particular,
1:23
I'll write not just income, I'll write disposable income.
1:27
I'll want to do that in a different color.
1:30
They will ... that's not a different color.
1:32
Above and beyond the base level,
1:34
they'll spend 60% of their disposable income.
1:40
I make the distinction, just to clarify our model,
1:44
between income and disposable income
1:46
because all of the aggregate income in an economy
1:49
does not end up in consumers' pockets.
1:54
Just for a simplification, you might say,
1:56
""Yeah, some of it ends up in firms' pockets,""
1:58
but the firms, at the end of the day,
1:59
are owned by individuals, so it can end up
2:01
in individuals' or consumers' pockets.
2:03
But some of it goes off to the government.
2:07
When you think about income, and if you spend
2:09
any time looking at your pay stub this will
2:11
become familiar to you, you have your income
2:13
but you don't end up with all of that in your
2:15
checking account or your pocket
2:17
or your savings account.
2:18
A good fraction of that is taken out for taxes.
2:21
What you have left over when you subtract
2:23
taxes out of income, that is your disposable income.
2:31
That's why I write this here because that's actually
2:33
a more reasonable thing to say.
2:34
People will spend 60% of their disposable income.
2:37
They obviously can't spend a fraction of stuff that
2:39
they don't have, the stuff that's taken out for taxes.
2:42
Just to visualize this, we can draw it.
2:44
This will be a line.
2:45
This might ring a bell from your early algebra days.
2:48
Just the variables are different.
2:50
Instead of a y, we have a c,
2:52
but that's still the dependent variable.
2:54
It's a function of disposable income.
2:56
In algebra you'll often call this the independent variable.
2:59
The most typical variable is x.
3:01
It's really the same idea over here.
3:03
Let me draw this a little bit neater.
3:07
We can graph this, what's essentially going to be a line.
3:11
It doesn't have to be a line.
3:12
We just constructed a consumption function
3:13
that happens to be a line.
3:15
This is consumption right over here in the vertical axis.
3:19
That could be in billions of dollars
3:21
or clamshells or whatever else.
3:22
Then right over here we have disposable income.
3:31
If there is zero disposable income,
3:34
maybe I'll draw a little table over here.
3:38
This is I'll call it disposable income
3:41
and this is consumption.
3:42
If there's zero disposable income,
3:44
then this whole term right over here is 0.
3:46
Then you have 500 billion dollars,
3:49
or whatever our units are, of base consumption.
3:52
This would correspond to this point right over here.
3:56
In the horizontal axis you don't move at all
3:59
because this is 0.
4:00
Vertical axis is 500.
4:02
So you have 500.
4:03
Let's say disposable income is 1,000
4:09
whatever our units are.
4:10
So this is 500.
4:11
Let's say this is 1,000 billion clamshells.
4:14
This could be in billions of clamshells.
4:16
I don't want to keep having to say that
4:18
over and over again.
4:19
What is our consumption going to be in our units?
4:21
Our consumption is going to be equal to
4:24
500 + 0.6 x 1,000 which is equal to
4:30
500 + 600 which is equal to 1,100.
4:35
That would correspond, this right over here,
4:39
would correspond to; so 1,000,
4:42
so this might be 1,000 on this axis
4:44
so this would be 1,100 to this point right over here.
4:47
That would be the coordinate: 1,000; 1,100.
4:54
This is a line.
4:55
Two points make a line.
4:56
In this particular case we have
5:01
a consumption function that looks
5:03
something like this.
5:06
We picked two points to draw it.
5:07
If you remember a little bit of your slope,
5:08
you could view this as your y intercept,
5:11
or in this case your c intercept,
5:13
and that your slope would be the .6,
5:15
and we'll talk more about that in future videos
5:17
when we dig into the marginal propensity
5:18
to consume a little bit more.
5:20
But the one thing I just want to highlight
5:22
is it's a very simple idea.
5:23
This does not have to be the consumption function.
5:26
The consumption functions that we tend to study
5:28
in introductory economics classes will look like this.
5:31
It will be a line that has some intersection,
5:33
some base level of consumption.
5:34
But one could argue it might be very different.
5:36
Maybe the consumption function looks like this.
5:39
Maybe when income is low,
5:41
for every incremental dollar of income,
5:44
people are probably going to spend a lot.
5:47
As they become richer and richer and richer,
5:49
as their income goes higher and higher,
5:51
they're going to spend less and less
5:52
a fraction of their disposable income.
5:54
Essentially what I'm describing here
5:56
is a marginal propensity to consume changes.
5:58
In our first model, we had a very basic
6:00
marginal propensity to consume.
6:02
It was constant.
6:03
For every incremental dollar, .6 of that got spent.
6:07
So we had a marginal propensity to consume
6:09
that was constant of 0.6.
6:13
Marginal propensity to consume.
6:15
But, you could argue, that maybe a more
6:16
complex model is justified.
6:18
That when you have a very high marginal
6:20
propensity to consume, when people have very little
6:23
because they have a very low standard of living,
6:25
they really want to just get a little bit more
6:27
just so they can live a decent life,
6:29
but as they get more and more income they say,
6:31
""Hey, I'm starting to max out my standard of living,
6:34
""I'll save more and more of it for a rainy day.""",Is induced spending related to the consumption function?

We could have a debate about what the most interesting cell
0:03
in the human body is, but I think easily the neuron would
0:07
make the top five, and it's not just because the cell
0:10
itself is interesting.
0:11
The fact that it essentially makes up our brain and our
0:14
nervous system and is responsible for the thoughts
0:17
and our feelings and maybe for all of our sentience, I think,
0:22
would easily make it the top one or two cells.
0:24
So what I want to do is first to show you what a neuron
0:26
looks like.
0:27
And, of course, this is kind of the perfect example.
0:30
This isn't what all neurons look like.
0:31
And then we're going to talk a little bit about how it
0:33
performs its function, which is essentially communication,
0:37
essentially transmitting signals across its length,
0:40
depending on the signals it receives.
0:43
So if I were to draw a neuron-- let me
0:45
pick a better color.
0:50
So let's say I have a neuron.
0:52
It looks something like this.
0:53
So in the middle you have your soma and then from the soma--
0:57
let me draw the nucleus.
1:00
This is a nucleus, just like any cell's nucleus.
1:03
And then the soma's considered the body of the neuron and
1:07
then the neuron has these little things sticking out
1:09
from it that keep branching off.
1:13
Maybe they look something like this.
1:16
I don't want to spend too much time just drawing the neuron,
1:18
but you've probably seen drawings like this before.
1:23
And these branches off of the soma of the neuron, off of its
1:27
body, these are called dendrites.
1:32
They can keep splitting off like that.
1:34
I want to do a fairly reasonable drawing so I'll
1:36
spend a little time doing that.
1:43
So these right here, these are dendrites.
1:46
And these tend to be-- and nothing is
1:48
always the case in biology.
1:49
Sometimes different parts of different cells perform other
1:53
functions, but these tend to be where the neuron receives
1:56
its signal.
1:58
And we'll talk more about what it means to receive and
2:01
transmit a signal in this video and
2:03
probably in the next few.
2:04
So this is where it receives the signal.
2:09
So this is the dendrite.
2:11
This right here is the soma.
2:13
Soma means body.
2:14
This is the body of the neuron.
2:17
And then we have kind of a-- you can almost view it as a
2:20
tail of the neuron.
2:22
It's called the axon.
2:26
A neuron can be a reasonably normal sized cell, although
2:29
there is a huge range, but the axons can be quite long.
2:32
They could be short.
2:33
Sometimes in the brain you might have very small axons,
2:36
but you might have axons that go down the spinal column or
2:39
that go along one of your limbs-- or if you're talking
2:42
about one of a dinosaur's limbs.
2:44
So the axon can actually stretch several feet.
2:47
Not all neurons' axons are several feet,
2:49
but they could be.
2:50
And this is really where a lot of the distance of the signal
2:53
gets traveled.
2:55
Let me draw the axon.
2:58
So the axon will look something like this.
3:01
And at the end, it ends at the axon terminal where it can
3:06
connect to other dendrites or maybe to other types of tissue
3:10
or muscle if the point of this neuron is to tell a muscle to
3:13
do something.
3:14
So at the end of the axon, you have the axon
3:16
terminal right there.
3:19
I'll do my best to draw it like that.
3:22
Let me label it.
3:22
So this is the axon.
3:25
This is the axon terminal.
3:29
And you'll sometimes hear the word-- the point at which the
3:33
soma or the body of the neuron connects to the axon is as
3:36
often referred to as the axon hillock-- maybe you can kind
3:39
of view it as kind of a lump.
3:40
It starts to form the axon.
3:46
And then we're going to talk about how the impulses travel.
3:54
And a huge part in what allows them to travel efficiently are
3:58
these insulating cells around the axon.
4:04
We're going to talk about this in detail and how they
4:06
actually work, but it's good just to have the anatomical
4:09
structure first. So these are called Schwann cells and
4:17
they're covering-- they make up the myelin sheath.
4:20
So this covering, this insulation, at different
4:23
intervals around the axon, this is
4:24
called the myelin sheath.
4:26
So Schwann cells make up the myelin sheath.
4:29
I'll do one more just like that.
4:40
And then these little spaces between the myelin sheath--
4:42
just so we have all of the terminology from-- so we know
4:46
the entire anatomy of the neuron-- these are called the
4:50
nodes of Ranvier.
4:56
I guess they're named after Ranvier.
4:57
Maybe he was the guy who looked and saw they had these
4:59
little slots here where you don't have myelin sheath.
5:02
So these are the nodes of Ranvier.
5:05
So the general idea, as I mentioned, is that you get a
5:07
signal here.
5:08
We're going to talk more about what the signal means-- and
5:11
then that signal gets-- actually, the signals can be
5:13
summed, so you might have one little signal right there,
5:16
another signal right there, and then you'll have maybe a
5:19
larger signal there and there-- and that the combined
5:23
effects of these signals get summed up and they travel to
5:26
the hillock and if they're a large enough, they're going to
5:30
trigger an action potential on the axon, which will cause a
5:34
signal to travel down the balance of the axon and then
5:38
over here it might be connected via synapses to
5:42
other dendrites or muscles.
5:44
And we'll talk more about synapses and those might help
5:46
trigger other things.
5:47
So you're saying, what's triggering these things here?
5:49
Well, this could be the terminal end of other neurons'
5:54
axons, like in the brain.
5:57
This could be some type of sensory neuron.
5:58
This could be on a taste bud someplace, so a salt molecule
6:02
somehow can trigger it or a sugar molecule-- or this might
6:06
be some type of sensor.
6:07
It could be a whole bunch of different things and we'll
6:09
talk more about the different types of neurons.","Why does he call the myelin sheath ""schwann cells""?"
khan_video_opEy6iN9kqc_88171,Math,MCQ,"•
0:00
I think a little bit of a review is in order now and
0:03
maybe just taking a little bit of a step back to say well,
0:05
why does a company even raise equity?
0:08
And why do the people who buy the equity even do it in the
0:11
first place?
0:12
So the whole idea of what we were doing in the last several
0:15
videos is that a company wants to raise money to start a
0:23
website, or build a factory, or do whatever else-- kind of
0:25
invest in the world and in its kind of productive capacity,
0:28
so it can build the things that the
0:30
company is meant to build.
0:31
And in every example so far-- we have the example where me
0:34
and my buddies, we have just a business
0:37
plan, that's the asset.
0:39
And then we own all the equity.
0:42
We're the board of directors initially.
0:44
So that's all the equity.
0:46
So let's call this the assets right now.
0:50
This is the equity.
0:52
And we could go to a venture capitalist-- it could have
0:53
been an angel investor.
0:54
It could have been-- we talked about Series A,
0:57
Series B, all of that.
0:59
And we could say OK, we need to raise x million dollars.
1:03
What percentage of your company do we have to give
1:06
away for that?
1:07
And it'll say OK, well we'll value what you have right
1:10
now-- I'll do a different number than what I did in the
1:12
past-- we'll value what you have right now as $1 million.
1:16
And so, if you need another $2 million-- so let's say we
1:20
value what you have right now as $1 million.
1:22
Let's say right now you have one million shares.
1:28
So the company's pre-money valuation is $1 million.
1:30
So you are essentially saying that the company right now is
1:34
worth a dollar per share.
1:34
There's $1 million worth of assets, and there's a million
1:37
shares, so a million divided by a million is $1 per share.
1:40
So they're valuing it at $1 per share.
1:44
And essentially they're saying that we're willing to give
1:46
you, or we're willing to buy more shares from you at $1.
1:50
So, if we give you-- let me see, let me do green, I'll do
1:55
a different color, I'll do purple-- we'll give you-- draw
1:59
the box-- we'll give you, I don't know, $2 million.
2:10
And since we're buying it at $1 per share, we get two
2:12
million shares for that.
2:18
And now all of this is the equity.
2:21
This is what the founders had, and this is all the equity.
2:24
And so now the company has what we say was worth a
2:28
million dollars.
2:28
And this is kind of an arbitrary thing, and we'll
2:30
talk more about how you can actually value these
2:32
intangible assets and things.
2:34
But now they had that, and now they have another $2 million.
2:36
So the post-money valuation-- pre-money was $1 million--
2:38
post-money is now $2 million.
2:41
And now, we had one million shares, now we have three
2:43
million shares.
2:44
So essentially, for giving $2 million, these venture
2:48
capitalists, or whoever-- so these shares go to some VC or
2:50
angel investor-- they have now 2/3 of the company.
2:54
They have two out of three million shares, or 66% of the
2:56
company for giving the $2 million.
2:58
So that was kind of a private raise of capital.
3:01
And so you've probably heard the words private company and
3:04
public company.
3:05
A private company is one whose shares are not traded on a
3:08
public exchange.
3:10
So if this company wants to raise money by selling equity,
3:14
the only place it can do it is to venture capitalists or to
3:16
private equity firms. And we'll talk a little bit more
3:18
about kind of the difference.
3:20
A venture capitalist really is a private equity firm because
3:22
it's buying private equity.
3:23
But private equity tends to invest in more established
3:26
business, when people just talk about
3:27
private equity by itself.
3:28
But we'll do several videos on that.
3:31
So this is, essentially, this company is a private company
3:33
raising private equity.
3:35
Now, the example we did in the last video is, let's say this
3:39
company grows to a certain size.
3:40
Let me just do another company so it's clean.
3:43
Let's say I have another company, these are its assets.
3:48
And this is its-- let me draw its current
3:50
equity base right there.
3:55
They should be the same size, but you get the idea-- and
3:58
these assets, it could be it has some cash.
4:02
It has some factories or land.
4:05
It could have a bunch of stuff.
4:06
It could have some technology, or we could have some
4:08
intellectual property.
4:10
Maybe it's a drug company, or maybe it's
4:12
a technology company.
4:12
It has a bunch of patents and stuff.
4:14
And then it has some intangibles-- a brand-- who
4:16
knows what it has.
4:17
These are the assets of the firm.
4:18
This is the equity of the firm.
4:19
So this company right now has no debt.
4:21
And we'll talk about that in a second, what it
4:22
means to have debt.
4:26
And this is its current shareholder base, maybe some
4:28
of these are some VCs who invested in the company when
4:31
it was private.
4:32
Maybe the founder has these shares.
4:34
But this is the equity base right here.
4:36
And let's say this company wants to raise a lot of money,
4:39
and as just kind of a review of the last video, it can do
4:41
an initial public offering.
4:42
So right now it's private.
4:44
All of these shares right now that are owned by the VCs and
4:50
the initial founders of the company, they are not traded
4:53
on a public exchange.
4:54
This VC can't go to the NASDAQ and sell their shares.
4:57
They can't go to the broker and say hey, sell my million
4:59
shares I have in Company X.
5:01
They have to just sit on them.
5:02
Maybe they can find another private equity investor to buy
5:05
their shares, or maybe these founders-- there's no
5:08
liquidity here.
5:09
There's no other person they can sell the shares to.
5:12
And also, if this company wants to raise money right now
5:14
it has to kind of go to a VC and do the whole process where
5:18
you negotiate what this value is-- what the
5:20
pre-money value is.
5:21
And they have to come up with all these legal documents, and
5:24
all of these stipulations around, we'll give you this
5:28
money, but if this happens, then you have to give us this
5:30
interest rate.
5:30
And just all these type of things.
5:33
So, what they might want to say is, we need to
5:35
raise a lot of money.
5:36
All of these guys want a way for them to be able to sell
5:39
their shares easily if they need to.
5:41
And this company says well, we need to raise a ton of money.
5:44
Let's say we want to raise $100 million.
5:46
And that's hard to raise from just any one individual
5:48
investor, even if they are a big institution.
5:51
So they'll do an initial public offering, and that
5:53
really just means and-- the IPO, and this is review of the
5:56
last one-- is that for the first time this company is
5:59
going to register its shares with the SEC, and because it
6:04
does, it's going to list its shares on an exchange.
6:06
It will get a ticker symbol, it will maybe be company--
6:09
this'll be its ticker, T-I-C-K, or in the last video
6:13
could be SOCKS, because it's going to sell socks.
6:16
And then people can trade these shares on that exchange.
6:20
It could be on the NASDAQ or something.
6:22
And I think some of you all have had experience doing that
6:25
where you go on your Charles Schwab account and you say I'm
6:28
going to sell SOCK.
6:29
Well, that company that you're selling, at some point, did an
6:32
initial public offering, and registered with the SEC, and
6:35
got listed on an exchange.
6:37
And the way it really works is, it's fundamentally the
6:40
same as when you raise money from a VC.
6:42
But now, instead of raising money from a VC, all the money
6:48
comes from, essentially, the public.
6:52
It goes through these banks and brokerages, but it's
6:54
coming from a bunch of small-- I'm just
6:57
divvying it up right here.
6:58
It could be coming from millions
7:00
and millions of people.
7:01
But the same process kind of holds.
7:03
In order to see what price these shares are bought at,
7:07
someone has to say well, what is the company worth before it
7:09
gets the money?
7:11
What is the company worth before it gets this money?
7:13
Kind of a pre-money valuation.
7:14
That still has to happen, and that's what the
7:16
investment bank does.
7:17
The investment bank will essentially do a model and
7:19
they'll say oh, this is worth-- the company beforehand
7:22
was worth $50 million.
7:27
They'll kind of go out into the market to say well, our--
7:29
and let's say the company right now has
7:33
five million shares.
7:35
So that this piece right here is five million.
7:38
So if the banks value the company at $50 million, and it
7:41
has five million shares, they'll say OK, right now, the
7:43
pre-money valuation is $10 a share.
7:46
And the bank will go out there.
7:47
It'll kind of gauge interest and say well, does it seem
7:50
like the market's willing to pay $10 a share for a
7:53
company like this?
7:53
Or give this company a $50 million pre-money valuation?
7:59
And if so, they'll move forth with the IPO.
8:02
And, hopefully, the market actually wants to
8:05
not pay $10 per share.
8:06
The market maybe wants to pay $20 a share.
8:08
So all of these guys, let's say they'll pay $10 a share,
8:12
so let's say that they sell 10 million shares at $10 a share.
8:18
So the company is able to raise $100 million.
8:21
10 times $10, $100 million.
8:24
Then they can do big ads and all of that.
8:27
And what the bank hopes is by selling these shares at $10 a
8:31
share-- so let's say this is days, and this is price.
8:38
Let me change colors-- so what the investment bank wants to
8:42
hope is that, on day one, you sell it at $10 a share, and
8:45
then the price moves up.
8:46
That the demand was actually to sell it for much more.
8:48
And there's a bit of a balancing act, because if they
8:50
sell for too little, then the company won't get as much
8:51
money as it deserves.
8:53
But if they sell for too much, then the stock price goes
8:55
down, then you kind of have a stigma
8:57
associated with the IPO.
8:59
But anyway, this begs the question of sure, I understand
9:02
why the company is selling shares.
9:04
It needs money.
9:04
It needs to operate.
9:06
It needs to build factories or put out
9:07
advertising, and all that.
9:08
But why are people buying shares to begin with?
9:10
Why do people buy shares in the stock market?
9:13
And frankly, there's two answers.
9:15
And one is kind of the obvious one, because they think the
9:17
shares will go up.
9:18
But to some degree, that's speculation.
9:21
If I'm buying a share at $10, just because I'm hoping that
9:24
there's some other dude out there who, maybe a few weeks
9:27
later, is going to pay $15, I'm just speculating.
9:30
I'm just saying oh, IPOs go up so let me buy it.
9:31
But, economically, why was this even worth
9:36
$10 to begin with?
9:38
How do we even think about that valuation, at a very even
9:41
high level, why is this even worth $10 a
9:43
share to begin with?
9:44
And the idea is that these assets-- assets are nothing
9:48
but claims on future benefits, right?
9:51
A house is an asset because you get the future benefit of
9:55
getting to live in it, right?
9:56
Or the future benefit of not having to pay rent.
9:59
So, the future benefit of these is, they'll hopefully,
10:02
at some point in the future, generate an income stream.
10:05
And even more, they'll generate cash.
10:07
And at some point in the future, and a lot of companies
10:09
don't do it right now, they'll actually
10:11
dividend out that cash.
10:12
So there's a couple of things that will make this equity
10:17
have kind of an economic-- it'll ground it economically.
10:20
And it could be these assets starting to pump out cash, and
10:23
then each of the shareholders will get a dividend.
10:28
A dividend is just cash that is given to the shareholders.
10:30
So let's say that this is a stock certificate in SOCK.
10:34
So at some point when the assets of this company start
10:38
generating cash, each of the shareholders might be getting
10:40
a dividend.
10:41
Or maybe a large company, at some future date, says wow,
10:45
this is an awesome technology.
10:47
It'll complement what we already have. And maybe
10:49
they'll buy out the company.
10:50
Maybe they'll pay $300 million for this company.
10:55
And then, essentially, they're paying $300 million-- and
10:59
there's, what, fifteen million shares?
11:00
So they're paying $20 a share.
11:02
So those are the economic kind of grounding points that why
11:05
these shares even have a value.
11:07
And I'll go into a lot more detail, I'll do a whole
11:09
playlist on how do you even think about whether this is
11:13
worth $50 million, or is it worth $5 million, or is it
11:16
worth $500 million.
11:17
And it's kind of an art, more than a science, because you're
11:21
going to make tons of assumptions in terms of how
11:23
fast the company grows, what's the risk free rate of return
11:27
that you could get on other assets?
11:29
Essentially, where else you could you put your money?
11:31
When does the company dividend out its-- there's so many
11:34
assumptions, so it's more of an art.
11:35
So it's really kind of you try to get a handle on things.
11:38
But there's no real right answer.
11:40
The real right answer is kind of what someone's willing to
11:42
pay for it.
11:43
But anyway, I'll see you in the next video.",Do angels ever arrange to receive a percentage of net profits?

I think we're all reasonably familiar with the three states
0:03
of matter in our everyday world.
0:05
At very high temperatures you get a fourth.
0:07
But the three ones that we normally deal with are, things
0:10
could be a solid, a liquid, or it could be a gas.
0:22
And we have this general notion, and I think water is
0:25
the example that always comes to at least my mind.
0:29
Is that solid happens when things are
0:30
colder, relatively colder.
0:33
And then as you warm up, you go into a liquid state.
0:37
And as your warm up even more you go into a gaseous state.
0:40
So you go from colder to hotter.
0:44
And in the case of water, when you're a solid, you're ice.
0:51
When you're a liquid, some people would call ice water,
0:55
but let's call it liquid water.
0:58
I think we know what that is.
1:01
And then when it's in the gas state, you're essentially
1:04
vapor or steam.
1:12
So let's think a little bit about what, at least in the
1:14
case of water, and the analogy will extend to
1:17
other types of molecules.
1:19
But what is it about water that makes it solid, and when
1:22
it's colder, what allows it to be liquid.
1:24
And I'll be frank, liquids are kind of fascinating because
1:28
you can never nail them down, I guess is the
1:31
best way to view them.
1:32
Or a gas.
1:34
So let's just draw a water molecule.
1:39
So you have oxygen there.
1:42
You have some bonds to hydrogen.
1:47
And then you have two extra pairs of valence electrons in
1:50
the oxygen.
1:51
And a couple of videos ago, we said oxygen is a lot more
1:55
electronegative than the hydrogen.
1:58
It likes to hog the electrons.
2:00
So even though this shows that they're sharing
2:04
electrons here and here.
2:06
At both sides of those lines, you can kind of view that
2:08
hydrogen is contributing an electron and oxygen is
2:10
contributing an electron on both sides of that line.
2:13
But we know because of the electronegativity, or the
2:15
relative electronegativity of oxygen, that it's hogging
2:18
these electrons.
2:19
And so the electrons spend a lot more time around the
2:22
oxygen than they do around the hydrogen.
2:24
And what that results is that on the oxygen side of the
2:27
molecule, you end up with a partial negative charge.
2:32
And we talked about that a little bit.
2:33
And on the hydrogen side of the molecules, you end up with
2:35
a slightly positive charge.
2:44
Now, if these molecules have very little kinetic energy,
2:51
they're not moving around a whole lot, then the positive
2:56
sides of the hydrogens are very attracted to the negative
2:59
sides of oxygen in other molecules.
3:03
Let me draw some more molecules.
3:04
When we talk about the whole state of the whole matter, we
3:06
actually think about how the molecules are interacting with
3:10
each other.
3:10
Not just how the atoms are interacting with each other
3:13
within a molecule.
3:16
I just drew one oxygen, let me copy and paste that.
3:20
But I could do multiple oxygens.
3:22
And let's say that that hydrogen is going to want to
3:26
be near this oxygen.
3:28
Because this has partial negative charge, this has a
3:30
partial positive charge.
3:32
And then I could do another one right there.
3:37
And then maybe we'll have, and just to make the point clear,
3:40
you have two hydrogens here, maybe an oxygen
3:43
wants to hang out there.
3:45
So maybe you have an oxygen that wants to be here because
3:49
it's got its partial negative here.
3:52
And it's connected to two hydrogens right there that
3:55
have their partial positives.
3:57
But you can kind of see a lattice structure.
4:00
Let me draw these bonds, these polar bonds that start forming
4:05
between the particles.
4:08
These bonds, they're called polar bonds because the
4:10
molecules themselves are polar.
4:14
And you can see it forms this lattice structure.
4:16
And if each of these molecules don't have a
4:19
lot of kinetic energy.
4:21
Or we could say the average kinetic energy of this matter
4:26
is fairly low.
4:27
And what do we know is average kinetic energy?
4:29
Well, that's temperature.
4:30
Then this lattice structure will be solid.
4:33
These molecules will not move relative to each other.
4:37
I could draw a gazillion more, but I think you get the point
4:40
that we're forming this kind of fixed structure.
4:44
And while we're in the solid state, as we add kinetic
4:48
energy, as we add heat, what it does to molecules is, it
4:52
just makes them vibrate around a little bit.
4:57
If I was a cartoonist, they way you'd draw a vibration is
4:59
to put quotation marks there.
5:01
That's not very scientific.
5:03
But they would vibrate around, they would buzz around a
5:05
little bit.
5:06
I'm drawing arrows to show that they are vibrating.
5:08
It doesn't have to be just
5:09
left-right it could be up-down.
5:10
But as you add more and more heat in a solid, these
5:14
molecules are going to keep their structure.
5:16
So they're not going to move around relative to each other.
5:19
But they will convert that heat, and heat is just a form
5:23
of energy, into kinetic energy which is expressed as the
5:27
vibration of these molecules.
5:29
Now, if you make these molecules start to vibrate
5:33
enough, and if you put enough kinetic energy into these
5:35
molecules, what do you think is going to happen?
5:37
Well this guy is vibrating pretty hard, and he's
5:39
vibrating harder and harder as you add more and more heat.
5:42
This guy is doing the same thing.
5:43
At some point, these polar bonds that they have to each
5:46
other are going to start not being strong enough to contain
5:50
the vibrations.
5:52
And once that happens, the molecules-- let me draw a
5:57
couple more.
5:58
Once that happens, the molecules are going to start
6:01
moving past each other.
6:07
So now all of a sudden, the molecule will start shifting.
6:13
But they're still attracted.
6:14
Maybe this side is moving here, that's moving there.
6:17
You have other molecules moving around that way.
6:19
But they're still attracted to each other.
6:22
Even though we've gotten the kinetic energy to the point
6:25
that the vibrations can kind of break the bonds between the
6:31
polar sides of the molecules.
6:34
Our vibration, or our kinetic energy for each molecule,
6:38
still isn't strong enough to completely separate them.
6:40
They're starting to slide past each other.
6:43
And this is essentially what happens when you're in a
6:44
liquid state.
6:46
You have a lot of atoms that want be touching each other
6:49
but they're sliding.
6:50
They have enough kinetic energy to slide past each
6:53
other and break that solid lattice structure here.
6:57
And then if you add even more kinetic energy, even more
7:00
heat, at this point it's a solution now.
7:05
They're not even going to be able to stay together.
7:07
They're not going to be able to stay near each other.
7:08
If you add enough kinetic energy they're going to start
7:11
looking like this.
7:12
They're going to completely separate and then kind of
7:15
bounce around independently.
7:17
Especially independently if they're an ideal gas.
7:19
But in general, in gases, they're no longer touching
7:22
each other.
7:22
They might bump into each other.
7:25
But they have so much kinetic energy on their own that
7:28
they're all doing their own thing
7:29
and they're not touching.
7:31
I think that makes intuitive sense if you just think about
7:33
what a gas is.
7:36
For example, it's hard to see a gas.
7:37
Why is it hard to see a gas?
7:39
Because the molecules are much further apart.
7:41
So they're not acting on the light in the way that a liquid
7:46
or a solid would.
7:47
And if we keep making that extended further, a solid--
7:50
well, I probably shouldn't use the example with ice.
7:53
Because ice or water is one of the few situations where the
7:56
solid is less dense than the liquid.
7:58
That's why ice floats.
8:00
And that's why icebergs don't just all fall to the
8:02
bottom of the ocean.
8:03
And ponds don't completely freeze solid.
8:07
But you can imagine that, because a liquid is in most
8:11
cases other than water, less dense.
8:13
That's another reason why you can see through it a little
8:15
bit better.
8:15
Or it's not diffracting-- well I won't go into that too much,
8:18
than maybe even a solid.
8:20
But the gas is the most obvious.
8:21
And it is true with water.
8:23
The liquid form is definitely more dense than the gas form.
8:27
In the gas form, the molecules are going to jump around, not
8:31
touch each other.
8:32
And because of that, more light can
8:35
get through the substance.
8:37
Now the question is, how do we measure the amount of heat
8:40
that it takes to do this to water?
8:44
And to explain that, I'll actually draw a
8:47
phase change diagram.
8:49
Which is a fancy way of describing something fairly
8:53
straightforward.
8:54
Let me say that this is the amount of heat I'm adding.
8:57
And this is the temperature.
8:59
We'll talk about the states of matter in a second.
9:02
So heat is often denoted by q.
9:06
Sometimes people will talk about change in heat.
9:09
They'll use H, lowercase and uppercase H.
9:11
They'll put a delta in front of the H.
9:13
Delta just means change in.
9:15
And sometimes you'll hear the word enthalpy.
9:17
Let me write that.
9:18
Because I used to say what is enthalpy?
9:26
It sounds like empathy, but it's
9:29
quite a different concept.
9:30
At least, as far as my neural connections could make it.
9:33
But enthalpy is closely related to heat.
9:36
It's heat content.
9:45
For our purposes, when you hear someone say change in
9:49
enthalpy, you should really just be thinking
9:51
of change in heat.
9:52
I think this word was really just introduced to confuse
9:56
chemistry students and introduce a non-intuitive word
10:00
into their vocabulary.
10:02
The best way to think about it is heat content.
10:04
Change in enthalpy is really just change in heat.
10:07
And just remember, all of these things, whether we're
10:09
talking about heat, kinetic energy,
10:13
potential energy, enthalpy.
10:16
You'll hear them in different contexts, and you're like, I
10:18
thought I should be using heat and they're
10:19
talking about enthalpy.
10:21
These are all forms of energy.
10:23
And these are all measured in joules.
10:26
And they might be measured in other ways, but the
10:28
traditional way is in joules.
10:29
And energy is the ability to do work.
10:31
And what's the unit for work?
10:33
Well, it's joules.
10:34
Force times distance.
10:35
But anyway, that's a side-note.
10:37
But it's good to know this word enthalpy.
10:38
Especially in a chemistry context, because it's used all
10:40
the time and it can be very confusing and non-intuitive.
10:43
Because you're like, I don't know what enthalpy is in my
10:46
everyday life.
10:47
Just think of it as heat contact, because that's really
10:50
what it is.
10:50
But anyway, on this axis, I have heat.
10:55
So this is when I have very little heat and I'm
10:57
increasing my heat.
10:58
And this is temperature.
11:05
Now let's say at low temperatures I'm here and as I
11:09
add heat my temperature will go up.
11:12
Temperature is average kinetic energy.
11:14
Let's say I'm in the solid state here.
11:16
And I'll do the solid state in purple.
11:21
No I already was using purple.
11:23
I'll use magenta.
11:26
So as I add heat, my temperature will go up.
11:29
Heat is a form of energy.
11:31
And when I add it to these molecules, as I did in this
11:36
example, what did it do?
11:37
It made them vibrate more.
11:38
Or it made them have higher kinetic energy, or higher
11:41
average kinetic engery, and that's what temperature is a
11:43
measure of; average kinetic energy.
11:46
So as I add heat in the solid phase, my average kinetic
11:50
energy will go up.
11:51
And let me write this down.
11:52
This is in the solid phase, or the solid state of matter.
11:58
Now something very interesting happens.
12:01
Let's say this is water.
12:03
So what happens at zero degrees?
12:09
Which is also 273.15 Kelvin.
12:14
Let's say that's that line.
12:15
What happens to a solid?
12:18
Well, it turns into a liquid.
12:19
Ice melts.
12:20
Not all solids, we're talking in particular about
12:22
water, about H2O.
12:25
So this is ice in our example.
12:27
All solids aren't ice.
12:29
Although, you could think of a rock as solid magma.
12:33
Because that's what it is.
12:38
I could take that analogy a bunch of different ways.
12:41
But the interesting thing that happens at zero degrees.
12:49
Depending on what direction you're going, either the
12:51
freezing point of water or the melting point of ice,
12:53
something interesting happens.
12:55
As I add more heat, the temperature does not to go up.
13:00
As I add more heat, the temperature does not go up for
13:03
a little period.
13:05
Let me draw that.
13:07
For a little period, the temperature stays constant.
13:10
And then while the temperature is constant, it stays a solid.
13:14
We're still a solid.
13:16
And then, we finally turn into a liquid.
13:22
Let's say right there.
13:23
So we added a certain amount of heat and it
13:25
just stayed a solid.
13:26
But it got us to the point that the ice
13:28
turned into a liquid.
13:29
It was kind of melting the entire time.
13:31
That's the best way to think about it.
13:32
And then, once we keep adding more and more heat, then the
13:36
liquid warms up too.
13:42
Now, we get to, what temperature becomes
13:45
interesting again for water?
13:46
Well, obviously 100 degrees Celsius or 373 degrees Kelvin.
13:56
I'll do it in Celsius because that's what
13:57
we're familiar with.
13:59
What happens?
13:59
That's the temperature at which water will vaporize or
14:03
which water will boil.
14:05
But something happens.
14:07
And they're really getting kinetically active.
14:13
But just like when you went from solid to liquid, there's
14:16
a certain amount of energy that you have to contribute to
14:19
the system.
14:20
And actually, it's a good amount at this point.
14:23
Where the water is turning into vapor, but it's not
14:26
getting any hotter.
14:31
So we have to keep adding heat, but notice that the
14:34
temperature didn't go up.
14:35
We'll talk about it in a second what
14:37
was happening then.
14:38
And then finally, after that point, we're completely
14:43
vaporized, or we're completely steam.
14:46
Then we can start getting hot, the steam can then get hotter
14:48
as we add more and more heat to the system.
14:53
So the interesting question, I think it's intuitive, that as
14:55
you add heat here, our temperature is going to go up.
15:01
But the interesting thing is, what was going on here?
15:03
We were adding heat.
15:04
So over here we were turning our heat into kinetic energy.
15:07
Temperature is average kinetic energy.
15:10
But over here, what was our heat doing?
15:12
Well, our heat was was not adding kinetic
15:15
energy to the system.
15:16
The temperature was not increasing.
15:17
But the ice was going from ice to water.
15:20
So what was happening at that state, is that the kinetic
15:24
energy, the heat, was being used to essentially break
15:29
these bonds.
15:32
And essentially bring the molecules into a
15:34
higher energy state.
15:35
So you're saying, Sal, what does that mean,
15:37
higher energy state?
15:38
Well, if there wasn't all of this heat and all this kinetic
15:42
energy, these molecules want to be very
15:44
close to each other.
15:46
For example, I want to be close to the
15:49
surface of the earth.
15:50
When you put me in a plane you have put me in a
15:52
higher energy state.
15:53
I have a lot more potential energy.
15:56
I have the potential to fall towards the earth.
15:58
Likewise, when you move these molecules apart, and you go
16:02
from a solid to a liquid, they want to fall
16:05
towards each other.
16:06
But because they have so much kinetic energy, they never
16:08
quite are able to do it.
16:10
But their energy goes up.
16:12
Their potential energy is higher because they want to
16:14
fall towards each other.
16:15
By falling towards each other, in theory, they
16:18
could do some work.
16:21
So what's happening here is, when we're contributing heat--
16:26
and this amount of heat we're contributing, it's called the
16:32
heat of fusion.
16:36
Because it's the same amount of heat regardless how much
16:39
direction we go in.
16:40
When we go from solid to liquid, you view it as the
16:43
heat of melting.
16:45
It's the head that you need to put in to melt
16:48
the ice into liquid.
16:49
When you're going in this direction, it's the heat you
16:51
have to take out of the zero degree water to
16:55
turn it into ice.
16:58
So you're taking that potential energy and you're
17:01
bringing the molecules closer and closer to each other.
17:05
So the way to think about it is, right here this heat is
17:08
being converted to kinetic energy.
17:10
Then, when we're at this phase change from solid to liquid,
17:15
that heat is being used to add potential
17:16
energy into the system.
17:18
To pull the molecules apart, to give them
17:21
more potential energy.
17:22
If you pull me apart from the earth, you're giving me
17:25
potential energy.
17:26
Because gravity wants to pull me back to the earth.
17:29
And I could do work when I'm falling back to the earth.
17:32
A waterfall does work.
17:33
It can move a turbine.
17:35
You could have a bunch of falling Sals move
17:37
a turbine as well.
17:39
And then, once you are fully a liquid, then you just become a
17:42
warmer and warmer liquid.
17:43
Now the heat is, once again, being used for kinetic energy.
17:48
You're making the water molecules move past each other
17:51
faster, and faster, and faster.
17:53
To some point where they want to completely disassociate
17:57
from each other.
17:58
They want to not even slide past each other, just
18:00
completely jump away from each other.
18:03
And that's right here.
18:04
This is the heat of vaporization.
18:13
And the same idea is happening.
18:15
Before we were sliding next to each other, now we're pulling
18:17
apart altogether.
18:19
So they could definitely fall closer together.
18:22
And then once we've added this much heat, now we're just
18:27
heating up the steam.
18:28
We're just heating up the gaseous water.
18:30
And it's just getting hotter and hotter and hotter.
18:33
But the interesting thing there, and I mean at least the
18:35
interesting thing to me when I first learned this, whenever I
18:41
think of zero degrees water I'll say, oh it must be ice.
18:43
But that's not necessarily the case.
18:45
If you start with water and you make it colder and colder
18:48
and colder to zero degrees, you're essentially taking heat
18:52
out of the water.
18:53
You can have zero degree water and it hasn't
18:57
turned into ice yet.
18:58
And likewise, you could have 100 degree water that hasn't
19:01
turned into steam yeat.
19:03
You have to add more energy.
19:04
You can also have 100 degree steam.
19:05
You can also have zero degree water.
19:08
Anyway, hopefully that gives you a little bit of intuition
19:10
of what the different states of matter are.
19:12
And in the next problem, we'll talk about how much heat
19:15
exactly it does take to move along this line.
19:18
And maybe we can solve some problems on how much ice we
19:21
might need to make our drink cool.",Why do the H atoms go lower than the O atom in a water molecule?

I think we're all reasonably familiar with the three states
0:03
of matter in our everyday world.
0:05
At very high temperatures you get a fourth.
0:07
But the three ones that we normally deal with are, things
0:10
could be a solid, a liquid, or it could be a gas.
0:22
And we have this general notion, and I think water is
0:25
the example that always comes to at least my mind.
0:29
Is that solid happens when things are
0:30
colder, relatively colder.
0:33
And then as you warm up, you go into a liquid state.
0:37
And as your warm up even more you go into a gaseous state.
0:40
So you go from colder to hotter.
0:44
And in the case of water, when you're a solid, you're ice.
0:51
When you're a liquid, some people would call ice water,
0:55
but let's call it liquid water.
0:58
I think we know what that is.
1:01
And then when it's in the gas state, you're essentially
1:04
vapor or steam.
1:12
So let's think a little bit about what, at least in the
1:14
case of water, and the analogy will extend to
1:17
other types of molecules.
1:19
But what is it about water that makes it solid, and when
1:22
it's colder, what allows it to be liquid.
1:24
And I'll be frank, liquids are kind of fascinating because
1:28
you can never nail them down, I guess is the
1:31
best way to view them.
1:32
Or a gas.
1:34
So let's just draw a water molecule.
1:39
So you have oxygen there.
1:42
You have some bonds to hydrogen.
1:47
And then you have two extra pairs of valence electrons in
1:50
the oxygen.
1:51
And a couple of videos ago, we said oxygen is a lot more
1:55
electronegative than the hydrogen.
1:58
It likes to hog the electrons.
2:00
So even though this shows that they're sharing
2:04
electrons here and here.
2:06
At both sides of those lines, you can kind of view that
2:08
hydrogen is contributing an electron and oxygen is
2:10
contributing an electron on both sides of that line.
2:13
But we know because of the electronegativity, or the
2:15
relative electronegativity of oxygen, that it's hogging
2:18
these electrons.
2:19
And so the electrons spend a lot more time around the
2:22
oxygen than they do around the hydrogen.
2:24
And what that results is that on the oxygen side of the
2:27
molecule, you end up with a partial negative charge.
2:32
And we talked about that a little bit.
2:33
And on the hydrogen side of the molecules, you end up with
2:35
a slightly positive charge.
2:44
Now, if these molecules have very little kinetic energy,
2:51
they're not moving around a whole lot, then the positive
2:56
sides of the hydrogens are very attracted to the negative
2:59
sides of oxygen in other molecules.
3:03
Let me draw some more molecules.
3:04
When we talk about the whole state of the whole matter, we
3:06
actually think about how the molecules are interacting with
3:10
each other.
3:10
Not just how the atoms are interacting with each other
3:13
within a molecule.
3:16
I just drew one oxygen, let me copy and paste that.
3:20
But I could do multiple oxygens.
3:22
And let's say that that hydrogen is going to want to
3:26
be near this oxygen.
3:28
Because this has partial negative charge, this has a
3:30
partial positive charge.
3:32
And then I could do another one right there.
3:37
And then maybe we'll have, and just to make the point clear,
3:40
you have two hydrogens here, maybe an oxygen
3:43
wants to hang out there.
3:45
So maybe you have an oxygen that wants to be here because
3:49
it's got its partial negative here.
3:52
And it's connected to two hydrogens right there that
3:55
have their partial positives.
3:57
But you can kind of see a lattice structure.
4:00
Let me draw these bonds, these polar bonds that start forming
4:05
between the particles.
4:08
These bonds, they're called polar bonds because the
4:10
molecules themselves are polar.
4:14
And you can see it forms this lattice structure.
4:16
And if each of these molecules don't have a
4:19
lot of kinetic energy.
4:21
Or we could say the average kinetic energy of this matter
4:26
is fairly low.
4:27
And what do we know is average kinetic energy?
4:29
Well, that's temperature.
4:30
Then this lattice structure will be solid.
4:33
These molecules will not move relative to each other.
4:37
I could draw a gazillion more, but I think you get the point
4:40
that we're forming this kind of fixed structure.
4:44
And while we're in the solid state, as we add kinetic
4:48
energy, as we add heat, what it does to molecules is, it
4:52
just makes them vibrate around a little bit.
4:57
If I was a cartoonist, they way you'd draw a vibration is
4:59
to put quotation marks there.
5:01
That's not very scientific.
5:03
But they would vibrate around, they would buzz around a
5:05
little bit.
5:06
I'm drawing arrows to show that they are vibrating.
5:08
It doesn't have to be just
5:09
left-right it could be up-down.
5:10
But as you add more and more heat in a solid, these
5:14
molecules are going to keep their structure.
5:16
So they're not going to move around relative to each other.
5:19
But they will convert that heat, and heat is just a form
5:23
of energy, into kinetic energy which is expressed as the
5:27
vibration of these molecules.
5:29
Now, if you make these molecules start to vibrate
5:33
enough, and if you put enough kinetic energy into these
5:35
molecules, what do you think is going to happen?
5:37
Well this guy is vibrating pretty hard, and he's
5:39
vibrating harder and harder as you add more and more heat.
5:42
This guy is doing the same thing.
5:43
At some point, these polar bonds that they have to each
5:46
other are going to start not being strong enough to contain
5:50
the vibrations.
5:52
And once that happens, the molecules-- let me draw a
5:57
couple more.
5:58
Once that happens, the molecules are going to start
6:01
moving past each other.
6:07
So now all of a sudden, the molecule will start shifting.
6:13
But they're still attracted.
6:14
Maybe this side is moving here, that's moving there.
6:17
You have other molecules moving around that way.
6:19
But they're still attracted to each other.
6:22
Even though we've gotten the kinetic energy to the point
6:25
that the vibrations can kind of break the bonds between the
6:31
polar sides of the molecules.
6:34
Our vibration, or our kinetic energy for each molecule,
6:38
still isn't strong enough to completely separate them.
6:40
They're starting to slide past each other.
6:43
And this is essentially what happens when you're in a
6:44
liquid state.
6:46
You have a lot of atoms that want be touching each other
6:49
but they're sliding.
6:50
They have enough kinetic energy to slide past each
6:53
other and break that solid lattice structure here.
6:57
And then if you add even more kinetic energy, even more
7:00
heat, at this point it's a solution now.
7:05
They're not even going to be able to stay together.
7:07
They're not going to be able to stay near each other.
7:08
If you add enough kinetic energy they're going to start
7:11
looking like this.
7:12
They're going to completely separate and then kind of
7:15
bounce around independently.
7:17
Especially independently if they're an ideal gas.
7:19
But in general, in gases, they're no longer touching
7:22
each other.
7:22
They might bump into each other.
7:25
But they have so much kinetic energy on their own that
7:28
they're all doing their own thing
7:29
and they're not touching.
7:31
I think that makes intuitive sense if you just think about
7:33
what a gas is.
7:36
For example, it's hard to see a gas.
7:37
Why is it hard to see a gas?
7:39
Because the molecules are much further apart.
7:41
So they're not acting on the light in the way that a liquid
7:46
or a solid would.
7:47
And if we keep making that extended further, a solid--
7:50
well, I probably shouldn't use the example with ice.
7:53
Because ice or water is one of the few situations where the
7:56
solid is less dense than the liquid.
7:58
That's why ice floats.
8:00
And that's why icebergs don't just all fall to the
8:02
bottom of the ocean.
8:03
And ponds don't completely freeze solid.
8:07
But you can imagine that, because a liquid is in most
8:11
cases other than water, less dense.
8:13
That's another reason why you can see through it a little
8:15
bit better.
8:15
Or it's not diffracting-- well I won't go into that too much,
8:18
than maybe even a solid.
8:20
But the gas is the most obvious.
8:21
And it is true with water.
8:23
The liquid form is definitely more dense than the gas form.
8:27
In the gas form, the molecules are going to jump around, not
8:31
touch each other.
8:32
And because of that, more light can
8:35
get through the substance.
8:37
Now the question is, how do we measure the amount of heat
8:40
that it takes to do this to water?
8:44
And to explain that, I'll actually draw a
8:47
phase change diagram.
8:49
Which is a fancy way of describing something fairly
8:53
straightforward.
8:54
Let me say that this is the amount of heat I'm adding.
8:57
And this is the temperature.
8:59
We'll talk about the states of matter in a second.
9:02
So heat is often denoted by q.
9:06
Sometimes people will talk about change in heat.
9:09
They'll use H, lowercase and uppercase H.
9:11
They'll put a delta in front of the H.
9:13
Delta just means change in.
9:15
And sometimes you'll hear the word enthalpy.
9:17
Let me write that.
9:18
Because I used to say what is enthalpy?
9:26
It sounds like empathy, but it's
9:29
quite a different concept.
9:30
At least, as far as my neural connections could make it.
9:33
But enthalpy is closely related to heat.
9:36
It's heat content.
9:45
For our purposes, when you hear someone say change in
9:49
enthalpy, you should really just be thinking
9:51
of change in heat.
9:52
I think this word was really just introduced to confuse
9:56
chemistry students and introduce a non-intuitive word
10:00
into their vocabulary.
10:02
The best way to think about it is heat content.
10:04
Change in enthalpy is really just change in heat.
10:07
And just remember, all of these things, whether we're
10:09
talking about heat, kinetic energy,
10:13
potential energy, enthalpy.
10:16
You'll hear them in different contexts, and you're like, I
10:18
thought I should be using heat and they're
10:19
talking about enthalpy.
10:21
These are all forms of energy.
10:23
And these are all measured in joules.
10:26
And they might be measured in other ways, but the
10:28
traditional way is in joules.
10:29
And energy is the ability to do work.
10:31
And what's the unit for work?
10:33
Well, it's joules.
10:34
Force times distance.
10:35
But anyway, that's a side-note.
10:37
But it's good to know this word enthalpy.
10:38
Especially in a chemistry context, because it's used all
10:40
the time and it can be very confusing and non-intuitive.
10:43
Because you're like, I don't know what enthalpy is in my
10:46
everyday life.
10:47
Just think of it as heat contact, because that's really
10:50
what it is.
10:50
But anyway, on this axis, I have heat.
10:55
So this is when I have very little heat and I'm
10:57
increasing my heat.
10:58
And this is temperature.
11:05
Now let's say at low temperatures I'm here and as I
11:09
add heat my temperature will go up.
11:12
Temperature is average kinetic energy.
11:14
Let's say I'm in the solid state here.
11:16
And I'll do the solid state in purple.
11:21
No I already was using purple.
11:23
I'll use magenta.
11:26
So as I add heat, my temperature will go up.
11:29
Heat is a form of energy.
11:31
And when I add it to these molecules, as I did in this
11:36
example, what did it do?
11:37
It made them vibrate more.
11:38
Or it made them have higher kinetic energy, or higher
11:41
average kinetic engery, and that's what temperature is a
11:43
measure of; average kinetic energy.
11:46
So as I add heat in the solid phase, my average kinetic
11:50
energy will go up.
11:51
And let me write this down.
11:52
This is in the solid phase, or the solid state of matter.
11:58
Now something very interesting happens.
12:01
Let's say this is water.
12:03
So what happens at zero degrees?
12:09
Which is also 273.15 Kelvin.
12:14
Let's say that's that line.
12:15
What happens to a solid?
12:18
Well, it turns into a liquid.
12:19
Ice melts.
12:20
Not all solids, we're talking in particular about
12:22
water, about H2O.
12:25
So this is ice in our example.
12:27
All solids aren't ice.
12:29
Although, you could think of a rock as solid magma.
12:33
Because that's what it is.
12:38
I could take that analogy a bunch of different ways.
12:41
But the interesting thing that happens at zero degrees.
12:49
Depending on what direction you're going, either the
12:51
freezing point of water or the melting point of ice,
12:53
something interesting happens.
12:55
As I add more heat, the temperature does not to go up.
13:00
As I add more heat, the temperature does not go up for
13:03
a little period.
13:05
Let me draw that.
13:07
For a little period, the temperature stays constant.
13:10
And then while the temperature is constant, it stays a solid.
13:14
We're still a solid.
13:16
And then, we finally turn into a liquid.
13:22
Let's say right there.
13:23
So we added a certain amount of heat and it
13:25
just stayed a solid.
13:26
But it got us to the point that the ice
13:28
turned into a liquid.
13:29
It was kind of melting the entire time.
13:31
That's the best way to think about it.
13:32
And then, once we keep adding more and more heat, then the
13:36
liquid warms up too.
13:42
Now, we get to, what temperature becomes
13:45
interesting again for water?
13:46
Well, obviously 100 degrees Celsius or 373 degrees Kelvin.
13:56
I'll do it in Celsius because that's what
13:57
we're familiar with.
13:59
What happens?
13:59
That's the temperature at which water will vaporize or
14:03
which water will boil.
14:05
But something happens.
14:07
And they're really getting kinetically active.
14:13
But just like when you went from solid to liquid, there's
14:16
a certain amount of energy that you have to contribute to
14:19
the system.
14:20
And actually, it's a good amount at this point.
14:23
Where the water is turning into vapor, but it's not
14:26
getting any hotter.
14:31
So we have to keep adding heat, but notice that the
14:34
temperature didn't go up.
14:35
We'll talk about it in a second what
14:37
was happening then.
14:38
And then finally, after that point, we're completely
14:43
vaporized, or we're completely steam.
14:46
Then we can start getting hot, the steam can then get hotter
14:48
as we add more and more heat to the system.
14:53
So the interesting question, I think it's intuitive, that as
14:55
you add heat here, our temperature is going to go up.
15:01
But the interesting thing is, what was going on here?
15:03
We were adding heat.
15:04
So over here we were turning our heat into kinetic energy.
15:07
Temperature is average kinetic energy.
15:10
But over here, what was our heat doing?
15:12
Well, our heat was was not adding kinetic
15:15
energy to the system.
15:16
The temperature was not increasing.
15:17
But the ice was going from ice to water.
15:20
So what was happening at that state, is that the kinetic
15:24
energy, the heat, was being used to essentially break
15:29
these bonds.
15:32
And essentially bring the molecules into a
15:34
higher energy state.
15:35
So you're saying, Sal, what does that mean,
15:37
higher energy state?
15:38
Well, if there wasn't all of this heat and all this kinetic
15:42
energy, these molecules want to be very
15:44
close to each other.
15:46
For example, I want to be close to the
15:49
surface of the earth.
15:50
When you put me in a plane you have put me in a
15:52
higher energy state.
15:53
I have a lot more potential energy.
15:56
I have the potential to fall towards the earth.
15:58
Likewise, when you move these molecules apart, and you go
16:02
from a solid to a liquid, they want to fall
16:05
towards each other.
16:06
But because they have so much kinetic energy, they never
16:08
quite are able to do it.
16:10
But their energy goes up.
16:12
Their potential energy is higher because they want to
16:14
fall towards each other.
16:15
By falling towards each other, in theory, they
16:18
could do some work.
16:21
So what's happening here is, when we're contributing heat--
16:26
and this amount of heat we're contributing, it's called the
16:32
heat of fusion.
16:36
Because it's the same amount of heat regardless how much
16:39
direction we go in.
16:40
When we go from solid to liquid, you view it as the
16:43
heat of melting.
16:45
It's the head that you need to put in to melt
16:48
the ice into liquid.
16:49
When you're going in this direction, it's the heat you
16:51
have to take out of the zero degree water to
16:55
turn it into ice.
16:58
So you're taking that potential energy and you're
17:01
bringing the molecules closer and closer to each other.
17:05
So the way to think about it is, right here this heat is
17:08
being converted to kinetic energy.
17:10
Then, when we're at this phase change from solid to liquid,
17:15
that heat is being used to add potential
17:16
energy into the system.
17:18
To pull the molecules apart, to give them
17:21
more potential energy.
17:22
If you pull me apart from the earth, you're giving me
17:25
potential energy.
17:26
Because gravity wants to pull me back to the earth.
17:29
And I could do work when I'm falling back to the earth.
17:32
A waterfall does work.
17:33
It can move a turbine.
17:35
You could have a bunch of falling Sals move
17:37
a turbine as well.
17:39
And then, once you are fully a liquid, then you just become a
17:42
warmer and warmer liquid.
17:43
Now the heat is, once again, being used for kinetic energy.
17:48
You're making the water molecules move past each other
17:51
faster, and faster, and faster.
17:53
To some point where they want to completely disassociate
17:57
from each other.
17:58
They want to not even slide past each other, just
18:00
completely jump away from each other.
18:03
And that's right here.
18:04
This is the heat of vaporization.
18:13
And the same idea is happening.
18:15
Before we were sliding next to each other, now we're pulling
18:17
apart altogether.
18:19
So they could definitely fall closer together.
18:22
And then once we've added this much heat, now we're just
18:27
heating up the steam.
18:28
We're just heating up the gaseous water.
18:30
And it's just getting hotter and hotter and hotter.
18:33
But the interesting thing there, and I mean at least the
18:35
interesting thing to me when I first learned this, whenever I
18:41
think of zero degrees water I'll say, oh it must be ice.
18:43
But that's not necessarily the case.
18:45
If you start with water and you make it colder and colder
18:48
and colder to zero degrees, you're essentially taking heat
18:52
out of the water.
18:53
You can have zero degree water and it hasn't
18:57
turned into ice yet.
18:58
And likewise, you could have 100 degree water that hasn't
19:01
turned into steam yeat.
19:03
You have to add more energy.
19:04
You can also have 100 degree steam.
19:05
You can also have zero degree water.
19:08
Anyway, hopefully that gives you a little bit of intuition
19:10
of what the different states of matter are.
19:12
And in the next problem, we'll talk about how much heat
19:15
exactly it does take to move along this line.
19:18
And maybe we can solve some problems on how much ice we
19:21
might need to make our drink cool.","If solid things are supposedly colder, why do I feel warmer when I'm lying down on the floor rather than in a pool?"

- [Instructor] Let's get some practice now thinking
0:01
about how ions typically form,
0:03
how they might form compounds
0:05
and how we name those compounds.
0:08
So let's start with something in group one.
0:12
In this first column, this first column is often known
0:15
as alkali metals.
0:17
So let's start with potassium.
0:19
K is the symbol for potassium.
0:23
Now things in group one here,
0:25
one way to think about is their outermost shell
0:27
has one electron in it.
0:29
So they wouldn't mind losing that electron.
0:32
So when they ionize, they tend to lose an electron
0:35
and become a cation, a positive ion.
0:39
And so let's look at a situation where I have some potassium
0:44
that has been ionized.
0:47
I could write it just like this,
0:49
we've seen that in previous videos
0:51
and we can refer to this just as a potassium ion,
0:54
we could refer to this as potassium one plus.
0:57
We could refer to this as a potassium cation.
1:02
Now let's go on to the other side of the periodic table.
1:05
Things that would really love to grab an electron.
1:09
So things in group, in the halides,
1:14
which is this column right over here.
1:17
So these are the halides.
1:20
They have seven electrons in their outermost shell.
1:23
They would love to have eight,
1:25
so they tend to be really good at grabbing electrons.
1:29
And so let's say we're dealing with chlorine,
1:31
and chlorine is able to ionize.
1:34
So it's able to grab an electron.
1:36
When chlorine grabs an electron,
1:39
it will be a negatively charged ion,
1:42
so you could write it as Chlorine one minus,
1:46
but the way that we generally refer to an anion,
1:50
a negatively charged ion,
1:53
instead of just calling this the chlorine anion,
1:56
we would call this chloride.
1:59
So this we would refer to as Chloride.
2:05
Now as you can imagine with potassium having
2:08
a positive one charge or one plus charge
2:10
and this having a negative charge,
2:12
they're going to be attracted to each other
2:14
and they can actually form an ionic compound.
2:18
The ionic compound they would form, we would write
2:22
as, you'd write your positive ion first
2:25
and then you would write your negative ion.
2:28
And this right over here would be described
2:32
as potassium chloride.
2:34
Let me write that down.
2:36
Potassium, potassium chloride.
2:43
Now you might be saying, ""Well, I just,""
2:46
Let me rewrite the whole thing.
2:48
So you know the chloride part, you say okay,
2:50
this is going to be an anion
2:52
because instead of writing chlorine
2:54
which is the name of this element,
2:56
I wrote this IDE at the end
2:58
to say, ""Hey, this is an anion,""
3:00
so I know that this is the chlorine anion, this is chloride,
3:04
why didn't I do something similar for potassium?
3:07
Well, the way the convention works
3:09
is if someone says potassium chloride,
3:11
you know you're dealing with an ionic compound
3:14
and if the chlorine has a negative one charge,
3:16
an ionic compound,
3:17
the whole thing is gonna be neutral.
3:19
So if this one over here is one minus,
3:23
then you know this over here is just one-for-one,
3:26
this is going to be one plus
3:29
so you know that you're dealing with a potassium cation
3:33
and you could say and a chloride ion or a chlorine anion.
3:38
You could refer to it various ways,
3:40
but this is potassium chloride.
3:42
You have a positively charged potassium
3:45
and you have a negatively charged chlorine,
3:47
which we would call a chloride.
3:50
In the next few videos I'll do many, many more examples
3:52
of this and ones that will be a little bit more complicated.","Why is potassium chloride considered an ""ionic"" compound if the two atoms already neutralized each other?"

In the last video we went over the multiplication tables for 1
0:04
through 9 and I ran out of time, and actually, it was a
0:06
good thing because 1 through 9 are kind of the core
0:09
multiplication tables.
0:11
And you'll see that if you know all your multiplication tables
0:13
from 1 to 9, so you know any number between 1 and 9 times
0:16
any other number between 1 and 9, you can actually do
0:19
any multiplication problem out there.
0:21
But what I want to do now is I want to complete the
0:23
multiplication tables for 10, 11, and 12.
0:29
So what is 10 times-- let's just start with 0.
0:33
10 times 0.
0:35
Anything times 0 is 0.
0:39
Ten 0's are 0.
0:40
0 plus 0 plus 0 ten times is still 0.
0:43
What's 10 times 1?
0:48
Well that's just 10 one time.
0:49
Or 1 plus itself ten times.
0:52
That's 10.
0:53
I think this is second nature to you at this point.
0:56
What's 10 times 2?
0:59
I meant to switch colors, but I didn't.
1:02
10 times 2?
1:04
That's 10 plus 10, which is 20.
1:08
Fair enough.
1:09
And notice, we went up by 10 the first time.
1:12
We went up by 10 again to get to 20.
1:15
What's 10 times 3?
1:17
Well, that's 10 plus 10 plus 10, or we could view it as 10
1:21
times 2 plus another 10, which is equal to 30.
1:26
What's 10 times 4?
1:27
I think you start to see a pattern.
1:28
10 times 4 is equal to 40.
1:32
Notice, 10 times 4 is equal to 40.
1:37
If I were to tell you what is 10 times-- let me
1:42
do another color-- 5?
1:44
Well that's equal to 50.
1:50
10 times anything is that anything with a 0 behind it.
1:56
So the 10 times tables you almost don't
1:58
have to remember it.
1:59
So let's just keep going.
2:01
What's 10 times 6?
2:04
It's equal to 60.
2:06
6 0.
2:08
What's 10 times 7?
2:11
70.
2:12
10 times 8?
2:13
This is almost ridiculous.
2:14
10 times 8 is 80.
2:16
10 times 9?
2:19
90.
2:20
10 times 10?
2:21
Now this is interesting.
2:25
So it'll be a 10-- let's see me write this.
2:28
Let me do it in this orange color.
2:32
10 times 10.
2:33
So it'll be ten 10's or a 10 with a 0 behind it.
2:38
There you go.
2:39
Notice everything-- whatever times 10 I just add a 0 and
2:41
then I get the next number.
2:42
So it's 100.
2:43
And I think you understand why that is.
2:45
I added 10 to itself ten times.
2:47
That each 10-- you go from 10, 20, 30.
2:51
30 is just three 10's or 10 times 3.
2:54
90 is just nine 10's or 9 times 10.
2:58
Let's keep going.
3:00
So 10 times 11 is equal to 11 with a 0 behind it.
3:05
110.
3:06
Finally, 10 times 12 is equal to 120.
3:13
Now, just for fun, these are kind of your 10 times tables.
3:17
But now that t know the pattern you can do anything.
3:20
If I asked you what 5,732 times 10 is, what's it going to be?
3:29
It's going to be this number with just one more 0.
3:32
So it's going to be-- I won't read it out yet.
3:34
5 7 3 2 with a 0 behind it.
3:39
And just so you know, this little comma that I wrote in
3:41
the number there, that's just to make it easier for
3:44
me to read that number.
3:45
And you put the comma-- you start over here and every third
3:48
number you put the comma.
3:49
So here I'm going to put the comma right here.
3:53
I'm going to put the comma right there.
3:54
So now I can read this.
3:56
The comma doesn't really add or take anything away from
3:59
the number, it just helps me read it.
4:01
Now 5,732 times 10 is 57,320.
4:07
i just had to add a 0 there, but that was a pretty
4:10
straightforward multiplication.
4:12
And notice, we had 5,000 times 10 and we got to 50 something
4:16
thousand when we multiplied them.
4:19
So that's similar to 5 times 10 is equal to 50.
4:21
But instead of 5 I had a 5,000, and so I got a 50,000 and
4:26
something and all this other stuff.
4:28
We're going to learn more about how to do problems
4:29
like this in the future.
4:30
But I thought I would introduce you to the idea that just from
4:33
this little pattern of adding a 0 you already know your
4:35
10's times tables.
4:37
Now let's do our 11's.
4:42
Well, they start off easy, and then they get a little more
4:44
difficult as we get into high numbers.
4:47
11 times 0.
4:49
This is easy, this is 0.
4:51
11 times 1.
4:52
This is also easy.
4:54
It's 11.
4:56
11 times 2.
4:57
We're going to start seeing a pattern here.
4:59
It's 11 plus 11 or we could've added 2 to itself eleven times,
5:03
but that is equal to 22.
5:06
If we do 11 times 3 it is equal to 33.
5:11
11 times 4 is equal to 44.
5:15
I think this is becoming obvious to you.
5:16
What's 11 times 5?
5:18
11 times 5 is 55.
5:20
Notice I put the 5 twice.
5:23
What's 11 times 6?
5:24
It's 66.
5:27
11 times 7 is 84-- no.
5:30
I'm kidding.
5:32
I didn't want to mess with you like that.
5:33
But no.
5:34
Of course, it's 77.
5:37
You just repeat the number twice.
5:41
Let me switch colors.
5:42
11 times 8 is equal to 88.
5:46
11 times 9 is equal to 99.
5:50
Now what's 11 times 12?
5:54
Oh sorry, I skipped 10.
5:56
11 times 10.
5:58
You might want to say it's 1,010.
6:00
No.
6:00
That's wrong.
6:01
It's not 1,010.
6:05
So that little pattern that we had where you just repeat the
6:07
number, that only worked for one-digit numbers.
6:10
So it only worked for 1 through 9.
6:11
11 times 10?
6:12
Well, we could think about it a couple of ways.
6:14
We can add 11 to 99.
6:16
So we can say it's 99 plus 11.
6:20
And what's that?
6:21
That's equal to 110.
6:23
And I'm going to show you how to do-- well, hopefully you've
6:25
already watched the video on how to add two-digit numbers
6:28
like this, but that's 110.
6:30
Or you could just use the property from the 10's times
6:32
tables that we learned where if you just take 11 times 10 you
6:36
add a 0 to the 11, you get 110.
6:37
That's the 11 right there.
6:39
Finally, let's do 11 times 12.
6:44
No easy way to remember this, you just kind of
6:46
should remember it.
6:47
Or you could say look, it's going to be 11 more
6:49
than 11 times-- sorry.
6:51
I keep skipping things.
6:53
We should do 11 times 11 first.
6:55
Let me make sure this is clear.
6:56
We're doing 11 times 11 before we go to 11 times 12.
7:00
So 11 times 11 is going to be 11 more than 11 times 10.
7:05
So we add 11 to this.
7:07
11 plus 110 is 121.
7:13
And actually, as you'll see, there actually is an order as
7:15
we get to higher multiples of 11, but I'll leave that
7:18
to a future video.
7:20
And then finally, we're at 11 times 12.
7:26
And we could add 11 to itself twelve times.
7:28
We could add 12 to itself eleven times.
7:30
Or we could just say, hey, is going to be 11 more
7:35
than 11 times 11.
7:37
So that is what?
7:38
You add 11 to this.
7:40
What do you get?
7:41
You get 132.
7:46
I just added 121 plus 11 and then got 132.
7:51
Now the other way you could have said it is, well,
7:52
what's 10 times 12?
7:54
We already knew that.
7:56
That was 120.
7:58
So 11 times 12 because we're multiplying 12 by one more
8:02
should be 12 more than that.
8:04
So that should be 132.
8:06
So two ways to get the exact same answer.
8:10
All right, now let's do our 12 times tables.
8:15
And once you know this you are ready to tackle any type
8:18
of multiplication problem.
8:19
But we'll do that in future videos.
8:21
So 12 times 0.
8:24
Super easy.
8:24
0.
8:25
12 times 1.
8:26
Also super easy.
8:27
Is 12.
8:28
Now it gets interesting.
8:29
We're going to increase by 12 every time.
8:33
12 times 2 is equal to 24.
8:37
12 plus 12 is 24.
8:39
12 times-- not 22.
8:43
Let me rewrite that.
8:44
12 times 3 is going to be 12 plus 12 plus 12.
8:50
Or we could write that as 12 times 2.
8:53
I see my brain is doing the wrong things.
8:56
We could rewrite that as 12 times 2 plus 12.
9:00
Or we could rewrite that as 24 plus 12.
9:03
Either way, all of these get us to 36.
9:07
And notice, that's just that plus 12.
9:10
12 times 4.
9:12
12 times 4 is equal to 48.
9:17
There's a lot of ways you could think about it.
9:18
You could say 11 times 4 is 44.
9:25
And you go up by one more 4, so you get to 12 times 4.
9:30
Or you could say 12 times 3 is 36 and you can add one
9:33
12 to it to get to 48.
9:36
Either way works and that's because you can multiply
9:39
in either direction.
9:40
Let's keep going.
9:42
12 times 5 is equal to 60.
9:47
10 times 5 is 50, 11 times 5 is 55, so 12 times 5 is 60.
9:55
12 times 6 is equal to what?
9:58
It's going to be 12 more than this.
10:00
It's going to equal 72.
10:02
12 times 7.
10:04
12 more than this again.
10:06
12 more than 72 is 84.
10:09
And I'm serious, I'm probably a lot older than you are and I
10:15
still, in my head to confirm, I go to some 12 times tables that
10:19
I remember as definitely right.
10:20
Like oh, 12 times 5-- and sometimes in my head I say,
10:23
oh, let me add another 12.
10:24
Oh yeah, definitely, my memory was correct.
10:26
12 times 6 is 72.
10:28
All right.
10:29
Then you go to 12 times 8.
10:31
Add 12 to the 12 times 7.
10:34
96.
10:35
12 times 9 .
10:38
Well you add 12 to this, so it's 108.
10:44
And then 12 times 10.
10:46
This is an easy one.
10:48
We just add a 0 to the 12 to get 120.
10:51
Or we could've added 12 to 108.
10:54
Either way.
10:55
12 times 11.
10:58
We just did this.
10:59
You add 12 to this you get to 132.
11:02
And then 12 times 12 is equal to 144.
11:09
And this actually shows up.
11:10
If I had a dozen of a dozen eggs-- a dozen is 12.
11:13
Or if I had, I think a gross is actually 12 dozens.
11:17
So that's 144 eggs.
11:18
You'll actually end up seeing this number a lot.
11:20
More than you would expect in life.
11:22
But anyway, we've now completed all of our
11:25
multiplication tables.
11:27
And I really encourage you to take the time now to
11:29
go and memorize them.
11:30
Make some flash cards.
11:33
Use the little software thing that I wrote on my website.
11:37
You could try that out.
11:38
As of September 2009 it's working.
11:41
I haven't touched it in a while, but I'm actually
11:43
probably going to rebuild it soon.
11:45
So if you're watching this video in the year 2200.
11:48
Well, I would probably not exist anymore.
11:50
But hopefully you'll get a better version of
11:52
the software app.
11:53
But you should practice it.
11:55
You should get your parents to quiz you.
11:56
You should get notes cards.
11:58
You should just be mumbling to yourself as you walk to
12:00
school-- what is 12 times 9?
12:02
What is 11 times 11?
12:03
And you should quiz each other because it'll pay huge rewards
12:07
to you later on in life.

The word inequality, by its very nature,
0:02
at least sounds, sounds a little bit unfair.
0:06
Obviously, everyone's not getting the same thing.
0:09
They're not getting the same income,
0:10
or they don't have the same wealth,
0:12
but a question needs to be asked is,
0:14
is this necessarily a bad thing,
0:17
and even if it is a bad thing,
0:19
are the ways of fixing it or trying to address it,
0:23
could they make matters worse in some way,
0:25
especially for the people that you're trying to help?
0:28
And, once again, my goal here is to not tell you
0:30
one way or the other, but to at least give you
0:32
frameworks for thinking about this.
0:34
So, let's just think about a world where we have
0:38
kind of a fixed-pie economy, and there,
0:40
increasing inequality is clearly not doing good
0:43
for the people who have less resources.
0:48
So, let's imagine a fixed-pie economy.
0:50
So, let's say this rectangle right over here
0:55
represents the total national income in a given period.
1:01
So, year one, this is the total national income,
1:05
total national income, and let's say that in year one
1:12
the top 10 percent of earners, the top 10 percent
1:17
of earners, make a third of the national income,
1:21
so, they make a third of the national income.
1:24
This is the top 10 percent.
1:26
Now, let me be very clear.
1:27
This area right over here is not 10 % of the whole rectangle.
1:31
This is 35 percent, or actually this is a third,
1:36
so, this is going to be 33.
1:38
This is one-third of the entire rectangle,
1:41
but it's the income from the top 10 percent.
1:45
Income from the top 10 percent.
1:49
Now, that would mean that the other 90 percent,
1:52
other 90 percent, is essentially splitting the remaining
1:58
two-thirds of national income between them.
2:01
So, if you take this reality, and if the total pie,
2:05
so, let's do a static pie right over here,
2:09
so pie stays the same, so pie, and when I say pie,
2:14
I'm talking about this square thing here.
2:15
I guess it doesn't look too much like a pie,
2:17
so maybe I don't call it a pie.
2:19
So, national income static.
2:22
So, it's not changing right over here.
2:24
So, then you have, let me try to draw
2:26
a rectangle of the same size, of the same size,
2:32
and if you have increasing inequality in this situation,
2:37
then you might have the top 10 percent of earners by,
2:39
let's just say this is year 10, year 10 right over here,
2:45
maybe instead of having one-third of the national income,
2:47
maybe they have 50 percent of the national income,
2:50
and I'm just picking round numbers for simplicity.
2:53
So, this right over here is one-half of
2:55
national income now from the top 10 percent.
2:58
From the top 10 percent.
3:03
So, clearly, if this happens, the other 90 percent
3:06
are now splitting only one-half of the national income.
3:10
So, this is the other 90 percent right over here.
3:15
So, here it's essentially a zero-sum game.
3:17
If you had a static economy, if it was not growing at all,
3:21
then, of course, rising inequality would mean
3:24
that these people, right over, the other 90 percent,
3:27
are going to have lower per capita,
3:30
I guess you could say income, lower per capita GDP.
3:34
They're going to have a lower standard of living.
3:36
So, they're not doing good in this situation.
3:39
But, let's think of the other way,
3:40
of where you do have economic growth,
3:42
and economic growth that's enough so even if you have
3:46
some inequality, the growth more than offsets that,
3:51
so that these, the other 90 percent, is still better off.
3:55
So, let's see if we can visualize that.
3:56
So, economic growth, economic growth,
4:06
and let's say your pie has grown dramatically
4:09
over 10 years, and I'm just, maybe I'm exaggerating
4:12
a little bit for the sake of discussion.
4:15
So, let me draw it like this.
4:17
So, I'll try to do about the same height,
4:19
but now, our whole economy, let's say our whole economy
4:24
has doubled, our whole economy has doubled here,
4:30
and now in this situation, let's say you still have
4:33
this wealth inequality growing.
4:35
So, the top 10 percent in year one
4:37
having one-third of national income.
4:39
Let's say that it still goes to one-half of national income
4:42
in year 10, so one-half of national income.
4:47
So, I can draw that a little bit neater.
4:49
So, half of national income right over there,
4:54
half of national income, so one-half of national income.
4:58
So, this is still a situation where you've had
5:00
inequality increase, but the half of national income
5:06
that's going to have to be split between the other
5:09
90 percent has still grown fairly dramatically,
5:14
if we assume that I've drawn it
5:15
pretty close to proportional.
5:18
So, let me just copy and paste this.
5:19
So, copy and paste.
5:23
So, this is how much was being split
5:25
amongst the other 90 percent in year one,
5:28
and notice, it's much smaller than how much
5:31
is being split by the other 90 percent,
5:33
and actually, let me put it right over here,
5:35
than the other 90 percent in year 10,
5:38
and if we assume that the population
5:40
hasn't grown by this amount, it's grown by
5:42
something smaller than this, or maybe the population
5:44
has been relatively stable, then your per capita,
5:47
your per capita GDP, your per capita income
5:50
is actually going to improve.
5:52
So, this is a situation here where even though inequality
5:56
has increased, because the pie has gotten bigger,
6:00
these people are better off.
6:02
These people are better off, and so, that leads to
6:07
really one of the fundamental questions,
6:10
especially when you're thinking about economic systems,
6:12
is that you have this market system,
6:15
this capitalist system, this market economy,
6:21
a market economy, and at least in the recent history,
6:25
it's shown us that, hey, this leads to growth,
6:28
wealth creation, so pie, so economic growth,
6:32
economic growth, but it also leads to inequality.
6:39
It also leads to Inequality.
6:42
Inequality is an inevitable by-product.
6:45
Inequality.
6:47
Now, the question you might have to ask is,
6:49
well, look, is this necessarily bad?
6:51
If this economic growth is enough, everyone is better off.
6:55
It doesn't matter if some people are even more better off
6:57
than other people, but everyone is better off,
6:59
and it's important to think about if you try to
7:03
just focus on inequality, just focus on inequality,
7:07
are you also going to stop this from happening?
7:09
Another way of thinking about it, if you're one of
7:11
the people in this situation right over here,
7:15
you're the other 90 percent, would you rather
7:17
stay in this world, where you're in a static pie
7:20
and inequality is not increasing,
7:22
or would you rather go to this world right over here?
7:26
Now, once again, the point of my video isn't to say
7:29
that this world is necessarily going to happen.
7:31
There could be a world where your
7:33
total economic growth was less than this,
7:35
and the pie got bigger, and these people are not
7:37
as well off, but the whole point of this is just to highlight
7:41
that inequality is not necessarily always going to lead
7:44
to the people, I guess who are getting less of the pie,
7:49
being worse off, if the pie grows fast enough,
7:52
and the other thing to realize is, well,
7:55
sometimes, in an attempt to lessen inequality,
7:59
you might also stifle economic growth,
8:02
and that might keep everyone from being better off
8:05
in this scenario right over here.
8:06
So, once again, it really depends on the context,
8:09
it really depends on the situation and the variables
8:11
and the numbers you're looking at,
8:13
but I just really want to emphasize that
8:15
there's no such thing as, hey, if there's rising inequality
8:17
it's going to hurt always the other 90 percent.
8:20
It'll definitely benefit the people who are maybe
8:23
in the top 10 percent, but it also,
8:25
because that's a by-product of economic growth,
8:27
it might make these people better off as well.","So, is the redistribution of wealth always going to lead to less economic growth?"
khan_video_rEiLOB4FulY_11,Social Studies,ESSAY,"•
0:00
I've been wanting to make a video on a couple of terms
0:03
that people have really thrown around for a while now.
0:06
And I think it really hits the core of some of the issues
0:09
we're dealing with now with the credit debacle but it's
0:11
kind of at a deeper level.
0:13
So the things I want to go over are the ideas of savings,
0:20
consumption, and investment.
0:28
And you hear these a lot.
0:29
Everyone obviously says, I've invested in the stock market
0:31
or I've invested in a house and I really want to give you
0:34
a framework for how I think about these ideas.
0:38
And frankly, I haven't seen them depicted this way in any
0:44
economics book, although they've kind of touched on
0:46
this, but I think this is really how you should think
0:48
about these things.
0:49
So if you save money, and I think we all know what that
0:52
means, that's money that you didn't spend, there's a couple
0:54
of things that you can do with it.
0:56
You can either consume your money or you
0:58
could invest your money.
1:00
So, let's just think about a bunch of different situations
1:02
and think about whether those things are consumption or
1:07
investment.
1:08
So let's say, I have $100,000 that I'm dealing with.
1:15
So let's say, I take that $100,000
1:17
and I build a factory.
1:23
And I think that that factory is going to be able to
1:26
produce-- I'll make up some product-- it'll be able to
1:29
produce cars more efficiently and cheaper than any other car
1:33
factory out there.
1:35
Well, I think we'd all agree that this is an investment.
1:39
And why is it an investment?
1:42
Because I'm taking this $100,000 and I'm putting it to
1:46
some use that is creating, hopefully, more value than my
1:50
original $100,000.
1:52
In fact, I'm expecting some type of a return on this
1:55
investment.
1:55
And I've made a bunch of videos on what a return on
1:58
investment is, and you can usually quantify it.
2:00
If I take a $100,000 and I build this factory and this
2:03
factory spits out $50,000 a year, it's probably creating
2:08
at least $50,000 a year value, assuming that nothing corrupt
2:12
is happening in our system.
2:13
In fact, it's normally creating more than $50,000 a
2:16
year of value.
2:16
It may be creating a $100,000 a year of value and $50,000 of
2:20
that may be going to the person who's doing the
2:22
production and then the other half of the value is actually
2:25
going to the consumer of whatever
2:27
this factory is making.
2:28
And you have to think about it, because if all of the
2:30
value went to the person who produced the factory then
2:33
there's not a huge incentive for someone to use his
2:35
products anymore.
2:36
But anyway, that's not the topic of discussion.
2:38
We're just trying to get at a mental framework on what
2:41
consumption is versus investment.
2:43
So I think we all agree that if I were to build a factory
2:46
that this is-- let's say I'll do everything in green as
2:49
investment.
2:51
So building a factory is an investment.
2:55
Now let's say that I'm homeless
3:00
and I have this $100,000.
3:01
And because I'm homeless, I don't have a place to go and
3:05
eat dinner and rest and relax.
3:08
Because I don't have that, I can't get a job and I can't
3:11
become a productive member of society.
3:13
So maybe, I'm going to use this $100,000 to buy a simple
3:17
house that meets all of my needs.
3:19
Let's say build a simple house, and I'll do that in a
3:22
neutral color.
3:31
This is my other use of this $100,000, instead of building
3:34
a factory, I'm going to build a simple house.
3:36
And this house, it provides shelter for me and my family,
3:39
it allows us that security that now my kids can go to
3:43
school and they can themselves become
3:45
more productive citizens.
3:46
I now have an address.
3:49
I have a place to take a shower, that allows me to go
3:51
get a job and I can now create value for society as a whole,
3:55
instead of being on the corner and begging
3:58
for money from people.
4:00
I would argue that this is also an investment.
4:02
Why is it?
4:03
Because I'm taking this $100,000, that maybe I had or
4:06
someone gave to me, and it's generating a return.
4:10
And what is that return?
4:11
Well, with a factory, it's maybe a
4:12
little easier to quantify.
4:13
But at minimum, it's this work that I'm able to do because I
4:17
now have a house.
4:17
Because I have the security, I have the address.
4:19
I have the shelter.
4:20
I'm able to relax.
4:21
It's that security and it's also the return that probably
4:24
my kids are going to be able to now contribute to society.
4:27
Maybe if they grew up homeless, they would have
4:29
never been able to contribute.
4:30
And now that they have a roof over their head, and are able
4:33
to go to school, et cetera, they are going to be able to
4:35
give some economic value back to society.
4:38
It's hard to value, maybe I didn't have any job before and
4:40
now I have a job and I can contribute
4:42
$30,000 a year to society.
4:45
Maybe I'm working at someone's factory.
4:47
Maybe I'm providing some other-- maybe
4:49
I'm a farmer now.
4:50
Whatever, I'm providing some source of value.
4:52
And maybe my kids-- if they never got an education, they
4:54
would have maybe added $10,000 of value per year to people
4:59
and now they can add $20,000 of value.
5:01
So that difference would also be some of the return on this
5:03
investment.
5:04
So I also consider this to be an investment.
5:09
Now, my question to you is, let's say that I already had a
5:12
house-- so this is an investment.
5:15
Let's say I already had a house and my family is happy
5:17
and we have everything we need.
5:20
We have food on the table and my kids go to school and I'm
5:23
able to get a job and all of that exists.
5:26
But let's say, I still have a $100,000 and I use that
5:30
$100,000-- I'll do it in yellow-- to put in some
5:40
granite counter tops.
5:44
I have some money left over, let's say, I'm going to add a
5:46
bathroom to my house and I will put the latest hardwood
5:55
floors, so that my family will be impressed.
6:00
You can imagine.
6:01
And maybe I add 2,000 square feet.
6:04
You normally can't get all that for a $100,000 but I
6:06
think you'll bear with me.
6:08
So I'm essentially doing some major home improvements.
6:11
So my question to you is-- is this an investment or is this
6:15
consumption?
6:16
Now, in our everyday world, with most people we deal with,
6:20
they will call this investment in my house.
6:22
And why are they saying that?
6:23
Because they say, by spending a $100,000 in the house in
6:26
this way, that maybe-- if you watch the Home and Garden
6:30
channel, they're doing this all the time-- that if you
6:32
pour this a $100,000 into your house, that maybe the value of
6:36
your house is going to increase by $150,000.
6:39
Or someone else, all of a sudden, is going to perceive
6:41
the value of your house as being $150,000.
6:44
They'll say, well, you got a $50,000 return on investment.
6:48
I'd argue that that is not investment.
6:50
That it's speculation.
6:52
You are, essentially, piling money into this stuff-- and
6:56
I'll do this in red, consumption is red.
7:02
What's happening here truly economically?
7:05
When you add granite, or you add an extra bathroom or
7:08
hardwood floors or this extra 2,000 square feet, is it
7:11
making anyone who's living in that house more productive?
7:14
Is it making you harder working; is it making you more
7:16
likely to invent the cure for cancer, or more likely to
7:20
invent a way of getting cheap energy, or
7:26
produce more widgets?
7:27
No, it's just, if anything, providing more things for you
7:31
to have to take care of, that you're not going to be able to
7:34
focus as much on your work.
7:35
Or more energy is going to have to be extended to
7:37
maintain this type of place, to heat and cool a 2,000
7:41
square foot house.
7:42
So if anything, by actually pouring the $100,000 here,
7:46
you're actually creating something that is going to
7:47
suck more out of society.
7:49
In fact, in no way is this going to contribute to the
7:52
collective wealth of society.
7:53
The last two examples I gave contribute to the collective
7:56
wealth society, some of which you share, and that is your
7:59
return on the investment.
8:00
But as a whole, this is an investment into society.
8:02
And it's going to make the pie bigger.
8:07
This right here, does not make the pie bigger.
8:09
It might make you a little bit happier, make your ego feel a
8:12
little bit better, let your pride grow, and your self
8:15
righteousness grow, and show other people that you've
8:18
arrived, but it's not going to increase
8:21
the wealth of society.
8:22
And when you say that you've invested, you are really just
8:24
saying I've speculated.
8:26
What you're saying is-- by paying this $100,000, you're
8:29
going to find, essentially, a greater fool out there.
8:33
They could have done the same thing, they could have bought
8:34
your house, spent $100,000 and done this, if this is what
8:38
would have made them happy.
8:39
But what you're saying is, essentially, that you're going
8:42
to find somebody out there who's willing to pay $150,000
8:45
extra for something that should
8:47
have only cost $100,000.
8:48
And in fact, if anything, if you use this at all, the value
8:51
of this is going to go down.
8:52
So you're just somehow assuming that the granite
8:56
counter tops that you choose are going to be the taste that
8:58
someone else would like or that the hardwood floors are
9:00
going to be the taste someone else would like.
9:01
I would actually argue that when you customize your house
9:04
in this way, you are creating $100,000 of consumption to
9:08
your taste.
9:09
And I'd be surprised if someone else, truly, is
9:12
willing to pay more than $100,000 unless they're being,
9:15
in some way, irrational or they can finance this because
9:18
it's part of the mortgage.
9:22
Anyway, this is, I think, just the big picture: investment
9:27
adds value to society.
9:29
A simple house adds value to society.
9:31
Consumption is something where people might call it an
9:36
investment because it's kind of speculation.
9:38
One might find some other guy willing to emotionally pay
9:41
more for something.
9:42
But it's money that's burned; it's not creating more value
9:46
for society.
9:47
I continue this in the next video.","For a government, is creating and maintaining a national park (like Carlsbad Caverns or the Grand Canyon) an investment or consumption?"

0:00
What I want to do in this video is give ourselves
0:02
a basic introduction to the phenomenon of light.
0:07
And light is, at least to me, mysterious.
0:11
Because on one level it really defines our reality.
0:14
It's maybe the most defining characteristic of our reality.
0:17
Everything we see, how we perceive reality,
0:20
is based on light bouncing off of objects
0:23
or bending around objects or diffracting around objects,
0:26
and then being sensed by our eyes,
0:29
and then sending signals into our brain that
0:32
create models of the world we see around us.
0:35
So it really is, almost, the defining characteristic
0:37
of our reality.
0:38
But at the same time, when you really go down to experiment
0:42
and observe with light, it starts
0:44
to have a bunch of mysterious properties.
0:47
And to a large degree it is not fully understood yet.
0:51
And probably the most amazing thing about light--
0:54
well, actually there's tons of amazing things about light--
0:56
but one of the mysterious things is when you really get down
0:59
to it-- and this is actually not just true of light,
1:01
this is actually true of almost anything
1:03
once you get onto a small enough quantum mechanical level--
1:07
light behaves as both a wave and a particle.
1:12
And this is probably not that intuitive to you,
1:15
because it's not that intuitive to me.
1:17
In my life, I'm used to certain things behaving as waves,
1:19
like sound waves or the waves of an ocean.
1:22
And I'm used to certain things behaving like particles,
1:25
like basketballs or-- I don't know-- my coffee cup.
1:29
I'm not used to things behaving as both.
1:32
And it really depends on what experiment you run
1:34
and how you observe the light.
1:36
So when you observe it as a particle,
1:38
and this comes out of Einstein's work
1:40
with the photoelectric effect-- and I won't go into the details
1:43
here, maybe in a future video when
1:44
we start thinking about quantum mechanics--
1:47
you can view light as a train of particles moving
1:54
at the speed of light, which I'll talk about in a second.
1:56
We call these particles photons.
2:00
If you view light in other ways-- and you see it
2:02
even when you see light being refracted by a prism here--
2:07
it looks like it is a wave.
2:10
And it has the properties of a wave.
2:12
It has a frequency, and it has a wavelength.
2:16
And like other waves, the velocity of that wave
2:19
is the frequency times its wavelength.
2:23
Now even if you ignore this particle aspect of light,
2:28
if you just look at the wave aspect of the light,
2:30
it's still fascinating.
2:32
Because most waves require a medium to travel through.
2:36
So for example, if I think about how sound travels through air--
2:40
so let me draw a bunch of air particles.
2:44
I'll draw a sound wave traveling through the air particles.
2:47
What happens in a sound wave is you compress some of the air
2:52
particles and those compress the ones next to them.
2:54
And so you have points in the air that have higher,
2:57
I guess you could say, higher pressure
2:59
and points that have lower pressure,
3:00
and you could plot that.
3:02
So we have high pressure over here.
3:03
High pressure, low pressure, high pressure, low pressure.
3:07
And as these things bump into each other,
3:08
and this wave essentially travels to the right--
3:11
and if you were to plot that you would see this wave
3:13
form traveling to the right.
3:15
But this is all predicated, or this is all
3:17
based on, this energy traveling through a medium.
3:22
And I'm used to visualizing waves in that way.
3:26
But light needs no medium.
3:34
Light will actually travel fastest through nothing,
3:37
through a vacuum.
3:39
And it will travel at an unimaginably fast speed--
3:42
3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second.
3:47
And just to give you a sense of this,
3:49
this is 300 million meters per second.
3:51
Or another way of thinking about it is it
3:54
would take light less than a seventh of a second
3:59
to travel around the earth.
4:00
Or it would travel around the earth more than seven times
4:03
in one second.
4:04
So unimaginably fast.
4:06
And not only is this just a super fast speed,
4:10
but once again it tells us that light
4:12
is something fundamental to our universe.
4:14
Because it's not just an unimaginable fast speed.
4:17
It is the fastest speed not just known to physics, but possible
4:21
in physics.
4:22
So once again something very unintuitive to us
4:25
in our everyday realm.
4:26
We always imagine that, OK, if something
4:29
is going at some speed, maybe if there was an ant riding on top
4:31
of that something and it was moving in the same direction,
4:34
it would be going even faster.
4:35
But nothing can go faster than the speed of light.
4:39
It's absolutely impossible based on our current understanding
4:43
of physics.
4:44
So it's not just a fast speed, it
4:46
is the fastest speed possible.
4:55
And this right here is an approximation.
4:57
It's actually 2.99 something something times 10
5:01
to the eighth meters per second.
5:02
But 3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second
5:04
is a pretty good approximation.
5:07
Now within the visible light spectrum-- and I'll
5:10
talk about what's beyond the visible light spectrum
5:13
in a second-- you're probably familiar with the colors.
5:15
Maybe you imagine them as the colors of the rainbow.
5:18
And rainbows really happen because the light
5:20
from the sun, the white light, is being refracted
5:24
by these little water particles.
5:27
And you can see that in a clearer way when
5:29
you see light being refracted by a prism right over here.
5:33
And the different wavelengths of light-- so white light
5:36
contains all of the visible wavelengths--
5:39
but the different wavelengths get refracted differently
5:42
by a prism.
5:44
So in this case the higher-frequency wavelengths,
5:47
the violet and the blue, get refracted more.
5:50
Its direction gets bent more than the low-frequency
5:53
wavelengths, than the reds and the oranges right over here.
5:59
And if you want to look at the wavelength of visible light,
6:02
it's between 400 nanometers and 700 nanometers.
6:05
And the higher the frequency, the higher the energy of that
6:09
light.
6:09
And that actually goes into when you
6:11
start talking about the quantum mechanics of it--
6:13
that the higher frequency means that each of these photons
6:16
have higher energy.
6:17
They have a better ability to give kinetic energy
6:20
to knock off electrons or whatever else they need to do.
6:23
So higher frequency-- let me write
6:25
that down-- higher frequency means higher energy.
6:35
Now I keep referring to this idea of the visible light.
6:39
And you might say, what is beyond visible light?
6:41
And what you'll find is that light is just
6:43
part of a much broader phenomenon,
6:46
and it's just the part that we happen to observe.
6:49
And if we want to broaden the discussion a little bit,
6:54
visible light is just really part
6:56
of the electromagnetic spectrum.
6:59
So light is really just electromagnetic radiation.
7:09
And everything that I told you about light just now--
7:11
it has a wave property and it has particle properties--
7:15
this is not just specific to visible light.
7:17
This is true of all of electromagnetic radiation.
7:22
So at very low frequencies or very long wavelengths--
7:25
we're talking about things like radio waves,
7:27
the things that allow a radio to reach your car;
7:31
the things that allow your cellphone
7:34
to communicate with cell towers; microwaves, the things that
7:38
start vibrating water molecules in your food
7:40
so that they heat up; infrared, which
7:43
is what our body releases, and that's
7:45
why you can detect people through walls
7:46
with infrared cameras; visible light; ultraviolet light,
7:50
the UV light coming from the sun that'll give you sunburn;
7:53
X-rays, the radiation that allows
7:55
us to see through the soft material and just visualize
7:58
the bones; gamma rays,
7:59
the super high energy that comes from quasars
8:03
and other certain types of physical phenomena-- these
8:05
are all examples of the exact same thing.
8:08
We just happen to perceive certain frequencies
8:11
of this as visible light.
8:14
And you might say, hey, Sal, how come we only
8:15
perceive certain frequencies of this?
8:18
How can we only see these frequencies?
8:23
Literally we can see those frequencies
8:25
with our unaided eye.
8:26
And the reason, or at least my best guess
8:28
of the reason of that, is that's the frequency where
8:30
the sun dumps out a lot of electromagnetic radiation.
8:34
So it's inundating the Earth.
8:36
And if, as a species, you wanted to observe things
8:38
based on reflected electromagnetic energy,
8:42
it is most useful to be able to perceive the things where there
8:46
is the most electromagnetic radiation.
8:48
So it is possible that in other realities or other planets
8:51
there are species that perceive more
8:53
in the ultraviolet range or the infrared range.
8:55
And even on Earth, there are some
8:57
that perform better at either end of the range.
8:59
But we see really well in the part of the spectrum
9:02
where the sun just happens to dump a lot of radiation on us.
9:08
Now I'll leave you there.
9:09
I think that's a pretty good overview of light.
9:11
And if any of this stuff seems kind
9:14
of unintuitive or daunting, or really
9:17
on some level confusing-- this wave-particle duality,
9:20
this idea of a transfer of energy through nothing--
9:25
and it seems unintuitive, don't worry.
9:27
It seems unintuitive even for the best of physicists.
9:30
So you're already at the leading edge of physics thinking.",How can 3x10^8 be the fast speed possible when If its facing a black hole and heading toward it?

In the last video, we saw that sodium borohydride
0:03
will reduce aldehydes or ketones to form
0:06
primary or secondary alcohols.
0:08
And if we look at this general reaction,
0:10
this is either an aldehyde or a ketone over here.
0:13
If we add lithium aluminum hydride in the first step
0:16
and then a source of protons in the second step-- which
0:19
is water-- we will form either a primary or a secondary alcohol,
0:23
depending on our starting materials.
0:24
So in that respect, lithium aluminum hydride
0:26
will react in the same way as sodium borohydride.
0:29
However, sodium borohydride will only
0:32
reduce aldehydes or ketones.
0:34
It won't reduce carboxylic acids or esters.
0:37
And that's what lithium aluminum hydride does.
0:39
So we can see that-- if this is an OH right here--
0:43
that would be a carboxylic acid functional group.
0:45
And if we take off the H and put in an alkyl group
0:47
in our prime group there, we would have an ester.
0:50
So lithium aluminum hydride, not only
0:52
reduces aldehydes and ketones, it also
0:54
reduces carboxylic acids and esters
0:56
since it's more reactive, which is also
0:58
why we have to separate these two.
1:00
We can't have water in the same reaction vessel
1:02
as our lithium aluminum hydride because it
1:04
will react with that faster.
1:06
And so once again, our product will
1:09
depend on what our starting material is.
1:11
So the mechanism for the reduction
1:13
of aldehydes or ketones with lithium aluminum hydride
1:15
is just like the one for sodium borohydride.
1:18
So we'll move on to a mechanism for the reduction of an ester.
1:22
So let's go ahead and do that.
1:24
So let's start with an ester down here.
1:26
So we have our carbonyl.
1:28
Like that.
1:29
So we'll put in our lone pairs.
1:31
And down here, we have our R prime group.
1:34
Like that.
1:35
So there's our ester.
1:36
And we add lithium aluminum hydride in excess.
1:40
So in terms of molar equivalence,
1:43
let's go ahead and put lithium aluminum hydride down here,
1:46
Li+.
1:47
And then, we have Al bonded to 4 hydrogens.
1:51
Like that.
1:51
And that's going to give the aluminum
1:53
a negative 1 formal charge.
1:55
Like that.
1:56
So the first step in the mechanism
1:58
is just like the one we did in the previous video.
2:00
All right.
2:01
We think about the carbonyl up here and the difference
2:04
in electronegativity between this carbon and this oxygen--
2:08
oxygen being more electronegative,
2:10
pulling these electrons closer towards it and the double bond,
2:13
giving it a partial negative charge.
2:16
Whereas the carbon down here is losing some electron density,
2:18
becoming partially positive.
2:20
So the carbonyl carbon is an electrophile.
2:23
It wants electrons.
2:24
And of course, it's going to get electrons
2:26
from these 2 electrons in here.
2:28
So these 2 electrons are going to attack this carbon.
2:32
All right.
2:32
So a nucleophilic attack.
2:34
And kick these electrons off onto our oxygen.
2:38
So that's our first step-- the nucleophilic attack portion.
2:41
So now, we have R. And it used to have
2:45
2 bonds to carbon and oxygen.
2:46
Now, it has only 1 bond because those electrons
2:49
moved off onto the oxygen, giving the oxygen
2:52
a negative 1 formal charge.
2:54
Like that.
2:55
So we added on our hydrogen.
2:57
Like that.
2:58
And then, we still have our O and our R prime group
3:02
over here.
3:02
So it will look like that.
3:04
In the next step of this reaction,
3:07
the carbonyl's going to reform.
3:09
So the electrons in here are going to kick back into here
3:12
to reform our carbonyl.
3:14
That would mean 5 bonds to carbon--
3:16
which we know never happens-- so that these electrons are going
3:18
to have to break and come off onto the oxygen.
3:22
So let's go ahead and draw the results of that.
3:24
So now, we have R bonded to carbon.
3:27
Now, we reformed our carbonyls.
3:29
Now, we have only two lone pairs of electrons
3:31
on that oxygen now.
3:32
And then, we still have a hydrogen.
3:34
Right here.
3:35
All right.
3:35
So we lost an oxygen with an R prime group.
3:40
And that oxygen is going to have three lone pairs around it
3:43
with a negative 1 formal charge.
3:44
Oxygen being relatively electronegative,
3:47
it can handle that formal charge fairly well
3:49
and be relatively stable.
3:51
So now we have an aldehyde.
3:53
And we know that this reaction can occur again
3:57
with an aldehyde.
3:58
So since you have extra lithium aluminum hydride floating
4:01
around, what's going to happen is another reaction.
4:03
Right?
4:04
So another reaction just like the one we just did.
4:07
We're going to have our lithium aluminum hydride again.
4:11
It's so reactive, you can't stop this reaction
4:14
from occurring a second time.
4:16
And same idea.
4:18
Right?
4:18
Exact same idea.
4:20
Partial negative oxygen, partial positive carbon.
4:23
The carbon wants electrons.
4:27
It's going to get these electrons right in here.
4:30
So these electrons are going to attack this carbon, bring
4:33
the hydrogen along with it, and then
4:35
these electrons kick off onto the oxygen.
4:38
So let's go ahead and draw the product
4:40
of that nucleophilic attack.
4:42
Right now, we have an R group here
4:44
and we have our carbon bonded to an oxygen.
4:47
Once again, it used to have two lone pairs.
4:49
Now it has three, giving it a negative 1 formal charge.
4:52
And this hydrogen over here on the right
4:54
is going to stay here.
4:55
And we added on another hydrogen.
4:57
Like that.
4:58
All right.
4:58
So in the second step of this reaction,
5:01
we're going to add water.
5:03
So we go back up here to refresh our memory.
5:05
In the second step of this reaction,
5:08
you add water as a proton source.
5:11
So let's go ahead and draw water floating around there.
5:15
So here is our H20 molecule.
5:17
And we're going to get an acid-base reaction.
5:20
We're going to get a lone pair of electrons
5:23
attacking and grabbing that proton
5:25
there, kicking these electrons off onto the oxygen.
5:28
So we're going to protonate that alkoxide anion.
5:31
So you form our alcohol finally.
5:34
So we're finally done.
5:35
Now, we have r and then we have oxygen bonded
5:37
to that hydrogen there.
5:39
And now only two lone pairs, the formal charge goes away.
5:42
And you can see what we've done here.
5:44
We've actually added on two hydrogens
5:48
to our original carbonyl carbon.
5:50
All right.
5:52
This is my original carbonyl carbon.
5:54
And if I look at it over here, there's
5:57
actually no hydrogen attached to it over here.
5:59
Both of those hydrogens came from our lithium aluminum
6:03
hydride.
6:04
So this one and this one.
6:06
So the reaction happened twice.
6:09
All right.
6:09
So if you're doing this reaction with a carboxylic acid,
6:13
it's a similar mechanism.
6:15
We don't have time to go through it.
6:16
But you're going to end up with the same product.
6:20
You're going to add on two hydrogens
6:22
on to that original carbonyl carbon.
6:24
Like that.
6:25
So let's look at the chemoselectivity
6:28
of this reaction.
6:29
OK.
6:29
So now that we've covered sodium borohydride and lithium
6:32
aluminum hydride, let's see how you
6:35
can choose which one of those reagents is the best to use.
6:38
So if I start here with our reactants-- so let's
6:43
make it a benzene ring.
6:44
Like that.
6:45
And let's put stuff on the benzene ring.
6:47
OK.
6:47
So let's go ahead and put a double bond here.
6:50
And then, we'll make this an aldehyde functional group
6:53
on one end.
6:54
And then over here on this end, I'm going to put an ester.
7:00
Like that.
7:01
And let's look at how we can selectively
7:06
transform different parts of this molecule using
7:08
different reagents.
7:10
So let's say we were to do a reaction wherein
7:15
we add on sodium borohydride.
7:18
And then, the proton source in the second step.
7:22
So we need to think about what's going to happen.
7:25
Sodium borohydride is selective for aldehydes and ketones only.
7:30
It will not reduce carboxylic acids or esters.
7:34
So it's only going to react with the aldehyde at the top right
7:39
portion of this molecule.
7:41
So let's see if we can draw this in here.
7:43
So it's going to react with the aldehyde in the top right
7:46
portion.
7:47
All right.
7:47
So we are still going to have our double bond here.
7:51
And the aldehyde's going to go away to form a primary alcohol.
7:56
So we're going to get primary alcohol
7:58
where the aldehyde used to be.
7:59
Sodium borohydride has reduced that carbonyl.
8:02
And the second step-- the protonation of the alkyloxide--
8:04
forms your primary alcohol as your product.
8:07
And the rest of the molecule's going to stay the same.
8:10
So this ester is going to remain untouched down here.
8:13
So it's the chemoselectivity of that reaction.
8:17
All right.
8:17
Let's say we start with the same starting material.
8:21
And the first step-- this time we
8:22
add lithium aluminum hydride.
8:24
Like that.
8:25
And the second step-- we add some water.
8:29
Well, lithium aluminum hydride will
8:31
reduce aldehydes and ketones, and it will also reduce esters.
8:36
So lithium aluminum hydride in excess--
8:38
so let's just assume this is at an excess
8:40
here-- it's going to react with this aldehyde portion
8:44
of the molecule.
8:45
It's also going to react with this ester
8:47
portion of the molecule.
8:48
So it's going to reduce both of those and form alcohol.
8:51
So let's go ahead and try to draw the product here.
8:53
All right.
8:53
So we have our benzene ring, which is untouched.
8:56
And up here, we know that lithium aluminum hydride
9:01
is going to form a primary alcohol as well.
9:03
Like that.
9:04
And then, down here, what used to be our ester functional
9:08
group, we're going to add two molar equivalents of hydrogen
9:11
to that carbonyl.
9:12
And we're going to end up breaking
9:16
that bond between the carbonyl carbon and that oxygen.
9:20
All of this over here is going to go away
9:22
as a leaving group in our mechanism.
9:24
And we're going to add on two hydrogens to that carbon.
9:29
And then, that's going to form our alcohol.
9:31
So we're going to add two hydrogens onto that carbon,
9:34
forming a primary alcohol down here as well-- just
9:37
like in the mechanism that we just discussed.
9:39
So reduction of esters using lithium aluminum hydride.
9:43
What about if we were to add a hydrogen gas
9:47
and palladium as our metal catalyst here?
9:51
Well, this is also a reduction reaction
9:54
that we talked about earlier.
9:55
Hydrogenation is an example of a reduction reaction.
9:59
And it's going to be chemoselective.
10:01
If you just used the normal conditions for a hydrogenation
10:05
reaction, the only thing the hydrogenation reaction
10:08
is going to touch is this double bond.
10:10
It's going to reduce this double bond.
10:13
So let's go ahead and draw the product.
10:14
It's not going to touch the aldehyde.
10:16
It's not going to touch the ester.
10:17
And it's not going to touch the benzene ring.
10:19
So let's go ahead and draw the product.
10:21
The benzene ring is not hydrogenated
10:25
under normal conditions, but we're
10:27
going to add on two hydrogens across that double bond.
10:30
And the aldehyde is untouched.
10:32
And down here, the ester is going to be untouched as well.
10:37
So that would be our product from a hydrogenation.
10:40
So three different reductions, three different products.
10:44
Now, hydrogen will reduce carbonyls
10:47
under the right conditions.
10:48
Usually, if you have increased pressure and increased
10:51
temperatures, you actually can reduce those carbonyls.
10:55
But again, you can control those conditions.
10:58
So you can control what part of the molecule is reduced.
11:01
So that sums up the ways to reduce carbonyl compounds using
11:07
sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride.
11:10
In the next video or two, we'll take a look
11:12
at organometallics and particularly
11:14
the Grignard reagent.","At 9:50, the guy drops the Oxygen bond to the rest of the ester molecule...

How does that happen?"

In your mathematical careers you might
0:03
encounter people who say it is wrong to say
0:05
that i is equal to the principal square root of negative 1.
0:10
And if you ask them why is this wrong,
0:12
they'll show up with this kind of line of logic
0:15
that actually seems pretty reasonable.
0:17
They will tell you that, OK, well
0:19
let's just start with negative 1.
0:21
We know from definition that negative 1
0:23
is equal to i times i.
0:26
Everything seems pretty straightforward right now.
0:28
And then they'll say, well look, if you
0:30
take this, if you assume this part right here,
0:33
then we can replace each of these i's with the square root
0:36
of negative 1.
0:36
And they'd be right.
0:37
So then this would be the same thing
0:39
as the square root of negative 1 times the square root
0:42
of negative 1.
0:43
And then they would tell you that,
0:45
hey, look just from straight up properties
0:48
of the principal square root function,
0:50
they'll tell you that the square root of a times b
0:53
is the same thing as the principal square root
0:55
of a times the principal square root of b.
0:58
And so if you have the principal square root of a times
1:01
the principal square root of b, that's
1:02
the same thing as the square root of a times b.
1:04
So based on this property of the radical of the principal root,
1:09
they'll say that this over here is
1:11
the same thing as the square root
1:13
of negative 1 times negative 1.
1:20
If I have the principal root of the product of two things,
1:23
that's the same thing as the product
1:24
of each of their principal roots.
1:26
I'm doing this in the other order here.
1:28
Here I have the principal root of the products,
1:30
over here I have this on the right.
1:32
And then from that we all know that negative 1 times
1:35
negative 1 is 1.
1:36
So this should be equal to the principal square root of 1.
1:41
And then the principal square root of 1-- Remember,
1:44
this radical means principal square root,
1:45
positive square root, that is just going to be positive 1.
1:51
And they'll say, this is wrong.
1:52
Clearly, negative 1 and positive 1 are not the same thing.
1:59
And they'll argue therefore, you can't make this substitution
2:02
that we did in this step.
2:04
And what you should then point out
2:06
is that this was not the incorrect step.
2:09
That it is true negative 1 is not equal to 1,
2:11
but the faulty line of reasoning here
2:13
was in using this property when both a and b are negative.
2:21
If both a and b are negative, this will never be true.
2:26
So a and b both cannot be negative.
2:36
In fact normally when this property is given-- sometimes
2:38
it's given a little bit in the footnotes
2:40
or you might not even notice it because it's not relevant
2:42
when you're learning it the first time--
2:43
but they'll usually give a little bit of a constraint
2:45
there.
2:45
They'll usually say for a and b greater than or equal to 0.
2:52
So that's where they list this property.
2:53
This is true for a and b greater than or equal 0.
2:56
And in particular, it's false if both a and b are both,
3:00
if they are both negative.
3:03
Now, I've just spent the last three minutes
3:07
saying that people who tell you that this is wrong are wrong.
3:11
But with that said, I will say that you
3:12
have to be a little bit careful about it.
3:16
When we take traditional principal square roots.
3:19
So when you take the principle square root of 4.
3:22
We know that this is positive 2, that 4 actually
3:24
has two square roots.
3:26
There's negative 2 also is a square root of 4.
3:34
If you have negative 2 times negative 2
3:36
it's also equal to 4.
3:38
This radical symbol here means principal square root.
3:42
Or when we're just dealing with real numbers, non
3:44
imaginary, non complex numbers, you
3:46
could really view it as the positive square root.
3:48
This has two square roots, positive and negative 2.
3:50
If you have this radical symbol right here
3:52
principal square roots, it means the positive square root of 2.
3:57
So when you start thinking about taking
3:59
square roots of negative numbers--
4:01
or even in the future we'll do imaginary numbers
4:03
and complex numbers and all the rest--
4:05
you have to expand the definition
4:07
of what this radical means.
4:08
So when you are taking the square root of really
4:12
of any negative number, you're really
4:16
saying that this is no longer the traditional principal
4:19
square root function.
4:20
You're now talking that this is the principal complex square
4:24
root function, or this is now defined
4:25
for complex inputs or the domain,
4:28
it can also generate imaginary or complex outputs,
4:31
or I guess you could call that the range.
4:34
And if you assume that, then really straight
4:36
from this you get that negative, the square root of negative x
4:42
is going to be equal to i times the square root of x.
4:47
And this is only-- and I'm going to make this clear
4:49
because I just told you that this will be false
4:51
if both a and b are negative.
4:52
So this is only true-- So we could
4:55
apply this when x is greater than or equal to 0.
5:06
So if x is greater than or equal to 0,
5:08
then negative x is clearly a negative number,
5:10
or I guess it could also be 0.
5:12
It's a negative number.
5:13
And then we can apply this right over here.
5:16
If x was less than 0, then we would
5:18
be doing all of this nonsense up here.
5:20
And we start to get nonsensical answers.
5:23
And if you look at it this way and you say hey,
5:25
look, i can be the square root of negative one,
5:27
if it's the principal branch of the complex square root
5:30
function.
5:31
Then you could rewrite this right over here
5:33
as the square root of negative 1 times the square root of x.
5:41
And so really the real fault in this logic when people
5:45
say, hey, negative 1 can't be equal to 1,
5:48
the real fault is using this property
5:52
when both a and b, where both of these are negative numbers.
5:57
That will come up with something that is unambiguously false.
6:00
If you expand your definition of the complex
6:03
or expand your definition of the principal root
6:05
to include negative numbers in the domain
6:09
and to include imaginary numbers, then you can do this.
6:13
You can say the square root of negative x
6:16
is the square root of negative 1 times--
6:19
Or you should say the principal square root of negative x--
6:22
I should be particular my words--
6:23
is the same thing as the principal square root
6:26
of negative 1 times the principal square root of x when
6:30
x is greater than or equal to 0.
6:32
And I don't want to confuse you, if x
6:34
is greater than or equal to 0, this negative x, that
6:39
is clearly a negative, or I guess
6:41
you should say a non positive number.","If when we normally just say square root we mean the positive result why do we as mathematicians always say ""Square root is actually 2 different things, principal, and negative"" when we will also say ""1^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 1 = 2 so the hypotenuse of a triangle with legs of length 1 is square root 2""?"

In the last video, we talked a little bit
0:02
about the immune system.
0:04
In that video, we focused on the nonspecific or the innate
0:09
immune system.
0:10
So let me write that.
0:17
And even in the nonspecific immune system, we subdivided
0:20
that into kind of the first line barriers.
0:24
And those were things like the skin, or the stomach acid, or
0:30
the acidity of the oils on the outside of your skin.
0:33
These are just natural barriers to not allowing
0:35
things inside of your body, but then once they get in-- so
0:38
you can almost imagine these were the
0:39
first line of defense.
0:42
And then you had your second line of defense, but these are
0:45
still nonspecific-- and when we say nonspecific, it means
0:48
that they don't necessarily know what type of virus, what
0:51
type of protein, what type of bacteria.
0:53
They just know that this thing looks shady.
0:55
Let me eat it up.
0:56
Let me kill it.
0:56
Let me have an inflammatory response.
0:59
So in there, we said, well, there's an inflammatory
1:01
response, which I'm actually going to talk about after we
1:06
do videos on the specific immune system.
1:09
You have your inflammatory response, which really just
1:11
gets things to where the action is at and then you also
1:14
have your phagocytes, which are these cells that are
1:20
engulfing things.
1:22
And just so you know, all the phagocytes that we talked
1:24
about in the last video, these are all instances of white
1:29
blood cells or leukocytes.
1:35
These phagocytes right here, these are all-- I talk about
1:38
dendritic cells and macrophages and neutrophils.
1:43
These were all white blood cells.
1:45
These weren't all the kinds of white blood cells.
1:47
We're about to talk about more-- and the other word for
1:50
white blood cell is also leukocyte.
1:55
So that is nonspecific.
1:57
Well, one, it just doesn't let you in, but then when you're
1:59
in, it says, hey, you're just shady.
2:01
I'm going to eat you up.
2:02
I have receptors.
2:03
You have some double stranded DNA floating around.
2:06
Only viruses have double strand DNA.
2:08
I'm going to eat you up.
2:08
I don't know what type of virus you are.
2:10
I don't know if I've seen you before or not.
2:12
That's why it's nonspecific.
2:14
Now the really interesting thing about our immune
2:16
system-- and this nonspecific, this exists across many, many,
2:22
many species and types of organisms. But the specific is
2:28
kind of a-- it's thought to be a newer adaptation.
2:32
What I'm going to talk about is the specific immune system
2:34
that's particular to humans.
2:41
That's our other classification.
2:42
Let me do it like that.
2:45
So then you have your specific-- or you can imagine
2:50
it's an adaptive immune system.
2:52
You've probably heard of things like that.
2:54
I have resistance to that bacteria or that virus.
3:00
So this is adaptive.
3:03
And it's really all based on having exposure to things.
3:06
And within the specific immune system, we talked a little--
3:12
when we talked about the antigen presenting molecules
3:16
that phagocytes do-- that plays a role in this.
3:18
We're going to go into more detail, but I don't want to
3:20
confuse you.
3:21
But the main actors here are called lymphocytes, not to be
3:24
confused with leukocytes-- because they still are
3:26
leukocytes.
3:28
So let me write this down.
3:38
These are specific.
3:40
Phagocytes, for the most part, are nonspecific, but both of
3:44
these are white blood cells.
3:45
Lymphocytes are another type of white
3:47
blood cell or leukocyte.
3:49
Don't want to confuse you with this convoluted diagram, but I
3:53
just want to make the terminology clear.
3:54
When someone talks about a white blood cell, they're
3:56
really just talking about a set of cells that when people
3:58
first tried to separate the components of blood-- you'd
4:01
have your red blood cells that would kind of settle in the
4:03
bottom, then you'd have this layer of white frothy stuff in
4:06
the middle that was really made of white blood cells, and
4:08
then on the top, you had the fluid, the plasma from your
4:11
blood, kind of the watery part.
4:13
So that's where the name came from, but they have different
4:15
roles, but they interact with each other.
4:17
Now lymphocytes can be divided into B lymphocytes, usually
4:24
referred to as B cells-- and T lymphocytes.
4:36
And the B and T just come from where they're developed.
4:39
B lymphocytes were first recognized in
4:42
the bursa of Fabricius.
4:44
That's why it's called B.
4:45
That's actually a part of birds that participate in the
4:48
immune system.
4:49
And so the B came from bursa, but B also applies to the
4:52
human immune system because it's produced in bone marrow.
4:56
So that might be an easier way to remember.
4:58
It's produced in bone marrow.
5:01
It's developed in bone marrow, but historically, the B came
5:08
from the bursa of Fabricius, just in case you want to know.
5:11
But it's easy to remember.
5:12
The B could also stand for bone marrow because that's
5:14
where it's produced.
5:16
T lymphocytes actually do start off in the bone marrow,
5:18
but they mature and become what they are in the thymus.
5:22
So that's where the T comes from.
5:26
Now in this video, I'm going to focus just on the B
5:29
lymphocytes-- because frankly, if I focused on everything, it
5:31
would be an hour-long video.
5:32
But the B lymphocytes frankly on some level-- well, I don't
5:36
want to pick and choose favorites, but something in my
5:39
brain-- I just really like the B lymphocytes.
5:41
So the B lymphocytes participate in what's called
5:44
the humoral response.
5:49
And I'll tell you what humoral means in a second.
5:58
You'll see that T lymphocytes participate in what's called
6:00
the cell mediated response and we're going to do that in a
6:02
future video.
6:07
They actually do certain classes of T lymphocytes.
6:10
We'll see that there are helper T cells and there are
6:15
cytotoxic T cells.
6:16
I know it's all very confusing the first time you see it, but
6:19
that's why I just want to focus on just
6:21
this part right here.
6:22
We're going to see in the future that the helper T cells
6:25
play a role in amplifying and really activating
6:28
this humoral response.
6:30
But a simple way to think about the difference between
6:33
the humoral response and the cell mediated response is,
6:36
when I get infected-- let's say I get
6:38
infected by a virus, right?
6:45
At first, when a virus comes into my system, it's just
6:48
floating around in the fluids in my system.
6:51
The fluids of our system-- that's really what humoral
6:54
responds to, into the humoral fluids of your body.
6:59
So you have your viruses.
7:05
These are little viruses floating around.
7:08
So while they're floating around and they're not sitting
7:11
inside of cells, that's where the humoral response
7:17
can come into play.
7:18
Same thing if we have little bacteria floating around and
7:22
they haven't infiltrated cells yet.
7:23
They're just floating around in the fluid, then the humoral
7:27
response can be useful for that.
7:31
Now if all of a sudden, these guys have infiltrated cells--
7:37
so if the cells are now infected with the virus and
7:40
they're producing the viruses using the mechanisms of the
7:43
cell to produce more, then all of a sudden we have to be a
7:46
little bit more sophisticated in how we deal with these
7:49
cells and how we deal with the viruses because they're not
7:52
just going to be floating around anymore.
7:53
We probably want to just kill this cell even though it was
7:56
one of our own, but now it's helping to make viruses.
7:59
Or maybe it's been colonized by bacteria.
8:02
So in either case, you want to kill this.
8:03
And we'll talk more about that in the cell mediating.",Why don't non-specific cells know what virus/bacteria they are fighting?

The function f of x is graphed.
0:03
What is its domain?
0:05
So the way it's graphed right over here,
0:06
we could assume that this is the entire function
0:08
definition for f of x.
0:11
So for example, if we say, well, what
0:12
does f of x equal when x is equal to negative 9?
0:14
Well, we go up here.
0:15
We don't see it's graphed here.
0:16
It's not defined for x equals negative 9 or x equals
0:20
negative 8 and 1/2 or x equals negative 8.
0:22
It's not defined for any of these values.
0:24
It only starts getting defined at x equals negative 6.
0:29
At x equals negative 6, f of x is equal to 5.
0:32
And then it keeps getting defined. f of x
0:34
is defined for x all the way from x equals
0:37
negative 6 all the way to x equals 7.
0:40
When x equals 7, f of x is equal to 5.
0:43
You can take any x value between negative 6,
0:45
including negative 6, and positive 7,
0:48
including positive 7, and you just
0:50
have to see-- you just have to move up
0:52
above that number, wherever you are,
0:54
to find out what the value of the function is at that point.
0:59
So the domain of this function definition?
1:03
Well, f of x is defined for any x that
1:06
is greater than or equal to negative 6.
1:08
Or we could say negative 6 is less than or equal to x,
1:11
which is less than or equal to 7.
1:13
If x satisfies this condition right over here,
1:16
the function is defined.
1:19
So that's its domain.
1:20
So let's check our answer.
1:21
Let's do a few more of these.
1:24
The function f of x is graphed.
1:26
What is its domain?
1:27
Well, exact similar argument.
1:29
This function is not defined for x is negative 9, negative 8,
1:33
all the way down or all the way up I should say to negative 1.
1:36
At negative 1, it starts getting defined.
1:39
f of negative 1 is negative 5.
1:42
So it's defined for negative 1 is less than or equal to x.
1:45
And it's defined all the way up to x equals 7,
1:48
including x equals 7.
1:50
So this right over here, negative 1
1:51
is less than or equal to x is less than or equal to 7,
1:54
the function is defined for any x that
1:56
satisfies this double inequality right over here.
2:00
Let's do a few more.
2:02
The function f of x is graphed.
2:04
What is its range?
2:06
So now, we're not thinking about the x's
2:08
for which this function is defined.
2:10
We're thinking about the set of y values.
2:14
Where do all of the y values fall into?
2:17
Well, let's see.
2:18
The lowest possible y value or the lowest possible value
2:22
of f of x that we get here looks like it's 0.
2:25
The function never goes below 0.
2:29
So f of x-- so 0 is less than or equal to f of x.
2:32
It does equal 0 right over here. f of negative 4 is 0.
2:36
And then the highest y value or the highest value
2:38
that f of x obtains in this function definition is 8.
2:42
f of 7 is 8.
2:44
It never gets above 8, but it does equal 8 right over here
2:47
when x is equal to 7.
2:48
So 0 is less than f of x, which is less than or equal to 8.
2:55
So that's its range.
2:57
Let's do a few more.
2:58
This is kind of fun.
2:59
The function f of x is graphed.
3:01
What is its domain?
3:02
So once again, this function is defined for negative 2.
3:06
Negative 2 is less than or equal to x, which is less than
3:09
or equal to 5.
3:11
If you give me an x anywhere in between negative 2 and 5,
3:14
I can look at this graph to see where the function is defined.
3:17
f of negative 2 is negative 4.
3:19
f of negative 1 is negative 3.
3:22
So on and so forth, and I can even
3:23
pick the values in between these integers.
3:26
So negative 2 is less than or equal to x, which is less than
3:29
or equal to 5.","So for functions, using x and y as examples, if x is the input and y is the output; is it you can't have the same y or is it you can't have the same x?"

You can ride your bike 1/5 of a mile per minute.
0:05
If it takes you 3 and 1/3 minutes
0:07
to get to your friend's house, how many miles
0:09
away does your friend live?
0:12
And this here is pictures of these guys on bicycles.
0:14
It's pretty clear they're not riding to work,
0:16
or some of these guys aren't even riding a bicycle.
0:18
But let's focus on the question.
0:20
So you can ride your bike 1/5 of a mile per minute.
0:24
And you're going to do this for 3 and 1/3
0:26
minutes-- times 3 and 1/3.
0:29
So we really have to figure out, how
0:31
do we multiply 1/5 times 3 and 1/3?
0:36
So there's a couple of ways to think about it.
0:38
You could literally view a 3 and 1/3 as this is the same thing
0:42
as 1/5 times 3 plus 1/3.
0:49
That's exactly what 3 and 1/3 is.
0:52
And then we can just apply the distributive property.
0:55
This would be 1/5 times 3-- I'm going
1:00
to keep the colors the same-- plus 1/5 times 1/3.
1:11
And this is going to be equal to-- well,
1:13
we could rewrite 1/5 times 3 as 1/5 times 3/1.
1:20
That's what 3 really is if we wrote it as a fraction.
1:23
And then, of course, we're going to have plus 1/5 times 1/3.
1:31
And let's just think about what each of these evaluate to.
1:34
Here you multiplied the numerators,
1:35
and you multiplied the denominators.
1:37
So this is going to be equal to 1 times 3 over 5 times 1.
1:42
And this business right over here
1:44
is going to be-- and remember, order of operations.
1:46
We want to do our multiplication first.
1:49
So this is going to be 1 times 1 over 5 times 3.
1:56
And so that's going to be equal to 3/5 plus 1/15.
2:05
And now we have different denominators here.
2:07
But lucky for us, 3/5, if we multiplied
2:09
the numerator and the denominator by 3,
2:12
we're going to get a denominator of 15.
2:14
And so that's equal to 9/15 plus 1/15, which equals 10/15.
2:22
And if you divide the numerator and the denominator both by 5,
2:25
you're going to get 2/3.
2:27
So your friend lives 2/3 miles away from your house.
2:30
Well, that's kind of interesting.
2:32
And this was kind of a long way to do it.
2:34
Let's think about if there's a simpler way to do it.
2:37
So this is the same thing as 1/5 times--
2:40
and I'm just going to write 3 and 1/3 as a mixed number.
2:44
So it's 1/5 times 3 and 1/3 can be rewritten as 9/3-- sorry,
2:50
I'm going to rewrite 3 and 1/3 as an improper fraction.
2:53
So this is the same thing as 9/3--
2:55
that's 3-- plus 1/3, which is the same thing as 1/5-- well, I
3:01
switched colors arbitrarily-- which
3:03
is the same thing-- I'm still on the same color-- as 1/5
3:09
times 9/3 plus 1/3 is 10/3.
3:16
And now we can just multiply the numerator
3:17
and multiply the denominator-- or multiply the numerators.

- [Instructor] Let's compare the structures
0:01
of ethane and ethene.
0:03
Ethane is an alkane with an A-N-E ending,
0:07
and it has the molecular formula C2H6.
0:13
Ethene is an alkene with an E-N-E ending,
0:17
and it has the molecular formula C2H4.
0:22
For two carbons,
0:23
six hydrogens is the maximum number that you can have,
0:26
so we say that ethane is completely saturated
0:30
with hydrogens.
0:32
If we look at ethene,
0:33
we only have four hydrogens for two carbons,
0:36
so we say that ethene is unsaturated.
0:40
So, for two carbons, it's possible to have more,
0:44
so this is unsaturated.
0:46
Next, let's look at the carbons present in both molecules.
0:50
We'll start with ethane.
0:52
This carbon is sp3 hybridized,
0:54
and so is this one,
0:55
so ethane contains two sp3 hybridized carbons.
1:01
And we know the geometry around sp3 hybridized carbon
1:05
is tetrahedral.
1:07
So we should have tetrahedral geometry
1:10
around both of these carbons.
1:13
For ethene,
1:14
let me use a different color here,
1:16
so this carbon and this carbon are both sp2 hybridized.
1:20
So sp2 hybridized carbons.
1:23
And we know the geometry around an sp2 hybridized carbon
1:27
is trigonal planar.
1:28
So, there's planar geometry around both of these carbons.
1:33
Finally, let's look at the bonding between the two carbons.
1:38
So, for ethane, this sigma bond between the two carbons
1:42
has some free rotation.
1:44
So different confirmations of the ethane molecule
1:47
are possible.
1:48
So we have free rotation.
1:50
Free rotation about the sigma bonds
1:53
between our two carbon atoms.
1:56
But for ethene, if we look at those two carbon atoms,
1:59
so this one and this one,
2:00
there's a double bond between those two carbons.
2:04
And we know that there's no free rotation
2:07
around a double bond.
2:08
So there's no free rotations.
2:12
You're not gonna get different confirmations for ethene,
2:17
so no free rotation, no confirmations.
2:20
That affects the structure of your alkenes.
2:24
On the left is ethane,
2:25
and if we look at our two sp3 hybridized carbons,
2:28
we can see the tetrahedral geometry around them.
2:31
And for the sigma bonds between those two carbons,
2:34
we know there's free rotation.
2:36
So here I am rotating the molecule
2:38
to show different confirmations of ethane.
2:41
For ethene, or ethylene, our two sp2 hybridized carbons
2:45
have planar geometry around them,
2:47
so if I rotate this molecule to the side here,
2:50
you can see that it is planar,
2:52
and there's no free rotation because of this double bond,
2:55
because of the presence of a pi bond.
2:57
So, here I am trying to rotate the model set
3:00
and you can see that the molecule does not rotate.
3:05
You can classify alkenes
3:06
according to their degrees of substitution.
3:09
If you take ethene, and you take a hydrogen off,
3:12
and you add-on an R group,
3:13
you now have a monosubstituted alkene.
3:17
So, on the right is an example of a monosubstituted alkene.
3:21
If I put in the hydrogens,
3:22
it might be a little bit more obvious.
3:24
We know that this carbon has two hydrogens
3:27
and we know that this carbon has one.
3:30
We have an alkyl group coming off of this carbon,
3:33
a methyl group,
3:34
and so this is an example of a monosubstituted alkene.
3:38
If I want to name this alkene,
3:40
we saw how to name them in an earlier video.
3:43
We would make this carbon one, this is carbon two,
3:46
and this is carbon three.
3:48
So, longest carbon chain, including our alkene,
3:51
and a three carbon alkene is called propene.
3:55
Let me write that down here.
3:57
So this is propene.
3:59
Next, let's look at a disubstituted alkene.
4:02
So now we're talking about two R groups.
4:05
Here I've put an R and R prime.
4:08
An R and R prime might be the same,
4:10
or they might be different.
4:12
Here, R and R prime are on the same carbon,
4:16
but it's possible to have a disubstituted alkene
4:18
where R and R prime are bonded to different carbons.
4:24
And then another example
4:25
of a disubstituted alkene on the right here,
4:28
so R and R prime are bonded to different carbons,
4:31
but notice a difference.
4:32
These two R groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.
4:36
So this and this one are on opposite sides,
4:38
whereas in this example, if I draw a line right here,
4:42
both R groups are on the same side of the double bond,
4:46
and we know that one of these
4:47
doesn't rotate to form the other,
4:49
because there's no free rotation around our double bond.
4:53
So here we have three examples of disubstituted alkenes.
4:57
Let's look at this one down here and let's name it.
5:00
So find our longest carbon chain
5:02
that includes our double bond,
5:04
and I wanna give the lowest number possible
5:06
to our double bond,
5:07
so we're gonna start right here at carbon one,
5:09
this is carbon two, and this is carbon three.
5:12
So three carbon alkene is called propene,
5:15
and we have a methyl group coming off carbon two,
5:19
so this would be 2-Methylpropene.
5:24
In terms of which type of disubstituted alkene this is,
5:27
let's go ahead and draw in our hydrogens
5:28
so it's a little bit easier to see.
5:30
So, for this carbon, there are two hydrogens bonded to it,
5:34
and then for the carbon on the left,
5:36
it has a methyl group and another methyl group.
5:39
So, two R groups that happen to be the same.
5:42
So that's this example of a disubstituted alkene,
5:44
where both of our R groups are bonded to one carbon.
5:50
Now let's look at a trisubstituted alkene.
5:53
So, we have three R groups.
5:55
R, R prime, and R double prime.
5:58
And again, R, R prime, and R double prime
6:00
might be the same, or they might be different.
6:03
So here's an example of a trisubstituted alkene.
6:07
Let me go ahead and draw in the hydrogen on this carbon,
6:11
so it's easier to see that we have three R groups
6:14
bonded to the double bonds.
6:17
If I want to name it,
6:19
I need to find the longest carbon chain
6:21
that includes my double bond,
6:23
so this would be carbon one,
6:24
this would be carbon two, three, four, and five.
6:28
So a five carbon alkene is called pentene,
6:32
so let me write that in here,
6:34
and our double bond starts at carbon two,
6:37
so this would be 2-Pentene.
6:39
And finally, I have a methyl group coming off of carbon two.
6:43
So, to complete the name, I need 2-Methyl,
6:46
so 2-Methyl-2-Pentene would be the name
6:50
for this trisubstituted alkene.
6:53
Next, let's look at a tetrasubstituted alkene.
6:56
So R, R prime, R double prime, and R triple prime.
6:59
This molecule is actually tetrasubstituted.
7:04
If we find our double bond,
7:05
so this carbon and this carbon, so this top carbon here,
7:09
actually, let's go ahead and name it first,
7:11
and then we'll look at why it's a tetrasubstituted alkene.
7:15
So this would be carbon one,
7:16
and then I have to follow my double bond for carbon two.
7:20
So, we have a cyclohexene derivative.
7:23
Again, we saw this in an earlier video,
7:25
so let me go ahead and write cyclohexene down here.
7:28
So, cyclohexene.
7:30
And we have a methyl group coming off carbon one,
7:33
and a methyl group coming off of carbon two.
7:36
So this would be 1,2-Dimethyl,
7:38
so 1,2-Dimethylcyclohexene would be the name.
7:44
And now, let's look at why it's tetrasubstituted.
7:46
So, let me use a different color here.
7:48
So, for carbon one,
7:50
I have one methyl group coming off on this side,
7:53
and then I have this alkyl group, as part of the ring,
7:56
coming off of that side.
7:58
So that carbon has two R groups bonded to it,
8:01
and carbon two also has two R groups bonded to it.
8:04
So, methyl group here, and again,
8:06
I have this portion of the rings.
8:08
So that's why this is a tetrasubstituted alkene.","Do these R groups start with a carbon, that is, is the explicit carbon in the molecule directly bonded to another carbon in the R group, or could the R group be just anything, such that the explicit carbon is bonded to something in the R group other than a carbon?"

Let's do some equations that deal with absolute values.
0:03
And just as a bit of a review, when you take the absolute
0:06
value of a number.
0:07
Let's say I take the absolute value of negative 1.
0:10
What you're really doing is you're saying, how far is that
0:13
number from 0?
0:16
And in the case of negative 1, if we draw a number line right
0:20
there-- that's a very badly drawn number line.
0:23
If we draw a number line right there, that's 0.
0:26
You have a negative 1 right there.
0:28
Well, it's 1 away from 0.
0:30
So the absolute value of negative 1 is 1.
0:33
And the absolute value of 1 is also 1 away from 0.
0:38
It's also equal to 1.
0:40
So on some level, absolute value is the distance from 0.
0:43
But another, I guess simpler way to think of it, it always
0:46
results in the positive version of the number.
0:48
The absolute value of negative 7,346 is equal to 7,346.
0:59
So with that in mind, let's try to solve some equations
1:02
with absolute values in them.
1:05
So let's say I have the equation the absolute value of
1:08
x minus 5 is equal to 10.
1:14
And one way you can interpret this, and I want you to think
1:16
about this, this is actually saying that the distance
1:18
between x and 5 is equal to 10.
1:23
So how many numbers that are exactly 10 away from 5?
1:26
And you can already think of the solution to this equation,
1:29
but I'll show you how to solve it systematically.
1:31
Now this is going to be true in two situations.
1:36
Either x minus 5 is equal to positive 10.
1:41
If this evaluates out to positive 10, then when you
1:44
take the absolute value of it, you're going to
1:46
get positive 10.
1:48
Or x minus 5 might evaluate to negative 10.
1:53
If x minus 5 evaluated to negative 10, when you take the
1:56
absolute value of it, you would get 10 again.
1:59
So x minus 5 could also be equal to negative 10.
2:04
Both of these would satisfy this equation.
2:07
Now, to solve this one, add 5 to both
2:10
sides of this equation.
2:11
You get x is equal to 15.
2:14
To solve this one, add 5 to both sides of this equation.
2:17
x is equal to negative 5.
2:20
So our solution, there's two x's that
2:23
satisfy this equation.
2:24
x could be 15.
2:26
15 minus 5 is 10, take the absolute value, you're going
2:29
to get 10, or x could be negative 5.
2:32
Negative 5 minus 5 is negative 10.
2:36
Take the absolute value, you get 10.
2:39
And notice, both of these numbers are exactly 10 away
2:43
from the number 5.
2:45
Let's do another one of these.
2:48
Let's do another one.
2:51
Let's say we have the absolute value of x plus
2:54
2 is equal to 6.
2:58
So what does that tell us?
2:59
That tells us that either x plus 2, that the thing inside
3:03
the absolute value sign, is equal to 6.
3:07
Or the thing inside of the absolute value sign, the x
3:10
plus 2, could also be negative 6.
3:12
If this whole thing evaluated to negative 6, you take the
3:13
absolute value, you'd get 6.
3:16
So, or x plus 2 could equal negative 6.
3:20
And then if you subtract 2 from both sides of this
3:22
equation, you get x could be equal to 4.
3:25
If you subtract 2 from both sides of this equation, you
3:29
get x could be equal to negative 8.
3:33
So these are the two solutions to the equation.
3:37
And just to kind of have it gel in your mind, that
3:39
absolute value, you can kind of view it as a distance, you
3:42
could rewrite this problem as the absolute value of x minus
3:46
negative 2 is equal to 6.
3:50
And so this is asking me, what are the x's that are exactly 6
3:55
away from negative 2?
3:57
Remember, up here we said, what are the x's that are
4:00
exactly 10 away from positive 5?
4:03
Whatever number you're subtracting from positive 5,
4:05
these are both 10 away from positive 5.
4:08
This is asking, what is exactly 6 away
4:11
from negative 2?
4:13
And it's going to be 4, or negative 8.
4:15
You could try those numbers out for yourself.
4:17
Let's do another one of these.
4:20
Let's do another one, and we'll do it in purple.
4:25
Let's say we have the absolute value of 4x-- I'm going to
4:30
change this problem up a little bit.
4:31
4x minus 1.
4:33
The absolute value of 4x minus 1, is equal to-- actually,
4:36
I'll just keep it-- is equal to 19.
4:40
So, just like the last few problems, 4x minus 1 could be
4:43
equal to 19.
4:47
Or 4x minus 1 might evaluate to negative 19.
4:51
Because then when you take the absolute value, you're going
4:53
to get 19 again.
4:54
Or 4x minus 1 could be equal to negative 19.
4:59
Then you just solve these two equations.
5:00
Add 1 to both sides of this equation-- we could do them
5:03
simultaneous, even.
5:03
Add 1 to both sides of this, you get 4x is equal to 20.
5:08
Add 1 to both sides of this equation, you get 4x is equal
5:13
to negative 18.
5:15
Divide both sides of this by 4, you get x is equal to 5.
5:20
Divide both sides of this by 4, you get x is equal to
5:23
negative 18/4, which is equal to negative 9/2.
5:31
So both of these x values satisfy the equation.
5:35
Try it out.
5:36
Negative 9/2 times 4.
5:39
This will become a negative 18.
5:41
Negative 18 minus 1 is negative 19.
5:44
Take the absolute value, you get 19.
5:46
You put a 5 here, 4 times 5 is 20.
5:49
Minus 1 is positive 19.
5:51
So you take the absolute value.
5:53
Once again, you'll get a 19.
5:55
Let's try to graph one of these, just for fun.
5:58
So let's say I have y is equal to the absolute
6:03
value of x plus 3.
6:04
So this is a function, or a graph, with an
6:07
absolute value in it.
6:09
So let's think about two scenarios.
6:11
There's one scenario where the thing inside of the absolute
6:14
value is positive.
6:16
So you have the scenario where x plus 3-- I'll write it over
6:19
here-- x plus 3 is greater than 0.
6:23
And then you have the scenario where x plus 3 is less than 0.
6:29
When x plus 3 is greater than 0, this graph, or this line--
6:35
or I guess we can't call it a line-- this function, is the
6:37
same thing as y is equal to x plus 3.
6:41
If this thing over here is greater than 0, then the
6:44
absolute value sign is irrelevant.
6:46
So then this thing is the same thing as y is
6:48
equal to x plus 3.
6:50
But when is x plus 3 greater than 0?
6:52
Well, if you subtract 3 from both sides, you get x is
6:57
greater than negative 3.
6:59
So when x is greater than negative 3, this graph is
7:03
going to look just like y is equal to x plus 3.
7:08
Now, when x plus 3 is less than 0.
7:11
When the situation where this-- the inside of our
7:14
absolute value sign-- is negative, in that situation
7:18
this equation is going to be y is equal to the
7:22
negative of x plus 3.
7:26
How can I say that?
7:27
Well, look, if this is going to be a negative number, if x
7:30
plus 3 is going to be a negative number-- that's what
7:33
we're assuming here-- if it's going to be a negative number,
7:36
then when you take the absolute value of a negative
7:38
number, you're going to make it positive.
7:40
That's just like multiplying it by negative 1.
7:43
If you know you're taking the absolute value of a negative
7:45
number, it's just like multiplying it by negative 1,
7:48
because you're going to make it positive.
7:51
And this is going to be the situation.
7:53
x plus 3 is less than 0.
7:55
If we subtract 3 from both sides, when x is less than
7:59
negative 3.
8:01
So when x is less than negative 3, the graph will
8:03
look like this.
8:05
When x is greater than negative 3, the graph will
8:08
look like that.
8:09
So let's see what that would make the
8:11
entire graph look like.
8:13
Let me draw my axes.
8:21
That's my x-axis, that's my y-axis.
8:26
So just let me multiply this out, just so we have it in mx
8:29
plus b form.
8:29
So this is equal to negative x minus 3.
8:36
So let's just figure out what this graph would
8:37
look like in general.
8:38
Negative x minus 3.
8:42
The y-intercept is negative 3, so 1, 2, 3.
8:47
And negative x means it slopes downward, has a
8:51
downward slope of 1.
8:52
So it would look like this.
8:56
The x-intercept would be at x is equal to--.
9:02
So if you say y is equal to 0, that would happen when x is
9:07
equal to negative 3.
9:08
So it's going to go through that line,
9:10
that point right there.
9:11
And the graph, if we didn't have this constraint right
9:14
here, would look something like this.
9:19
That's if we didn't constrain it to a certain interval on
9:22
the x-axis.
9:23
Now this graph, what does it look like?
9:27
Let's see.
9:27
It has its y-intercept at positive 3.
9:31
Just like that.
9:33
And where's its x-intecept?
9:35
When y is equal to 0, x is negative 3.
9:37
So it also goes through that point right there, and it has
9:39
a slope of 1.
9:40
So it would look something like this.
9:43
That's what this graph looks like.
9:45
Now, what we figured out is that this absolute value
9:48
function, it looks like this purple graph when x is less
9:52
than negative 3.
9:53
So when x is less than negative 3-- that's x is equal
9:57
to negative 3 right there-- when x is less than negative
9:59
3, it looks like this purple graph.
10:03
Right there.
10:04
So that's when x is less than negative 3.
10:07
But when x is greater than negative 3, it looks like the
10:10
green graph.
10:12
It looks like that.
10:14
So this graph looks like this strange v.
10:17
When x is greater than negative 3, this is positive.
10:21
So we have the graph of-- we have a positive slope.
10:24
But then when x is less than negative 3, we're essentially
10:28
taking the negative of the function, if you want to view
10:30
it that way, and so we have this negative slope.
10:32
So you kind of have this v-shaped function, this
10:35
v-shaped graph, which is indicative of an absolute
10:38
value function.",Why are there two roots for a first degree equation?

0:41
to explain the phenomena,
0:43
all the phenomena,
0:44
of the universe.
0:45
And physicists will the the first to admit
0:47
that they are just beginning to understand
0:49
the nature of reality,
0:51
the nature of everything around us.
0:53
Now a lot of times, we think physics
0:54
is only limited to things like cosmological phenomena
0:59
or getting rockets into space,
1:01
or how waves move or building structures.
1:04
But physics is the foundation for
1:07
all of the other sciences.
1:09
When we think about chemistry,
1:10
when we think about chemistry,
1:12
which is at the end of the day
1:13
interactions between atoms,
1:15
those interactions are really physics-based interactions.
1:18
So chemistry, chemistry is actually laid down
1:22
on a foundation of physics.
1:25
And then even when we think about ourselves,
1:28
our bodies, even our consciousness, our brains,
1:30
it really all boils down to chemistry and physics.
1:35
It boils down to interactions between atoms
1:37
and even mechanical properties of our bodies.
1:40
And so even biology,
1:43
even what we are,
1:45
is built on a foundation of chemistry.
1:49
So this is biology right over here,
1:53
which is built on a foundation of physics,
1:54
which is highly dependent on some of the math
1:57
that you've been learning your whole life
1:59
and that you will continue to learn.
2:00
And that fundamental question that you might have said,
2:03
""Well you know, hey, why am I learning this math?""
2:04
Well one, 'cause the math is beautiful,
2:06
but also you will see that it starts to,
2:08
in almost the most pure way,
2:10
describe the structure of the universe.
2:13
And we're going to see that more and more and more
2:15
as we go into physics.
2:17
All of this complex phenomena
2:19
that you see around us,
2:20
whether we're looking at a galaxy
2:21
or we're looking at ocean waves,
2:22
or we're looking at even biological systems,
2:25
we'll see that a shocking amount of them
2:28
can start to be described using some fairly elegant
2:31
mathematics that we can build on
2:33
and continue to build on.
2:34
Simple or elegant mathematics
2:36
like force is equal to mass times acceleration.
2:40
And we're gonna talk about force and acceleration
2:43
as vector quantities.
2:45
We're gonna think about things like displacement,
2:48
and I'll put it as a vector quantity,
2:50
and we'll soon learn more about vector
2:52
and scalar quantities are.
2:53
Displacement is equal to velocity times time.
2:58
We'll learn things like accelaration
3:00
is equal to change in velocity over change in time.
3:04
What we'll see with even a handful
3:06
of very simple ideas like this.
3:09
We'll go into much more depth in future videos.
3:11
You can explain all sorts of complex phenomena.
3:14
And the one thing that I always loved about physics,
3:16
and I don't think it's always fully appreciated,
3:18
sometimes as you start to learn physics,
3:20
you'll see all these complicated formula,
3:21
all of these kind of complicated problems,
3:24
but it's super valuable to realize
3:27
it's all coming from some of these basic ideas.
3:29
Some of the things that I just mentioned,
3:31
these ideas, we're gonna explore ideas of energy.
3:34
We're going to explore Newton's laws.
3:37
We're going to explain, we're gonna think about
3:39
what are the the different types of forces out there,
3:41
and why they might, why they might actually exist.
3:44
At its essence, it's all about trying to
3:48
explain the complexity of the universe,
3:51
predict what is going to happen
3:52
based on simple ideas.
3:55
And that's what physics is all about.
3:58
Now when we think of physics,
3:59
it's been studied by humanity for a very, very long time.
4:02
In fact, I'm sure we don't know
4:04
who the first physicists were.
4:07
But some of the,
4:08
I guess you could say foundational thinkers
4:11
in physics are these gentlemen that I have here.
4:14
And this is just a...
4:15
You could kind of say
4:16
this is some of the most prominent thinkers in physics,
4:19
but this is by no means a complete list.
4:21
First and foremost, we'd wanna include Isaac Newton.
4:25
Especially when you start to study physics,
4:27
you're starting to understand the world
4:30
as Newton understood it.
4:31
He understood, ""Hey, you know,
4:32
""things don't fall to the ground
4:34
""just 'cause they always fall to,
4:35
""just 'cause that's the way the universe is.
4:37
""That's a force that's acting on it,
4:39
""and maybe that same force that's causing me
4:41
""to be stuck to my chair right now
4:44
""is what keeps Earth orbiting around the Sun
4:46
""or the moon orbiting around the Earth.""
4:50
He developed Law of Gravitation,
4:53
Newton's Laws, and we're going to study that
4:54
as we delve into our basic physics.
4:57
And what we'll see,
4:58
even classical mechanics,
5:00
the physics that Newton established,
5:03
can explain a large range of phenomena
5:05
with amazing precision.
5:07
But as we get into the early 20th century,
5:10
physics starts to get even more wild
5:12
as we start to look at the scales
5:14
of the super small,
5:15
and we have Max Planck giving us quantum mechanics,
5:18
and then we have Albert Einstein
5:20
as we start thinking about super fast speeds,
5:23
the speed of light, and we realize that's an absolute.
5:26
That nothing can travel faster than the speed of light,
5:29
which is this mind-boggling thing
5:31
that we have these notions
5:33
of general and special relativity,
5:35
and we start realizing that the universe
5:37
is in some ways more bizarre, and more mysterious,
5:40
and more fascinating than we ever could have imagined.
5:43
But all of the work, even to understand the modern physics
5:46
of Max Planck and Albert Einstein,
5:49
it's based on a lot of the core ideas
5:52
that were given to us by Isaac Newton,
5:54
even people before Isaac Newton.
5:56
So as you go into your study of physics,
5:58
and I'm kind of a physicist wannabe.
6:01
I wanted to be a physicist.
6:03
I imagined kind of,
6:04
'cause it's all about, we all wonder,
6:06
why are we here?
6:07
What is the nature of reality?
6:09
Why do things happen the way they are?
6:12
And these are the questions that physics
6:14
is attempting to answer.
6:16
And so as you go into your study of physics,
6:19
I wanna leave you with some quotes
6:21
from these three gentlemen.
6:22
So the first two are from Isaac Newton.
6:25
""Truth is ever to be found in simplicity,
6:29
""and not in the multiplicity and the confusion of things.""
6:32
And I really wanted to stress this,
6:34
because a lot of times in your studies,
6:35
you might be finding yourself memorizing formulas
6:37
and vocabulary, but that's,
6:41
if you're doing that, you're just at the very surface.
6:43
But if you really start to think about it,
6:45
really start to think about where these things come from,
6:48
it'll come to simpler and simpler and more intuitive ideas.
6:51
And then, you are getting closer to the truth.
6:54
Now, I love this second quote from Isaac Newton.
6:57
""I do not know what I may appear to...
7:00
""I do not know what I may appear to the world,
7:03
""but to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy
7:07
""playing on the seashore,
7:08
""and diverting myself in now and then
7:11
""finding a smoother pebble
7:12
""or prettier shell than ordinary,
7:14
""whilst the great ocean of truth
7:17
""lay all undiscovered before me.""
7:20
I like to imagine there's so much,
7:22
we, even though we think we know so much,
7:24
that we haven't even learned a small fraction
7:27
of how the universe really is.
7:29
And even a great thinker like Isaac Newton,
7:31
he recognized this.
7:32
He's like, ""Hey, I'm just kind of dabbling
7:34
""into the seashore and picking up a pebble there,
7:36
""but there's this vast ocean
7:37
""that I can't even begin to understand.""
7:39
You can even imagine alien civilizations
7:41
that are thousands of years ahead of us
7:43
technologically or scientifically
7:45
or even millions of years,
7:47
how they might perceive the reality,
7:49
and they might see us as ants
7:50
in that we are just beginning
7:51
to scrape the surface of how the world works.
7:55
This is from Max Planck.
7:56
""When you change the way you look at things,
7:59
""the things you look at change.""
8:01
And I find this to be pretty profound,
8:03
because it is true.
8:04
As you study physics,
8:05
you will start to see, whoa,
8:06
most of what we consider to be reality,
8:08
our current understanding is based
8:09
on these forces, but what are these forces?
8:11
And even these things that we think are solid,
8:14
when we go down to the atomic level,
8:15
we see it's mostly empty space
8:17
and it's really just the interaction of forces
8:18
that make us think that something
8:20
is solid or there or tangible is some way.
8:23
And you realize these very tangible things
8:24
aren't so tangible after all.
8:27
At the end of the day, the whole world
8:28
is just a mental model that we have.
8:31
In some ways,
8:32
it's an illusion
8:34
that our mind creates so that we can operate inside of it.
8:37
But we're just beginning to understand it.
8:40
And last but not least,
8:42
and there's actually a ton of great quotes
8:43
from these folks and others,
8:44
but especially Albert Einstein.
8:46
""The most beautiful experience
8:48
""we can have is the mysterious.
8:50
""It is the fundamental emotion that stands
8:53
""at the cradle of true art and true science.""
8:56
And I really want you to take this to heart
8:58
as you study your physics.
9:00
There will be times where we're going
9:02
to be building our tool kits.
9:03
What's a vector?
9:04
What's a scalar?
9:04
Going into some mathematics,
9:06
proving some formulas.
9:07
Those are the tool kits,
9:09
but then we're gonna try to understand
9:10
fundamental phenomena.
9:12
How does the universe actually work?
9:14
And if when we start to think about these,
9:16
you don't get a few chills on your skin,
9:18
a few goosebumps, and feel that the universe
9:21
is more mysterious than you thought,
9:23
then we're not studying physics
9:25
the say that we should be studying physics.",Do physics problems encourage the discovery of mathematics?

- [Voiceover] I could imagine
0:00
that even the earliest human beings,
0:02
or possibly pre-human beings
0:04
had asked themselves the questions,
0:06
""Why am I here? What is the nature of reality?
0:10
""Why is the universe organized the way that it is?""
0:13
And these questions are what we attempt to answer
0:17
in the field of physics...
0:21
In the field of physics,
0:22
which you could view
0:23
maybe right after mathematics
0:24
as the purest of the sciences.
0:27
So you have math, which is very pure,
0:30
and then on that foundation of math
0:33
you have physics.
0:34
And physics really does try to use that mathematics
0:39
along with some core ideas
0:41
to explain the phenomena,
0:43
all the phenomena,
0:44
of the universe.
0:45
And physicists will the the first to admit

Let's graph ourselves some inequalities.
0:03
So let's say I had the inequality y is less than or
0:06
equal to 4x plus 3.
0:11
On our xy coordinate plane, we want to show all the x and y
0:15
points that satisfy this condition right here.
0:19
So a good starting point might be to break up this less than
0:22
or equal to, because we know how to graph y is
0:24
equal to 4x plus 3.
0:26
So this thing is the same thing as y could be less than
0:31
4x plus 3, or y could be equal to 4x plus 3.
0:38
That's what less than or equal means.
0:41
It could be less than or equal.
0:43
And the reason why I did that on this first example problem
0:46
is because we know how to graph that.
0:47
So let's graph that.
0:52
Try to draw a little bit neater than that.
0:55
So that is-- no, that's not good.
0:57
So that is my vertical axis, my y-axis.
1:02
This is my x-axis, right there.
1:07
And then we know the y-intercept, the
1:09
y-intercept is 3.
1:11
So the point 0, 3-- 1, 2, 3-- is on the line.
1:16
And we know we have a slope of 4.
1:21
Which means if we go 1 in the x-direction, we're going to go
1:25
up 4 in the y.
1:26
So 1, 2, 3, 4.
1:29
So it's going to be right here.
1:31
And that's enough to draw a line.
1:33
We could even go back in the x-direction.
1:35
If we go 1 back in the x-direction, we're
1:37
going to go down 4.
1:38
1, 2, 3, 4.
1:40
So that's also going to be a point on the line.
1:43
So my best attempt at drawing this line is going to look
1:47
something like-- this is the hardest part.
1:52
It's going to look something like that.
1:55
That is a line.
1:57
It should be straight.
1:58
I think you get the idea.
2:00
That right there is the graph of y is equal to 4x plus 3.
2:05
So let's think about what it means to be less than.
2:07
So all of these points satisfy this
2:09
inequality, but we have more.
2:11
This is just these points over here.
2:13
What about all these where y ix less than 4x plus 3?
2:17
So let's think about what this means.
2:20
Let's pick up some values for x.
2:22
When x is equal to 0, what does this say?
2:26
When x is equal to 0, then that means y is going to be
2:29
less than 0 plus 3. y is less than 3.
2:33
When x is equal to negative 1, what is this telling us?
2:40
4 times negative 1 is negative 4, plus 3 is negative 1. y
2:44
would be less than negative 1.
2:46
When x is equal to 1, what is this telling us?
2:50
4 times 1 is 4, plus 3 is 7.
2:54
So y is going to be less than 7.
2:57
So let's at least try to plot these.
2:59
So when x is equal to-- let's plot this one first. When x is
3:04
equal to 0, y is less than 3.
3:11
So it's all of these points here-- that I'm shading in in
3:15
green-- satisfy that right there.
3:19
If I were to look at this one over here, when x is negative
3:22
1, y is less than negative 1.
3:26
So y has to be all of these points down here.
3:30
When x is equal to 1, y is less than 7.
3:36
So it's all of these points down here.
3:39
And in general, you take any point x-- let's say you take
3:44
this point x right there.
3:47
If you evaluate 4x plus 3, you're going to get the point
3:50
on the line.
3:52
That is that x times 4 plus 3.
3:55
Now the y's that satisfy it, it could be equal to that
3:58
point on the line, or it could be less than.
4:01
So it's going to go below the line.
4:03
So if you were to do this for all the possible x's, you
4:06
would not only get all the points on this line which
4:11
we've drawn, you would get all the points below the line.
4:15
So now we have graphed this inequality.
4:19
It's essentially this line, 4x plus 3, with all of the area
4:23
below it shaded.
4:25
Now, if this was just a less than, not less than or equal
4:29
sign, we would not include the actual line.
4:32
And the convention to do that is to actually make the line a
4:36
dashed line.
4:37
This is the situation if we were dealing with just less
4:44
than 4x plus 3.
4:46
Because in that situation, this wouldn't apply, and we
4:49
would just have that.
4:50
So the line itself wouldn't have satisfied it, just the
4:53
area below it.
4:55
Let's do one like that.
4:57
So let's say we have y is greater than negative x
5:06
over 2 minus 6.
5:09
So a good way to start-- the way I like to start these
5:11
problems-- is to just graph this equation right here.
5:14
So let me just graph-- just for fun-- let me graph y is
5:18
equal to-- this is the same thing as negative 1/2 minus 6.
5:24
So if we were to graph it, that is my vertical axis, that
5:30
is my horizontal axis.
5:34
And our y-intercept is negative 6.
5:36
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
5:40
So that's my y-intercept.
5:42
And my slope is negative 1/2.
5:43
Oh, that should be an x there, negative 1/2 x minus 6.
5:49
So my slope is negative 1/2, which means when I go 2 to the
5:53
right, I go down 1.
5:55
So if I go 2 to the right, I'm going to go down 1.
6:02
If I go 2 to the left, if I go negative 2, I'm
6:05
going to go up 1.
6:06
So negative 2, up 1.
6:09
So my line is going to look like this.
6:11
My line is going to look like that.
6:15
That's my best attempt at drawing the line.
6:17
So that's the line of y is equal to
6:19
negative 1/2 x minus 6.
6:22
Now, our inequality is not greater than or equal, it's
6:24
just greater than negative x over 2 minus 6, or greater
6:28
than negative 1/2 x minus 6.
6:30
So using the same logic as before, for any x-- so if you
6:35
take any x, let's say that's our particular x we want to
6:39
pick-- if you evaluate negative x over 2 minus 6,
6:43
you're going to get that point right there.
6:44
You're going to get the point on the line.
6:47
But the y's that satisfy this inequality are the y's
6:50
greater than that.
6:51
So it's going to be not that point-- in fact, you draw an
6:54
open circle there-- because you can't include the point of
6:58
negative 1/2 x minus 6.
7:00
But it's going to be all the y's greater than that.
7:05
That'd be true for any x.
7:06
You take this x.
7:07
You evaluate negative 1/2 or negative x over 2 minus 6,
7:11
you're going to get this point over here.
7:13
The y's that satisfy it are all the y's above that.
7:19
So all of the y's that satisfy this equation, or all of the
7:22
coordinates that satisfy this equation, is this entire area
7:25
above the line.
7:28
And we're not going to include the line.
7:30
So the convention is to make this line into a dashed line.
7:33
And let me draw-- I'm trying my best to turn it into a
7:35
dashed line.
7:36
I'll just erase sections of the line, and hopefully it
7:41
will look dashed to you.
7:43
So I'm turning that solid line into a dashed line to show
7:45
that it's just a boundary, but it's not included in the
7:48
coordinates that satisfy our inequality.
7:51
The coordinates that satisfy our equality are all of this
7:53
yellow stuff that I'm shading above the line.
8:00
Anyway, hopefully you found that helpful.","You grAph the line with the two points, the b the area above the line is shaded because those are the possible us, and vise versa, right?"

If the distance between the plane Ax-2y+z = d and the plane containing the lines,
0:09
and they give us two lines here in three-dimensions,
0:12
if that distance is square-root of 6, then the absolute value of d is...
0:18
So let's think about it for a little bit. They're talking about the distance between this plane and some
0:25
plane that contains these two line.
0:28
So in order to talk realistically about the distance between the planes, those planes will have to be
0:33
parallel, because if they're not parallel - if they intersect with each other, the distance is clearly
0:37
zero, and they're telling us here that the distance is square-root of 6.
0:41
So we have a situation so that the planes can't intersect they must be parallel.
0:46
So you have this plane up here, you have this plane up here, you could call this the equation here
0:53
is ax - 2y + z = d, and then you're going to have another plane, that's going to be parallel to it,
1:01
maybe it looks something like this. You have the other plane that is parallel, and it's going to contain
1:07
both of these lines. So maybe it has this line - so this line is in green, maybe this line looks something
1:14
like this, it's on that blue plane. And then this line, maybe in magenta, is also going to be on the
1:23
blue plane. So how can we figure out the distances?
1:26
Well a good starting point would be to try to figure out the equation for this blue plane here.
1:33
And since these planes are parallel, this equation should look very much like this orange equation -
1:40
at least on the left-hand-side, it might just have a different d-value, and that's because it has the
1:44
exact same inclination. And then once we figure out the equation for this plane over here, then we could
1:52
actually probably figure out what 'a' is, then we could find some point on the blue plane and then use
1:58
our knowledge of finding the distance points and planes to figure out the actual distance from any point
2:05
to this orange plane.
2:07
So let's figure out the equation of this blue plane first, and a good place to start is just to try to
2:12
figure out two vectors on this blue plane, then we can take the cross-product of those two vectors to
2:19
find out a normal to this blue plane, and then use that information to actually figure out the
2:24
equation for the blue plane.
2:26
So let's figure out some points that sit on the blue plane.
2:31
So on this green line right over here you have, see if I want all of these to be equal to zero, you'd
2:37
have the point x is equal to 1, y is equal to 2, z is equal to 3, so you have the point (1,2,3) - that definitely sits
2:46
on the blue plane. Let's come up with another point. let's see if I want all of these to be equal to
2:52
one, I could make this, if I want this to evaluate to two, I'd have the point three, I would have the point,
2:59
if I want this to evaluate to one, I would want five minus two over three, so 3, 5, and then I would want this
3:07
to be seven. Seven minus three over four is also 1, so that's another point, actually both of these points sit on this
3:16
line right over here. 1,2,3 and then 3,5,7. And then let's do the same thing for this - let's find two
3:24
points on this plane, and actually we just need to find one point on this plane, because if you have
3:29
three points that's enough to figure out two different vectors -vectors that aren't scalar multiples
3:35
of each other, which would be enough to figure out the normal to this plane.
3:39
So let's just figure out one more point over here and one more point would be, if we want all of these
3:44
three to be equal to zero, would be the point (2,3,4).
3:52
Because this would be zero, zero, zero. So that's also sitting the plane and that sits on the magenta
3:57
line right over there.
3:59
So let's use these three points to figure out two vectors on the plane that aren't multiples of each
4:03
other, then we can take their cross-product to actually figure out a normal vector to the blue plane.
4:11
So let's say the first vector, 'a', that sits on this plane, let's say it's the difference in the position
4:16
vectors that specify these two points, and then we know that will be on the plane.
4:21
And so that will be three minus one is 2i plus five minus two is 3j, plus seven minus three is 4k.
4:37
So vector 'a' is actually going to sit on this green line, because both of these points are on this line,
4:44
so it's going to sit on that line. If we put it on the plane or if we were to start it at one of those
4:48
points it will sit on that line.
4:50
And then we can do another vector, and it's essentially going between a point on the green line and a
4:55
point on the purple line, but that's definitely going to be a vector on our blue plane.
4:59
Let's go between these two points - that looks pretty straight-forward, so let's call vector b,
5:07
so let's call vector b, let's call that, let's see, two minus one is 'i', three minus two is 'j', and then four minus three, that's just 1k.
5:21
So this vector here is also sitting on the plane. So if I take the cross-product of 'a' and 'b' I am
5:29
going to get a vector that is perpendicular to the plane, or a normal vector to the plane.
5:34
So let's do that. So let's find what 'a' cross 'b' is. 'a' cross 'b' is equal to - and this is how I
5:43
find it easiest - I just write 'i', 'j', 'k', this is really the definition of the cross product, or
5:49
I guess one of them. And we write our first vector, we have 2, 3, 4, and then we have our second vector,
5:56
which is just 1,1,1, and then this is going to be equal to, first we'll look at the 'i' component, so
6:02
cross that row, that column out.
6:04
three times one minus one times four, so that's just three minus four, so it's negative 'i', and then
6:13
minus, we're going to have the 'j', so let we write up minus here, minus , let me just swap signs, we
6:19
have positive, negative, positive, so 'j' , get rid of that column, that row,
6:23
two times one which is two, minus one times four, so that's minus four, is negative 2,
6:28
so we could have written negative 2 here, but the negatives cancel out, so it becomes plus 2j,
6:33
and finally for the 'k', get rid of that row that column, two times one is two, minus one times three,
6:39
is two minus three, which is negative one, so it's negative k.
6:44
So this right here is a normal vector to the plane.
6:52
So if we want to find the equation for that plane, we've done it multiple times, we'd just have to take
7:00
the dot product of that normal vector and any arbitrary vector on that that specified that we can specify
7:13
with with an arbitrary x y and z, and we've done this multiple times in multiple videos.
7:17
If this is any point, x, y, z, that sits on the plane, then the vector - let me draw the vector, let's
7:29
say we go to this point right over here, so this vector right over here is going to be
7:34
- let me draw it the other way actually, so this vector right over here, let's say we're going between
7:39
this point and x,y,z, this vector right here is going to be x minus three i, plus y minus five j, plus
7:53
z minus 7 k.
7:56
That's what this vector is, it sits on the plane, assuming x,y and z sit on the plane.
8:01
So if we take the dot product of this and the normal vector that has got to be equal to zero,
8:06
because it sits on the plane, and then we'll have our equation.
8:09
So let's take 'n' dot that over there, so n dot x minus three i, plus y minus five j, plus z minus seven k.
8:23
If any of this is confusing to you, I've gone into a little bit more depth in previous videos,
8:28
especially in the linear algebra playlist where I talk about constructing the equation of a plane given
8:32
a point on the plane and a normal vector, and even how you find that normal vector,
8:38
so you might want to watch those if you want some review there.
8:40
But these are going to be equal to zero, so when you take the dot product, n, our normal vector is this,
8:46
so we just take the x term, which is negative one, times this x term right over here,
8:51
so negative one times this is just three minus x, and then plus this y component times this y component,
8:58
so it's two times this, so it's plus two y minus ten, and then finally the z component -
9:05
negative one times this. So this is plus seven minus z is equal to zero, and what do we get?
9:15
So we have our negative x, plus two y, minus z, and then is equal to, let's subtract three from both sides
9:27
So if we take it out there it will be minus three. If we add ten to both sides, so then you have
9:35
a plus ten over here, and then we subtract seven from both sides, this becomes a minus seven
9:43
So then on the right-hand-side, negative three plus ten minus seven, well that's just going to be zero!
9:50
And just like that we have the equation for this blue plane over here - the plane that contains these two lines.
10:04
Now remember what we said at the beginning of the video - these two planes are parallel, so the ratio
10:08
of the coefficients on the 'x' terms, the 'y' term and the 'z' term has got to be the same.
10:14
So this one has a positive 2, that has a negative 2, this is just to simplify it, so it looks very similar
10:20
to each other. Let's multiple this equation right here, both sides, by negative one. And then we're going
10:25
to get x minus two y plus z is equal to zero; so this is a completely valid, another alternate way of
10:34
expressing the same plane. And what like about this about this is that it looks very similar to this -
10:39
at least the ratio of the x, y's and z's, negative two y, negative two y; one z, one z, and remember
10:46
the ratios have to be the same.
10:47
So here we have a one-to-one ratio between the z-coefficient and the z-coefficient, the y-coefficient
10:52
and the y-coefficient, so it's also going to be for the x coefficient.
10:56
So here we know if this is going to be parallel to the blue plane we know that 'a' has got to be equal
11:01
to one.
11:03
So this is x minus two y plus z is equal to d. So now let's figure out the actual distance between these
11:18
two planes. So what we can do is we can take a point on this blue plane - and we have several examples
11:24
of points on the blue plane, and find the distance between that point and this plane over here.
11:30
And actually I just finished doing some videos on how to find the distance between a point and a plane,
11:35
so I'm just going to use that formula (if you want it to be proved go watch that video - it's actually
11:39
pretty interesting proof I think) but the distance between let's say this point, (1,2,3), and this plane
11:47
over here, so this distance right here is going to be in the direction of the normal,
11:52
the distance is going to be, you literally just evaluate this, let me do it this way:
12:08
you literally just put in this point for the x, y and z, and then you subtract the d in the numerator,
12:14
and we saw that as the formula for finding the distance. So it's literally going to be one, one,
12:20
(I'm actually using this point right over here)
12:23
So it's going to be one, one, because we just have one x so it's just going to be one minus two times
12:27
two, one minus four (that's two times two), plus three, minus d, over here the d is just d, so we're
12:39
just going to write minus d, just like that, all of that over what is essentially the magnitude of the
12:46
normal vector, and we saw in several videos that's just the square of the coefficients on each of these
12:50
terms right here, and taking the sum of those, taking the square root,
12:54
so it's going to be equal to: 1 squared, plus negative 2 squared which is four, plus one squared which is one.
13:05
So this is going to simplify to the distance is equal to one minus four plus three is zero.
13:13
So in the numerator we have negative d, all of that over the square root of one plus four plus one,
13:21
so all over the square root of six. So they say the distance
13:30
between this plane and this plane over here is square root of six. So they're saying the distance is
13:36
equal to the square root of six, that's what this information right over here is, maybe I should do that
13:44
in another colour.
13:49
The distance between the two planes is going to be the square root of six, and so then if we solve for d,
13:55
multiple both sides of this equation times the square root of six, you get six is equal to negative d,
14:01
or d is equal to negative six.
14:07
Now, what they care about is the absolute value of d, or the absolute distance, so this would be kinda
14:12
the signed distance - it specifies whether we're above or below the plane.
14:15
Since we're below the plane we got a negative number - I just happened to draw it right, if we above
14:19
the plane we would get a positive number.
14:22
So this distance is negative six, the absolute value of it, the absolute value of d which is the same
14:27
as the absolute value of negative six, is equal to six.
14:31
So take any point on this blue plane and you look for the closest point on the orange plane, and they
14:38
will be exactly six apart. Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.","Isn't the m1 (2,3,4) and m2(3,4,5) two vectors on the plane?"

0:20
and sit around all day pondering whether the Civil War
0:23
was caused by slavery or states' rights?
0:27
No, but you can try that if you want.
0:30
But I would say thinking like a historian is a little bit
0:33
like being a combination between a storyteller
0:41
and a scientist . . .
0:43
you're gonna see me draw a really, really bad beaker here
0:49
there we go . . .
0:53
some little fumes coming off of that.
0:57
and a lawyer, maybe I'll put a gavel here.
1:08
It's a gavel, not a croquet mallet or a hammer.
1:12
So first let's start with the storytelling aspect.
1:18
I think one of the most important things that we can learn
1:22
from telling this story of history is that
1:24
in a good story nothing just happens.
1:32
Imagine a story where everything just happened.
1:37
The story would be: the wind blows, the earth turns, right?
1:42
No one is making those things happen
1:45
and that's why it's kind of a boring story
1:48
because it doesn't show cause and effect.
1:50
And that cause and effect is really
1:53
the backbone of history, right?
1:57
And you would be surprised how often
1:59
people can fall into the trap of telling history,
2:03
this incredible story about what people have done
2:07
in the past that has led to the society we have today
2:10
as if it were kind of a laundry list of events
2:14
that just followed one after another without
2:16
any possibility of things being different.
2:19
People will say, ""and then World War II happened""
2:21
or ""and then the United States was born,"" right?
2:26
Those statements are in passive voice because they don't
2:29
talk about the people who make these things happen.
2:32
And really, short of a natural disaster,
2:35
pretty much everything happens in history
2:38
because people made it happen.
2:41
So when you think like a historian, you kind of think
2:44
the same way that a novelist might think.
2:46
OK, what is this character's motive?
2:49
What are they going to do to make their wish come true?
2:55
What are the influences that lead
3:00
a person to make certain choices?
3:02
And just like people make choices,
3:05
nations make choices, right?
3:07
World War I didn't just happen
3:10
and just as people make choices,
3:12
actions have consequences.
3:14
You wouldn't write a story where
3:16
a thief stole 100 million dollars
3:18
and the police didn't even try to come after her.
3:21
Neither can you write a story about history without
3:24
talking about the effects that actions have on people.
3:27
So that's the storytelling aspect
3:30
of thinking like a historian.
3:31
Let's talk about the scientific aspect.
3:34
We often think of history as something
3:36
that's pretty much done, right?
3:39
It's a series of events that happened in the past
3:44
and now we just have to memorize what happened
3:47
so we can learn from it and maybe have a good idea
3:50
about what to do in the future.
3:52
But really there is only so much we can actually know
3:56
about what happened in the past.
3:57
And so historians always have to do
4:01
a kind of research to understand what happened
4:06
and get a better idea of what people were feeling.
4:10
So just like scientists have theories,
4:14
when historians think about the past,
4:17
they're really thinking about theories as well.
4:20
They're saying, ""ok, I have a theory about
4:23
""what caused the evolution of jazz in the 1920s.""
4:27
Why did jazz become a major
4:30
popular form of music in the 1920s?
4:33
Well, I'm gonna theorize it was because people
4:36
were reacting to the horror of World War I
4:39
which made so many people interested in kind of,
4:42
staccato notes and discordant sounds.
4:45
Alright, so that's a theory.
4:47
Well, how do you go about proving a theory?
4:49
And the answer is you do research
4:51
and you consult evidence, right?
4:53
And the way that you do that in history
4:56
is usually by doing a lot of reading, right?
4:59
You might say, alright well, let me take
5:02
the letters of some jazz musicians from this time period
5:05
and see what they write about.
5:06
Maybe they write all about how
5:09
they experienced battle in World War I
5:11
and they were trying to reflect that in their music.
5:14
Or maybe they write that World War I
5:16
had nothing to do with their interest in music.
5:19
Actually, they wanted to simulate the sounds of flight
5:24
because they were so interested in
5:26
modern forms of transportation.
5:28
So our understanding of what happened in the past
5:30
is always just a theory.
5:33
I mean we have a pretty good idea
5:36
of what was going on most of the time,
5:39
but new information comes to light all the time, right?
5:42
I mean people are always cleaning out their grandma's attic
5:45
and finding some new documents
5:47
and as the preponderance of the evidence shifts and changes
5:51
so might our understanding of the past.
5:54
The last aspect of thinking like a historian
5:56
I want to talk about is this kind of lawyerly aspect.
6:00
And what I mean by this is that historians
6:04
are always making an argument.
6:14
Just like a lawyer gets up in a court room and says,
6:16
""Here's my idea, now let me support it
6:19
""with the evidence from witnesses, from experts,
6:23
""from objects we might have found at a crime scene.""
6:27
A historian is saying, ""believe my theory.
6:30
""Believe my evidence.""
6:33
And I think the analogy of law is really powerful here
6:36
because you could see the same pieces of evidence
6:39
used to support two different arguments.
6:42
So for example, say there's, maybe . . .
6:46
a sock that was found at the scene of a crime
6:51
right, and here's our sock . . .
6:58
I'm not a beautiful artist.
7:02
But, maybe the prosecution
7:06
tries to argue . . .
7:09
that the accused must have committed
7:12
this crime because the sock is his size.
7:20
Right, the sock shows he did it.
7:22
Whereas the defense
7:27
might say, ""My client never wears socks,
7:30
""he always wears sandals.""
7:32
So it's clear that the sock shows that
7:35
he couldn't possibly have been the one to do this crime.
7:38
So that's how we end up with so many
7:40
different interpretations of the same event.
7:43
The task of the historian is to gather evidence
7:46
and to present an argument that they think will
7:51
best convince the public of their interpretation.
7:55
And so these interpretations do change over time.
7:58
So in later videos we'll get into the nuts and bolts
8:01
of how you tell these stories and make these arguments.
8:04
But for now, I just kind of want you to see
8:07
that thinking like a historian is not
8:09
something that only historians can do.
8:12
It's actually a really useful skill
8:14
for lots of aspects of your life.
8:16
We tell stories, search for evidence, and make arguments
8:20
in our lives all the time about things
8:22
that we interact with every day like our favorite
8:25
bands, our favorite foods, our political views, right?
8:29
We base those on our own experiences,
8:32
consequences in our lives
8:34
and evidence that we see around us.
8:37
And we can do the same thing for the past.
8:39
It's not such a foreign country.
8:41
What we have are the remnants of that past
8:44
and the ability to interpret them.",What kinds of evidence are used when researching prehistory or an area that lacked an abundance of writing?

0:01
- [Voiceover] Here we have the eclipsed confirmation
0:02
of ethane, and if I turn it so we sight
0:05
down the carbon carbon bond,
0:07
we'll see the Newman projection
0:09
for the eclipsed confirmation.
0:11
Notice I have some hydrogens in green here,
0:13
and that's just to help us visualize rotation
0:16
around the carbon carbon bond.
0:18
So I'm going to rotate the front carbon
0:21
and keep the back carbon stationary.
0:23
So now we get the staggered confirmation of ethane.
0:27
I'm gonna keep rotating 60 degrees.
0:30
So I'm gonna rotate again,
0:31
and now we have an eclipsed confirmation.
0:34
I rotate again, and now we have a staggered
0:38
confirmation of ethane.
0:40
I rotate another 60 degrees,
0:42
and we get an eclipsed confirmation.
0:45
I rotate again, and we get a staggered,
0:48
and you get the idea.
0:49
One more rotation, and we get back
0:51
to an eclipsed confirmation.
0:54
Here we have a graph of the potential energies
0:57
of the confirmations that we just saw in the video.
0:59
So we started out right here
1:01
with this eclipsed confirmation of ethane,
1:03
so we are at this particular potential energy.
1:06
As we rotate to get to this staggered confirmation,
1:10
you can see there's a decrease in potential energy.
1:13
So this staggered confirmation has a lower
1:16
potential energy than the eclipsed confirmation.
1:19
We rotate again, we get back up here
1:21
to this eclipsed confirmation.
1:22
Notice that takes energy.
1:24
So it takes energy to go from this staggered
1:26
confirmation to this eclipsed confirmation.
1:30
Going from the eclipsed to the staggered,
1:31
that's a decrease in energy.
1:33
Going from staggered up to this eclipsed,
1:35
that's an increase in energy.
1:37
Going from the eclipsed down to the staggered
1:39
again is a decrease, and finally,
1:40
back to the original eclipsed confirmation
1:43
would be an increase in energy.
1:45
Notice that all of our eclipsed confirmations here
1:49
have the same potential energy.
1:51
If I draw a line, this is all the same potential energy.
1:54
Whoops, I didn't draw a very nice line there,
1:56
but you get the idea.
1:57
Therefore, we say that these are degenerate
2:00
in terms of energy.
2:02
Same thing for the staggered confirmations.
2:04
All of these staggered confirmations,
2:06
if I draw a line in here,
2:07
have the same potential energy.
2:10
So the staggered confirmations
2:13
are lower in energy than the eclipsed confirmations.
2:17
Actually, the difference is 12 kilojoules per mole.
2:21
So if I write that in here,
2:22
so 12 kilojoules per mole,
2:25
that's talking about the difference in energy
2:28
between the eclipsed confirmations
2:30
and the staggered confirmations.
2:33
Lower in energy means more stable.
2:36
The easy way of thinking about that
2:38
is imagine these things as hills,
2:41
if I have a boulder, or a rock, or something
2:43
down here at the bottom of the hill
2:45
and I'm comparing that boulder or rock
2:47
up here to a boulder at the top of the hill.
2:50
In physics, you can set your potential energy
2:52
equal to zero at the ground.
2:54
So let's say that this is ground level.
2:56
I say my potential energy, U,
2:58
is equal to zero joules at this point.
3:01
And so the boulder in this valley here,
3:03
let's say it's 10 joules.
3:05
Let's say this is 10 joules here at this point.
3:08
And then it would take energy to push this boulder
3:10
up this hill to this point.
3:13
Let's say the final potential energy
3:16
of the boulder at this point would be 22 joules.
3:19
It takes energy in order to do that.
3:21
This final position is less stable,
3:25
and this is the higher potential energy.
3:28
So higher in potential energy means less stable.
3:32
Lower in potential energy means more stable.
3:36
So why do we have a difference in energy
3:37
between the staggered and the eclipsed confirmation?
3:40
Well this is called torsional strain.
3:43
So this difference in energy,
3:45
this 12 kilojoules per mole,
3:47
is called torsional strain.
3:51
The source of torsional strain has been
3:53
a topic of debate.
3:55
One of the current theories has to do
3:57
with molecular orbital theory.
3:59
I'm gonna go with one of the older ones,
4:01
which talks about the electron pair repulsions.
4:05
The electron pair repulsions are greatest
4:08
when the bonds are eclipsed.
4:10
So if you think about the electrons
4:11
in this bond being close to the electrons
4:14
in this bond, and you have that same thing
4:16
over here and over here,
4:18
so in space, these electron pairs,
4:20
these bonding electron pairs are closer together
4:23
in the eclipsed confirmation than they are
4:25
in the staggered.
4:26
If I go down here to the staggered,
4:27
you can see if you're thinking about these electron pairs
4:30
they're relatively further away than they are
4:33
in the eclipsed confirmation.
4:34
We know that electrons will repel.
4:37
So electron pair repulsions are greatest
4:39
when the bonds are eclipsed,
4:41
and therefore, that's higher energy
4:43
and the electron pairs are further away
4:46
from each other when you're talking about staggered,
4:48
therefore, more stable.
4:50
The total energy cost between the two confirmations
4:54
is 12 kilojoules per mole.
4:57
We have three pairs of eclipsed hydrogens.
5:01
If I go back up to here,
5:02
here's one pair of eclipsed hydrogens,
5:04
here's another pair,
5:05
and here's another pair.
5:07
So if the total energy is 12 kilojoules per mole,
5:10
and I have three pairs of eclipsed hydrogens,
5:12
we could say that the energy cost
5:14
for each pair of eclipsed hydrogens
5:16
is four kilojoules per mole.
5:19
So this would be four kilojoules per mole
5:22
for this pair of eclipsed hydrogens,
5:24
four kilojoules per mole for this one,
5:27
and four kilojoules per mole for this one,
5:29
adding up for a total of 12.
5:32
So our total energy cost is 12,
5:34
and now we can think about two hydrogens
5:36
eclipsing each other as having an energy cost
5:38
of four kilojoules per mole.
5:42
We've just seen that the staggered confirmation
5:44
of ethane is more stable than the eclipsed
5:46
confirmation of ethane.
5:47
If you want turn a staggered confirmation
5:50
into an eclipsed confirmation,
5:52
you would need energy.
5:54
At room temperature, there's enough energy
5:56
for the staggered confirmation to turn
5:58
into the eclipsed.
6:00
Equilibrium is reached between the two confirmations,
6:04
and at room temperature, approximately 99%
6:08
of ethane molecules have an approximately
6:11
staggered confirmation, whereas only
6:14
about 1% have an eclipsed confirmation.
6:17
Again, that's due to stability.
6:19
Staggered is more stable than eclipsed.",Would a gauche interaction add additional energy?

Let's say we have a cup of water.
0:03
Let me draw the cup.
0:06
This is one side of the cup, this is the bottom of the cup,
0:11
and this is the other side of the cup.
0:15
Let me say that it's some liquid.
0:16
It doesn't have to be water, but some arbitrary liquid.
0:19
It could be water.
0:21
That's the surface of it.
0:23
We've already learned that the pressure at any point within
0:26
this liquid is dependent on how deep
0:30
we go into the liquid.
0:32
One point I want to make before we move on, and I
0:35
touched on this a little bit before, is that the pressure
0:39
at some point isn't just acting downwards, or it isn't
0:43
just acting in one direction.
0:44
It's acting in all directions on that point.
0:46
So although how far we go down determines how much pressure
0:50
there is, the pressure is actually acting in all
0:53
directions, including up.
0:54
The reason why that makes sense is because I'm assuming
0:58
that this is a static system, or that the fluids in this
1:02
liquid are stationary, or you even could imagine an object
1:05
down here, and it's stationary.
1:07
The fact that it's stationary tells us that the pressure in
1:09
every direction must be equal.
1:12
Let's think about a molecule of water.
1:13
A molecule of water, let's say it's roughly a sphere.
1:20
If the pressure were different in one direction or if the
1:24
pressure down were greater than the pressure up, then the
1:28
object would start accelerating downwards,
1:30
because its surface area pointing upwards is the same
1:32
as the surface area pointing downwards, so the force
1:36
upwards would be more.
1:37
It would start accelerating downwards.
1:39
Even though the pressure is a function of how far down we
1:43
go, at that point, the pressure is
1:45
acting in every direction.
1:48
Let's remember that, and now let's keep that in mind to
1:51
learn a little bit about Archimedes' principle.
1:54
Let's say I submerge a cube into this liquid, and let's
2:01
say this cube has dimensions d, so every side is d.
2:17
What I want to do is I want to figure out if there's any
2:19
force or what is the net force acting on this
2:22
cube due to the water?
2:25
Let's think about what the pressure on this cube is at
2:27
different points.
2:29
At the depths along the side of the cube, we know that the
2:32
pressures are equal, because we know at this depth right
2:35
here, the pressure is going to be the same as at that depth,
2:38
and they're going to offset each other, and so these are
2:40
going to be the same.
2:41
But one thing we do know, just based on the fact that
2:44
pressure is a function of depth, is that at this point
2:47
the pressure is going to be higher-- I don't know how much
2:50
higher-- than at this point, because this point is deeper
2:54
into the water.
2:55
Let's call this P1.
2:59
Let's call that pressure on top, PT, and let's call this
3:03
point down here PD.
3:06
No, pressure on the bottom, PB.
3:11
What's going to be the net force on this cube?
3:17
The net force-- let's call that F sub N-- is going to be
3:22
equal to the force acting upwards on this object.
3:27
What's the force acting upwards on the object?
3:29
It's going to be this pressure at the bottom of the object
3:35
times the surface area at the bottom of the object.
3:38
What's the surface area at the bottom of the object?
3:41
That's just d squared.
3:42
Any surface of a cube is d squared, so the bottom is
3:45
going to be d squared minus-- I'm doing this because I
3:54
actually know that the pressure down here is higher
3:56
than the pressure here, so this is going to be a larger
3:58
quantity, and that the net force is actually going to be
4:01
upwards, so that's why I can do the minus confidently up
4:04
here-- the pressure at the top.
4:07
What's the force at the top?
4:09
The force at the top is going to be the pressure on the top
4:14
times the surface area of the top of the cube,
4:16
right, times d squared.
4:20
We can even separate out the d squared already at that point,
4:24
so the net force is equal to the pressure of the bottom
4:30
minus the pressure of the top, or the difference in pressure
4:33
times the surface area of either the top or the bottom
4:37
or really any of the sides of the cube.
4:39
Let's see if we can figure what these are.
4:41
Let's say the cube is submerged h units or h meters
4:45
into the water.
4:48
So what's the pressure at the top?
4:51
The pressure at the top is going to be equal to the
4:55
density of the liquid-- I keep saying water, but it could be
4:58
any liquid-- times how far down we are.
5:02
So we're h units down, or maybe h meters, times gravity.
5:08
And what's the pressure the bottom?
5:10
The pressure at the bottom similarly would be the density
5:15
of the liquid times the depth, so what's the depth?
5:18
It would be this h and then we're another d down.
5:24
It's h plus d-- that's our total depth-- times gravity.
5:29
Let's just substitute both of those back into our net force.
5:31
Let me switch colors to keep from getting monotonous.
5:35
I get the net force is equal to the pressure at the bottom,
5:40
which is this.
5:42
Let's just multiply it out, so we get p times h times g plus
5:52
d times p times g.
5:58
I just distributed this out, multiplied this out.
6:00
That's the pressure at the bottom, then minus the
6:06
pressure at the top, minus phg, and then we learned it's
6:13
all of that times d squared.
6:17
Immediately, we see something cancels out.
6:20
phg, phg subtract.
6:23
It cancels out, so we're just left with--
6:25
what's the net force?
6:27
The net force is equal to dpg times d squared, or that
6:36
equals d cubed times the density of the
6:42
liquid times gravity.
6:45
Let me ask you a question: What is d cubed?
6:50
d cubed is the volume of this cube.
6:51
And what else is it?
6:54
It's also the volume of the water displaced.
6:56
If I stick this cube into the water, and the cube isn't
6:59
shrinking or anything-- you can even imagine it being
7:03
empty, but it doesn't have to be empty-- but that amount of
7:05
water has to be moved out of the way in order for
7:08
that cube to go in.
7:11
This is the volume of the water displaced.
7:15
It's also the volume of the cube.
7:24
This is the density-- I keep saying water, but it could be
7:28
any liquid-- of the liquid.
7:30
This is the gravity.
7:32
So what is this?
7:33
Volume times density is the mass of the liquid displaced,
7:38
so the net force is also equal to the
7:42
mass of liquid displaced.
7:47
Let's just say mass times gravity, or we could say that
7:52
the net force acting on this object is-- what's the mass of
7:55
the liquid displaced times gravity?
7:57
That's just the weight of liquid displaced.
8:05
That's a pretty interesting thing.
8:08
If I submerge anything, the net force acting upwards on
8:12
it, or the amount that I'm lighter by, is equal to the
8:15
weight of the water being displaced.
8:18
That's actually called Archimedes' principle.
8:20
That net upward force due to the fact that there's more
8:24
pressure on the bottom than there is on the top, that's
8:27
called the buoyant force.
8:28
That's what makes things float.
8:30
I'll leave you there to just to ponder that, and we'll use
8:35
this concept in the next couple of videos to actually
8:37
solve some problems. I'll see you soon.","if the net force is upward the object is buoyant , then will the object sink if the net force is downward, if so then why ?"

We're asked to move the orange dot to negative 0.6
0:04
on the number line.
0:05
So the dot right now is at 0.
0:08
And let's see, this is negative 2.
0:10
This is positive 2.
0:11
So each of these big slashes look like it's 1.
0:13
So this would be negative 1, negative 2.
0:16
This right over here would be negative 0.5.
0:19
So we're going to go a little bit more
0:21
negative than negative 0.5.
0:23
That would be negative 0.6.
0:24
We want to go another tenth.
0:26
And so that looks right at about negative 0.6.
0:29
Let's do a couple more of these.
0:31
Move the orange dot to 1.9 on the number line.
0:34
So it seems like we have the same scale
0:36
as in the previous example.
0:38
This gets us to 1.
0:39
In fact, this is 0.5, 1, 1.5.
0:43
And 1.9 is only going to be a tenth less than 2.
0:46
So it's going to be-- let's see, that's 2,
0:49
so a tenth less than that.
0:52
And I'm assuming that it's locking us to the tenths.
0:55
And it looks like it is, so that looks pretty close to 1.9.
0:59
Let's do one more of these.
1:01
Move the orange dot to 0.5 on the number line.
1:04
Well, once again, we have the same scale.
1:06
It's important to always check the scale.
1:08
And this right over here is 1.
1:09
So 0.5 would be halfway, so that little small mark right

over there.",how do you plot a fraction on the number line?

- [Instructor] In this video, we're going to look
0:01
at how to determine if a reaction proceeds
0:04
via an S N 1 or an S N 2 mechanism
0:07
and also how to draw the product or products
0:10
for those reactions.
0:11
To help us, we're gonna look
0:12
at this S N 1 versus S N 2 summary
0:15
and the first thing that we're going to look at
0:17
is the structure of our substrate.
0:20
For example, for this reaction down here,
0:23
we have a primary alkyl halides, a primary substrate,
0:27
so we need to think about an S N 2 reaction
0:30
which requires decreased steric hindrance
0:32
and that's what we have with a primary alkyl halide.
0:36
From an earlier video, we know that an S N 2 mechanism
0:39
has our nucleophile attack at the same time
0:41
that we get loss of a leaving group.
0:43
And for this reaction,
0:45
our nucleophile must be our solvent here, which is ethanol.
0:48
So, our nucleophile is going to attack
0:51
and the oxygen is gonna form a bond with this carbon
0:54
which I'll go ahead and highlight in red.
0:58
So our nucleophile attacks,
0:59
at the same time, we get loss of leaving group.
1:01
These electrons come off to form the iodide anion
1:04
which is an excellent leaving group.
1:07
Let's draw what we would form.
1:09
Let's sketch in our carbon chain here
1:12
and we know that a bond forms
1:14
between the oxygen and the carbon in red,
1:17
so the carbon in red is this carbon
1:20
and let's make these electrons magenta.
1:23
So those electrons form a bond
1:25
between the oxygen and the carbon in red.
1:28
The oxygen is still attached to this ethyl group here,
1:31
so let's draw in those two carbons.
1:34
And the oxygen is still bonded to this hydrogen.
1:37
So let's put in this hydrogen.
1:39
We still have a lone pair of electrons left on this oxygen,
1:42
so I'll put in that lone pair right here.
1:44
And that gives us a plus one formal charge on the oxygen.
1:49
Next, we need to make a neutral molecule for our product,
1:53
so we need to have another molecule of ethanol come along,
1:57
so let's draw that in here.
1:58
So, ethanol is our solvent.
2:01
And this time, the ethanol molecule
2:02
is going to function as a base.
2:05
We need to take this proton here
2:08
and these electrons are left behind on the oxygen.
2:12
Let's draw our final product.
2:14
We sketch in our carbon chain.
2:17
We have our oxygen.
2:19
We have these two carbons.
2:21
And now we have two lone pairs of electrons on this oxygen.
2:25
Let's make these electrons blue.
2:28
So, our second step is an acid-base reaction
2:31
where we take a proton
2:32
and these are, these electrons in blue here,
2:35
to form our final product which is an ether.
2:39
Notice we don't have to worry about any stereochemistry
2:42
for our final product.
2:43
We don't have any chiral centers to worry about.
2:47
Let's look at another reaction.
2:49
For this reaction,
2:50
we're starting with a secondary alkyl halides.
2:53
If I look at my summary over here
2:55
with a secondary substrate,
2:57
we could have either an S N 2 mechanism
2:59
or an S N 1 mechanism,
3:01
so we need to look at a few more things.
3:04
First, let's look at the nucleophile.
3:06
This is N a plus and SH minus,
3:09
so let me draw in the SH minus here
3:11
which that is going to be our nucleophile
3:14
and that's a strong nucleophile.
3:16
A negative charge on a sulfur
3:18
would make a strong nucleophile.
3:20
And for our solvent, we saw in an earlier video,
3:23
DMSO is a polar A product solvent
3:26
which favors an S N 2 reaction.
3:29
So with a strong nucleophile and a polar A product solvent,
3:34
we need to think about in S N 2 mechanism.
3:38
So we know our nucleophile attacks
3:40
at the same time that we get loss of our leaving group,
3:43
so our nucleophile is going to attack this carbon.
3:46
So again, I'll make this carbon red.
3:48
At the same time that we get loss of leaving groups,
3:51
so these electrons are gonna come off onto the bromine
3:53
to form the bromide anion.
3:55
For this reaction, we need to think about
3:57
the stereochemistry of our S N 2 reaction.
4:00
Our nucleophile has to attack from the opposite side
4:03
of our leaving group,
4:05
so we get inversion of configuration.
4:08
So if we have a chiral center, we have to worry
4:10
about our stereochemistry for this reaction.
4:13
So we have the bromine on a wedge,
4:14
so drawing the final product here,
4:16
we need to have the SH going away from us in space,
4:19
so we put that on a dash.
4:22
Again, we saw details about this in an earlier video.
4:25
So we get inversion of configuration
4:28
for this S N 2 reaction.
4:32
First, let's look at our alkyl halides.
4:34
The carbon that's bonded to our bromine
4:36
is bonded to two other carbon.
4:38
So, this is a secondary alkyl halide.
4:41
And so we know we could have either S N 1 or S N 2.
4:44
We need to look at the nucleophile and the solvent next
4:47
to decide which mechanism it is.
4:50
Our nucleophile will be formic acid
4:52
which is a weak nucleophile
4:54
and water is a polar product solvent.
4:57
So we know that these two things
4:59
favor an S N 1 type mechanism.
5:02
The polar product solvent water
5:04
can stabilize the carbocation that would result.
5:08
So the first step should be loss of our leaving group
5:11
to form our carbocations.
5:13
These electrons come off onto our bromine
5:15
to form the bromide ion
5:17
and we're taking a bond away from this carbon in red.
5:20
So the carbon in red
5:21
is gonna have a plus one formal charge.
5:24
Let's draw our carbocations.
5:27
Let me put in this ring here with our pi electrons.
5:30
And then let me highlight our carbon in red.
5:34
The carbon in red is this one.
5:36
So that should get a plus one formal charge.
5:39
And let me highlight the other carbon over here.
5:42
So this carbon in magenta, I moved it up to here
5:45
to make it easier to see the mechanism.
5:48
So this is our secondary carbocation,
5:51
but this is actually a benzylic carbocation
5:53
which makes it even more stable
5:55
than we would normally expect.
5:57
The pi electrons in the ring
5:59
can actually provide us with other resonant structures
6:01
to stabilize this positive charge.
6:03
So I don't have the time or the space to show that here,
6:07
but we have our secondary benzylic carbocation
6:09
which will be our electrophile
6:12
and our next step is to have our nucleophile
6:14
attack our electrophile
6:16
and our nucleophile is formic acid here.
6:20
We have two oxygens in formic acid
6:22
and one of them is more nucleophilic than the other,
6:25
so it turns out that this carbonyl oxygen
6:28
is more nucleophilic than this oxygen down here
6:32
and we'll go into more detail in a couple of minutes,
6:35
but for right now, let's show our nucleophile
6:37
attacking our electrophile.
6:39
So, a lone pair of electrons on our oxygen
6:41
are gonna form a bond with this carbon in red.
6:44
So let's draw the result of our nucleophilic attack.
6:48
We have our benzene ring,
6:50
so I'll draw that in here
6:52
and our carbon in red is this one.
6:57
And let's highlight the electrons on our oxygen.
7:00
So, this lone pair of electrons in blue
7:03
forms a bonds with our carbon in red.
7:06
So now, let's draw in our oxygen.
7:09
Our oxygen still has a lone pair of electrons on it
7:12
and our oxygen is double bonded to a carbon
7:14
which is bonded to a hydrogen.
7:16
And on the right, we have our oxygen and a hydrogen.
7:20
Now we have a plus one formal charge on our oxygen.
7:24
So this oxygen has a plus one formal charge.
7:27
And this product is resonance stabilized,
7:31
so we can move in a lone pair of electrons here
7:33
and push these electrons off onto our oxygen.
7:36
And let's go ahead and show the results of that.
7:39
So we'll put in our resonance brackets here
7:41
and our resonance arrow.
7:43
So we have our benzene ring,
7:46
so let's draw that in.
7:48
And we have our carbons.
7:50
We have a bond to this oxygen
7:53
and I'll drawn on that lone pair of electrons
7:55
on the top oxygen here.
7:57
Should only be one bond now to this carbon.
7:59
I'll put in my hydrogen,
8:01
and now actually, we have a double bond over here.
8:04
Let me draw everything in.
8:06
And let me show the movement of electrons.
8:10
So first, let's start with these electrons
8:12
which I will make magenta.
8:14
Those electrons moved into here to form a double bond.
8:18
And then let's highlight these electrons here in red.
8:22
So these electrons came off onto our oxygen right here.
8:26
And now, we have a plus one formal charge on this oxygen.
8:30
So the product of nucleophilic attack
8:33
by the carbonyl oxygen is resonance stabilized.
8:37
And then to go to our product,
8:39
just think about a base coming along, something like water,
8:42
and we could take this proton
8:45
and then these electrons would be left behind.
8:49
These electrons would be left behind on that oxygen.
8:51
So let's draw in our product.
8:53
We would have a benzene ring.
8:55
So here's our benzene ring.
8:57
We would have an oxygen here.
9:01
And then we would have our carbonyl
9:05
and then our hydrogen.
9:07
So this oxygen has two lone pairs of electrons
9:10
and so does this one.
9:13
So we could highlight some of those electrons.
9:15
Let me make them green.
9:16
So these electrons in green here came off onto this oxygen
9:21
and that gives us our product.
9:24
Notice that in our products,
9:25
we have a chiral center.
9:27
So this carbon right here is a chiral center.
9:30
We have four different groups attached to it.
9:32
So we would expect to get a racemic mixture.
9:35
We should get both in the enatiomers here
9:37
because remember, going back to our carbocation,
9:40
this carbocation is planer
9:42
and our nucleophile can attack from either sides.
9:46
If you're wondering why this oxygen
9:48
is not as nucleophilic as the carbonyl oxygen,
9:51
let's show the result of what would happen
9:53
if this oxygen attacked our positively charged carbon.
9:57
Let me draw in our benzene ring.
10:00
Let's sketch that in.
10:02
And we would form a bond between the oxygen and,
10:06
let me highlight our carbon which I made red below,
10:08
so this is our carbon in red.
10:10
And I'm gonna show this lone pair of electrons
10:13
forming a bond with that carbon.
10:16
So, that's bonded to this oxygen
10:18
and the oxygen is bonded to our carbonyl
10:22
which is bonded to our hydrogen.
10:24
And our oxygen still has a hydrogen on it
10:26
and a lone pair of electrons.
10:28
So there's still a hydrogen on it
10:30
and there's still a lone pair of electrons
10:32
which gives this oxygen a plus one formal charge.
10:36
Notice this positively charged oxygen
10:39
is right next to this carbonyl carbon
10:42
and we know that this carbonyl carbon is partially positive
10:46
because this carbonyl oxygen
10:47
withdraws electron density from it.
10:50
So you have a positively charged oxygen
10:53
next to a partially positively charged carbon
10:56
and we know that like charges repel.
10:58
So having these two positive charges next to each other
11:02
would destabilized this structure.
11:05
And so that's the reason why
11:06
this oxygen is not the nucleophile.
11:10
The carbonyl oxygen is.
11:14
Let's look at one final example.
11:16
So for this alkyl halide,
11:17
this is a tertiary alkyl halide
11:20
and a tertiary substrate means,
11:22
think about an S N 1 mechanism.
11:25
So our first step here would be loss of a leaving group.
11:28
These electrons come off to form the iodide anion
11:30
and we're taking a bond away from this carbon in red
11:33
to form a carbocation.
11:36
Let's get some more room.
11:36
Let's go down here
11:38
and let's draw our carbocation.
11:40
So we have a six-membered ring,
11:43
so let me draw in our six-membered ring here.
11:46
And our carbon in red is this carbon,
11:50
so that carbon gets a plus one formal charge.
11:54
We have a tertiary carbocation
11:56
which is relatively stable for a carbocation.
11:59
And in our next step,
11:59
our nucleophile attacks our electrophile
12:02
and our nucleophile is our solvent, which is methanol.
12:06
So our nucleophile is going to attack our electrophile.
12:09
Our oxygen is gonna form a bond with this carbon in red.
12:13
So let's draw the results of our nucleophilic attack.
12:17
I'll put in this ring here,
12:19
move the methyl group over to make room for the oxygen.
12:22
So here's that oxygen.
12:24
Let's highlight the carbon in red.
12:26
And let's also highlight some electrons.
12:29
So, these electrons in magenta form the bond
12:32
between the oxygen and the carbon in red.
12:34
The oxygen is still bonded to a hydrogen and a methyl group,
12:38
so let's put those in.
12:39
So here is our hydrogen
12:41
and here is our methyl group.
12:44
We still have a lone pair of electrons on the oxygen,
12:47
so let's put in that lone pair of electrons
12:49
and that gives the oxygen a plus one formal charge.
12:54
To get to our product,
12:55
we need a neutral product,
12:57
so another another molecule of methanol comes along
13:01
but this time, instead of acting like a nucleophile,
13:03
it's gonna act as a base and take off that proton.
13:07
So here is our molecule of methanol
13:10
and we're gonna take this proton
13:12
and leave these electrons behind on the oxygen.
13:16
So let's draw in our final product up here.
13:19
So, here is our ring
13:21
and let's move up a little bit.
13:23
So, let's move up.
13:24
In our ring, we have this methyl group here
13:27
and we have our oxygen
13:29
and another methyl group,
13:30
two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen.
13:33
Let's show those electrons.
13:35
These electrons in here in blue
13:38
come off onto the oxygen to form our final product.
13:42
Notice that for our final product,
13:44
we don't have any chiral centers to worry about,
13:47
so we don't need to worry
13:48
about specifying any stereochemistry.",why does not the second water molecule function as a nucleophile?

What I want to do in this video
0:01
is think about the demand curve
0:02
for two different products.
0:04
So this is some laptop
0:05
that's on the market.
0:06
And this, let's just say,
0:08
is the cheapest car
0:09
that happens to be on the market
0:10
this is actually a picture of a 1985
0:12
assuming this is the cheapest car on the market.
0:15
So let's just think about
0:17
their hypothetical demand curves right now
0:20
So once again, on the vertical axis,
0:23
we're going to put price,
0:24
and on the horizontal axis,
0:25
we put quantity,
0:29
and then over here
0:30
let me do it for the same thing
0:32
So this is price,
0:36
and this right over here is quantity.
0:37
And both of them satisfy the law of demand
0:42
if the price is really high
0:44
the quantity demanded is going to be really low for the laptop
0:48
and so it might be right over there
0:50
and if the price is low
0:51
the quantity demanded is going to increase.
0:53
So, the demand curve might look something like that.
0:57
And it doesn't have to be a curve,
0:59
or doesn't have to be a line,
1:00
it could be a curve or anything like that.
1:02
So that is the current demand for the laptop
1:09
All else equal,
1:10
so we're not talking about shifting any of those other factors
1:13
that we've been talking about in the last few videos.
1:15
Now we can draw a similar demand curve
1:18
for this very cheap automobile.
1:20
If the price is high,
1:22
very few people are going to want to buy it,
1:24
and I'm not going to specify what the price is,
1:26
but this is a general idea
1:27
if the price is higher,
1:28
fewer people are going to want to buy it
1:30
If the price is lower,
1:31
more people are going to want to buy it
1:33
So this demand curve will also have the same shape
1:36
from the top left to the bottom right
1:38
it satisfies the law of demand.
1:40
So once again, that is the current demand.
1:46
Now let's think about
1:47
how the demand for each of these goods might change
1:50
depending on changes in income.
1:54
So we're going to focus on the income factor
1:57
the income effect, for this video
2:00
and see how these 2 products might change.
2:02
So let's just assume that
2:05
income in the general population goes up.
2:10
So for something like a laptop, wow,
2:12
if more people are making more money
2:14
especially in real terms
2:16
they have more money to spend well
2:17
for any given price point,
2:18
at any given price point,
2:20
there's going to be a higher quantity
2:25
that's demanded.
2:26
At any given price point,
2:26
higher quantity demanded.
2:30
And so if income goes up for this laptop,
2:33
the demand will increase.
2:35
And the way we show demand increasing
2:37
is the whole curve shifts to the right
2:39
so this right over here demand increased
2:43
demand went up when income went up.
2:46
And this makes complete sense
2:48
and if income were to go down,
2:49
demand would go down
2:51
because people would have less money
2:52
to buy something like a laptop.
2:54
And this is the case for most goods
2:56
we call things like this,
2:57
when income goes up, demand goes up,
2:59
whole curve shifts to the right
3:01
income goes down, demand goes down,
3:02
whole curve shifts to the left
3:04
We call this a normal good.
3:06
So this right over here is a normal good.
3:11
Now let's think about
3:12
what happens with the cheapest car on the market.
3:16
And let's assume we're in a developed country
3:18
where almost everyone has some form of a car.
3:21
Now, what happens when income goes up?
3:25
So people have more money
3:27
but are they going to spend that money
3:29
buying the cheapest car on the market?
3:31
Well, in most cases, if income goes up generally,
3:35
people say, well I have a little bit more money,
3:36
maybe I'll buy a slightly nicer car.
3:39
So, and maybe in particular
3:40
the people who were going to buy this car
3:42
at any given price point
3:44
So this price point,
3:45
the people who were going to buy the car will say
3:47
Wait! I can now afford a better car!
3:49
Why should I you know,
3:51
this is not safe
3:52
maybe or not as safe as the other cars,
3:53
and I want to impress my friends
3:56
from high school and all that,
3:57
so something very strange might happen for this car,
4:00
the demand for this car.
4:02
It actually will decrease
4:04
so the whole curve could shift to the left.
4:11
So income is a very strange thing for this good
4:14
because income increasing maybe people say,
4:16
hey you know what,
4:17
I could trade out of this good
4:18
I could get a good that
4:19
I'd rather have than just getting more of this thing right over here
4:23
Demand went down.
4:24
And goods like this, we call them inferior goods.
4:30
And the general way to think about
4:32
inferior goods are the goods
4:33
that people will want to not own if they had more money
4:36
they would want to buy, I guess, less inferior goods.
4:39
Or another way to think about it is,
4:41
if income were to go down,
4:45
and more people are budget strapped
4:46
and they can't afford
4:47
the Mercedes-Benz or the BMW
4:49
or even the mid-sized sedan anymore,
4:51
so if income were to go down
4:52
and things were getting tighter,
4:54
more people would want this car
4:56
more people would have to trade down to this
4:57
because they're strapped,
4:59
they're tightening their belts
5:00
and so you'll have this strange situation
5:04
where if income goes down,
5:06
demand would go up for this thing
5:09
So income goes down,
5:12
demand goes up.
5:13
Remember, we're talking about demand,
5:15
we're talking about the entire shifting of the curve.
5:17
At any given price point,
5:18
the quantity demanded will go up.
5:21
Because, this is, or we're assuming,
5:23
is the cheapest car on the market.
5:27
So, and likewise,
5:28
if income were to go down for a normal good,
5:30
it'll do what you'll expect,
5:31
demand would go down.
5:32
So this, an inferior good,
5:33
does the opposite of a normal good
5:35
when we're talking about the income effect,
5:40
the inferior good will do the opposite of a normal good
5:44
and that's because people want to trade out of it
5:46
when their income goes up
5:47
or they don't want to buy it
5:48
or they want to buy something nicer.
5:49
And when their income goes down,
5:50
they'll say
5:51
I have to buy this thing,
5:52
so you know, let me just do it.",And why does Law of Demand come under microeconomics when the general price of an economy is considered?

0:00
Write six hundred forty-five million five hundred
0:05
eighty-four thousand four hundred
0:08
sixty-two in standard form.
0:10
So let's tackle this piece by piece.
0:13
So the first part we have six hundred
0:16
and forty-five million.
0:21
So let's think about that.
0:22
So we have six hundred and forty-five.
0:26
But it's not just six hundred forty-five.
0:28
We have six hundred forty-five millions.
0:31
So we could view that as 645 times 1,000,000.
0:37
One million is one followed by six zeroes.
0:41
So this piece right here is this right over here.
0:44
That is six hundred and forty-five million.
0:48
And what is that when we write it out?
0:50
If we were to multiply this out, this is equal to-- it
0:53
would be 645 times this 1 with six zeroes behind it.
0:57
So this would be equal to 600-- I'll write it like this.
1:01
This is equal to 645, and then we have our six zeroes.
1:07
One, two, three, one, two, three.
1:10
That's just this part of the number.
1:13
And I'm going to do it kind of slow and do all of the
1:16
different parts of the problem, but once you get some
1:18
practice, you'll find that these are a bit second nature,
1:20
and you won't have to go through all of these steps.
1:22
You'll just be able to write the number.
1:24
Now, let's move on to the next part.
1:25
We have five hundred and eighty-four.
1:28
Let me write that down.
1:33
Well, I'll write it like this.
1:34
584 thousand.
1:40
So let me write the thousand.
1:42
So 584 thousand.
1:43
So it's 584 times 1,000.
1:47
And what's that going to look like?
1:48
So that's this whole part right here.
1:51
So 584 times 1,000 is equal to what?
1:55
Well, it's going to be 584 with three zeroes behind it,
1:59
or you could view it as 584 times the 1, and then you're
2:01
going to have three zeroes in the final answer.
2:04
So it's going to be 584,000.
2:11
We have our three zeroes at the end.
2:13
584, three zeroes.
2:15
So that's that part.
2:16
And then finally, we have four hundred sixty-two, and that's
2:22
just 462, straight up.
2:24
You could view it as 462 ones.
2:28
So then you just have 462, which
2:31
obviously equals just 462.
2:35
Now our number is all of these combined.
2:38
It is 645,000,000 and 584,000 and 462.
2:45
So one way to think about it is that you could add these
2:48
three numbers.
2:49
So if we were to add them, we get 645,584,462.
3:08
Now, I said it'll become a little bit of second nature to
3:10
you in a little bit, and the way to think about that, the
3:13
easiest way to think about that, is millions will have
3:16
six zeroes behind them, thousands will have three
3:18
zeroes behind them, and just regular numbers have no zeroes
3:22
behind them.
3:23
So what you can do when you kind of want to learn it
3:25
second nature, you'll just look at the six hundred and
3:28
forty-five million, so you'll write 645, and you'll kind of
3:33
keep in the back of your mind that you're going to have to
3:35
have six more digits to the right of this.
3:38
And then you say five hundred and eighty-four thousand, so
3:41
then you have your five hundred and eighty-four
3:44
thousand, so then you write that down, 584,000, keeping in
3:50
mind that you're going to need three digits to
3:51
the right of that.
3:52
And so if they didn't tell us 462, we would just put three
3:55
zeroes here, and that would also fulfill the six zeroes we
3:58
need behind 645,000,000.
4:00
But then they tell us 462, so we just write that right here.
4:04
462.","At 1:00, would it be easier to simply use an exponent instead of writing out the entire number?"

0:05
Steven: We're in Washington D.C. on the mall
0:08
at the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial.
0:10
Beth: With is situated right between
0:12
the Washington Monument and the Lincolcn Memorial.
0:16
Maya Lin, the architect of the memorial
0:19
sought about uniting the memorial to the nation's past,
0:23
bringing together the past and the present.
0:25
Steven: It's this very long series of
0:28
slabs of stone, this highly-reflective black granite
0:32
that actually points to both of those monuments.
0:35
Beth: Although the architect didn't like to
0:37
refer to these as walls, in a way they are walls,
0:40
but it's very thin, sunk into the ground
0:43
and inscribed with the names of
0:44
the servicemen who died in the Vietnam War.
0:47
Steven: Now there are more than 58,000 names
0:50
and in fact, more names are being added.
0:52
It is overwhelming in the density of names.
0:56
What happens as you walk down this path,
1:00
you sink into the earth.
1:02
The earth opens up and reveals these names.
1:05
Because the surface of the stone is so reflective,
1:09
it becomes a mirror and really all that
1:11
seems to have substance is
1:14
the rougher surface of the names themselves.
1:17
Beth: Maya Lin's idea was that it was the names
1:20
that were the reality, the substance of the monument
1:24
and that the reflectivity of the granite
1:28
opened up into another world that we could not enter,
1:31
but which was there for us to see.
1:33
Steven: She describes when she first visited the site
1:36
that she wanted to reveal that edge.
1:39
Beth: In fact, she said, ""I had a simple impulse
1:41
to cut into the earth. I imagined taking a knife
1:45
and cutting into the earth, opening it up
1:47
and initial violence and pain that in time would heal.""
1:51
She writes,""That the experience of the monument
1:53
would help people to come to terms
1:55
with the death of their loved ones.""
1:57
Steven: There is a real journey involved here.
1:58
You walk down in, you find the name
2:01
of your loved one embedded within
2:03
the chronological sequence of the death
2:06
of all of these soldiers, and then you walk back out.
2:09
Beth: That's right. In the center,
2:11
the chronology begins and goes down toward the right
2:14
as we're facing the wall and then picks up again
2:16
on the low edge of the left side
2:19
and then towards the center again.
2:21
As we move down the center, the path widens
2:25
and the granite rises more than 10 feet above us.
2:28
Steven: The names become a symbol of
2:30
this person multiplied more than 58,000 times,
2:34
but even though you've got that abstraction,
2:36
you also have this very concrete reality.
2:40
You have this place for family to come,
2:42
to gather, to reflect on that name.
2:44
Beth: Maya Lin talks about the name as
2:47
an abstraction that in fact, means more to
2:51
family and loved ones than a picture.
2:55
The picture represents someone at
2:56
a particular time and a particular place
2:58
as one moment in their lives whereas a name
3:02
might recall everything about that person.
3:04
Steven: There is this powerful accumulation
3:06
of all of the names.
3:08
As you descend, as you walk into the densest middle
3:11
of the monument, it becomes absolutely overwhelming.
3:14
Beth: It's a very different experience than
3:16
most previous war memorials.
3:19
When we think about the history of war memorials,
3:21
we often think about memorials to military heroes like
3:25
the monument to Lord Nelson in Trafalgar Square
3:28
or we might think about the Shaw memorial by
3:31
Augustus Saint-Gaudens in the National Gallery
3:33
where you have a hero leading an
3:36
anonymous army with an allegorical figure
3:39
representing peace and death,
3:41
this combination of allegory and heroism
3:44
that's usually in memorials,
3:46
it's completely absent here.
3:48
Steven: How can one create a meaningful monument
3:51
in the late 20th century?
3:53
What does it mean to strip away all of the
3:55
representational form?
3:56
What does it mean to create something so
3:59
subconsciously abstract and yet also so
4:01
powerful and so meaningful?
4:03
Beth: Evidently the committee that judged this
4:05
decided that this abstraction would be best.
4:08
It's interesting to think about how the committee
4:11
didn't know who was Maya Lin was.
4:13
There were 1,400 entries, completely anonymous.
4:17
Maya Lin at that point, was an undergraduate at Yale,
4:19
she was an architecture student, she's an Asian American.
4:22
It's interesting to think about what
4:24
might have happened had they known
4:26
who this application was from.
4:28
Steven: Once her identity had been revealed,
4:30
there was real backlash and racism.
4:33
There was backlash also about the abstraction.
4:35
Ultimately that was resolved by
4:37
a much more naturalistic sculpture
4:38
adjacent to the main memorial.
4:41
Beth: One that shows soldiers in a
4:43
very naturalistic way, three-dimensionally,
4:46
which is also powerful, but in a way that
4:48
feels much more public and far less intimate.
4:50
Steven: Maya Lin was brilliant in creating
4:53
a public space and yet tremendous intimacy.
4:56
We can feel those names inscribed.
4:58
The active reading is to come close,
5:00
to internalize those names.
5:03
Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial is one of the most
5:06
successful memorials in the nation.
5:08
Beth: And apparently one of the most visited
5:10
monuments in Washington D.C.
5:13
In an article that was published much later,
5:15
writing about her ideas for the monument,
5:17
Maya Lin said, ""It would be an interface between
5:20
our world and the quieter, darker,
5:22
more peaceful world beyond.
5:25
I chose black granite in order to make
5:27
the surface reflective and peaceful.
5:29
I never looked at the memorial as a wall,
5:31
an object, but as an edge to the earth,
5:34
an opened side. The mirrored sect would
5:36
double the size of the park creating two worlds;
5:40
one we are part of and one we cannot enter.""
5:43
Steven: Even that black granite created controversy.
5:45
She also talked about how she couldn't
5:48
expect granite that came from Canada
5:50
or from Sweden, two countries that had
5:52
really good quality black granite because
5:55
there was too much political baggage because
5:58
draft dodgers had gone to both of those countries.
6:00
Beth: One opponent of her design said,
6:03
""One needs no artistic education to see
6:05
this memorial designed for what it is,
6:07
a black scar and a hole hidden, as if out of shame.""
6:12
No, I think this is very different than what
6:14
Maya Lin intended for the wall.
6:16
She specifically took an apolitical approach
6:20
and wanted the design to be about those veterans
6:24
who had sacrificed their lives and not about
6:26
the political controversy at all;
6:28
not about whether if the was was
6:29
something shameful or something honorable.
6:32
Steven: The country had not only fought the war,
6:34
but then fought itself over the meaning of the war.
6:37
Maya Lin was very wise in sidestepping that
6:40
and putting to the fore simply the names,
6:45
the numerical power of all those fallen.
6:48
Beth: And she wrote, ""The wall dematerializes
6:50
of the form and allows the names
6:52
to become the object. Pure and reflective
6:55
surfaces that would allow visitors
6:57
the chance to see themselves with the name.""
7:00
(music) (""In The Sky With Diamonds"" by Scalding Lucy)","The only reason the design represents the cost of war is because Maya Lin cut up the earth, correct?"

0:00
- [Voiceover] As we exit 1917 and enter into 1918,
0:04
we're getting into the final stages of World War I.
0:08
And let's just give ourselves a little bit of review,
0:10
a little bit of background, a little bit of context.
0:12
The war started off as
0:14
a two-front war for the Central Powers.
0:15
You have the Western Front,
0:17
you have the Western Front right over here,
0:20
and you had the huge,
0:22
you had the huge Eastern Front right over here.
0:26
By 1917, the major conflict on the Eastern Front,
0:29
especially with Russia, which was the major power there,
0:33
had come to an end.
0:34
You had a February Revolution in Russia.
0:36
The czar had to abdicate the throne.
0:39
You had a provisional government.
0:41
Then in November of 1917,
0:43
the Bolsheviks have a coup, they take over.
0:46
They have no interest in prosecuting World War I,
0:48
because they have their own civil war to worry about,
0:51
so they sign an armistice with the Central Powers,
0:55
by the end of 1917.
0:58
And then we get into 1918,
1:00
just let me write all this down,
1:02
so by the time we get into 1918,
1:05
they're ready to sign a treaty in March,
1:08
in March, the Russians sign
1:11
the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk,
1:13
Litovsk,
1:15
which cedes over all of this territory to the Germans
1:18
and takes the Russians out of World War I.
1:21
So I'm not gonna, I've gone into detail in other videos,
1:23
but a huge amount of territory,
1:25
and I'm gonna do it very informally right over here.
1:27
I'll give a rough sense of where that territory was.
1:31
And the treaty itself, its main significance,
1:33
'cause the treaty didn't last,
1:35
as you might already know,
1:36
the Central Powers lost World War I,
1:38
so that treaty was later nullified.
1:41
But the key importance of that treaty,
1:43
is one, it took Russia out of the war,
1:45
it allowed the Central Powers, especially Germany,
1:48
to focus on the Western Front.
1:49
But the other element of it is,
1:51
by giving so much territory to the Germans,
1:53
the Germans couldn't just leave that territory as is.
1:56
If they wanted any claims to it,
1:58
they had to devote some of their troops to occupy,
2:01
or at least attempt to occupy some of it.
2:04
So even though it was a huge opportunity,
2:05
and the Germans were able to, after the treaty,
2:08
or even before the treaty, after the armistice,
2:10
they were able to start bringing many more
2:13
of the Eastern-Front troops over to the Western Front.
2:17
They didn't bring over as many as they could have,
2:19
because they left some to attempt to occupy
2:22
some of the territory that had been gained
2:24
on the Eastern Front.
2:26
But if you view things from a German perspective,
2:29
at this point, March 1918,
2:31
you're gonna be feeling pretty good.
2:33
You are holding your own in a two-front war now,
2:36
and at one point you thought Russia
2:39
was the major threat there.
2:40
That threat is gone, you can now focus on a one-front war,
2:43
maybe you should be able to kind of
2:45
put the decisive blow against the allies now.
2:48
And that is how the Germans felt.
2:51
But they were worried about a couple of things.
2:53
They were worried about the British industrial capacity,
2:57
and the Allied industrial capacity,
2:58
that was stronger than the Central Powers,
3:02
and so the British could produce more tanks
3:05
and more guns and more weapons,
3:06
so it was a race against that,
3:08
and there was also a race against
3:09
significant American entry.
3:11
Remember, April 1917,
3:13
Woodrow Wilson gives a speech to Congress,
3:16
they declare war on the Central Powers,
3:19
and so the Germans wanna get this thing over with
3:22
before the Americans have a chance
3:24
to send in significant number of fresh troops.
3:27
So in March 1918, not only do you have
3:30
the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk,
3:32
you also have the beginning of Germany's attempt
3:35
to deal that decisive blow to the Allies,
3:38
and it's known as the Spring Offensive.
3:41
So you have the Spring, the Spring Offensive.
3:46
And the goal of the Spring Offensive
3:49
was to essentially try to end the war for the Germans.
3:53
And the goal was to separate
3:55
the British from the French forces.
3:57
The British, for the most part, were in control
3:59
of the line right over here, north of the Salm River,
4:02
while the French were in control south of it.
4:05
So the Spring Offensive, especially the first phases
4:07
of the Spring Offensive, in March 1918,
4:09
focused on this area, right over here.
4:13
And at first it was actually very successful.
4:14
They were able to make huge territorial gains,
4:17
drive through the lines,
4:19
drive the Allied Powers back.
4:21
Now, the problem was is that it wasn't
4:23
a real big strategic gain.
4:25
The Germans were just hoping it would be such a demoralizer,
4:28
that it would throw at least,
4:29
maybe the French out of the war,
4:31
and then maybe they could take care of the British
4:32
or whatever else, but that didn't happen,
4:35
and all of a sudden they found themselves
4:36
with these huge territorial gains,
4:38
in very short amount of time,
4:40
they had to supply themselves,
4:42
and they didn't really quite,
4:44
and they had spread their troops thin,
4:46
and so it frankly just let the opportunity arise
4:49
for the Allies, in August,
4:51
to lead a counteroffensive.
4:53
And this counteroffensive by the Allies,
4:56
is referred to as the 100 Days Offensive.
4:58
It began in August, went roughly into November,
5:01
so 100 Days, 100 Days Offensive,
5:06
during which the Allies, between August and November,
5:09
were able to push the Germans, not only back
5:11
beyond what they had captured during the Spring Offensive,
5:14
but all the way well back of the front
5:17
that was kind of the stalemate line
5:19
for most of World War I.
5:21
And it was during this 100 Days Offensive,
5:23
that to most objective observers,
5:25
it was clear that the Allies would win this war.
5:29
And it was clear to several of the Central Powers,
5:31
or those Allied with the Central Powers.
5:33
As we go into September,
5:36
as we go into September of 1918,
5:40
Bulgaria drops itself out of the war,
5:43
just to remind ourselves where, what we're talking about.
5:46
So you have Bulgaria right over here.
5:49
It, Bulgaria, right over here.
5:51
It signs an armistice with the Allies,
5:54
so, let me just, you have armistice,
5:58
I'll use a little peace symbol for armistice,
6:00
that's a, armistice is just the fighting has stopped,
6:02
you still, in theory, could be at a state of war,
6:05
so maybe I shouldn't do the peace symbol,
6:07
I'll just write armistice.
6:09
Armistice, Armistice, with Bulgaria.
6:15
And this is really starting to tighten the noose
6:17
around the remaining Central Powers,
6:19
because this allowed the Allies to gain control
6:23
of Serbia and of Greece,
6:26
which essentially tied, removed the last source of food
6:30
for Austria, Hungary and the German Empire.
6:33
There was already a blockade,
6:35
the kind of the harsh, British blockade
6:37
that we've already talked about, up in the North Sea,
6:39
and so their last source of food was from the south,
6:41
but now with Bulgaria signing an armistice,
6:44
and ceding over territory,
6:46
now the strangle hold was really,
6:49
was really, really coming into effect.
6:52
Now, by October, and remember,
6:53
at this point it was reasonably clear,
6:56
and even by this point, even clear to the German people
6:59
that the war is pretty much done for,
7:01
and they're just waiting for their leaders
7:03
to make it official.
7:06
So several of the leaders of the German Navy
7:09
wanted to do this last-ditch,
7:11
what could easily be considered suicidal,
7:13
offensive against the British Navy,
7:16
and as they're planning it and the sailors catch wind of it,
7:19
they mutiny, they revolt.
7:20
They say hey, look, the war is over.
7:22
We're not gonna die in a futile attempt
7:25
to just kind of, for pride or whatever else,
7:28
and so you have a naval mutiny begins.
7:31
Naval mutiny, and eventually this spreads to the mainland
7:35
and leads to revolts and revolutions,
7:38
so revolution in Germany, in Germany.
7:43
And this culminates in November, in November,
7:47
November 9th, famous date in history,
7:49
November 9th, 1918.
7:51
You essentially, Kaiser Wilhelm II,
7:55
right over here, let me make sure you see his picture,
7:58
this is him right over here, Kaiser Wilhelm II,
8:02
is forced to abdicate, give up his throne.
8:04
He flees to the Netherlands,
8:07
and on November 9th, 1918,
8:09
Germany is declared a republic.
8:11
So Germany no longer has a king or emperor in charge.
8:18
Germany becomes a republic.
8:22
And a little bit before this, November 3rd,
8:24
the writing was already clear to the Austrians,
8:27
in fact, they even, in 1917,
8:29
attempted to make some peace overtures,
8:31
thinking that they were pretty much done for,
8:33
but by November 3rd, 1918,
8:36
the Austrians also signed an armistice,
8:39
armistice, armistice,
8:43
with the Austrians, with the Austrians,
8:47
and with the Kaiser Wilhelm II fleeing to the Netherlands,
8:52
Germany becoming a republic,
8:54
this sets up the armistice, finally, with Germany
8:58
on November 11th,
9:00
and this is one of the most famous dates in history,
9:03
known for a long time in the US as Armistice Day,
9:06
and so it was November 11th, 1918,
9:10
and it was actually 11am, 11am,
9:13
so you might remember the famous,
9:14
the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month,
9:18
war, or World War I, or the fighting in World War I,
9:22
was over with the Allies victorious,
9:25
and the Central Powers losing it,
9:27
and the terms of what would happen for those that lost
9:30
and those that won would be dictated
9:33
by the Treaty of Versailles.
9:34
The Treaty of Versailles in 1919.
9:37
The terms of which were finally finalized
9:39
about six months later.
9:41
So this is June, you have the treaty,
9:44
Treaty of, Treaty of, Treaty of Versailles.
9:50
Which, incidentally, this is like one of those
9:51
little footnotes in history,
9:53
the Americans did not actually ratify it,
9:55
mainly because it had the League of Nations in it,
9:57
which was this project of Woodrow Wilson,
10:00
but the American people and the American Congress
10:03
was not a fan of this whole trans-national government,
10:06
League of Nations thing,
10:07
so the United States did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles
10:10
but in effect, on Armistice Day, November 11th, 11am,
10:14
the war was over, Treaty of Versailles dictated the terms,
10:17
many would argue, overly-harsh terms,
10:20
of the Treaty of Versailles,
10:22
and we're done with World War I.",Why is the name of Germany so much pronounced in the world war 1 although there were other countries involved in the central power?

Let's do a few more problems that bring together the
0:03
concepts that we learned in the last two videos.
0:05
So let's say we have the inequality 4x plus 3 is less
0:11
than negative 1.
0:12
So let's find all of the x's that satisfy this.
0:16
So the first thing I'd like to do is get rid of this 3.
0:18
So let's subtract 3 from both sides of this equation.
0:23
So the left-hand side is just going to end up being 4x.
0:27
These 3's cancel out.
0:29
That just ends up with a zero.
0:31
No reason to change the inequality just yet.
0:33
We're just adding and subtracting from both sides,
0:35
in this case, subtracting.
0:36
That doesn't change the inequality as long as we're
0:38
subtracting the same value.
0:40
We have negative 1 minus 3.
0:43
That is negative 4.
0:45
Negative 1 minus 3 is negative 4.
0:49
And then we'll want to-- let's see, we can divide both sides
0:53
of this equation by 4.
1:00
Once again, when you multiply or divide both sides of an
1:02
inequality by a positive number, it doesn't change the
1:06
inequality.
1:06
So the left-hand side is just x.
1:09
x is less than negative 4 divided by 4 is negative 1.
1:15
x is less than negative 1.
1:16
Or we could write this in interval notation.
1:19
All of the x's from negative infinity to negative 1, but
1:24
not including negative 1, so we put a
1:25
parenthesis right there.
1:27
Let's do a slightly harder one.
1:31
Let's say we have 5x is greater than 8x plus 27.
1:39
So let's get all our x's on the left-hand side, and the
1:41
best way to do that is subtract 8x from both sides.
1:45
So you subtract 8x from both sides.
1:49
The left-hand side becomes 5x minus 8x.
1:53
That's negative 3x.
1:56
We still have a greater than sign.
1:57
We're just adding or subtracting the same
1:59
quantities on both sides.
2:01
These 8x's cancel out and you're just left with a 27.
2:04
So you have negative 3x is greater than 27.
2:08
Now, to just turn this into an x, we want to divide both
2:11
sides by negative 3.
2:12
But remember, when you multiply or divide both sides
2:16
of an inequality by a negative number, you swap the
2:19
inequality.
2:20
So if we divide both sides of this by negative 3, we have to
2:29
swap this inequality.
2:30
It will go from being a greater than sign
2:33
to a less than sign.
2:36
And just as a bit of a way that I remember greater than
2:39
is that the left-hand side just looks bigger.
2:41
This is greater than.
2:42
If you just imagine this height, that height is greater
2:45
than that height right there, which is just a point.
2:48
I don't know if that confuses you or not.
2:49
This is less than.
2:50
This little point is less than the
2:53
distance of that big opening.
2:55
That's how I remember it.
2:56
But anyway, 3x over negative 3.
3:00
So now that we divided both sides by a negative number, by
3:04
negative 3, we swapped the inequality from greater than
3:07
to less than.
3:08
And the left-hand side, the negative 3's cancel out.
3:11
You get x is less than 27 over negative 3,
3:16
which is negative 9.
3:18
Or in interval notation, it would be everything from
3:21
negative infinity to negative 9, not including negative 9.
3:26
If you wanted to do it as a number line, it
3:29
would look like this.
3:31
This would be negative 9, maybe this would be negative
3:35
8, maybe this would be negative 10.
3:37
You would start at negative 9, not included, because we don't
3:40
have an equal sign here, and you go everything less than
3:44
that, all the way down, as we see, to negative infinity.
3:47
Let's do a nice, hairy problem.
3:52
So let's say we have 8x minus 5 times 4x plus 1 is greater
4:05
than or equal to negative 1 plus 2 times 4x minus 3.
4:12
Now, this might seem very daunting, but if we just
4:14
simplify it step by step, you'll see it's no harder than
4:17
any of the other problems we've tackled.
4:20
So let's just simplify this.
4:21
You get 8x minus-- let's distribute this negative 5.
4:26
So let me say 8x, and then distribute the negative 5.
4:29
Negative 5 times 4x is negative 20x.
4:33
Negative 5-- when I say negative 5, I'm talking about
4:35
this whole thing.
4:36
Negative 5 times 1 is negative 5, and then that's going to be
4:42
greater than or equal to negative 1 plus
4:45
2 times 4x is 8x.
4:48
2 times negative 3 is negative 6.
4:51
And now we can merge these two terms. 8x minus 20x is
4:56
negative 12x minus 5 is greater than or equal to-- we
5:04
can merge these constant terms. Negative 1 minus 6,
5:10
that's negative 7, and then we have this plus 8x left over.
5:16
Now, I like to get all my x terms on the left-hand side,
5:18
so let's subtract 8x from both sides of this equation.
5:30
I'm subtracting 8x.
5:32
This left-hand side, negative 12 minus 8,
5:34
that's negative 20.
5:36
Negative 20x minus 5.
5:41
Once again, no reason to change the
5:42
inequality just yet.
5:44
All we're doing is simplifying the sides, or adding and
5:46
subtracting from them.
5:48
The right-hand side becomes-- this thing cancels out, 8x
5:53
minus 8x, that's 0.
5:54
So you're just left with a negative 7.
5:57
And now I want to get rid of this negative 5.
5:59
So let's add 5 to both sides of this equation.
6:06
The left-hand side, you're just left with a negative 20x.
6:12
These 5's cancel out.
6:14
No reason to change the inequality just yet.
6:17
Negative 7 plus 5, that's negative 2.
6:22
Now, we're at an interesting point.
6:23
We have negative 20x is greater than or equal to
6:26
negative 2.
6:28
If this was an equation, or really any type of an
6:31
inequality, we want to divide both sides by negative 20.
6:33
But we have to remember, when you multiply or divide both
6:36
sides of an inequality by a negative number, you have to
6:39
swap the inequality.
6:40
So let's remember that.
6:42
So if we divide this side by negative 20 and we divide this
6:46
side by negative 20, all I did is took both of these sides
6:50
divided by negative 20, we have to swap the inequality.
6:54
The greater than or equal to has to become a less than or
6:58
equal sign.
6:59
And, of course, these cancel out, and you get x is less
7:03
than or equal to-- the negatives cancel
7:05
out-- 2/20 is 1/10.
7:10
If we were writing it in interval notation, the upper
7:13
bound would be 1/10.
7:15
Notice, we're including it, because we have an equal sign,
7:18
less than or equal, so we're including 1/10, and we're
7:22
going to go all the way down to negative infinity,
7:24
everything less than or equal to 1/10.
7:27
This is just another way of writing that.
7:29
And just for fun, let's draw the number line.
7:33
Let's draw the number line right here.
7:35
This is maybe 0, that is 1.
7:38
1/10 might be over here.
7:42
Everything less than or equal to 1/10.
7:45
So we're going to include the 1/10 and everything less than
7:51
that is included in the solution set.
7:54
And you could try out any value less than 1/10 and
7:56
verify that it will satisfy this inequality.",So the signs are swapped only when you divide or multiply by a negative number?
khan_video_xaz5ftvZCyI_108,Science,MCQ,"•
0:00
Now that we've touched on all of the major players in the
0:02
specific immune system, what I thought I would do in this
0:05
video is do a summary so it all fits
0:08
together a little bit.
0:09
So the first person or character we got exposed to
0:12
was the B cell, which I always do in blue.
0:18
And what made that interesting is that every B cell has its
0:22
own specific-- or they have membrane bound antibodies, but
0:28
for each B cell, the membrane bound antibodies on each
0:33
specific B cell had its own variable portion.
0:36
So this B cell-- it'll be variable right like that.
0:41
And if I were to draw another B cell right here, I would
0:45
draw the variable portion a little bit different.
0:47
This is why different actual B cells will respond to
0:51
different antigens or different pathogens that have
0:54
entered our system.
0:55
And a B cell gets activated-- let's talk about what happens
1:05
when it gets activated or what needs to happen.
1:10
It needs binding of the pathogen onto one of these
1:15
membrane bound antibodies.
1:28
But that's not all.
1:29
I mean, sometimes that's all you need, but usually you also
1:33
need to be stimulated by a T cell.
1:41
And you might say, where's the helper T cell
1:44
stimulate this guy?
1:46
Well, B cells were also antigen presenting cells so
1:49
he'll suck this guy in, break him out, and present him on an
1:53
MHC II complex.
2:00
Let's say this is an MHC II complex.
2:03
This guy gets cut up, part of him gets presented right here,
2:06
and then an activated helper T cell whose variable portion of
2:12
their T cell receptor is specific to this could come
2:15
along and activate this character.
2:20
I'm not drawing that receptor well, but that right there is
2:24
a helper T cell and that is the B cell.
2:28
Now, once it's activated, it starts differentiating-- and
2:33
it starts cloning itself and it can either turn into
2:35
effector cells-- and this true of B cells or T cells.
2:41
Once they get activated, they keep cloning or they either
2:43
turn into effector cells or memory cells.
2:46
Memory cells stick around a lot longer so that in the
2:49
future you're going to have many more of this
2:51
version of B cells.
2:52
So if you get the same antigen or pathogen in the future, the
2:56
likelihood of it bumping into this type of B cell is going
2:59
to be higher so the response will occur faster.
3:02
The effector B cells produce-- they essentially turn into
3:10
antibody making machines.
3:12
So they'll say, gee, this antibody bonds to this antigen
3:16
that we have in the system now.
3:18
Let me just produce a ton of them.
3:20
So it starts building up all of the cellular machinery and
3:23
it starts producing antibodies like crazy.
3:26
I want to point out one thing that my wife pointed out to me
3:29
when I was-- she overheard me making the last video and
3:32
she's a fellow in hematology and a lot of hematology is
3:35
immunology.
3:36
So I definitely have to defer to her.
3:38
She is the expert on this.
3:41
In the last video, I kind of very hand-wavingly said, B
3:45
cells, once they get activated, if they're the
3:47
effector B cells, they produce antibodies.
3:49
I want to be very clear.
3:50
It is only the effector B cells that produce the
3:52
antibodies and the common term for them-- if someone were to
3:57
walk up to you and say, what cells in the body are
4:01
producing antibodies?
4:02
You wouldn't be wrong if you said effector B cells, but the
4:05
common term that people expect to hear are plasma cells.
4:12
Plasma cells and effector B cells are the same thing, but
4:16
normally when they say, what happens to a B cell when it
4:18
starts producing antibodies?
4:20
They then call it a plasma cell.
4:21
They don't call it a B cell anymore and I want to make
4:23
that very clear because my wife's like, well, I have
4:24
attendings that if they asked me, what cell in the body
4:28
produces antibodies?
4:29
And if you said, B cell, they would say, no, wrong.
4:32
It's a plasma cell-- or if you said effector B cell, they
4:34
wouldn't be happy.
4:35
They wanted to hear plasma cell.
4:36
This is the common term used in immunology and apparently
4:44
rheumatology circles.
4:45
Did I just say my wife is a hematologist?
4:47
No, no.
4:47
She's studying rheumatology.
4:48
I get confused with all the tologies sometimes.
4:51
Anyway, that's what the B cells do.
4:52
And these antibodies can then go attach things and mess up
4:55
viruses and antigen-- well, viruses or instances of
4:58
antigens and bacteria-- and tag them for pick up by
5:02
macrophages or other types of phagocytes.
5:04
Those were the B cells.
5:06
Then you have your T cells.
5:09
And here I'm going to talk about T cells a little bit
5:11
differently than I had in the last few videos.
5:14
Just to give a little bit more of a nuance-- so there's two
5:18
types of T cells.
5:19
You'll say, hey, they are helper T cells and cytotoxic T
5:21
cells-- and you're not wrong, but what I'm going to do is do
5:24
a slightly different differentiation just so that
5:28
you are familiar with these terms. So there's
5:30
two types of T cells.
5:33
All T cells have T cell receptors.
5:44
But they also have these other proteins on them and some of
5:50
them have these proteins called-- CD4 proteins and some
5:58
of them have what's called CD8.
6:09
So this one right here would be called a
6:11
CD8 positive T cell.
6:15
It has the CD8 proteins on it.
6:18
And this would be called a CD4 positive T cell.
6:23
I've never used these words before.
6:25
You're like, gee, where are these coming from?
6:27
Now, the CD4 receptor is the thing that wants to bind--
6:32
this is the thing that helps to go to the MHC II complexes.
6:38
So most CD4 T cells are helper T cells.
6:45
Most of the time-- and I want to make it very clear--
6:47
immunology is a very-- I mean, this field, people are
6:49
discovering things on a regular basis.
6:51
So people are still understanding these things and
6:53
there's all sorts of special cases, but usually when people
6:57
talk about CD4 positive T cells, they're talking about
7:00
helper T cells.
7:02
So this is normally going to be a helper T cell-- or you
7:07
could call it T helper, just like that.
7:10
Likewise, the CD8 proteins, these are attracted
7:13
to the MHC I complex.
7:21
This is what brings them to the cells that have the
7:24
cancer, that have expressed antigens
7:26
on their MHC I complex.
7:28
So most of the time CD8
7:30
positive T cells are cytotoxic.
7:39
And oftentimes, before a cell gets activated, they just
7:42
describe it as a CD4 T cell or a CD8 cell and after it
7:45
becomes activated and starts wanting to kill things, then
7:53
maybe you call it cytotoxic.
7:54
But this is all wordplay.
7:56
I think you get the general idea.
7:58
But just to remember what they do, this guy-- we just said he
8:04
wants to bond to the MHC complex, so you have MHC
8:08
complex plus presenting some antigen.
8:13
This is MHC I right here.
8:15
We learned in the last video, every nucleated cell in the
8:19
body expresses an MHC I complex.
8:22
So this is the case where something wacky is happening
8:25
inside this cell.
8:26
Maybe a virus has infected it.
8:28
Maybe it's cancerous.
8:30
It needs to die, otherwise it's going to keep producing
8:34
viruses if it's infected by a virus, or otherwise it's going
8:37
to keep dividing if it's a cancer and infect
8:39
the rest of the body.
8:40
So the CD8 kills infected cells.
8:45
I'll just say bad cells because I don't if you can--
8:48
cancer really isn't an infection.
8:50
Kills bad cells-- cells that are-- if you don't kill them,
8:53
they're going to keep producing viruses or keep
8:54
splitting and spreading the cancer, while T cells--
9:00
they're attracted to professional antigen
9:03
presenting cells.
9:04
And I always do a dendritic cell right here because those
9:06
are the best antigen presenting cells.
9:09
And they have MHC II complexes and it's digested some antigen
9:16
and it presents it right there and then that activates the
9:21
helper T cell.
9:22
And then when the helper T cell-- all of these guys, once
9:26
they're activated, they all go into effector-- they all start
9:31
differentiating into effector and memory cells.
9:35
An effector helper T cell does a couple of things.
9:40
So if we're talking about a helper T cell, it can activate
9:46
B cells and it also releases cytokines.
9:51
Let's say this guy gets activated.
9:53
He'll also start releasing these chemicals, which are
9:56
really those alarm bells that tell other people to really
10:00
get in gear-- maybe B cells and cytotoxic T cells start
10:03
proliferating more rigorously.
10:05
Actually, part of the cytotoxic T cell activation
10:10
can be assisted or kind of given a boost by these
10:14
cytokines-- of so by these alarm bells.
10:17
So this guy's the alarm ringer, while the CD8 cells or
10:24
the cytotoxic T cells-- in their effector
10:27
mode, they kill cells.
10:31
And of course in the memory mode, there's just a bunch of
10:33
copies of these originals around that are ready and more
10:36
than they were originally were, so that in the future if
10:39
something like this or something like this occurs,
10:41
they're going to be activated faster because they're going
10:43
to be bumped into faster.
10:45
So hopefully that clears up a little bit and I introduced a
10:47
little bit more tough terminology, but I really want
10:48
to stress my wife's point because she said, hey, you
10:50
don't want people out there saying B cells produce
10:53
antibodies even though it is effector B cells-- activated B
10:57
cells that have differentiated into effector B cells.
10:59
Those are what are producing antibodies-- because when they
11:01
go to medical school, people are going to want to hear
11:03

Now that we've touched on all of the major players in the
0:02
specific immune system, what I thought I would do in this
0:05
video is do a summary so it all fits
0:08
together a little bit.
0:09
So the first person or character we got exposed to
0:12
was the B cell, which I always do in blue.
0:18
And what made that interesting is that every B cell has its
0:22
own specific-- or they have membrane bound antibodies, but
0:28
for each B cell, the membrane bound antibodies on each
0:33
specific B cell had its own variable portion.
0:36
So this B cell-- it'll be variable right like that.
0:41
And if I were to draw another B cell right here, I would
0:45
draw the variable portion a little bit different.
0:47
This is why different actual B cells will respond to
0:51
different antigens or different pathogens that have
0:54
entered our system.
0:55
And a B cell gets activated-- let's talk about what happens
1:05
when it gets activated or what needs to happen.
1:10
It needs binding of the pathogen onto one of these
1:15
membrane bound antibodies.
1:28
But that's not all.
1:29
I mean, sometimes that's all you need, but usually you also
1:33
need to be stimulated by a T cell.
1:41
And you might say, where's the helper T cell
1:44
stimulate this guy?
1:46
Well, B cells were also antigen presenting cells so
1:49
he'll suck this guy in, break him out, and present him on an
1:53
MHC II complex.
2:00
Let's say this is an MHC II complex.
2:03
This guy gets cut up, part of him gets presented right here,
2:06
and then an activated helper T cell whose variable portion of
2:12
their T cell receptor is specific to this could come
2:15
along and activate this character.
2:20
I'm not drawing that receptor well, but that right there is
2:24
a helper T cell and that is the B cell.
2:28
Now, once it's activated, it starts differentiating-- and
2:33
it starts cloning itself and it can either turn into
2:35
effector cells-- and this true of B cells or T cells.
2:41
Once they get activated, they keep cloning or they either
2:43
turn into effector cells or memory cells.
2:46
Memory cells stick around a lot longer so that in the
2:49
future you're going to have many more of this
2:51
version of B cells.
2:52
So if you get the same antigen or pathogen in the future, the
2:56
likelihood of it bumping into this type of B cell is going
2:59
to be higher so the response will occur faster.
3:02
The effector B cells produce-- they essentially turn into
3:10
antibody making machines.
3:12
So they'll say, gee, this antibody bonds to this antigen
3:16
that we have in the system now.
3:18
Let me just produce a ton of them.
3:20
So it starts building up all of the cellular machinery and
3:23
it starts producing antibodies like crazy.
3:26
I want to point out one thing that my wife pointed out to me
3:29
when I was-- she overheard me making the last video and
3:32
she's a fellow in hematology and a lot of hematology is
3:35
immunology.
3:36
So I definitely have to defer to her.
3:38
She is the expert on this.
3:41
In the last video, I kind of very hand-wavingly said, B
3:45
cells, once they get activated, if they're the
3:47
effector B cells, they produce antibodies.
3:49
I want to be very clear.
3:50
It is only the effector B cells that produce the
3:52
antibodies and the common term for them-- if someone were to
3:57
walk up to you and say, what cells in the body are
4:01
producing antibodies?
4:02
You wouldn't be wrong if you said effector B cells, but the
4:05
common term that people expect to hear are plasma cells.
4:12
Plasma cells and effector B cells are the same thing, but
4:16
normally when they say, what happens to a B cell when it
4:18
starts producing antibodies?
4:20
They then call it a plasma cell.
4:21
They don't call it a B cell anymore and I want to make
4:23
that very clear because my wife's like, well, I have
4:24
attendings that if they asked me, what cell in the body
4:28
produces antibodies?
4:29
And if you said, B cell, they would say, no, wrong.
4:32
It's a plasma cell-- or if you said effector B cell, they
4:34
wouldn't be happy.
4:35
They wanted to hear plasma cell.
4:36
This is the common term used in immunology and apparently
4:44
rheumatology circles.
4:45
Did I just say my wife is a hematologist?
4:47
No, no.
4:47
She's studying rheumatology.
4:48
I get confused with all the tologies sometimes.
4:51
Anyway, that's what the B cells do.
4:52
And these antibodies can then go attach things and mess up
4:55
viruses and antigen-- well, viruses or instances of
4:58
antigens and bacteria-- and tag them for pick up by
5:02
macrophages or other types of phagocytes.
5:04
Those were the B cells.
5:06
Then you have your T cells.
5:09
And here I'm going to talk about T cells a little bit
5:11
differently than I had in the last few videos.
5:14
Just to give a little bit more of a nuance-- so there's two
5:18
types of T cells.
5:19
You'll say, hey, they are helper T cells and cytotoxic T
5:21
cells-- and you're not wrong, but what I'm going to do is do
5:24
a slightly different differentiation just so that
5:28
you are familiar with these terms. So there's
5:30
two types of T cells.
5:33
All T cells have T cell receptors.
5:44
But they also have these other proteins on them and some of
5:50
them have these proteins called-- CD4 proteins and some
5:58
of them have what's called CD8.
6:09
So this one right here would be called a
6:11
CD8 positive T cell.
6:15
It has the CD8 proteins on it.
6:18
And this would be called a CD4 positive T cell.
6:23
I've never used these words before.
6:25
You're like, gee, where are these coming from?
6:27
Now, the CD4 receptor is the thing that wants to bind--
6:32
this is the thing that helps to go to the MHC II complexes.
6:38
So most CD4 T cells are helper T cells.
6:45
Most of the time-- and I want to make it very clear--
6:47
immunology is a very-- I mean, this field, people are
6:49
discovering things on a regular basis.
6:51
So people are still understanding these things and
6:53
there's all sorts of special cases, but usually when people
6:57
talk about CD4 positive T cells, they're talking about
7:00
helper T cells.
7:02
So this is normally going to be a helper T cell-- or you
7:07
could call it T helper, just like that.
7:10
Likewise, the CD8 proteins, these are attracted
7:13
to the MHC I complex.
7:21
This is what brings them to the cells that have the
7:24
cancer, that have expressed antigens
7:26
on their MHC I complex.
7:28
So most of the time CD8
7:30
positive T cells are cytotoxic.
7:39
And oftentimes, before a cell gets activated, they just
7:42
describe it as a CD4 T cell or a CD8 cell and after it
7:45
becomes activated and starts wanting to kill things, then
7:53
maybe you call it cytotoxic.
7:54
But this is all wordplay.
7:56
I think you get the general idea.
7:58
But just to remember what they do, this guy-- we just said he
8:04
wants to bond to the MHC complex, so you have MHC
8:08
complex plus presenting some antigen.
8:13
This is MHC I right here.
8:15
We learned in the last video, every nucleated cell in the
8:19
body expresses an MHC I complex.
8:22
So this is the case where something wacky is happening
8:25
inside this cell.
8:26
Maybe a virus has infected it.
8:28
Maybe it's cancerous.
8:30
It needs to die, otherwise it's going to keep producing
8:34
viruses if it's infected by a virus, or otherwise it's going
8:37
to keep dividing if it's a cancer and infect
8:39
the rest of the body.
8:40
So the CD8 kills infected cells.
8:45
I'll just say bad cells because I don't if you can--
8:48
cancer really isn't an infection.
8:50
Kills bad cells-- cells that are-- if you don't kill them,
8:53

Let's say that f(x) is equal to x over the square root of x^2+1
0:09
and I want to think about the limit of f(x) as x approaches positive infinity
0:18
and the limit of f(x) as x approaches neagative infinity.
0:25
So let's think about what these are going to be.
0:28
Well, once again, and I'm not doing this in an ultra-rigorous way but more in an intuitive way
0:32
is to think about what this function approximately equals
0:36
as we get larger and larger and larger x'es.
0:38
This is the case if we're getting very positive x'es, in very positive infinity direction or very negative.
0:44
Still the absolute value of those x'es are very very very large as we approach positive infinity
0:48
or negative infinity.
0:50
Well, in the numerator we only have only 1 term -- we have this x term --
0:54
-- but in the denominator we have 2 terms under the radical here.
0:57
And as x gets larger and larger and larger either in the positive or the negative direction
1:01
this x squared term is going to really dominate this one
1:05
You can imagine, when x is 1 million, you're going to have a million squared plus one.
1:09
The value of the denominator is going to be dictated by this x squared term.
1:13
So this is going to be approximately equal to x over the square root of x squared.
1:22
This term right over here, the 1 isn't going to matter so much when we get very very very large x'es.
1:29
And this right over here -- x over the square root of x squared or x over the principle root of x squared --
1:34
-- this is going to be equal to x over --
1:37
-- if I square something and then take the principle root --
1:40
-- remember that the principle root is the positive square root of something --
1:43
-- then I'm essentially taking the absolute value of x.
1:45
This is going to be equal to x over the absolute value of x
1:49
for x approaches infinity or for x approaches negative infinity.
1:57
So, another way to say this, another way to restate these limits,
2:00
is as we approach infinity, this limit, we can restate it as the limit,
2:04
this is going to be equal to the limit as x approaches infinity of x over the absolute value of x.
2:11
Now, for positive x'es the absolute value of x is just going to be x.
2:15
This is going to be x divided by x, so this is just going to be 1.
2:19
Similarly, right over here, we take the limit as we go to negative infinity,
2:23
this is going to be the limit of x over the absolute value of x as x approaches negative infinity.
2:29
Remember, the only reason I was able to make this statement is that f(x) and this thing right over here
2:35
become very very similar, you can kind of say converge to each other,
2:39
as x gets very very very large or x gets very very very very negative.
2:45
Now, for negative values of x the absolute value of x is going to be positive,
2:50
x is obviously going to be negative and we're just going to get negative 1.
2:55
And so using this, we can actually try to graph our function.
3:01
So let's try to do that.
3:02
So let's say, that is my y axis,
3:06
this is my x axis,
3:10
and we see that we have 2 horizontal asymptotes.
3:13
We have 1 horizontal asymptote at y=1,
3:17
so let's say this right over here is y=1,
3:20
let me draw that line as dotted line,
3:23
we're going to approach this thing,
3:25
and then we have another horizontal asymptote at y=-1.
3:29
So that might be right over there, y=-1.
3:37
And if we want to plot at least 1 point we can think about what does f(0) equal.
3:41
So, f(0) is going to be equal to 0 over the square root of 0+1, or 0 squared plus 1.
3:50
Well that's all just going to be equal to zero.
3:53
So we have this point, right over here,
3:57
and we know that as x approaches infinity, we're approaching this blue, horizontal asymptote,
4:02
so it might look something like this.
4:06
Let me do it a little bit differently. There you go.
4:12
I'll clean this up. So it might look something like this.
4:16
That's not the color I wanted to use.
4:18
So it might look something like that.
4:25
We get closer and closer to that asymptote as x gets larger and larger
4:29
and then like this -- we get closer and closer to this asymptote as x approaches negative infinity.
4:38
I'm not drawing it so well.
4:39
So that right over there is y=f(x).
4:44
And you can verify this by taking a calculator, trying to plot more points
4:48
or using some type of graphing calculator or something.
4:50
But anyway, I just wanted to tackle another situation we're approaching infinity and or negative infinity
4:54
and we're trying to determine the horizontal asymptotes.
4:57
And remember, the key is just to say what terms dominate
5:01
as x approaches positive infinity or negative infinity.
5:05
To say, well, what is that function going to approach, and it's going to approach this horizontal asymptote
5:10
in the positive direction and this one in the negative.","So if the gradient approaches zero, why doesn't the function sqrt(x) approach some number and have a horizontal asymtote as x approaches infinity?"

Tracy is putting out decorative bowls of potpourri
0:03
in each room of the hotel where she works.
0:05
She wants to fill each bowl with 1/5 of a can of potpourri.
0:11
If Tracy has 4 cans of potpourri, in how many rooms
0:15
can she place a bowl of potpourri?
0:18
So she has 4 cans, and she wants to divide this 4
0:22
cans into groups of 1/5 of a can.
0:25
So if you have 4 of something and you're
0:27
trying to divide it into groups of a certain amount,
0:29
you would divide by that amount per group.
0:32
So you want to divide 4 by 1/5.
0:37
You want to divide 4 cans of potpourri into groups of 1/5.
0:42
So let's visualize this.
0:46
Let me draw one can of potpourri right over here.
0:50
So one can of potpourri can clearly be cut up into 5/5.
0:55
We have it right over here.
0:56
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
1:00
So 1 can of potpourri can fill 5 bowls
1:05
if you put 1/5 in each bowl.
1:07
Now, we have 4 cans.
1:10
So let me paste these.
1:12
So 2, 3, and 4.
1:18
So how many total bowls of potpourri can Tracy fill?
1:23
Well, she's got 4 cans.
1:25
So this is going to be equal to-- let
1:27
me do this is the right color-- this is going
1:29
to be equal to, once again, she has 4 cans.
1:33
And then for each of those cans, she
1:35
can fill 5 bowls of potpourri because each bowl only
1:37
requires a 1/5 of those cans.
1:40
So this is going to be the same thing as 4 times 5.
1:45
Or we can even write this as 4 times 5 over 1.
1:48
5 is the same thing as 5/1, which
1:51
is the same thing as 4 times 5, which,
1:58
of course, is equal to 20.
2:02
She can fill 20 cans-- or I should say, with her 4 cans,
2:06
she can fill 20 bowls of potpourri.
2:10
Now, just as a review here, we've
2:13
already seen that dividing by a number
2:15
is equal to multiplying by its reciprocal.
2:18
And we see that right over here.
2:20
Dividing by 1/5 is the same thing
2:22
as multiplying by the reciprocal of 1/5, which is 5/1.
2:27
So she could fill up 20 bowls of potpourri.",What if you have to divide a 3 digit number such as 3/4 divided by 225?

- [Voiceover] Let's now see if we can balance a chemical
0:02
equation with slightly more complex molecules.
0:07
So, here we have a chemical equation,
0:10
describing a chemical reaction.
0:11
This is actually a combustion reaction.
0:14
You have some ethylene right over here,
0:17
in the presence of oxygen, and you need to get a
0:20
little bit of energy to get this going, but then you're
0:22
going to have this reaction that's actually going to
0:24
release energy as well, but we're not accounting for
0:26
the energy, at least the way we've written it.
0:28
Right over here, you have some ethylene, and this little
0:32
g in parentheses, says it's in the gas form
0:35
or gaseous form, so gaseous ethylene plus some
0:40
dioxygen molecule, which is the most prevalent form of
0:43
oxygen molecule that you would find in the atmosphere.
0:47
And so, that's also in the gas form.
0:49
Put them together, you end up with some carbon dioxide
0:52
gas and some liquid water.
0:55
This is the classic combustion reaction.
0:58
But now let's think about, how do we balance this thing?
1:01
Let's make sure we have the same number
1:03
of each atom on both sides.
1:07
And when you see something more complicated like this,
1:09
where, you know, here I have an oxygen and two different
1:13
molecules over here, and a lot of these molecules have
1:17
multiple elements in it.
1:19
It might be very daunting.
1:20
Where do I start?
1:21
And this is where the art of balancing chemical
1:23
equations starts to come into play.
1:26
The general idea is,
1:28
Try to balance the...
1:30
try to balance the molecules that have multiple
1:33
elements in them first, and leave the...
1:37
molecules that only have one element in them for last.
1:40
And the idea there is, is that these are harder.
1:43
They're going to have all sorts of implications,
1:44
and then, at the end of the day, you can just set
1:46
a number here for the number of dioxygens.
1:50
If you saved, say the ethylene for last,
1:54
then every time, and you're trying to balance the carbons,
1:57
you try to change the number of carbons, you're going to
1:59
change the number of hydrogens,
2:00
which is going to change the...
2:01
You're going to have to balance over and over, and you're
2:03
going to go into this really really really confusing circle.
2:05
So, the best thing to do, try to balance
2:08
the complex molecules first, and then
2:11
save the single element molecules for last.
2:15
So let's do that.
2:16
So, let's start with the carbons.
2:19
So, over here, I have two carbons.
2:22
Over here, I only have one carbon.
2:26
I only have one carbon.
2:28
So, it seems like the best way to balance it is, I should
2:31
have two molecules of carbon dioxide,
2:35
and I haven't even thought about the oxygens yet.
2:37
By putting that two there, that's going to change the
2:39
number of oxygens I have on the righthand side.
2:42
But at least it balances my carbons.
2:44
I now have two carbons on the lefthand side,
2:47
and I have two carbons on the righthand side.
2:49
I’m no longer magically destroying
2:52
a carbon atom, all right.
2:55
Now, let's move on to the hydrogens, and remember,
2:57
what I said is, let's wait to do the oxygens last,
3:00
because we have a molecule
3:03
that only contains oxygen right over here,
3:06
so we'll save oxygen for last.
3:08
So, let's do hydrogen next.
3:11
So, hydrogen, right over here, we have four hydrogens.
3:15
And on the righthand side, we have two hydrogens.
3:18
So, it seems like the easiest thing to do to balance
3:21
the hydrogens is to have two of these water molecules.
3:25
Now I have four hydrogens here,
3:27
and I have four hydrogens there.
3:30
Now, let's do the oxygen.
3:33
Now, let's do the oxygen.
3:34
I've balanced the carbons and the hydrogens.
3:36
And the reason why oxygen's going to be interesting,
3:38
I can just count the amount of oxygen I now have here,
3:41
after changing the amount of molecules I have.
3:45
And then I can adjust this accordingly, because this is
3:48
only going to affect the number of oxygens
3:50
that I have on the lefthand side.
3:52
Right now, on the lefthand side, I have two oxygens,
3:54
and on the righthand side, let me count this,
3:57
I have two O two's, really.
4:00
So, this is going to be four oxygens here,
4:02
and then I have, each of these water molecules has
4:05
one oxygen, but I have two water molecules,
4:07
so this is going to be two oxygens, two oxygens here.
4:11
So, on the righthand side, I have four plus two oxygens.
4:15
So, I have six oxygens on the righthand side.
4:17
I need six oxygens on the lefthand side.
4:19
I need this number to be six.
4:21
So, how do I do that?
4:23
Well, I just need three of these molecules.
4:24
If I have three molecules, each of them have two oxygens,
4:27
I'm going to have a total of six oxygens.
4:29
And just like that, we have balanced this
4:31
combustion reaction, this chemical equation.",Why do we differentiate between the two that comes before the atom and the two written in subscript?
khan_video_yQtUyBrRBx4_45600,Social Studies,ESSAY,"•
0:00
Everything we've talked about so far with this startup
0:04
company selling socks and all of that, has been raising
0:06
money from an equity.
0:07
We raised private money-- when the company was private it
0:10
went to VCs and it went to angel investors, and maybe you
0:15
could go to your friends and family to raise money.
0:17
And then the company could go public and raise money from
0:20
the public markets.
0:21
But there's actually two ways that a
0:23
company can raise capital.
0:26
So this is why this playlist is called capital markets, or
0:29
it's part of it, the name of raise capital.
0:32
Capital is just essentially-- I mean the easy way to think
0:34
about it is you're raising cash that you want to invest
0:38
in some way to grow your business or to sustain your
0:40
business or start your business.
0:41
So everything we talked about so far was equity, and that's
0:47
essentially selling shares in your company to raise money.
0:51
And so that's all of those VC examples.
0:54
The equity investor-- so when you sell equity, you're
0:56
essentially selling-- you're kind of making that person
0:59
who's buying the stock-- you know, an equity is the same
1:01
thing as stock-- you're making the person who's buying a
1:04
stock kind of a partner in the company.
1:06
So if the company-- let's say there's two situations-- if
1:09
the company goes bankrupt-- and I'll talk a lot more about
1:12
what bankruptcy even means-- but if the company goes
1:16
bankrupt, all the shareholders end up with nothing.
1:18
They end up with nil.
1:20
But if the company has a lot of upside, the stock gets a
1:25
lot of upside.
1:27
Because they're partners in it.
1:28
If this was a company, that start-up that we talked about,
1:31
if it turns into Amazon.com and becomes a billion-dollar
1:34
company, everyone is going to do really well.
1:35
Everyone's going to share in that upside.
1:38
But there's another way to raise money, and actually this
1:40
is probably something that's more familiar at
1:43
the household level.
1:44
I mean at the household level you never raise equity.
1:46
You never say, you know what-- well you can, but you're not
1:49
going to say hey, I need to buy a house, why don't I go to
1:52
my rich friend and offer to sell 10% of the stake in my
1:55
house to him and he'll be kind of a partner in my house.
1:59
That could happen but for the most part it doesn't.
2:01
Usually when you do something on a personal level you raise
2:04
money through debt.
2:09
And that's interesting.
2:10
So what's good about debt is it's-- so let's think about it
2:15
from the point of view of the person who's lending
2:18
the money to you.
2:20
Debt is just borrowing money.
2:26
I think all of us know what borrowing money is.
2:29
I go to my rich friend and I say hey, could I borrow $1 and
2:32
I'll give you $1.25 in a year?
2:34
And he says, OK, you're good for it.
2:36
But I'm essentially promising I'm going to give the money
2:38
back at some future date.
2:39
If I sell equity, I'm not promising anything.
2:42
I'm like hey, I got a great business, why don't you give
2:45
$1 and then you get a 20% cut of my business.
2:47
If my business does awesome, you get 20% of all of the
2:50
profits of my business.
2:51
If my business does horrible, well you took a risk, you get
2:54
nothing and I get nothing.
2:55
Debt says regardless of how my business does, if it does
2:59
awesome all you're going to get is the interest.
3:05
That's kind of the upside.
3:05
So the upside's limited, right?
3:07
If I borrow money at 9% interest, all that person's
3:11
going to get is 9%.
3:12
Even if my company becomes the next Google or Microsoft or
3:17
whatever else, that person's just going to
3:18
get 9% on their money.
3:20
While this person might have gotten a hundred times their
3:23
money because they made a bet.
3:24
On the other hand, this downside is much lower.
3:28
So limited downside.
3:30
Because they're going to get their money back at a
3:32
certain-- you know, there's a certain payment schedule.
3:35
And they're going to get their money back before the
3:38
stockholders-- so let's say in a situation where the
3:40
company's going into difficulty-- and we'll do a
3:43
whole playlist on bankruptcy-- the people who lend money to
3:47
the company will see their money before the stockholders
3:50
see anything.
3:51
So how does all of this come out from the balance sheet?
3:53
So let's say we have a public company.
3:57
If you wonder what a CFO at a company does, this is really
4:00
the main decision that they're always making.
4:02
Do we raise money-- well, how do we raise money if we need
4:05
it, and do we raise money from the equity markets or from the
4:07
debt markets?
4:08
So let's come up with a company again.
4:12
Let's say that that's its current assets.
4:14
Not current-- I don't want to say current assets, it's the
4:18
assets that it currently has.
4:19
Current assets means something different, and we'll talk
4:21
about that in the future.
4:23
But let's say, so that's its assets.
4:29
You know it might have some cash here.
4:33
We'll go into more detail.
4:34
We'll actually look at real company balance sheets and
4:37
decipher what all of the terms on the balance sheet mean.
4:40
But that's its assets for now.
4:41
And let's say right now all of its money it's raised so far
4:44
has been equity.
4:46
And let's say it's a publicly listed company.
4:48
It doesn't have to be.
4:50
Let's say that's all of its equity, and let's say it has,
4:59
I don't know, 10 million shares.
5:04
And the other interesting thing about when a company's
5:06
public-- remember, every time when a company was private and
5:08
it took an investor, when it took equity investors, they
5:11
had to sit and have a negotiation saying what is
5:13
this worth?
5:14
What are these assets worth?
5:16
But what's cool is, is when you have a publicly traded
5:18
company, these shares are traded on an exchange, right?
5:21
These shares are on, let's say it's on the
5:24
New York Stock Exchange.
5:27
So every day you could go to Yahoo!
5:29
Finance or wherever and you can look at a chart.
5:33
Let me draw a chart.
5:35
You can draw a chart.
5:41
And we've all seen stock charts, I think.
5:44
So let's say that this is this could have been its IPO date
5:46
or it could just be the start that we're looking at, and
5:48
let's say the stock IPO went up, and then the whole market
5:51
went down a little bit.
5:52
But the stock-- maybe it's there, right?
5:54
But on any given, really almost any given second,
5:57
there's a price that somebody traded that stock at and it
6:00
might not be the best price, but it is a price.
6:03
And we'll talk about why that happens, because you might
6:05
have 10 million shares, and if only, I don't know, 100 shares
6:09
get traded at any second, or let's say only 100 shares get
6:12
traded in the day, is that an indicative price?
6:13
Because that's not a huge percentage
6:15
of all of the shares.
6:16
But anyway, we'll talk more about what volume means
6:20
relative to the total float and all of that.
6:23
But let's say at this split second the company shares
6:26
traded at $15 a share.
6:29
This is $15, right, at this second in time.
6:32
This is like right now.
6:33
Traded at $15 a share, and you could look it up on your
6:36
Bloomberg terminal or whatever else.
6:38
So essentially the market is providing us a
6:41
value for this company.
6:43
The market is saying wow, the market is willing to trade the
6:46
share at $15.
6:47
There was a willing buyer and a willing seller at exactly
6:49
$15 a share.
6:51
So that means that the market at that moment is valuing this
6:54
company at $15 per share times 10 million shares.
6:57
So $15 per share times 10 million shares-- not
7:05
necessarily a dollar sign.
7:08
So the market is assigning a, 15 times 10 is 100.
7:13
$150 million market cap.
7:17
Market capitalization for the company.
7:22
And you could look on the kind of, I think it's the key
7:25
statistics tab on Yahoo!
7:26
Finance, and you'll see market capitalization for a company.
7:29
And it's just the number of shares times the
7:33
price of the shares.
7:34
This is essentially what the market's value
7:37
of the equity is.
7:38
The market is saying that this piece right here
7:40
is worth $150 million.
7:43
And since this piece is the same size as the assets, we
7:47
have nothing else on the right-hand side, the market's
7:49
essentially saying that the assets right now are worth
7:52
$150 million.
7:53
And these aren't always going to be equal.
7:55
We'll see probably in a few videos when you start raising
7:57
debt you have to do an extra calculation to figure out what
8:01
the asset value or-- and I'll throw out a new term here, the
8:03
enterprise value of the firm is.
8:06
The enterprise value's essentially the asset value
8:09
minus excess cash.
8:12
The cash the company really doesn't need to operate.
8:14
And we'll go into more detail of that.
8:16
But we'll just view it as the assets for now.
8:18
So if I'm the CFO of this company, and let's say we need
8:21
to raise another, I don't know, $15 million.
8:25
I have two options.
8:27
I could say OK, the company is trading at $15 per share, I
8:32
need to raise $15 million, so I could issue
8:36
another million shares.
8:38
It wouldn't be the initial public offering because I'm
8:40
already public.
8:41
It would be a follow-on offering, or sometimes it's
8:43
called a secondary offering.
8:44
Although the word secondary has kind of two connotations.
8:47
But it would be a follow-on offering where I would issue,
8:50
I'd go to the board, we would essentially create another
8:53
million shares, and then sell them into the market, and
8:56
hopefully people will buy it at $15 a share or probably a
8:59
little bit less because we're kind of flooding the market
9:01
with a ton of shares.
9:02
Maybe they buy it at $14 per share, and we
9:04
would raise $14 million.
9:08
And that would be a follow-on offering.
9:10
So we can always use the public markets as a way to
9:12
raise more money.
9:13
We didn't have to go to all this-- I mean, for the most
9:15
part we didn't have to do this huge valuation exercise and
9:17
negotiations and do all of this, hire banks and all that.
9:22
Although the banks will still collect fees.
9:24
We actually would have to hire banks to do this.
9:26
So that's one option.
9:27
Or the other option is we're an established company, we're
9:30
generating cash, we could make interest
9:32
payments if we want to.
9:33
We could go to a bank.
9:34
And actually there's a lot of different ways to do this.
9:36
But we could essentially borrow money.
9:38
And let's just say we do that.
9:39
Instead of doing this-- let's say we do both.
9:41
So let's say we did a $1 million follow-on offering,
9:43
that gave us $14 million.
9:47
And let's say we want another $2 million, but this time
9:50
instead of selling shares-- so right now how many
9:52
shares do we have?
9:52
We sold 1 million, we had 10 million, we
9:53
have 11 million shares.
9:57
Let's say, you know what, let's say as a CFO I feel like
10:00
our shares are going to move up a lot more.
10:02
So we don't like selling them at this low price.
10:05
And let's say interest rates are really low.
10:08
Instead we're going to borrow money.
10:10
That's essentially raising debt.
10:12
So let's say we borrow another $3 million because we need it.
10:18
So actually this would be debt, $3 million of debt, and
10:23
we would get $3 million of cash.
10:32
So now our assets are all of this stuff on
10:37
the left-hand side.
10:40
And what are our liabilities now?
10:41
Now, we didn't have liabilities before because
10:43
everything we had were equities.
10:44
But now we do.
10:45
Now we owe somebody $3 million right here.
10:49
And I'll talk more about all the different ways to kind of
10:51
borrow money.
10:52
But it's essentially, it could just literally be a bank loan.
10:55
They might have just gone to Bank of America and said hey,
10:57
we're a big company and we're good for the money, why don't
11:00
you lend us $3 million.
11:02
And maybe it would be $3 million at a low interest
11:06
rate, at maybe 6% per year.
11:08
And Bank of America feels good because you have a high--
11:11
we'll talk more about credit ratings and all of that-- but
11:14
they say oh, you have essentially a good company
11:16
credit score.
11:18
So we'll give it to you at a low interest rate.
11:19
So what happens in the future is, these assets are going to
11:22
generate, hopefully, some cash.
11:24
And before these guys see it-- let me do to it in the--
11:28
before these equity holders-- this is the equity holders
11:31
right now-- before the equity holders see anything, these
11:33
guys have to get paid their interest. And I'll show you
11:36
all of that on a line-by-line basis in an income statement.
11:39
Everything we've done so far has been a balance sheet.
11:42
But something interesting is happening now.
11:44
Now all of a sudden your assets, which is that side-- I
11:47
know I just keep writing over the same drawing-- your assets
11:50
are now larger than your equity.
11:53
I think now, and this is just kind of a review of the
11:55
balance sheet video, you see that the assets are equal to
12:02
your equity, which is this right here, your equity plus
12:09
your liabilities.
12:10
Your liabilities now are $3 million.
12:13
Plus liabilities.
12:14
So if you wanted to know what your assets are worth, because
12:17
your assets are equal to your equity.
12:21
So what's your market value of your equity?
12:25
Well, we figured that out already.
12:26
We have 11 million shares now.
12:28
And let's say the stock plummets to $10 a share for
12:32
some strange reason or for a not-strange reason.
12:35
So what's the market cap? $10 a share, 11 million shares, we
12:39
have a $110 million market cap.
12:41
We're doing a market value.
12:43
And we'll talk more about the difference between market and
12:44
book value.
12:45
But this is the market value of your equity.
12:47
And then what is your liabilities?
12:49
Well we owe $3 million, so plus 3 million.
12:55
So we could say that for the most part the market value of
12:58
our assets, the market thinks that this entire left-hand
13:01
side is going to be worth the value of our equity, the
13:07
market cap of the company, plus the amount of debt, which
13:10
is equal to $113 million.
13:14
So the value of these assets are $113 million, and that for
13:18
the most part is the enterprise
13:20
value of the company.
13:21
What is the company's assets worth?
13:24
And we'll talk-- there's a little bit of a tweak we'll do
13:26
in the future on enterprise value.
13:28
But that's essentially how you kind of can value what the
13:31
company's worth.
13:32
A lot of people when they do a market capitalization
13:35
calculation they say oh, that's what
13:36
the company's worth.
13:37
Well no, that's what the equity is worth.
13:39
Market cap is what the equity's worth.
13:41
If you want to know what the company's worth, you have to
13:43
take the market cap and then add the debt.
13:48
Another way-- well, I won't get too complicated because I
13:51
just realized I've run out of time again.
13:52
See you in the next video.","say i own some significant amount of stocks in a company which isn't publicly traded.If i want to quit the company and withdraw my share that i own in the company how will i get the cash back, if at all cash is the way by which my shares are returned (also supposing there is no other investor ready to buy my share)?"

In this video I'm going to talk a little more about points on
0:03
angle bisector but before that I want to at least make sure we
0:07
understand what we mean when we talk about the distance
0:09
between a point and a line.
0:12
So say that that is some point, point A
0:16
this is some line right over here, we'll call that line,
0:19
BC, so when you're taking the distance between
0:23
a point and another point, it's very obvious,
0:25
you just draw a line to that other point,
0:28
Well I already used B, you just draw a line to that other point
0:30
and you find the length of that line,
0:33
so distance seems very straight foreward between
0:35
two points, but what about a point and a line
0:37
because there are many points on this line
0:40
maybe were going to find this distance, or maybe were going to find this distance, or this distance,
0:45
and these are all going to be different lengths
0:48
so how do we have one unique distance?
0:49
And the way that we think about this, and we're going
0:52
to do this in much more depth in future math courses
0:54
especially when you start vectors and linear algebra
0:57
and all the rest, is distance between a point and a line is
1:00
really the shortest distance and that shortest distance
1:03
is as if you were to drop a
1:05
perpendicular from that point to the line, so this right over here,
1:08
this right over here, is what we call the distance
1:12
the distance between the point and the line, and this
1:15
is perpendicular right over here, to
1:17
recognize that this is indeed the shortest distance
1:20
think about this relative -the distance between this point
1:23
and any other point on this line. so pick another
1:28
point on this line right over here, let's call this
1:31
point E, and think about this --now this is an
1:36
arbitrary point I could have drawn E here,
1:38
I could have drawn E here, I could have drawn E anywhere,
1:39
but regardless of where you draw E, if you
1:41
draw a line segment between A and E, you see that
1:44
we've form a right triangle from A to E, to the
1:47
point we had the perpendicular, so let me call this
1:51
point right here F, you're always going to draw
1:54
a right triangle assuming that E is different than F
1:57
and if you will immediately see that you see that D
2:00
has to be shorter than this orange length, because this
2:02
orange length is the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse
2:05
is always going to be the longest side a triangle
2:07
D squared plus whatever length this squared, is
2:10
going to be equal to this length squared. So hopefully
2:14
that at least gives you a decent sense why dropping
2:16
the perpendicular will always give you the shortest
2:20
distance between a point and a line, and that unique
2:22
shortest distance is what we call the distance
2:25
between a point and a line. Now with that out of the way,
2:28
let's think a little bit about angle bisectors.
2:31
So let me draw an angle here, so let me, draw an angle.
2:38
So lets call this point, let me do it in a different color,
2:42
let's call that point A, lets call this point B,
2:44
and let's call this point C right over here.
2:47
And an angle bisector is essentially line, or a segment,
2:50
or a ray that splits an angle into two equal angles
2:53
and we've talked about this before,
2:56
so for example if we want to bisect angle ABC,
2:59
so this angle right over here, we want to split it
3:01
in two, we are going to -I can draw a better version
3:05
of that, we want to split it in two, we want to split it in two
3:09
like, let me draw a little bit better, my drawing
3:13
still doesn't look like, that looks decent, alright,
3:17
so lets call this point right over here D,
3:23
and again we could even say that, that's a ray,
3:25
or we could call that a segment, or whatever,
3:27
but the way to think about this, is if now
3:29
angle DBC is equal to angle DBA, so this angle,
3:35
DBC is equal to angle DBA, we can say that DB bisects
3:43
angle ABC, so we can say that DB and now Im talking
3:49
about segment DB we could have made it a ray if we
3:52
had -keep going to the right, or a line. DB
3:54
bisects BISECTS angle ABC, ABC
4:02
Fare enough, now, the whole reason why I started
4:05
this video talking about distances between points and lines,
4:08
is that I want to show you, that any point that is on
4:10
an angle bisector, is actually going to be
4:12
equidistant from the sides of the angle, and then were
4:16
going to go the other way saying, any point
4:18
that is equidistant from the sides of an angle is
4:20
going on the angle bisector. So lets take an
4:24
arbitrary point that sits on this angle bisector
4:26
so let's take this point right over here,
4:30
Ill call that arbitrary point F, or actually I havnt used
4:33
E yet, so this is going to be and arbitrary point on our
4:36
angle bisector, and now let's look at the distance between
4:40
E and BC and the distance between E and BA we already
4:44
say that, -we already said that the distance between
4:46
point and a line is if you drop a perpendicular
4:49
from a point to that line, which you can always do
4:51
so lets draw a perpendicular right over here,
4:54
this is one distance, and then this is the other distance
4:57
this is, -this orange line right here is the distance between E and BC and this orange line is the distance
5:04
between E and BA and what I want to prove is that these distances are equal
5:11
well the first thing to realize, is that we have two right triangles over here, they both share
5:17
th- they both have the same angle, they're not sharing it but angle ABE is congruent
5:24
to angle CBE and we know that because DB bisects it so this angle is equal to that angle
5:29
they're both right triangles so the actually have 2 angles in common, which actually means
5:34
they actually have 3 angles in common and constrains what this other angle would be and they also have
5:38
this side in common, -they have 3 angles are congruent to each other, they are not
5:44
necessarily in common, but it does have this side in common, BE is the hypotenuse
5:48
of both of these right triangles, and so, you can invoke
5:52
using this angle, that angle and this side, this angle,that angle and this side
5:56
you could say that these 2 triangles are going to be congruent to each other
6:00
so we could say that triangle, and let me put some points over here, so let's see
6:04
let's call this F and let's call this G, we can say that triangle EBF is congruent to triangle
6:14
EBG and we can use AAS, by Angle Angle Side congruency or you could say hey if
6:23
two angles, -if corresponding angles are the same then the third angle is also going to be the same
6:28
so this angle right over here could also be the same and
6:31
you could use ASA, but either way these two things are going to be congruent
6:35
but if these two things are congruent, then the corresponding sides are going to be congruent
6:39
so then, then length of EF, segment EF, is going to be congruent to segment
6:47
EF is going to be congruent to segment EG which is the same
6:51
thing as the length of EF is equal to the length of EG, these are really, these are really
6:57
equivalent statements right over there, so the length of EF, the length of EF
7:02
is equal to the length of EG and the length of those two segments are the distances
7:06
between the point and those 2 respective sides.
7:09
We've just proven the first case, if a point lies on an angle bisector, it is
7:15
equidistant from the 2 sides of the angle, now let's go the other way around,
7:21
let's say that I have, so let me draw another angle here, so let me draw another angle over here and let's call
7:29
this A, B, and C and let's pick some arbitrary point E, let's point some arbitrary point E
7:40
right over here and let's say we start off with the assumption that E is equidistant
7:43
to BC and BA and what we want to do is prove that E must be on the angle bisector,
7:51
so here, if you're on the angle bisector you're equidistant, over here we're going to show if you're
7:55
equidistant you're on the angle bisector, so if it's equidistant to BC and BA, then this perpendicular
8:02
right over here, this perpendicular right over here, is going to be congruent to this
8:06
perpendicular right over there, and let me give these points' labels, so let call this point D, and let's
8:13
call this point right over F, and let's just draw segment BE here, let's just draw segment
8:20
BE right over here, so once again, we have 2 right triangles, we already know that
8:29
2 of the legs are congruent to each other, they both share the hypotenuse this
8:32
hypotenuse is equal to its self, we know from the pythagorean theorm
8:36
if you know 2 sides of a triangle, it determines the third side, so and we know 2 sides of both
8:43
of these, so the third sides must be the same, so this side must be equal to that side
8:48
so you could invoke SSS, Side Side Side, to show these 2 triangles are congruent
8:53
or you actually didn't need to -have to good there you could have used a special
8:56
case, the RSH case, where if you have a right triangle, so if you have the right triangle
9:02
you have one set of sides that are congruent, and you have the hypotenuse that is congruent
9:06
then you're also okay, you could use RSH to prove congruency as well,
9:11
and so either way we know that triangle EBD, triangle EBD, is congruent to triangle EBF
9:21
congruent to triangle EBF, we used Side Side Side here but you could have used RSH, let me write that
9:29
RSH, which is -we know that Angle Side Side can be used for any general triangle
9:34
but it can be, -RSH is essentially Angle Side Side for right triangles, if you have
9:38
2 sides of a right triangle and- in common, --if 2 sides of a right triangle are congruent then
9:49
the 2 triangles are definitely congruent but once you know that two triangles are congruent, then
9:57
they're corresponding angles have to be congruent, and angle EBD, angle EBD
10:01
corresponds to angle EBF so we know that angle EBD must be congruent to angle EBF
10:11
so EBD must be congruent to EBF, well if EBD is congruent to EBF then that means
10:21
that segment EB must bisect, must bisect angle CBF, or actually CBA even, it could be called CEF
10:38
angle CBA. So we're done! If over here, we show that if something sits on a bisector is
10:43
equidistant from the sides of the angle, and here we showed if it's equidistant from the sides
10:48
of the angle it sits on the angle bisector, or, or -it could even be the end point of an angle bisector
10:54
but clearly, it sits on it.","Is it the right angle (90 degrees) in one of the triangles and the bisected purple angle in the same triangle, and then the hypotenuse of that triangle (or the bisecting line)?"

Welcome back.
0:01
We'll now do another tension problem and this one is just a
0:04
slight increment harder than the previous one just because
0:06
we have to take out slightly more sophisticated algebra
0:10
tools than we did in the last one.
0:11
But it's not really any harder.
0:14
But you should actually see this type of problem because
0:15
you'll probably see it on an exam.
0:17
So let's figure out the tension in the wire.
0:19
So first of all, we know that this point
0:22
right here isn't moving.
0:24
So the tension in this little small wire right here is easy.
0:26
It's trivial.
0:28
The force of gravity is pulling down at this point
0:30
with 10 Newtons because you have this weight here.
0:33
And of course, since this point is stationary, the
0:35
tension in this wire has to be 10 Newtons upward.
0:37
That's an easy one.
0:38
So let's just figure out the tension in these two slightly
0:41
more difficult wires to figure out the tensions of.
0:44
So once again, we know that this point right here, this
0:47
point is not accelerating in any direction.
0:49
It's not accelerating in the x direction, nor is it
0:52
accelerating in the vertical direction or the y direction.
0:55
So we know that the net forces in the x direction need to be
0:57
0 on it and we know the net forces in the y
1:00
direction need to be 0.
1:03
So what are the net forces in the x direction?
1:06
Well they're going to be the x components of these two-- of
1:10
the tension vectors of both of these wires.
1:12
I guess let's draw the tension vectors of the two wires.
1:15
So this T1, it's pulling.
1:18
The tension vector pulls in the direction of the wire
1:21
along the same line.
1:23
So let's say that this is the tension vector of T1.
1:26
If that's the tension vector, its x component will be this.
1:30
Let me see how good I can draw this.
1:33
It's intended to be a straight line, but that
1:35
would be its x component.
1:36
And its x component, let's see, this is 30 degrees.
1:42
This is 30 degrees right here.
1:44
And hopefully this is a bit second nature to you.
1:47
If this value up here is T1, what is the
1:49
value of the x component?
1:51
It's T1 cosine of 30 degrees.
1:59
And you could do your SOH-CAH-TOA.
2:01
You know, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.
2:04
So the cosine of 30 degrees is equal to-- This over T1 one is
2:09
equal to the x component over T1.
2:10
And if you multiply both sides by T1, you get this.
2:14
This should be a little bit of second nature right now.
2:15
That the x component is going to be the cosine of the angle
2:20
between the hypotenuse and the x component times the
2:23
hypotenuse.
2:24
And similarly, the x component here-- Let me
2:27
draw this force vector.
2:28
So if this is T2, this would be its x component.
2:38
And very similarly, this is 60 degrees, so this would be T2
2:44
cosine of 60.
2:48
Now what do we know about these two vectors?
2:50
We know that their net force is 0.
2:55
Or that you also know that the magnitude of these two vectors
2:57
should cancel each other out or that they're equal.
2:59
I mean, they're pulling in opposite directions.
3:01
That's pretty obvious.
3:04
And so you know that their magnitudes need to be equal.
3:05
So we know that T1 cosine of 30 is going to equal
3:08
T2 cosine of 60.
3:10
So let's write that down.
3:12
T1 cosine of 30 degrees is equal to T2 cosine of 60.
3:27
And then we could bring the T2 on to this side.
3:29
And actually, let's also-- I'm trying to save as much space
3:31
as possible because I'm guessing this is going to take
3:33
up a lot of room, this problem.
3:35
What's the cosine of 30 degrees?
3:38
If you haven't memorized it already, it's square
3:39
root of 3 over 2.
3:40
So this becomes square root of 3 over 2 times T1.
3:45
That's the cosine of 30 degrees.
3:47
And then I'm going to bring this on to this side.
3:49
So the cosine of 60 is actually 1/2.
3:54
You could use your calculator if you forgot that.
3:56
So this is 1/2 T2.
3:58
Bring it on this side so it becomes minus 1/2.
4:01
I'm skipping more steps than normal just because I don't
4:04
want to waste too much space.
4:07
And this equals 0.
4:08
But if you seen the other videos, hopefully I'm not
4:11
creating too many gaps.
4:12
And this is relatively easy to follow.
4:14
So we have the square root of 3 times T1 minus 1/2 T2 is
4:19
equal to 0.
4:19
So that gives us an equation.
4:21
One equation with two unknowns, so it doesn't help
4:24
us much so far.
4:25
But let's square that away because I have a feeling this
4:29
will be useful.
4:32
Now what's going to be happening on the y components?
4:34
So let's say that this is the y component of T1 and this is
4:39
the y component of T2.
4:42
What do we know?
4:42
What what do we know about the two y components?
4:44
I could've drawn them here too and then just shift them over
4:46
to the left and the right.
4:48
We know that their combined pull upwards, the combined
4:52
pull of the two vertical tension components has to
4:54
offset the force of gravity pulling down because this
4:57
point is stationary.
4:59
So we know these two y components, when you add them
5:02
together, the combined tension in the vertical direction has
5:05
to be 10 Newtons.
5:06
Because it's offsetting this force of gravity.
5:09
So what's this y component?
5:10
Well, this was T1 of cosine of 30.
5:12
This should start to become a little second nature to you
5:15
that this is T1 sine of 30, this y component right here.
5:19
So T1-- Let me write it here.
5:23
T1 sine of 30 degrees plus this vector, which is T2 sine
5:34
of 60 degrees.
5:38
You could review your trigonometry and your
5:39
SOH-CAH-TOA.
5:41
Frankly, I think, just seeing what people get confused on is
5:44
the trigonometry.
5:45
But you can review the trig modules and maybe some of the
5:48
earlier force vector modules that we did.
5:50
And hopefully, these will make sense.
5:52
I'm skipping a few steps.
5:53
And these will equal 10 Newtons.
5:58
And let's rewrite this up here where I substitute the values.
6:02
So what's the sine of 30?
6:03
Actually, let me do it right here.
6:06
What's the sine of 30 degrees?
6:07
The sine of 30 degrees is 1/2 so we get 1/2 T1 plus the sine
6:15
of 60 degrees, which is square root of 3 over 2.
6:17
Square root of 3 over 2 T2 is equal to 10.
6:22
And then I don't like this, all these 2's
6:23
and this 1/2 here.
6:25
So let's multiply this whole equation by 2.
6:27
So 2 times 1/2, that's 1.
6:30
So you get T1 plus the square root of 3 T2 is equal to, 2
6:37
times 10 , is 20.
6:40
Similarly, let's take this equation up here and let's
6:42
multiply this equation by 2 and bring it down here.
6:46
So this is the original one that we got.
6:47
So if we multiply this whole thing by 2-- I'll do it in
6:50
this color so that you know that
6:52
it's a different equation.
6:54
So if you multiply square root of 3 over 2 times 2-- I'm just
6:56
doing this to get rid of the 2's in the denominator.
6:58
So you get square root of 3 T1 minus T2 is equal to 0 because
7:10
0 times 2 is 0.
7:12
And let's see what we could do.
7:13
What if we take this top equation because we want to
7:15
start canceling out some terms. Let's take this top
7:18
equation and let's multiply it by-- oh, I don't know.
7:24
Let's multiply it by the square root of 3.
7:28
So you get the square root of 3 T1.
7:36
I'm taking this top equation multiplied by the
7:37
square root of 3.
7:38
This is just a system of equations
7:39
that I'm solving for.
7:41
And the square root of 3 times this right here.
7:43
Square root of 3 times square root of 3 is 3.
7:46
So plus 3 T2 is equal to 20 square root of 3.
7:54
And now what I want to do is let's-- I know I'm doing a lot
7:59
of equation manipulation here.
8:01
But this is just hopefully, a review of algebra for you.
8:04
Let's subtract this equation from this equation.
8:09
So you can also view it as multiplying it by negative 1
8:11
and then adding the 2.
8:13
So when you subtract this from this, these two terms cancel
8:15
out because they're the same.
8:17
And so then you're left with minus T2 from here.
8:22
Minus this, minus 3 T2 is equal to 0 minus 20 square
8:31
roots of 3.
8:33
And so this becomes minus 4 T2 is equal to minus 20 square
8:40
roots of 3.
8:42
And then, divide both sides by minus 4 and you get T2 is
8:46
equal to 5 square roots of 3 Newtons.
8:52
So that's the tension in this wire.
8:54
And now we can substitute and figure out T1.
8:58
Let's use this formula right here because it
8:59
looks suitably simple.
9:02
So we have the square root of 3 times T1 minus T2.
9:08
Well T2 is 5 square roots of 3.
9:10
5 square roots of 3 is equal to 0.
9:14
So we have the square root of 3 T1 is equal to five square
9:19
roots of 3.
9:21
Divide both sides by square root of 3 and you get the
9:23
tension in the first wire is equal to 5 Newtons.
9:28
So this is pulling with a force or tension of 5 Newtons.
9:31
Or a force.
9:33
And this is pulling-- the second wire --with a tension
9:36
of 5 square roots of 3 Newtons.
9:39
So this wire right here is actually
9:43
doing more of the pulling.
9:45
It's actually more of the force of gravity is ending up
9:48
on this wire.
9:49
That makes sense because it's steeper.
9:51
So since it's steeper, it's contributing
9:54
more to the y component.
9:56
It's good whenever you do these problems to kind of do a
9:58
reality check just to make sure your numbers make sense.
10:01
And if you think about it, their combined tension is
10:05
something more than 10 Newtons.
10:07
And that makes sense because some of the force that they're
10:10
pulling with is wasted against pulling each other in the
10:13
horizontal direction.
10:15
Anyway, I'll see you all in the next video.","Isn't the weight force of the object pulling downwards, and therefore the direction of this force is opposite to the direction of the y components of the tension forces?"
teded_1065,Science,MCQ,"On a December afternoon in Chicago
during the middle of World War II,
scientists cracked open the nucleus
at the center of the uranium atom
and turned nuclear mass into energy
over and over again.
They did this by creating 
for the first time
a chain reaction inside a new
engineering marvel:
the nuclear reactor.
Since then, the ability to mine great
amounts of energy from uranium nuclei
has led some to bill nuclear power
as a plentiful utopian
source of electricity.
A modern nuclear reactor generates enough
electricity from one kilogram of fuel
to power an average American household
for nearly 34 years.
But rather than dominate the global
electricity market,
nuclear power has declined from
an all-time high of 18% in 1996
to 11% today.
And it's expected to drop further
in the coming decades.
What happened to the great promise
of this technology?
It turns out nuclear power 
faces many hurdles,
including high construction costs
and public opposition.
And behind these problems lie 
a series of unique engineering challenges.
Nuclear power relies on the fission
of uranium nuclei
and a controlled chain reaction
that reproduces this splitting
in many more nuclei.
The atomic nucleus is densely packed
with protons and neutrons
bound by a powerful nuclear force.
Most uranium atoms have a total
of 238 protons and neutrons,
but roughly one in every 140
lacks three neutrons,
and this lighter isotope is less
tightly bound.
Compared to its more abundant cousin,
a strike by a neutron easily splits
the U-235 nuclei
into lighter, radioactive elements
called fission products,
in addition to two to three neutrons,
gamma rays,
and a few neutrinos.
During fission, some nuclear mass
transforms into energy.
A fraction of the newfound energy
powers the fast-moving neutrons,
and if some of them strike uranium nuclei,
fission results in a second 
larger generation of neutrons.
If this second generation of neutrons
strike more uranium nuclei,
more fission results in an even
larger third generation, and so on.
But inside a nuclear reactor,
this spiraling chain reaction is tamed
using control rods
made of elements that capture excess 
neutrons and keep their number in check.
With a controlled chain reaction,
a reactor draws power steadily
and stably for years.
The neutron-led chain reaction
is a potent process driving nuclear power,
but there's a catch that can result
in unique demands 
on the production of its fuel.
It turns out, most of the neutrons emitted
from fission have too much kinetic energy
to be captured by uranium nuclei.
The fission rate is too low
and the chain reaction fizzles out.
The first nuclear reactor built in Chicago
used graphite as a moderator
to scatter and slow down 
neutrons just enough
to increase their capture by uranium
and raise the rate of fission.
Modern reactors commonly use
purified water as a moderator,
but the scattered neutrons are still
a little too fast.
To compensate 
and keep up the chain reaction,
the concentration of U-235 is enriched
to four to seven times 
its natural abundance.
Today, enrichment is often done by
passing a gaseous uranium compound
through centrifuges
to separate lighter U-235 
from heavier U-238.
But the same process can be continued
to highly enrich U-235
up to 130 times its natural abundance
and create an explosive chain reaction
in a bomb.
Methods like centrifuge processing
must be carefully regulated
to limit the spread of bomb-grade fuel.
Remember, only a fraction 
of the released fission energy
goes into speeding up neutrons.
Most of the nuclear power goes into the
kinetic energy of the fission products.
Those are captured inside the reactor
as heat by a coolant,
usually purified water.
This heat is eventually used to drive
an electric turbine generator by steam
just outside the reactor.
Water flow is critical 
not only to create electricity,
but also to guard against the most dreaded
type of reactor accident,
the meltdown.
If water flow stops because a pipe
carrying it breaks,
or the pumps that push it fail,
the uranium heats up very quickly
and melts.
During a nuclear meltdown,
radioactive vapors escape 
into the reactor,
and if the reactor fails to hold them,
a steel and concrete containment building
is the last line of defense.
But if the radioactive gas pressure
is too high,
containment fails and the gasses
escape into the air,
spreading as far 
and wide as the wind blows.
The radioactive fission products
in these vapors
eventually decay into stable elements.
While some decay in a few seconds,
others take hundreds 
of thousands of years.
The greatest challenge 
for a nuclear reactor
is to safely contain these products
and keep them from harming humans
or the environment.
Containment doesn't stop mattering
once the fuel is used up.
In fact, it becomes an even greater
storage problem.
Every one to two years,
some spent fuel is removed from reactors
and stored in pools of water 
that cool the waste
and block its radioactive emissions.
The irradiated fuel is a mix of uranium
that failed to fission,
fission products,
and plutonium, a radioactive material
not found in nature.
This mix must be isolated from
the environment
until it has all safely decayed.
Many countries propose deep time storage
in tunnels drilled far underground,
but none have been built,
and there's great uncertainty about
their long-term security.
How can a nation that has existed
for only a few hundred years
plan to guard plutonium
through its radioactive half-life
of 24,000 years?
Today, many nuclear power plants
sit on their waste, instead,
storing them indefinitely on site.
Apart from radioactivity, there's an
even greater danger with spent fuel.
Plutonium can sustain a chain reaction
and can be mined from the waste
to make bombs.
Storing spent fuel is thus not only
a safety risk for the environment,
but also a security risk for nations.
Who should be the watchmen to guard it?
Visionary scientists from the early years
of the nuclear age
pioneered how to reliably tap 
the tremendous amount of energy
inside an atom -
as an explosive bomb
and as a controlled power source
with incredible potential.
But their successors have learned
humbling insights
about the technology's not-so-utopian
industrial limits.
Mining the subatomic realm makes for
complex, expensive, and risky engineering.
","It is apparent that the spent radioactive fuel of nuclear reactors needs to be safely stored here on Earth, however the radioactive lifetimes of the fuel products may long outlast the lifetime of social and political creations like states and nations. What new challenges for international cooperation might this unique storage problem pose?"
teded_1289,Social Studies,MCQ,"Hey it's me Destin.
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.
You've heard people say,
""It's just like riding a bike""
meaning it's really easy and you can't forget how to do it, right?
But I did something.
I did something that damaged my mind.
It happened on the streets of Amsterdam
and I got really scared honestly.
I can't ride a bike like you can anymore.
Before I show you the video of what happened
I need to tell you the back story.
Like many six year olds with a MacGyver mullet
I learned how to ride a bike when I was really young.
I had learned a life skill and I was really proud of it.
Everything changed though when my friend Barney called me 25 years later.
Where I work, the welders are geniuses, and they like to play jokes on the engineers.
He had a challenge for me.
He had built a special bicycle and he wanted me to try to ride it.
He had only changed one thing.
When you turn the handlebar to the left, the wheel goes to the right.
When you turn it to the right, the wheel goes to the left.
I thought this would be easy so I hopped on the bike
ready to demonstrate how quickly I could conquer this.
- And here he is ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Destin Sandlin.
First attempt riding the bicycle.
- Yeah, yeah.
I couldn't do it.
You can see that I'm laughing but I'm actually really frustrated.
In this moment I had a really deep revelation.
My thinking was in a rut.
This bike revealed a very deep truth to me.
I had the knowledge of how to operate the bike,
but I did not have the understanding.
Therefore, knowledge is not understanding.
Look I know what you're probably thinking.
Destin's probably just an uncoordinated engineer and can't do it.
But that's not the case at all.
The algorithm that's associated with riding a bike,
in your brain, is just that complicated.
Think about it.
Downwards force on the pedals,
leaning your whole body,
pulling and pushing the handlebars,
gyroscopic procession in the wheels,
every single force is part of this algorithm.
And if you change any one part it affects the entire control system.
I do not make definitive statements that often,
but I'm telling you right now,
you cannot ride this bicycle.
You might think you can, but you can't.
I know this because I'm often asked to speak at universities and conferences
and I take the bike with me.
It's always the same.
People think they're gonna try some trick or they're just gonna power through it.
It doesn't work.
Your brain cannot handle this.
For instance, this guy.
I offered him two hundred dollars just to ride this bike ten feet across the stage.
Everybody thought he could do it.
[crowd exclaims] No no no. You didn't understand.
So.. this way, not that way. [crowd laughs]
Alright so, whenever you're ready.
Remember you have to keep your feet on.. [crowd laughs]
[laughing crowd]
You've gotta start rolling at least. And go.
Keep your feet on the pedal, go.
[laughing crowd]
Just keep your feet on the pedals.
Alright, one more time.
Once you have a rigid way of thinking in your head,
sometimes you cannot change that, even if you want to.
So here's what I did.
It was a personal challenge.
I stayed out here in this driveway
and I practiced about 5 minutes every day.
My neighbors made fun of me.
I had many wrecks.
But after 8 months, this happened.
One day I couldn't ride the bike, and the next day I could.
It was like I could feel some kind of pathway in my brain that was now unlocked.
It was really weird though.
It's like there's this trail in my brain,
but if I wasn't paying close enough attention to it,
my brain would easily lose that neural path and jump back onto the old road it was more familiar with.
Any small distractions at all, like a cellphone ringing in my pocket,
would instantly throw my brain back to the old control algorithm and I would wreck.
But at least I could ride it.
My son is the closest person to me genetically
and he's been riding a normal bike for 3 years,
that's over half his life.
I wanted to know how long it would take him to learn how to ride a backwards bike
so I told him if he learned how to ride a backwards bike
he could go with me to Australia and meet a real astronaut.
Are you gonna give up?
- No.
- Go ahead.
This is how it starts.
Look at this.
This is such a big deal.
Get up, you got it.
Did you see his brain get it?
So he, in.. How many weeks we been doing this? Two weeks?
In two weeks he did something that took me 8 months to do,
which demonstrates that a child has more neural plasticity,
am I even saying that right?
Than an adult.
It's clear from this experiment that children have a much more plastic brain than adults.
That's why the best time to learn a language is when you're a young child.
Alright, today's bike log.
I can ride smooth, I can ride fast.
I'm thinking the experiment is over.
OK now I'm in Amsterdam,
a city that has more bicycles than people.
The question is, can I ride a normal bike now.
I mean I have spent all this time unlearning how to ride a bike,
If I go back and try to ride a normal one will my brain mess up.
So I've tweeted a Smarter Every Day.. meetup, if you will.
And I'm gonna see if somebody brings a bicycle and I'm gonna try to ride a normal bike.
It's backwards, it's backwards.
This was one of the most frustrating moments of my life.
I had ridden a normal bike since I was six,
but in this moment I couldn't do it any more.
I had set out to prove that I could free my brain from a cognitive bias,
but at this point I'm pretty sure that all I've proved is that I can only re-designate that bias.
So what you're not seeing is there's a group of people here,
looking at me.
Looking at the strange American,
that can't ride a bike, cause they think I'm dumb.
But I'm actually two levels deep into this,
because I've learned and un-learned. Alright.
After 20 minutes of making a fool out of myself,
suddenly my brain clicked back into the old algorithm.
I can't explain it, but it happened in a very specific moment.
[laughter]
I've got it, I've got it, I've got it.
I'm back.
Oh it clicked. It clicked.
I've got it, I've got it.
OK there it is.
There was the moment.
OK I can ride a bike.
I tried to explain this to the people around me,
and they just didn't get it.
They thought I was faking the previous 20 minutes
and I couldn't get anybody to believe me.
That looked like I faked it, didn't it.
You think I'm faking. You don't believe me.
- It looked so weird...
- You think I'm lying don't you.
I'm not lying.
I felt like the only person on the planet who had ever un-learned how to ride a bike,
and I couldn't articulate it to anyone
because everybody just knew that you can't forget how to ride a bike.
So I learned 3 things from this experiment.
I learned that welders are often smarter than engineers,
I learned that knowledge does not equal understanding,
and I learned that truth is truth.
No matter what I think about it.
So be very careful how you interpret things
because you're looking at the world with a bias
whether you think you are or not.
I'm Destin,
you're getting Smarter Every Day,
have a good one.
OK if you wanna support Smarter Every Day
you can download a free audio book at audible.com/smarter
I recommend Commander Hadfield's book
which is An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth.
I read it, it was awesome.
If you think about it, I had to learn how to ride a different kind of bicycle
and my son did it as well,
but Commander Hadfield had to learn how to ride a different space ship.
Not only that, but a different type of space station.
He was on Mir and the International Space Station.
Anyway, if you're interested in supporting Smarter Every Day,

[crowd cheers]
Everything is wrong... My instinctive reaction is wrong.
(Destin) Why don't you ride it? You just build it?
- I can't ride it, I just build it.

teded_2092,Social Studies,MCQ,"Hi, I'm Medium Invader
from the classic video game Space Invaders,
and I want to tell you a little bit
about where video games came from.
A video game is an electronic game
that has an interface designed for human interaction
on a video device.
Simple.
Video games are used by scientists,
the military,
and people like you,
and their evolution has spread across arcades,
consoles,
computers,
smart phones,
and all kinds of other electronics.
These days video games are everywhere,
but they were actually made in science labs.
In fact, the earliest U.S. video game patent on record
was in 1948,
and at the time it was referred to
as a cathode-ray tube amusement device.
That's a mouthful!
Some of the earliest video games include
the Nimrod computer,
OXO,
Tennis for Two,
and my personal favorite, Spacewar!
But none of these early video games
were ever sold to the public
because they were either too huge
or too expensive
to get out of the lab.
This all changed when a man named Ralph Baer
looked at his television screen and wondered
how else it might be used.
In 1972, Baer's idea to get video games
out of the science lab and into the living room
led to the release of a game console
called Odyssey.
Odyssey allowed you to play a game on your TV.
At about the same time,
two other people, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney,
were working on something similar
in a little company called Atari.
You might have heard of it,
and even if you haven't,
I'm sure that your Dad has.
Atari's first major game release was in 1972,
an arcade game called Pong.
It was an immediate hit,
and it's credited
as the first commercially successful video game.
Atari then released a home version of Pong in 1974.
By 1978, competition between Atari
and another game company called Midway
was heating up.
Midway had licensed an arcade game
for the Japanese company, Taito,
that put them on the map.
The game:
Space Invaders.
It featured iconic actors, like me,
and it went on to become
the second highest selling arcade game of all time.
Space Invaders also helped kick off
what is known as the Golden Age of Arcade Games.
In response, Atari followed
with the release of the arcade game Asteroids,
which ranked sixth on the list
of highest selling arcade games.
It was a good game,
but it's no Space Invaders.
By 1980, color came to arcade games,
and this was also the year
that another video gaming milestone was born.
Pac-Man, created by the Japanese company Namco,
was brought to the U.S. by Midway.
Important to the spread
of video games into popular culture,
Pac-Man was a character that could be licensed.
It wasn't long before it had a song on the charts,
a Saturday morning television show,
and all sorts of other products.
In just a year, Pac-Man arcade games
made over one billion dollars in quarters.
Then, in 1981, a company called Nintendo
started making waves in the U.S. video game market
with their release of Donkey Kong.
It was the earliest video game
to have a story line.
The story went a bit like this:
Donkey Kong is the pet
of a carpenter named Jumpman.
Jumpman mistreats his pet ape,
so the ape steals his girlfriend,
leaving the game player to assume the role
of Jumpman and rescue the girl.
Jumpman was eventually renamed to Mario.
Other iconic arcade games from the early 80s include
Frogger,
Dragon's Lair,
and Mario Brothers.
Perhaps the last iconic game considered
to be part of the Golden Age of Arcade Games
is Double Dragon.
It was the first really successful example
of the beat-them-up genre.
It was released in 1987,
and, like Donkey Kong,
it featured a damsel in distress storyline,
a storyline common in many video games.
By the mid-90s, the Golden Age of Arcade Games
was coming to an end,
and the home game console
was gaining in popularity.
While arcade games continued
to decline in sales over the years,
the popularity of video games was merely beginning,
and we'll talk about that
and a lot more
in part two of a brief history of video games.

teded_2658,Science,MCQ,"Cloudy climate change:
How clouds affect Earth's temperature.
Earth's average surface temperature
has warmed by .8 Celsius since 1750.
When carbon dioxide concentrations
in the atmosphere have doubled,
which is expected before the end
of the 21st century,
researchers project global temperatures
will have risen by 
1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius.
If the increase is near the low end,
1.5 Celsius,
then we're already halfway there,
and we should be more able to adapt
with some regions becoming drier
and less productive,
but others becoming warmer,
wetter and more productive.
On the other hand, a rise of 4.5 degrees
Celsius would be similar in magnitude
to the warming that's occurred since
the last glacial maximum 22,000 years ago,
when most of North America was under
an ice sheet two kilometers thick.
So that would represent a 
dramatic change of climate.
So it's vitally important for scientists
to predict the change in temperature
with as much precision as possible
so that society can plan for the future.
The present range of uncertainty
is simply too large
to be confident of how best
to respond to climate change.
But this estimate of 1.5 to 4.5 Celsius
for a doubling of carbon dioxide
hasn't changed in 35 years.
Why haven't we been able 
to narrow it down?
The answer is that we don't yet understand
aerosols and clouds well enough.
But a new experiment at CERN
is tackling the problem.
In order to predict how
the temperature will change,
scientists need to know something
called Earth's climate sensitivity,
the temperature change in response
to a radiative forcing.
A radiative forcing is 
a temporary imbalance
between the energy received from the Sun
and the energy radiated back out to space,
like the imbalance caused by an
increase of greenhouse gases.
To correct the imbalance,
Earth warms up or cools down.
We can determine Earth's
climate sensitivity
from the experiment that we've already
performed in the industrial age 
since 1750
and then use this number to determine
how much more it will warm
for various projected radiative forcings
in the 21st century.
To do this, we need to know
two things:
First, the global temperature rise
since 1750,
and second, the radiative forcing
of the present day climate
relative to the pre-industrial climate.
For the radiative forcings,
we know that human activities
have increased greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere,
which have warmed the planet.
But our activities have at the same time
increased the amount
of aerosol particles in clouds,
which have cooled the planet.
Pre-industrial greenhouse gas
concentrations are well measured
from bubbles trapped in ice cores
obtained in Greenland and Antarctica.
So the greenhouse gas forcings
are precisely known.
But we have no way of directly measuring
how cloudy it was in 1750.
And that's the main source of uncertainty
in Earth's climate sensitivity.
To understand pre-industrial cloudiness,
we must use computer models
that reliably simulate
the processes responsible for 
forming aerosols in clouds.
Now to most people, aerosols are the thing
that make your hair stick,
but that's only one type of aerosol.
Atmospheric aerosols are tiny liquid
or solid particles suspended in the air.
They are either primary,
from dust, sea spray salt
or burning biomass,
or secondary, formed by gas to
particle conversion in the atmosphere,
also known as particle nucleation.
Aerosols are everywhere in the atmosphere,
and they can block out the sun
in polluted urban environments,
or bathe distant mountains in a blue haze.
More importantly, a cloud droplet cannot
form without an aerosol particle seed.
So without aerosol particles,
there'd be no clouds,
and without clouds,
there'd be no fresh water.
The climate would be much hotter,
and there would be no life.
So we owe our existence
to aerosol particles.
However, despite their importance,
how aerosol particles form
in the atmosphere
and their effect on clouds 
are poorly understood.
Even the vapors responsible
for aerosol particle formation
are not well established
because they're present in only
minute amounts,
near one molecule per million million
molecules of air.
This lack of understanding
is the main reason
for the large uncertainty 
in climate sensitivity,
and the corresponding wide range
of future climate projections.
However, an experiment underway at CERN,
named, perhaps unsurprisingly, ""Cloud""
has managed to build a steel vessel
that's large enough
and has a low enough contamination,
that aerosol formation can,
for the first time, be measured under
tightly controlled atmospheric conditions
in the laboratory.
In its first five years of operation,
Cloud has identified the vapors
responsible for aerosol particle
formation in the atmosphere,
which include sulfuric acid,
ammonia, amines,
and biogenic vapors from trees.
Using an ionizing particle beam
from the CERN proton synchrotron,
Cloud is also investigating
if galactic cosmic rays
enhance the formation of 
aerosols in clouds.
This has been suggested as a possible
unaccounted natural climate forcing agent
since the flux of cosmic rays raining
down on the atmosphere
varies with solar activity.
So Cloud is addressing two big questions:
Firstly, how cloudy was the 
pre-industrial climate?
And, hence, how much have
clouds changed due to human activities?
That knowledge will help sharpen
climate projections in the 21st century.
And secondly, could the puzzling
observations of solar climate variability
in the pre-industrial climate be explained
by an influence
of galactic cosmic rays on clouds?
Ambitious but realistic goals
when your head's in the clouds.
",How much has Earth's average surface temperature increased since 1750?
teded_682,Science,MCQ,"On July 26, 1943,
Los Angeles was blanketed by a thick
gas that stung people's eyes
and blocked out the Sun.
Panicked residents believed their city
had been attacked using chemical warfare.
But the cloud wasn't an act of war.
It was smog.
A portmanteau 
of smoke and fog,
the word smog was coined at the beginning
of the 20th century
to describe the thick gray 
haze that covered cities
such as London,
Glasgow,
and Edinburgh.
This industrial smog was known to form
when smoke from coal-burning 
home stoves and factories
combined with moisture in the air.
But the smog behind 
the LA panic was different.
It was yellowish with a chemical odor.
Since the city didn't burn much coal,
its cause would remain a mystery
until a chemist named Arie Haagen-Smit
identified two culprits,
volatile organic compounds, or VOCs,
and nitrous oxides.
VOCs are compounds that easily
become vapors
and may contain elements, such as carbon,
oxygen,
hydrogen,
chlorine,
and sulfur.
Some are naturally produced 
by plants and animals,
but others come from manmade sources,
like solvents,
paints,
glues,
and petroleum.
Meanwhile, the incomplete combustion
of gas in motor vehicles
releases nitrous oxide.
That's what gives this type of smog
its yellowish color.
VOCs and nitrous oxide react with sunlight
to produce secondary pollutants called
PANs and tropospheric,
or ground level, ozone.
PANs and ozone cause eye irritation
and damage lung tissue.
Both are key ingredients 
in photochemical smog,
which is what had been plaguing LA.
So why does smog affect some cities
but not others?
Both industrial and photochemical smog
combine manmade pollution
with local weather and geography.
London's high humidity made it a prime
location for industrial smog.
Photochemical smog is strongest in
urban areas with calm winds
and dry, warm, sunny weather.
The ultraviolet radiation from sunlight
provides the energy necessary
to breakdown molecules that contribute
to smog formation.
Cities surrounded by mountains, like LA,
or lying in a basin, like Beijing,
are also especially vulnerable to smog
since there's nowhere for it to dissipate.
That's also partially due to a phenomenon
known as temperature inversion,
where instead of warm air 
continuously rising upward,
a pollution-filled layer of air remains 
trapped near the Earth's surface
by a slightly warmer layer above.
Smog isn't just an aesthetic eyesore.
Both forms of smog irritate the eyes,
nose,
and throat,
exacerbate conditions like asthma
and emphysema,
and increase the risk 
of respiratory infections like bronchitis.
Smog can be especially harmful 
to young children and older people
and exposure in pregnant women has been
linked to low birth weight
and potential birth defects.
Secondary pollutants found 
in photochemical smog
can damage and weaken crops
and decrease yield,
making them more susceptible to insects.
Yet for decades, smog was seen
as the inevitable price of civilization.
Londoners had become accustomed to 
the notorious pea soup fog
swirling over their streets until 1952,
when the Great Smog of London shut down
all transportation in the city for days
and caused more 
than 4,000 respiratory deaths.
As a result, the Clean Air Act of 1956
banned burning coal in 
certain areas of the city,
leading to a massive reduction in smog.
Similarly, regulations on vehicle 
emissions and gas content in the US
reduced the volatile compounds in the air
and smog levels along with them.
Smog remains a major problem
around the world.
Countries like China and Poland that
depend on coal for energy
experience high levels of industrial smog.
Photochemical smog and airborne particles
from vehicle emissions
affect many rapidly developing cities,
from Mexico City and Santiago
to New Delhi and Tehran.
Governments have tried many methods
to tackle it,
such as banning cars from driving
for days at a time.
As more than half of the world's 
population crowds into cities,
considering a shift to mass transit
and away from fossil fuels
may allow us to breathe easier.

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby
Today, we're going to look at the world of Rome
through the eyes of a young girl.
Here she is, drawing a picture of herself
in the atrium of her father's enormous house.
Her name is Domitia,
and she is just 5 years old.
She has an older brother who is fourteen,
Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus,
named after her dad.
Girls don't get these long names that boys have.
What is worse is that Dad insists
on calling all his daughters Domitia.
""Domitia!""
His call to Domitia drawing on the column,
Domitia III.
She has an older sister, Domitia II, who is 7 years old.
And then there's Domitia I, who is ten.
There would have been a Domitia IV,
but mom died trying to give birth to her three years ago.
Confused?
The Romans were too.
They could work out ancestry through the male line
with the nice, tripartite names
such as Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus.
But they got in a real mess
over which Domitia was married to whom
and was either the great aunt
or the great stepmother and so on to whom
when they came to write it down.
Domitia III is not just drawing on the pillar,
she's also watching the action.
You see, it's early,
in the time of day when all her dad's clients and friends
come to see him at home to pay their respects.
Lucius Popidius Secundus, a 17 year old,
he wants to marry Domitia II
within the next five to seven years,
has come as well.
He seems to be wooing not his future wife,
but her dad.
Poor Lucius, he does not know that Domitia's dad
thinks he and his family are wealthy
but still scumbags from the Subura.
Afterall, it is the part of Rome
full of barbers and prostitutes.
Suddenly, all the men are leaving with Dad.
It's the second hour
and time for him to be in court
with a sturdy audience of clients
to applaud his rhetoric
and hiss at his opponent.
The house is now quieter.
The men won't return for seven hours,
not until dinner time.
But what happens in the house for those seven hours?
What do Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia do all day?
Not an easy question!
Everything written down by the Romans
that we have today was written by men.
This makes constructing the lives of women difficult.
However, we can't have a history of just Roman men,
so here it goes.
We can begin in the atrium.
There is a massive loom,
on which Dad's latest wife is working on a new toga.
Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia are tasked
with spinning the wool
that will be used to weave this mighty garment,
30 or more feet long and elliptical in shape.
Romans loved the idea
that their wives work wool.
We know that because it's written
on the gravestones of so many Roman women.
Unlike women in Greece,
Roman women go out the house
and move about the city.
They go to the baths in the morning to avoid the men
or to separate baths that are for women only.
Some do go in for the latest fad of the AD 70s:
nude bathing with men present.
Where they have no place
is where the men are:
in the Forum,
in the Law Court,
or in the Senate House.
Their place in public is in the porticos
with gardens,
with sculpture,
and with pathways for walking in.
When Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia want
to leave the house to go somewhere,
like the Portico of Livia,
they must get ready.
Domitia II and Domitia III are ready,
but Domitia I, who is betrothed to be married
in two years to darling Philatus,
isn't ready.
She's not slow, she just has more to do.
Being betrothed means she wears the insignia of betrothal:
engagement rings
and all the gifts Pilatus has given her -
jewels,
earrings,
necklaces,
and the pendants.
She may even wear her myrtle crown.
All this bling shouts,
""I'm getting married to that 19 year old
who gave me all this stuff I'm wearing!""
While as they wait, Domitia II and Domitia III play with their dolls
that mirror the image of their sister
decked out to be married.
One day, these dolls will be dedicated
to the household gods on the day of their wedding.
Okay, we're ready.
The girls step into litters carried by some burly slaves.
They also have a chaperone with them
and will be meeting an aunt at the Porticus of Livia.
Carried high on the shoulders of these slaves,
the girls look out through the curtains
to see the crowded streets below them.
They traverse the city, pass the Coliseum,
but then turn off to climb up the hill
to the Porticus of Livia.
It was built by Livia, the wife of the first emperor Augustus,
on the site of the house of Vedius Pollio.
He wasn't such a great guy.
He once tried to feed a slave
to the eels in his fish pond
for simply dropping a dish.
Luckily, the emperor was at the dinner
and tamed his temper.
The litters are placed on the ground
and the girls get out
and arm in arm, two by two,
they ascend the steps
into the enclosed garden with many columns.
Domitia III shot off and is drawing on a column.
Domitia II joins her
but seeks to read the graffiti higher up on the column.
She spots a drawing of gladiators
and tries to imagine seeing them fighting,
something she will never be permitted to do,
except from the very rear of the Coliseum.
From there, she will have a good view
of the 50,000 spectators
but will see little by way of blood and gore.
If she really wanted a decent view,
she could become a vestal virgin
and would sit right down the front.
But a career tending the sacred flame of Vesta
is not to everybody's taste.
Domitia I has met another ten year old
also decked out in the insignia of betrothal.
Home time.
When they get there after the eighth hour,
something is up.
A smashed dish lies on the floor.
All the slaves are being gathered together in the atrium
and await the arrival of their master.
Dad is going to go mad.
He will not hit his children,
but like many other Romans,
he believes that slaves have to be punished.
The whip lies ready for his arrival.
No one knows who smashed the dish,
but Dad will call the undertaker
to torture it out of them, if he must.
The doorkeeper opens the front door to the house.
A hush comes over the anxious slaves.
In walks not their master
but, instead, a pregnant teenager.
It is the master's eldest daughter, age 15,
who is already a veteran of marriage and child birth.
Guess what her name is.
There is a five to ten percent chance
she won't survive giving birth to her child,
but, for now, she has come to dinner with her family.
As a teenage mother,
she has proved that she is a successful wife
by bringing children and descendants for her husband,
who will carry on his name in the future.
The family head off to the dining room
and are served dinner.
It would seem Dad has had an invite to dinner elsewhere.
With dinner concluded, the girls crossed the atrium
to bid farewell to their older sister
who is carried home in a litter,
escorted by some of Dad's bodyguards.
Returning to the house,
the girls cross the atrium.
The slaves, young and old,
male and female,
await the return of their owner.
When he returns, he may exact vengeance,
ensuring his power over the slaves
is maintained through violence and terror,
to which any slave could be subjected.
But, for the girls, they head upstairs for the night,
ready for bed.

teded_Could your brain repair itself? - Ralitsa Petrova - 04:00_5,Science,SHORT_ANSWER,"Imagine the brain could reboot,
updating its withered and damaged cells
with new, improved units.
That may sound like science fiction,
but it's a potential reality
scientists are investigating right now.
Will our brains one day 
be able to self-repair?
It's well known that embryonic cells
in our young developing brains
produce new neurons,
the microscopic units 
that make up the brain's tissue.
Those newly generated neurons migrate
to various parts of the developing brain,
making it self-organize 
into different structures.
But until recently,
scientists thought cell production came to
an abrupt halt soon after this initial growth,
leading them to conclude 
that neurological diseases,
like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's,
and damaging events, like strokes,
are irreversible.
But a series of recent discoveries
has revealed that adult brains 
actually do continue to produce new cells
in at least three specialized locations.
This process, known as neurogenesis,
involves dedicated brain cells,
called neural stem cells
and progenitor cells,
which manufacture new neurons
or replace the old ones.
The three regions where neurogenesis
has been discovered
are the dentate gyrus,
associated with learning and memory,
the subventricular zone, which may
supply neurons to the olfactory bulb
for communication 
between the nose and brain,
and the striatum, 
which helps manage movement.
Scientists don't yet have a good grasp
on exactly what role
neurogenesis plays 
in any of these regions,
or why they have this ability 
that's absent from the rest of the brain,
but the mere presence of a mechanism
to grown new neurons in the adult brain
opens up an amazing possibility.
Could we harness that mechanism
to get the brain to heal its scars
similar to how new skin
grows to patch up a wound,
or a broken bone 
stitches itself back together?
So here's where we stand.
Certain proteins and other small molecules
that mimick those proteins
can be administered to the brain
to make neural stem cells 
and progenitor cells
produce more neurons 
in those three locations.
This technique still needs improvement
so that the cells 
reproduce more efficiently
and more cells survive.
But research shows that progenitor cells
from these areas
can actually migrate to places where
injury has occurred
and give rise to new neurons there.
And another promising possible approach
is to transplant healthy 
human neural stem cells,
which are cultured in a laboratory,
to injured tissue,
like we can do with skin.
Scientists are currently experimenting
to determine whether transplanted
donor cells can divide, differentiate
and successfully give rise 
to new neurons in a damaged brain.
They've also discovered
that we might be able to teach
other kinds of brain cells,
such as astrocytes
or oligodendrocytes
to behave like neural stem cells
and start generating neurons, too.
So, a couple of decades from now
will our brains be able to self-repair?
We can't say for sure,
but that has become one of the major 
goals of regenerative medicine.
The human brain has 100 billion neurons
and we're still figuring out the wiring
behind this huge biological motherboard.
But everyday, research on neurogenesis
brings us closer to that reboot switch.",The adult human brain is composed of billions of neurons and glial cells connected to one another. What are some of the challenges of successfully grafting donor neural cells to treat brain disease?
teded_Gyotaku: The ancient Japanese art of printing fish - K. Erica Dodge - 03:38_0,Social Studies,MCQ,"Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby
How big was that fish you caught?
This big?
This big?
This big?
Without photographic evidence,
there's nothing that proves you caught a whopper,
and that's been true since the dawn of fishing.
In fact, hundreds of years ago,
long before photography could capture the moment,
Japanese fishermen invented their own way
to record trophy catches.
They called it Gyotaku.
Gyotaku is the ancient art of printing fish
that originated in Japan
as a way to record trophy catches
prior to the modern day camera.
Gyo means fish
and taku means impression.
There are several different stories about
how Gyotaku came about,
but it basically started with fishermen
needing a way to record the species and size
of the fish they caught over 100 years ago.
Fishermen took paper, ink, and brushes
out to sea with them.
They told stories of great adventures at sea.
Since the Japanese revered certain fish,
the fishermen would take a rubbing from these fish
and release them.
To make the rubbing,
they would paint the fish with non-toxic sumi-e ink
and print them on rice paper.
This way they could be released
or cleaned and sold at market.
The first prints like this were for records only
with no extra details.
It wasn't until the mid 1800's
that they began painting eye details
and other embellishments onto the prints.
One famous nobleman, Lord Sakai, was an avid fisherman,
and, when he made a large catch,
he wanted to preserve the memory
of the large, red sea bream.
To do so, he commissioned a fisherman to print his catch.
After this, many fisherman would bring
their Gyotaku prints to Lord Sakai,
and if he liked their work,
he would hire them to print for him.
Many prints hung in the palace during the Edo period.
After this period, Gyotaku was not as popular
and began to fade away.
Today, Gyotaku has become a popular art form,
enjoyed by many.
And the prints are said to bring good luck to the fishermen.
But the art form is quite different than it used to be.
Most artists today learn on their own by trial and error.
Before the artist begins to print,
the fish needs to be prepared for printing.
First, the artist places the fish
on a hollowed out surface.
Then the artist spreads the fins out
and pins them down on the board to dry.
They then clean the fish with water.
When it comes time to print,
there are two different methods.
The indirect method begins with pasting moist fabric or paper
onto the fish using rice paste.
Then, the artist uses a tompo,
or a cotton ball covered in silk,
to put ink on the fabric or paper to produce the print.
This method requires more skill
and great care needs to be taken
when pulling the paper off the fish
so the paper doesn't tear.
In the direct method,
the artist paints directly on the fish,
and then gently presses the moist fabric or paper into the fish.
With both of these methods,
no two prints are exactly alike,
but both reveal dramatic images of the fish.
For the final touch,
the artist uses a chop, or a stamp,
and signs their work,
and can hold it up to say,
""The fish was exactly this big!""",What was the original purpose for gyotaku?
teded_History vs. Genghis Khan - Alex Gendler - 06:06_6,Social Studies,MCQ,"He was one of the most fearsome 
warlords who ever lived,
waging an unstoppable conquest
across the Eurasian continent.
But was Genghis Khan a vicious barbarian
or a unifier who paved the way
for the modern world?
We'll see in ""History vs. Genghis Khan.""
""Order, order. 
Now who's the defendant today?
Khan!""
""I see Your Honor is familiar 
with Genghis Khan,
the 13th century warlord whose military
campaigns killed millions
and left nothing 
but destruction in their wake.""
""Objection. First of all,
it's pronounced Genghis Kahn.""
""Really?""
""In Mongolia, yes.
Regardless, he was one of the greatest
leaders in human history.
Born Temüjin, he was left fatherless
and destitute as a child
but went on to overcome constant strife
to unite warring Mongol clans
and forge the greatest empire
the world had seen,
eventually stretching from the Pacific
to Europe's heartland.""
""And what was so great 
about invasion and slaughter?
Northern China lost 2/3 of its population.""
""The Jin Dynasty had long harassed 
the northern tribes,
paying them off to fight each other
and periodically attacking them.
Genghis Khan wasn't about 
to suffer the same fate
as the last Khan who tried 
to unite the Mongols,
and the demographic change may reflect
poor census keeping,
not to mention that many peasants
were brought into the Khan's army.""
""You can pick apart numbers all you want,
but they wiped out entire cities,
along with their inhabitants.""
""The Khan preferred enemies 
to surrender and pay tribute,
but he firmly believed in loyalty
and diplomatic law.
The cities that were massacred were ones
that rebelled after surrendering,
or killed as ambassadors.
His was a 
strict understanding of justice.""
""Multiple accounts show his army's 
brutality going beyond justice:
ripping unborn children 
from mothers' wombs,
using prisoners as human shields,
or moat fillers to support siege engines,
taking all women from conquered towns--""
""Enough! How barbaric!""
""Is that really so much worse 
than other medieval armies?""
""That doesn't excuse 
Genghis Khan's atrocities.""
""But it does make Genghis Khan 
unexceptional for his time
rather than some bloodthirsty savage.
In fact, after his unification
of the tribes abolished bride kidnapping,
women in the Mongol ranks 
had it better than most.
They controlled domestic affairs,
could divorce their husbands,
and were trusted advisors.
Temüjin remained with 
his first bride all his life,
even raising her possibly 
illegitimate son as his own.""
""Regardless, Genghis Khan's 
legacy was a disaster:
up to 40 million killed across Eurasia
during his descendents' conquests.
10% of the world population.
That's not even counting 
casualties from the Black Plague
brought to Europe by 
the Golden Horde's Siege of Kaffa.""
""Surely that wasn't intentional.""
""Actually, when they saw their own troops
dying of the Plague,
they catapulted infected bodies
over the city walls.""
""Blech.""
""The accounts you're referencing
were written over a hundred years 
after the fact.
How reliable do you think they are?
Plus, the survivors reaped the benefits
of the empire Genghis Khan founded.""
""Benefits?""
""The Mongol Empire practiced
religious tolerance among all subjects,
they treated their soldiers well, promoted
based on merit, rather than birth,
established a vast postal system,
and inforced universal rule of law,
not to mention their 
contribution to culture.""
""You mean like Hulagu Khan's 
annihilation of Baghdad,
the era's cultural capital?
Libraries, hospitals and palaces burned,
irrigation canals buried?""
""Baghdad was unfortunate,
but its Kalif refused to surrender,
and Hulagu was later punished 
by Berke Khan for the wanton destruction.
It wasn't Mongol policy 
to destroy culture.
Usually they saved doctors, scholars
and artisans from conquered places,
and transferred them 
throughout their realm,
spreading knowledge across the world.""
""What about the devastation of Kievan Rus,
leaving its people in the Dark Ages
even as the Renaissance 
spread across Western Europe?""
""Western Europe was hardly 
peaceful at the time.
The stability of Mongol rule
made the Silk Road flourish once more,
allowing trade and cultural exchange
between East and West,
and its legacy forged Russia and China
from warring princedoms
into unified states.
In fact, long after the Empire,
Genghis Khan's descendants could be found
among the ruling nobility 
all over Eurasia.""
""Not surprising that a tyrant would inspire
further tyrants.""
""Careful what you call him.
You may be related.""
""What?""
""16 million men today are descended
from Genghis Khan.
That's one in ever 200.""
For every great conqueror,
there are millions of conquered.

or cultural signifigance
outweigh the deaths 
they caused along the way?

when we put history on trial.",Which city’s destruction by one of Genghis Khan’s descendants infuriated another Khan?
teded_How ancient art influenced modern art - Felipe Galindo - 04:51_0,Social Studies,MCQ,"The term modern art sounds like it
means art that is popular at the moment,
but in fact, modern art is a style
that originated over 150 years ago,
and includes artists that by now
have attained classic status,
such as Picasso, Matisse, and Gauguin.
And what's even more ironic is that
the movement they pioneered,
considered revolutionary
and even scandalous at the time,
was inspired largely by an object
of a traditional and ancient design.
As far back as the Renaissance,
the primary European art movements
emphasized conventional representation
and adherence to classical forms.
But that began to change 
in the late 19th century
as artists like Van Gogh and Cézanne
expanded the boundaries of painting.
Soon, a movement arose that sought
to create an entirely new style of art,
and one way of doing so was to look
beyond Western civilization.
For example, Paul Gauguin moved
to the island of Tahiti in the 1890s.
There, he found inspiration in the island's
inhabitants, landscape, and culture
to create artwork that intertwined
European themes and Polynesian lore.
Others looked the cultures 
of the Islamic world,
but the most influential inspiration
would come from Sub-Saharan Africa.
As European empires expanded
deeper into the African continent,
its artifacts and artworks made their way
into the hands of museums and collectors.
One such collector was Henri Matisse,
who showed his friend Picasso 
a mask he had acquired
made by the Dan tribe of the Ivory Coast.
The mask awoke Picasso's curiosity,
leading him to visit the Trocadéro 
Ethnographic Museum in Paris in 1907.
Founded to house acquisitions 
from colonial conquests,
the museum boasted 
a collection of African art,
with stylized figures 
and masks made of wood
and decorated with simple colors 
and materials.
The visit was a revelation for Picasso,
who proclaimed that African masks
were what painting was all about.
At this time, Picasso had been working
on a painting of five nude women
in a style that would later come
to be known as Cubism.
And while three of these ladies
show facial features
found in ancient Iberian art,
a nod to Picasso's Spanish heritage,
the faces of the two on the right
closely resemble African masks.
Created in 1907 after hundreds
of sketches and studies,
""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon""
has been considered 
the first truly 20th century masterpiece,
breaking with many previously 
held notions in art.
It was at once aggressive and abstract,
distorted yet primal in its raw geometry,
a new artistic language with new forms,
colors, and meanings.
And these avant-garde qualities
caused a sensation
when the painting was first exhibited
almost ten years later.
The public was shocked,
critics denounced it as immoral,
and even Picasso's own friends
were simultaneously surprised,
offended,
and mesmerized at his audacity.
More artists soon followed 
in Picasso's footsteps.
Constantin Brâncuși 
and Amedeo Modigliani in Paris,
as well as the German Expressionists,
all drew on the aesthetics 
of African sculptures in their work.
Others looked to a different continent
for their inspiration.
British sculptor Henry Moore based many
of his semi-abstract bronze sculptures
on a replica of a chacmool,
a distinctive reclining statue
from the Toltec-Maya culture.
Pre-Columbian art was also a major
influence for Josef Albers.
He created a series of compositions,
such as the geometrical series
Homage to the Square,
that were inspired by pyramids
and local art
he encountered
on his frequent visits to Mexico.
Inspiration from ancient cultures
initiated one of the most revolutionary 
movements in art history,
but were these artists playing the role
of explorers or conquistadors,
appropriating ideas and profiting
from cultures they considered primitive?
Questions like this deserve scrutiny,
as artists continue to redefine standards.
Perhaps not too long from now,
the bold innovations of modern art
will seem like stale orthodoxies,
ready to be overturned by a new set
of radical trailblazers
drawing inspiration from another
unlikely source.",How many years ago do you think the modern art movement originated?
teded_Will future spacecraft fit in our pockets? - Dhonam Pemba - 04:37_4,Science,MCQ,"When you picture a spaceship,
you probably think of something like this,
or this, or maybe this.
What do they all have in common?
Among other things, they're huge
because they have to carry people, fuel,
and all sorts of supplies, 
scientific instruments,
and, in rare cases, planet-killing lasers.
But the next real-world generation 
of spacecraft may be much, much smaller.
We're talking fit-inside-your-pocket tiny.
Imagine sending a swarm of these
microspacecraft out into the galaxy.
They could explore 
distant stars and planets
by carrying sophisticated 
electronic sensors
that would measure everything
from temperature to cosmic rays.
You could deploy thousands of them
for the cost of a single 
space shuttle mission,
exponentially increasing 
the amount of data
we could collect about the universe.
And they're individually expendable,
meaning that we could send them 
into environments
that are too risky 
for a billion dollar rocket or probe.
Several hundred small spacecraft
are already orbiting the Earth,
taking pictures of outer space,
and collecting data on things,
like the behavior of bacteria 
in the Earth's atmosphere
and magnetic signals that could help
predict earthquakes.
But imagine how much more we could learn
if they could fly beyond Earth's orbit.
That's exactly what organizations,
like NASA, want to do:
send microspacecraft 
to scout habitable planets
and describe astronomical phenomena
we can't study from Earth.
But something so small can't carry 
a large engine or tons of fuel,
so how would such a vessel propel itself?
For microspacecraft, it turns out, 
you need micropropulsion.
On really small scales,
some of the familiar 
rules of physics don't apply,
in particular, everyday 
Newtonian mechanics break down,
and forces that are normally negligible
become powerful.
Those forces include surface tension
and capillary action,
the phenomena 
that govern other small things.
Micropropulsion systems can harness
these forces to power spacecraft.
One example of how this might work
is called microfluidic 
electrospray propulsion.
It's a type of ion thruster,
which means that it shoots out
charged particles to generate momentum.
One model being developed at NASA's
jet propulsion laboratory
is only a couple centimeters 
on each side.
Here's how it works.
That postage-stamp sized metal plate
is studded with a hundred skinny needles
and coated with a metal 
that has a low melting point, like indium.
A metal grid sits above the needles,
and an electric field is set up
between the grid and the plate.
When the plate is heated,
the indium melts
and capillary action draws 
the liquid metal up the needles.
The electric field tugs 
the molten metal upwards,
while surface tension pulls it back,
causing the indium to deform into a cone.
The small radius of the tips 
of the needles
makes it possible for the electric field
to overcome the surface tension,
and when that happens,
positively charged ions shoot off at
speeds of tens of kilometers per second.
That stream of ions propels the spacecraft
in the opposite direction,
thanks to Newton's third law.
And while each ion 
is an extremely small particle,
the combined force of so many of them
pushing away from the craft
is enough to generate 
significant acceleration.
And unlike the exhaust 
that pours out of a rocket engine,
this stream is much smaller
and far more fuel efficient,
which makes it better suited
for long deep-space missions.
These micropropulsion systems
haven't been fully tested yet,
but some scientists think that they
will provide enough thrust
to break small craft out of Earth's orbit.
In fact, they're predicting that thousands
of microspacecraft
will be launched in the next ten years
to gather data that today 
we can only dream about.
And that is micro-rocket science.",How fast do the charged ions shoot out of the emitters?
