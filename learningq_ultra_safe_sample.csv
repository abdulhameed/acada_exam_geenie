khan_video_QaOtsYouet0_6,"Hello,
So deltaG is change in free energy at non-stadard condition but it is also instantaneous change in free energy between products and reactant?",Essay,"•
0:01
- [Instructor] We've already seen that the change
0:02
in free energy, delta G,
0:05
can be related to the cell potential E, by this equation.
0:09
Under standard state conditions,
0:11
this would be the standard change in free energy,
0:13
so delta G zero which is related to the
0:15
standard cell potential E zero, right,
0:18
by the same equation.
0:20
This equation down here comes from thermodynamics,
0:23
and we're going to plug in for delta G and delta G zero,
0:27
so we're going to plug this in for delta G,
0:31
and we're going to plug this in for delta G zero.
0:34
So that gives us negative nFE is equal to,
0:39
negative nFE zero, plus RT,
0:45
natural log of Q,
0:47
where Q is the reaction quotient.
0:50
Let's divide everything by negative nF,
0:53
so we're going to divide everything
0:55
in here by negative nF,
0:57
and let's see what cancels out.
1:00
So all of this would cancel out,
1:02
all of that would cancel out,
1:04
and we get the Nernst equation.
1:07
So let me go ahead and write it,
1:08
the cell potential E,
1:11
is equal to the standard cell potential, E zero,
1:15
minus RT over nF,
1:20
times the natural log of Q,
1:23
where Q is the reaction quotient.
1:26
So this is the Nernst equation,
1:29
alright, we'll talk about why the Nernst equation
1:32
is so important, we'll talk more about that
1:33
at the end of the video.
1:35
Right now, let's go ahead and derive
1:38
another form of the Nernst equation,
1:40
I should say, the form when you're talking
1:41
about a certain temperature.
1:43
So at 25 degrees C, right,
1:46
most of our reactions take place at 25 degrees C,
1:50
well, temperature, right,
1:52
temperature in here, this in the temperature in Kelvin,
1:54
so we need to convert to Kelvin.
1:57
So if you add 273.15, alright,
2:01
you get your temperature in Kelvin,
2:03
so that would be 298.15,
2:08
so what we're going to do is solve for RT over F,
2:12
to write a different form of the Nernst equation.
2:15
And so the temperature is 298.15 Kelvin,
2:18
so let's write that in,
2:20
so 298.15 Kelvin.
2:24
R is the gas constant,
2:26
so remember, the gas constant is 8.314, 8.314,
2:31
joules over mole Kelvin.
2:35
And F is Faraday's constant,
2:38
remember Faraday's constant from an earlier video, right,
2:40
that's 96,500 coulombs per mole.
2:45
So Faraday's constant is the
2:48
charge of one mole of electrons.
2:52
Alright, so let's solve for
2:53
what all this is equal to,
2:55
so let's get some more space,
2:57
and let's get out the calculator.
3:00
So we've already done this calculation
3:02
in an earlier video,
3:03
but I'm going to go ahead and do it again,
3:05
for this Nernst equation video.
3:06
So 8.314 times 289.15,
3:14
we need to divide that by Faraday's constant, 96,500.
3:19
So that gives us 0.0257, alright,
3:24
so this is equal to,
3:26
this is equal to 0.0257,
3:31
and for units, Kelvin would cancel out,
3:33
moles would cancel out,
3:35
that gives us joules over coulombs,
3:37
which is equal to volts, alright.
3:40
So this is equal to volts,
3:42
and we can write another form of the Nernst equation.
3:46
So if your reaction is at 25 degrees C,
3:50
you can write the Nernst equation this way,
3:52
you could say that the cell potential E,
3:54
is equal to the standard cell potential E zero, minus,
3:59
so all that RT over F is equal to this, 0.0257, right.
4:05
So 0.0257 volts,
4:09
we still have n,
4:11
remember n is the number of moles
4:14
I'm going to use green for that,
4:15
n is the number of moles
4:17
of electrons that are transferred
4:19
in your redox reaction, right.
4:21
So we're going to put n in here,
4:23
and we still have the natural log of Q,
4:26
the reaction quotient, right.
4:28
So here is another form of the Nernst equation,
4:33
alright, so at 25 degrees, you can use this form,
4:36
and then we can also write this
4:40
into base 10 logarithms that have natural logs.
4:43
So we can do that conversion, right.
4:45
So we also did that in an earlier video,
4:47
but if you're trying to convert this 0.0257,
4:52
you need to multiply by the natural log of 10.
4:56
So when we do that,
4:58
so we have 0.0257 times the natural log of 10,
5:05
that gives us 0.0592,
5:08
so this is equal to 0.0592.
5:14
So we can write the Nernst equation once again,
5:18
alright, so E, or the cell potential,
5:20
is equal to the standard cell potential E zero,
5:22
minus 0.0592 over n.
5:29
And we essentially just change this
5:32
from natural logarithm to base 10 logarithm,
5:34
so this would be log of Q, log of the reaction quotient.
5:39
So here is just another form of the Nernst equation.
5:44
So why is the Nernst equation important
5:47
and why is it useful?
5:48
It's useful, because it allows us to calculate
5:51
a cell potential under non-standard state conditions,
5:56
so think about this cell potential
5:59
as being the instantaneous cell potential,
6:02
and you can relate that
6:03
to the progress of the reaction, right.
6:05
So as you change concentrations,
6:07
the reaction quotient Q changes, right,
6:10
and that means that the
6:12
instantaneous cell potential changes,
6:15
alright, so if you change if the concentrations,
6:17
if you change the concentrations,
6:19
you're changing the cell potential.
6:21
And so we'll see more about that in the next video,
6:23
so I think that the Nernst equation makes much more
6:26
sense when you do some problems with it,
6:29
and then you can understand better what it means.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,QaOtsYouet0,
teded_Could your brain repair itself? - Ralitsa Petrova - 04:00_5,The adult human brain is composed of billions of neurons and glial cells connected to one another. What are some of the challenges of successfully grafting donor neural cells to treat brain disease?,open-ended,"Imagine the brain could reboot,
updating its withered and damaged cells
with new, improved units.
That may sound like science fiction,
but it's a potential reality
scientists are investigating right now.
Will our brains one day 
be able to self-repair?
It's well known that embryonic cells
in our young developing brains
produce new neurons,
the microscopic units 
that make up the brain's tissue.
Those newly generated neurons migrate
to various parts of the developing brain,
making it self-organize 
into different structures.
But until recently,
scientists thought cell production came to
an abrupt halt soon after this initial growth,
leading them to conclude 
that neurological diseases,
like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's,
and damaging events, like strokes,
are irreversible.
But a series of recent discoveries
has revealed that adult brains 
actually do continue to produce new cells
in at least three specialized locations.
This process, known as neurogenesis,
involves dedicated brain cells,
called neural stem cells
and progenitor cells,
which manufacture new neurons
or replace the old ones.
The three regions where neurogenesis
has been discovered
are the dentate gyrus,
associated with learning and memory,
the subventricular zone, which may
supply neurons to the olfactory bulb
for communication 
between the nose and brain,
and the striatum, 
which helps manage movement.
Scientists don't yet have a good grasp
on exactly what role
neurogenesis plays 
in any of these regions,
or why they have this ability 
that's absent from the rest of the brain,
but the mere presence of a mechanism
to grown new neurons in the adult brain
opens up an amazing possibility.
Could we harness that mechanism
to get the brain to heal its scars
similar to how new skin
grows to patch up a wound,
or a broken bone 
stitches itself back together?
So here's where we stand.
Certain proteins and other small molecules
that mimick those proteins
can be administered to the brain
to make neural stem cells 
and progenitor cells
produce more neurons 
in those three locations.
This technique still needs improvement
so that the cells 
reproduce more efficiently
and more cells survive.
But research shows that progenitor cells
from these areas
can actually migrate to places where
injury has occurred
and give rise to new neurons there.
And another promising possible approach
is to transplant healthy 
human neural stem cells,
which are cultured in a laboratory,
to injured tissue,
like we can do with skin.
Scientists are currently experimenting
to determine whether transplanted
donor cells can divide, differentiate
and successfully give rise 
to new neurons in a damaged brain.
They've also discovered
that we might be able to teach
other kinds of brain cells,
such as astrocytes
or oligodendrocytes
to behave like neural stem cells
and start generating neurons, too.
So, a couple of decades from now
will our brains be able to self-repair?
We can't say for sure,
but that has become one of the major 
goals of regenerative medicine.
The human brain has 100 billion neurons
and we're still figuring out the wiring
behind this huge biological motherboard.
But everyday, research on neurogenesis
brings us closer to that reboot switch.",TED-Ed,Science,Could your brain repair itself? - Ralitsa Petrova - 04:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D1AwQ0lTsg,data/teded/crawled_data/videos/Could your brain repair itself? - Ralitsa Petrova - 04:00,,

0:00
I said I would get you
0:01
a more interesting mass composition
0:03
to empirical formula problem,
0:06
one that doesn't just have a straight-up 2:1 ratio.
0:08
And so here it is.
0:09
I have a bag of stuff.
0:11
Or let's call this a bottle of stuff.
0:13
Maybe it's in its liquid form.
0:14
And it happens to be 2.04% hydrogen,
0:18
65.3% oxygen, and 32.65% sulfur.
0:24
What is the empirical formula,
0:26
what's our best stab
0:28
at the empirical formula, of this substance?
0:30
So what we would do,
0:31
like we do in all these problems,
0:32
let's just assume we've got 100 grams of the stuff.
0:35
So we have 100 grams of the stuff.
0:38
So we assume 100 grams.
0:41
Let me do that in a good yellow.
0:45
So let's say, assume I have 100 grams.
0:49
How many grams of hydrogen do I have?
0:53
If I have 100 grams total,
0:54
2.04% of that is hydrogen,
0:56
so I have 2.04 grams of hydrogen.
1:00
I have 65.3 grams of oxygen.
1:04
And I have 32.65 grams of sulfur.
1:13
Now, what we need to do now is figure out
1:14
how many moles of hydrogen is this.
1:16
How many moles of oxygen.
1:17
And how many moles of sulfur.
1:19
Then we can compare the ratios
1:20
and we should be able to know the empirical formula.
1:22
So how much 1 mole of hydrogen?
1:25
What is the mass of 1 mole of hydrogen?
1:28
Let me write that.
1:29
So 1 mole of hydrogen.
1:35
Well we know what the mass number for hydrogen is.
1:39
It's 1.
1:40
And especially, the atomic weight, also for hydrogen,
1:44
if we were to take it on Earth.
1:45
The composition, you pretty much just find hydrogen nucleuses.
1:48
If it's neutral, it has an electron,
1:50
but it has no neutrons.
1:52
So it has an atomic mass of one atomic mass unit.
1:56
So one mole of hydrogen.
1:57
If you have a ton of hydrogens together,
2:00
or a mole of them, not a ton, I shouldn't say,
2:02
you have a mole of them.
2:06
you have 6.02 times 10 to the 23 hydrogens.
2:09
Then you take hydrogen's
2:10
atomic mass number in atomic mass units.
2:12
And you say, well, it'll be that
2:14
many grams of hydrogen, right?
2:17
So if you immediately look up here,
2:18
if we have 2.04 grams of hydrogen,
2:21
how many moles of hydrogen do we have?
2:24
Well, one mole is one gram,
2:26
so we have 2.04 moles of hydrogen.
2:32
Notice, this said what the mass of the hydrogen is.
2:35
This tells us how many hydrogen molecules we have.
2:39
Remember, this is 2.04 times 6.02
2:42
times 10 to the 23 hydrogen atoms.
2:45
Moles of hydrogen.
2:47
Maybe I should write that down.
2:49
So one mole of hydrogen.
2:50
There you go.
2:51
And then oxygen.
2:53
One mole of oxygen.
2:56
Oxygen's mass number, in case you forgot, is 16.
3:01
Right there.
3:03
Oxygen's mass number is 16.
3:05
So one mole of oxygen has a mass of 16 grams.
3:09
6.02 times 10 to the 23 oxygen atoms has a mass of 16 grams.
3:15
So how many moles do we have here?
3:17
Let's see.
3:19
So if we take 65.3 grams of oxygen.
3:30
And we have 16 grams per mole,
3:33
so you divide by 16.
3:34
It equals 4.08125.
3:37
I don't want to get too precise here.
3:39
But let me just write that. 4.08 moles of oxygen.
3:43
So I'm going to write that in oxygen color.
3:46
So I have 4.08 moles of oxygen.
3:53
And then finally, sulfur.
3:55
What is sulfur's atomic mass?
3:58
The one thing I'll never forget about sulfur
4:01
is its smell.
4:02
There's a city in Louisiana
4:04
which we used to drive to all the time --
4:05
I think we had some family friends there
4:07
--called Port Sulfur.
4:08
And they did a lot of sulfur processing there.
4:11
And lucky for the residents, at least at the time
4:14
-- I apologize if they fixed the issue
4:17
-- it smelled like sulfur, which smells like rotten eggs.
4:20
But anyway, one mole of sulfur. One mole of sulfur.
4:27
So sulfur's atomic mass is
4:32
32 atomic mass units per sulfur atom.
4:36
So a whole mole of it is going to have a mass of 32 grams.
4:41
So a mole of sulfur-- not a mule.
4:45
Maybe I should invent a new unit called the mule.
4:48
So a mole of sulfur is 32 grams.
4:51
So how many moles do we have?
4:53
We have a little bit more than one,
4:54
but let's be precise here,
4:56
because everything else is a little bit of a decimal.
4:58
So if we have 32.65 grams of sulfur
5:07
and we divide by the number of grams per mole
5:10
-- divided by 32 grams per mole
5:13
we have 1.02 moles of sulfur.
5:25
This was hydrogen up here.
5:27
So here, you should hopefully see a pretty good ratio, here.
5:30
For every one sulfur atom--
5:32
I mean, the ratio worked exactly out
5:33
and that's because I did this problem before.
5:36
I actually made up this problem before we worked,
5:38
so I made it so the numbers worked out.
5:39
But one mole of sulfur, for every mole of sulfur,
5:42
so for every 6.02 times 10 to the 23 sulphur atoms,
5:46
you have two moles of hydrogen, right?
5:48
This ratio is 1:2.
5:49
Two times 1.02 is 2.04.
5:52
And then, for every one mole of sulfur,
5:54
you have four moles of oxygen. Right?
5:56
Literally, if you multiply this times four you get 4.08.
5:59
So the ratio of hydrogen to sulfur to oxygen
6:08
is for every one sulfur,
6:11
we have two hydrogens and we have four oxygens.
6:15
So the empirical formula of this is H2.
6:25
And then we have one sulfur.
6:28
And then we have four oxygens.
6:30
And this is sulfuric acid, one of the things
6:33
you would least like poured
6:35
on you most of the time.
6:37
Anyway, hope you found that useful.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,sXOIIEZh6qg,
khan_video_E1P79uFLCMc_20,Why would the Cyanobacteria produce oxygen that killed its own kind which it was derived from?,Essay,"•
0:00
We left off in the last video in the Archean Eon.
0:03
And ""arche"" comes from ancient Greek.
0:05
It means beginning or origin.
0:08
And it's the eon in which either life first started to exist
0:11
or at least it first start to somewhat flourish.
0:13
It's possible that maybe life first
0:16
started to exist at the end of the Hadeon Eon.
0:18
And, of course, this boundary is vague.
0:20
And the Archean Eon is also the first eon
0:23
where we still have rocks from that time.
0:26
So we are able to find rocks that we can date
0:28
to be roughly 3.8 billion years.
0:31
Now, the other really interesting thing
0:33
that happened in the Archean Eon,
0:34
and it really has pretty profound effects
0:37
once we get into the Proterozoic Eon,
0:40
is that you started to have cyanobacteria produce oxygen.
0:45
And we said in the last video that they were producing
0:48
oxygen, but most of that oxygen was
0:50
being absorbed by iron in the oceans.
0:53
But what happens is we enter into the Proterozoic Eon.
0:57
And Proterozoic Eon, it's right over here.
0:59
I don't know if you can see it .
1:01
I'll rewrite it, Proterozoic.
1:06
We're now in the Proterozoic Eon that
1:11
starts up about 2.5 billion years ago.
1:15
And ""proterozoic"" comes from the Greek for earlier life.
1:22
And I'm not a Greek scholar.
1:23
So any of you Greeks out there, forgive me
1:26
if I'm not getting the translation exactly right.
1:28
But what's really interesting about the Proterozoic Eon
1:33
is that that oxygen that was being produced
1:35
by the cyanobactera, and at some point
1:38
begins to saturate the iron and any other molecule that
1:42
could have absorbed it before.
1:43
And once it saturates, it starts to get
1:46
released into the atmosphere.
1:49
So the oxygen starts to get released
1:51
and accumulate in the atmosphere.
1:52
And we think this started to happen
1:55
about 2.4 billion years ago.
1:58
So 2.4 billion years ago, oxygen begins
2:02
to accumulate in the atmosphere.
2:03
And, of course, these dates, they
2:05
might be moved around a few hundred million years
2:08
as we get more and more data.
2:09
But this is the current understanding
2:11
of when things happened.
2:13
And maybe we'll look at the geological record,
2:15
or the fossil record, and we'll move these things around
2:17
in the future.
2:18
I can only imagine that 50 years from now,
2:19
or 100 years from now, if someone is still
2:21
watching this video, a lot of this
2:23
might say, hey, we found out later
2:24
that oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere
2:27
earlier or later or that eukaryotes
2:29
occurred earlier or later.
2:30
But this, as far as I can tell, is
2:31
our best current understanding.
2:33
But the 2.4 billion years ago, oxygen
2:39
begins to accumulate in the atmosphere.
2:45
And what's interesting about this is once it accumulates
2:49
and once it gets kind of a critical amount of oxygen
2:52
in the atmosphere-- and I touched
2:54
on this in the last video-- about 2.3 billion years ago,
2:57
we have something called the Great Oxygenation Event,
3:01
sometimes called the Oxygen Catastrophe.
3:05
And this is right here.
3:06
They marked it this right here, 2.3 billion years ago
3:09
or 2,300 million years ago, atmosphere becomes oxygen rich.
3:13
And it's not as oxygen rich as our current atmosphere.
3:17
But it becomes oxygen rich enough
3:20
that at least the environment becomes
3:22
suitable for eurkaryotic organisms or eukaryotic cells.
3:27
Now the other interesting thing, and we might not
3:29
care so much about it because we needed the oxygen,
3:31
is that we think that this was actually
3:33
the greatest extinction event in the history of Earth.
3:37
That's why it's called the Oxygen Catastrophe.
3:40
So this right over here, 2.3 billion years ago-- I
3:42
shouldn't giggle about it-- this is a serious matter.
3:45
This is the greatest extinction event in Earth's history,
3:55
in History.
3:56
And I'll do history with a capital H,
3:59
in the history of the Earth.
4:01
And that's because the cyanobacteria
4:03
is producing all this oxygen.
4:05
It eventually saturates the iron.
4:07
It accumulates in the air.
4:08
Once it gets to enough concentration,
4:10
it begins to actually suffocate.
4:11
It's poisonous.
4:12
It's poisonous to most of the other organisms
4:16
on the planet that were anaerobic,
4:18
that did not need oxygen, that actually
4:22
found oxygen poisonous.
4:24
But since we have oxygen, there's
4:26
two interesting things that happened once that oxygen
4:29
accumulated, other than causing this mass extinction
4:32
event-- actually three interesting things.
4:33
Two of them are crucial to us eventually
4:38
showing up on this planet.
4:40
The first is is that it became suitable now for eukaryotes
4:44
to exist.
4:45
Eukaryotic organisms, remember, these
4:46
are organisms that have nuclear membranes around their DNA.
4:51
Most eukaryotes have other organelles, like mitochondria.
4:55
They need oxygen.
5:02
You can go to the biology playlist.
5:04
We actually talk about respiration
5:05
that occurs in the mitochondria.
5:07
And that's obviously a process that needs oxygen.
5:11
So one, we have, now that oxygen is in the atmosphere,
5:13
we're starting to have an environment where
5:15
eukaryotes could at least exist.
5:17
And based on the fossil records, and when
5:19
we look at how the DNA has changed over time--
5:22
and we'll do multiple videos of that-- we
5:25
think that the first eukaryotes showed up
5:27
about 2.2 billion years ago.
5:30
Although there's some debate here.
5:31
There's some evidence it might have been a little earlier,
5:33
some evidence it might have a little later.
5:35
I'm sure that number will be refined.
5:37
But give or take a few hundred millions
5:40
of years, one prokaryote got engulfed by another prokaryote,
5:45
and said, hey, we do pretty well living together.
5:47
I mean the current theory is that mitochondria is actually
5:55
descended from kind of an ancient prokaryotic cell,
5:58
an ancient bacteria.
5:59
It actually has its own DNA.
6:02
And actually, your mitochondrial DNA
6:04
is passed down from your mother, and your mother's mother,
6:06
and your mother's mother, so on and so forth.
6:08
So it's kind of like another little animal
6:10
living inside of a larger cell.
6:12
And we are eukaryotes.
6:13
We needed this to happen.
6:16
The human body, we're not just one eukaryotic cell.
6:18
We're made up of trillions.
6:19
The estimates are 50 to 100 trillion eukaryotic cells.
6:24
So these are our ancestors that had
6:27
to come into being at that time.
6:30
And once again, all of this is happening inside of the oceans.
6:34
Now, the other interesting thing that happened--
6:36
remember, we're being bombarded with UV radiation from the Sun.
6:40
So if you're on the land-- let me draw the land and the ocean.
6:45
So here is the ocean and then here is the land.
6:51
Here is the land, right over there in yellow, constantly
6:55
being bombarded with UV radiation.
6:58
And ""UV"" stands for ultraviolet.
6:59
So I'm drawing it in purple.
7:00
But it's even more violet than purple.
7:03
So it's constantly being bombarded
7:05
by with ultraviolet radiation from the Sun,
7:08
which is very inhospitable to DNA and to life.
7:12
And so the only life at this point
7:14
could occur in the ocean, where it was protected
7:16
to some degree from the ultraviolet radiation.
7:20
The land was just open to it.
7:22
Anything on the land would have just gotten irradiated.
7:24
It's DNA would get mutated.
7:25
It just would not be able to live.
7:28
So what happened, and what I guess has to happen,
7:31
and the reason why we are able to live on land
7:33
now is that we have an ozone layer.
7:36
We have an ozone layer up in the upper atmosphere
7:40
that helps absorb, that blocks most of the UV radiation
7:46
from the Sun.
7:47
And now that oxygen began to accumulate,
7:50
we have the Oxygen Catastrophe.
7:51
Oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere.
7:54
Some of that oxygen goes into the upper atmosphere.
7:57
So we're now in this time period right over here.
7:59
It goes into the upper atmosphere.
8:01
It actually really reacts with the UV light
8:03
to turn into ozone, which then can help actually
8:07
block the UV light.
8:08
And I'll do another video maybe on the ozone/oxygen cycle.
8:13
So this oxygen production, it's crucial,
8:16
one, to having an ozone layer so that eventually life
8:19
can exist on the land.
8:21
And it's also crucial because eukaryotic organisms
8:24
need that oxygen.
8:25
Now, the third thing that happened,
8:27
and this is also pretty significant event,
8:30
we believe that that oxygen that started
8:33
to accumulate in the atmosphere, reacted with methane
8:36
in the atmosphere.
8:37
So it reacted with methane.
8:39
And methane is an ozone-- not an ozone.
8:43
It's a greenhouse gas.
8:45
It helps retain heat in the atmosphere.
8:47
And once it reacts with the oxygen
8:49
and starts dropping out of the atmosphere as methane,
8:52
we believe the Earth cooled down.
8:54
And it entered its first, and some people
8:56
believe it's longest, snowball period.
8:59
So that's what they talk about right here
9:01
on this diagram, the first snowball Earth.
9:06
It's sometimes called the Huronic glaciation.
9:08
And that happened because we weren't
9:10
able to retain our heat, if that theory is correct.
9:13
And so the whole-- as the theory goes-- the whole Earth
9:16
essentially just iced over.
9:20
So as we go through the Proterozoic Eon,
9:24
I guess the big markers of it is it's the first time that we now
9:28
have an oxygen-rich atmosphere.
9:30
It's the first time that eukaryotes can now
9:34
come into existence because they now
9:36
have oxygen to, I guess we could say, breathe.
9:39
And the other big thing is now this is where the ozone forms.
9:43
So this kind of sets the stage for in the next eon,
9:46
for animals or living things, to eventually get on to the land.
9:52
And we'll talk about that in the next video.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,E1P79uFLCMc,

- [Voiceover] Hello, my name is Jennifer Riley,
0:02
and I'm a cognitive scientist who studies
0:04
text comprehension and reasoning.
0:07
The goal of this video is to help you
0:08
better understand the new section of the MCAT,
0:11
called the critical analysis and reasoning skills section.
0:16
Its main purpose is to figure out how well
0:18
you can understand and reason about the things you read.
0:22
In this part of the test, you'll read nine passages.
0:26
Each one is about 500 to 600 words long,
0:29
and you'll usually be asked between
0:30
five to seven questions about each passage.
0:34
In total, you'll go through 53 questions in 90 minutes.
0:37
That means you have about 10 minutes per passage,
0:40
on average.
0:43
In terms of the topics that you'll be reading about,
0:45
approximately half of these passages
0:46
will come from the humanities,
0:49
such as literature, philosophy or ethics.
0:52
The other half will come from social sciences,
0:55
such as psychology, sociology or economics.
0:59
For example, one of the passages
1:01
that's in the Khan Academy MCAT collection
1:04
discusses how people negotiate deals with one another,
1:07
and when they believe they are getting a fair deal.
1:10
Another passage is about how computers,
1:12
rather than just being tools used by humans,
1:15
might actually be changing the way that humans think.
1:18
The passages come from a lot of different areas,
1:20
and are meant to stretch your mind a bit.
1:23
You'll probably find that the topics
1:24
of these passages will be unfamiliar.
1:26
You're not expected to already
1:28
know about any of these topics.
1:30
Sometimes the writing styles will be complicated.
1:33
Some words may be new to you,
1:34
and some passages may be tough to understand.
1:37
Just remember, everything that you need to know
1:39
to answer the questions will be in the passages.
1:43
You're not expected to know any background information.
1:45
In fact, to do well, you really need to just focus on
1:49
the passage, and not information that you already know
1:52
from elsewhere.
1:53
There are three types of questions you'll be asked
1:55
to answer in this section.
1:58
The first type is called foundations of comprehension.
2:01
These questions mainly ask you to answer
2:03
questions about the author's intended message.
2:07
They'll ask you about the overall idea,
2:10
or about why the author used specific words or phrases,
2:14
or why the author organized the passage in a specific way.
2:18
The second category is called reasoning within the text,
2:22
and these questions mainly ask you to think
2:24
about the reasoning within an author's argument,
2:27
such as, what claim is an author trying to support
2:31
with a piece of evidence?
2:32
Or, is an argument flawed?
2:35
The third category is called reasoning beyond the text.
2:38
Questions in this category ask you to apply
2:41
ideas from the passage to new situations,
2:43
or to think about how the author's main message
2:47
would change if there were new information to consider.
2:50
This new information will be given to you in the question.
2:54
About a third of the questions will come from each category.
2:57
You should expect about 30%
2:59
foundations of comprehension questions,
3:01
30% reasoning within the text questions,
3:05
and 40% reasoning beyond the text questions.
3:09
People often wonder how the skills that are tested
3:12
by the critical analysis and reasoning skills section
3:15
will ever be useful for a future physician.
3:18
These questions are on the MCAT
3:20
because doctors need to be able to reason
3:22
through a lot of clinical information.
3:25
For example, these skills are needed
3:27
when you need to analyze information
3:29
to come up with a treatment plan that makes sense
3:31
for a patient, and also so that you can explain
3:34
your reasoning to others, including the patient,
3:37
family members, or other members of your medical team.
3:41
For more information on this section of the test,
3:44
and on each of the question types,
3:45
be sure to see the other videos in this section,
3:48
which I hope will help you, too.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,4dKtWI0rROA,

khan_video_ShzPtU7IOXs_186,We know the latter is untrue because science studies the variables but was there a study for the law of demand?,Essay,"•
0:00
In this video, we're going to talk about the law of demand,
0:04
which is one of the core ideas of microeconomics.
0:07
And lucky for us, it's a fairly intuitive idea.
0:10
It just tells us that if we raise the price of a product,
0:16
that will lower the quantity demanded for the product.
0:20
Quantity demanded will go down.
0:23
And you could imagine the other side of that.
0:25
If we lower the price of a product,
0:30
that will raise the quantity demanded of that product.
0:36
And the law of demand says this just kind of generally.
0:39
What we'll see in a few videos from now
0:41
is that there are some exceptions to this.
0:44
But to make this little concrete,
0:46
let's think about the demand for a certain product.
0:49
And one thing I want to clear here,
0:51
and I'm going to go through great pains
0:53
to not mess this up, is that when
0:55
we talk about the word demand in a formal economic sense,
0:59
we're not talking about a quantity.
1:01
We're actually going to talk, all
1:02
else equal, ceteris paribus, the relationship
1:07
between price and quantity demanded.
1:10
If we talk about an actual quantity,
1:11
we should say the quantity demanded.
1:13
So demand versus quantity demanded.
1:17
These are two different things.
1:19
And if it's a little confusing to you
1:21
right now, hopefully by the end of this video,
1:23
the difference between demand and quantity
1:25
demanded will become a little bit clearer.
1:27
And definitely over the next few videos, because in this video,
1:30
we're going to focus on how the quantity demanded changes
1:33
relative to the price.
1:34
In future videos, we'll talk about how
1:36
the entire relationship, how demand changes
1:39
based on different factors.
1:41
But to make things concrete, let's
1:42
say I'm about to release my science fiction
1:47
book, Space Whatever.
1:48
I don't know, the book that I want to release.
1:50
So I'm going to release some ebook.
1:54
And we've done some market study,
1:56
or we just know how the demand is related to price
2:00
or the price is related to demand.
2:02
And we're going to show that in a demand schedule, which
2:06
is really just a table that just shows how the price-- and,
2:12
actually I just made my first mistake.
2:14
I just said how price relates to demand.
2:17
I should say how price relates to quantity demanded
2:20
and how quantity demanded relates to price.
2:23
So demand schedule, it shows a relationship between price
2:27
and quantity demanded, all else equal.
2:32
So we're going to have multiple scenarios here.
2:36
So this column, let me do my scenarios.
2:38
In this column, let me put my price.
2:41
In this column, I put my quantity demanded.
2:50
So scenario, let's call this scenario A.
2:54
I could price my book at $2.
2:59
And I'll get a ton of people downloading it at that price.
3:02
So I will get 60,000 people download my book
3:07
at that price, my ebook.
3:09
Scenario B, I could raise the price by $2.
3:12
So it's now $4.
3:14
And that kills off a lot of the demand.
3:17
Now the quantity demanded goes down
3:18
to 40,000 people downloading it.
3:21
Then I can go to scenario C, if I raise it by another $2.
3:24
So now I'm at $6.
3:26
Now that lowers the quantity demanded to 30,000.
3:32
I'll do a couple more of these.
3:33
Scenario D, I raise another $2.
3:37
So I get to $8 now.
3:39
Now the quantity demanded goes down to 25,000.
3:43
And I'll do one more of these.
3:46
Let me see, what color have I not used yet.
3:48
I haven't used yellow yet.
3:49
Scenario E, if I raise it to $10,
3:53
now the quantity demanded, let's just say, is 23,000.
3:59
So this relationship shows the law of demand right over here.
4:05
And this table that shows how the quantity demanded
4:07
relates to price and vice versa, this
4:09
is what we call a demand schedule.
4:11
Now we can also, based on this demand schedule,
4:14
draw a demand curve.
4:15
And really, we're just going to plot these points
4:17
and draw the curve the connects them.
4:20
Because these aren't the only scenarios.
4:23
Anything in between is possible.
4:24
We could charge $2.01 for the book.
4:26
We could charge for $4.50 for the book.
4:28
And so that's what the demand curve captures a little bit
4:30
better, because it's a continuous curve, not just
4:32
five points.
4:34
So let's do that.
4:35
Let's graph it.
4:37
And this is one of those conventions of economics
4:39
that I am not a fan of.
4:40
Because people often talk about changing the price,
4:45
and how the quantity demanded changes from that.
4:48
And in traditional-- in most of math and science, the thing
4:51
that you're changing, you normally
4:52
put on the horizontal axis.
4:54
So if I was in charge of the convention of economics,
4:58
I would plot price on the horizontal axis
5:01
right over here.
5:02
But the way it's done typically is
5:04
that price is done on the vertical axis.
5:06
And so you're used to seeing it in kind of a traditional class
5:08
environment.
5:09
I'll do the same.
5:10
So we'll put price in the vertical axis,
5:13
and we'll put quantity demanded in the horizontal axis.
5:21
And our quantity demanded goes all the up to 60,000.
5:23
So let's see, that's 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.
5:29
So that's 10-- this is in thousands-- 20, 30, 40-- sorry,
5:34
not 45-- 40, 50, and 60.
5:38
And this is in thousands.
5:41
And then the price goes up to $10, from $2 to $10.
5:45
So let's say this is 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.
5:55
So let's plot the scenarios.
5:57
So scenario A, price is $2, 60,000 units are demanded.
6:02
That is scenario A right over there.
6:05
Scenario B, when the price is $4, 40,000 units are demanded.
6:13
And that's right over there.
6:14
That's scenario B.
6:16
Scenario C, $6, 30,000 units.
6:22
Right over there, scenario C. Scenario D, $8, 25,000 units.
6:29
$8, 25 is right about there.
6:32
That looks like 25,000, right in between.
6:34
That's close enough.
6:36
So that right over there is scenario D.
6:39
And then finally scenario E, $10, 23,000 units.
6:46
So it might be something like that.
6:48
That is scenario E.
6:50
And so we could actually have prices
6:52
anywhere in between that.
6:53
And maybe we could even go further.
6:55
So this right over here.
6:56
So if I were to draw the demand curve,
6:58
it could look something like this.
7:00
The demand curve would look something--
7:03
I'm trying to do my best to draw it
7:04
as a straight continuous line-- could look something like that.
7:08
And it could keep going on and on.
7:11
And so these are two ways to show demand.
7:13
So just going back to what I said earlier,
7:16
the quantity demanded is, all else
7:17
equal for a given price, how many units people are
7:22
willing to download or buy of my ebook.
7:25
When we talk about the demand itself,
7:30
we're talking about this entire relationship.
7:33
So this demand itself is this entire demand schedule.
7:36
Or another way to think of it is this entire demand curve.
7:39
If demand were to change, we would actually
7:43
have a different curve.
7:44
This curve would shift, or the entries in this table
7:48
would shift.
7:49
If the quantity of demand changes--
7:51
so we move along this curve when you hold everything else equal
7:55
and you only change price.
7:57
So hopefully that makes it clear.
7:58
When everything else is equal, and you're only changing price,
8:02
you're not changing demand, you're
8:04
changing the quantity demanded.
8:05
The demand, because everything else is equal,
8:07
is this relationship.
8:09
In the next few videos, we'll think
8:10
about what does happen when you do
8:12
change some of those other factors.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,ShzPtU7IOXs,

Hello.
0:19
My name is Bill Harrington and I'm
0:21
a graduate student at the Massachusetts
0:22
Institute of Technology.
0:24
We're in the Course Six Modern Optics Project Laboratory,
0:27
and this is Young's Double Slit Experiment,
0:28
an important experiment from around 1800.
0:32
We have a laser shining light onto a pair of identical slits.
0:35
These are rectangular openings in a transparency.
0:39
After shining through slits, light propagates some distance
0:41
to a screen where we can observe the resulting pattern.
0:44
We have a webcam set up so you can see
0:46
what's happening on the screen.
0:48
Right now, we have blocked one of the two slits.
0:50
So light is propagating through a single slit,
0:53
and this is the pattern that results.
0:56
Let's see what happens when we open the second slit.
1:01
The pattern changes significantly.
1:03
You should be asking yourself why has the pattern changed
1:06
and why is this experiment important?
1:08
The answers to those two questions are related.
1:11
To understand why this experiment is important
1:13
and what we are observing, you have
1:15
to go back to the days of Sir Isaac Newton.
1:18
At that time, people were debating
1:19
the basic nature of light.
1:21
One group of people held that light
1:23
was a particle traveling like a projectile from a source
1:26
to an observer.
1:28
Another group of people held that light propagate more
1:30
like a wave, sort of like the waves
1:32
you see moving along the surface of the body of water.
1:35
Based on his own experiments and extensive observations,
1:38
Sir Isaac Newton decided that light was most like a particle.
1:42
Newton was quite brilliant in advanced science
1:44
in a number of fields.
1:45
So for many people, because Newton says so,
1:48
was solid evidence that light was a particle,
1:50
and Newton's corpuscular theory of light was widely accepted.
1:55
About seven years after Newton's death,
1:57
another scientist, Thomas Young, was working with light
2:00
and he came to believe that light behaved like a wave.
2:03
Young's double slit experiment attempts
2:05
to address the nature of light by looking
2:07
at what happens when light passes through a pair of slits.
2:10
If light behaved like a particle,
2:12
for the double slit experiment, we
2:14
would expect to see two overlapping copies
2:16
of the single slit pattern.
2:18
This did not match our own observation.
2:21
On the other hand, if light behaves like a wave,
2:23
we expect to see the two waves interfere,
2:26
adding together in some directions
2:28
and canceling each other in others.
2:30
If we make some assumptions about how light propagates,
2:33
we can predict that the intensity
2:34
pattern on a screen placed far from the slits
2:37
will be a proportional product of a sinc-squared term
2:40
due to the width of a single slit,
2:42
and a cosine-squared term due do the separation
2:44
of the two slits.
2:46
This is an excellent match for what we observe in lab,
2:48
and is good evidence that light behaves like a wave.
2:51
So the pattern that we observed was
2:53
due to the interference of light that passed through one slit
2:55
with light that was passing through the other slit,
2:57
and it looks as though light is propagating as a wave.
3:00
Does that mean that we could shine any light
3:02
through this system and expect to see an interference pattern?
3:04
For instance, can we shine the light from this flashlight
3:06
through the double slit and see an interference pattern?
3:09
It turns out the answer is no and it's
3:10
a problem of spatial coherence, which
3:12
is the ability of light from one point on a wave front
3:15
to interfere with light from another point on the wave
3:17
front.
3:18
This laser has a lot of spatial coherence,
3:20
but a flashlight and most other sources have very little.
3:23
So how did Thomas Young do his experiment?
3:25
After all, they didn't have lasers in the 1800s.
3:28
Well, it turns out it is possible to get
3:30
these interference patterns to form even when
3:32
using a source normally considered incoherent,
3:34
it just takes a little planning and some more work.
3:38
Thomas Young recognized that not just any light
3:40
could be used to see interference effects.
3:42
In this quote from his lecture on the nature of light
3:45
and colors, he lays out the conditions
3:47
on the interfering portions of light
3:49
as deriving from the same origin,
3:51
arriving at the same point in different paths,
3:54
and traveling in similar directions.
3:57
This suggests two possible approaches to the experiment.
4:00
One approach is to mask your source down to a point.
4:03
This is probably the technique that Young
4:05
used as he mentions using a pinhole and a shuttered window
4:08
in his other publications.
4:10
It has the advantage of being simple with the disadvantage
4:13
of wasting much of the source light.
4:16
Another approach is to simply place a source
4:18
far away from double slits.
4:20
This approach allows astronomers to perform
4:22
stellar interferometry experiments,
4:24
and will allow you to view interference patterns
4:26
using street lights at night as a light source.
4:30
A double pinhole system is quite easy to construct at home,
4:33
and can produce striking interference patterns
4:35
using street lights as a light source.
4:38
To build the system, you'll need a piece of pipe, some cardboard
4:42
to block most of one end of the pipe,
4:44
and the pair of pinholes in a piece of opaque material.
4:47
For my system, I used a piece of stainless steel shim stock,
4:50
but good results can be had with the material from a soda can.
4:54
To make the pinholes, the basic technique
4:56
is to dimple the material with a pen,
4:58
and then sand away the protruding material
5:00
on the other side until you have two nice pinholes.
5:03
More detailed instructions can be
5:05
found online from the do-it-yourself pinhole camera
5:07
crowd.
5:09
Keep in mind that you want your pinholes
5:10
to be small and close together.
5:12
Aim for 1/4 to 1/2 millimeter separation
5:15
and a similar pinhole diameter.
5:17
Smaller would be better.
5:20
The assembly of the system is straightforward.
5:22
Start by mounting the panels to the cardboard so the hole's
5:25
unobstructed, then mount the cardboard in the tube,
5:28
and finally, tape everything together.
5:30
One trick that I found helpful was
5:32
to use aluminum foil to make the joint between the cardboard
5:35
and the tube light tight.
5:36
To use the system, stand somewhere safe,
5:40
hold the open end of the tube close to one eye,
5:42
and look at a street light or stoplight
5:44
at least 10 to 20 meters away.
5:47
This is a picture I took of a car
5:48
at a stoplight using the double pinhole
5:50
system pictured earlier.
5:52
Notice the strong dark bands in the stoplights and the car
5:55
headlights.
5:56
The pattern is even more impressive in person.
5:59
Warning-- do not use this system to observe
6:02
laser light or the sun.
6:03
You may damage your eyesight.
6:06
OK, so the experiment shows interference
6:07
and we can even build one of these widgets
6:09
if we want to see it for ourselves at home.
6:12
But does light always behave like a wave?
6:14
What about Einstein and photons?
6:16
We know that at least in some circumstances,
6:18
light has to behave like a particle.
6:20
Well, it turns out something interesting
6:22
would happen if you did this experiment one
6:24
photon at a time.
6:25
We don't have the equipment to do it for you,
6:27
but we can show you a simulation of what you would see.
6:30
Right now, you are watching an animation
6:32
showing what we would expect to see
6:34
if we could do the double slit experiment with only
6:36
a small number of photons in a system at a time.
6:39
The top half of the screen showing the photon impacts
6:41
at each stage, and the bottom half
6:43
is showing the accumulated pattern
6:45
that we would get if we were exposing
6:46
the photographic plate.
6:48
For this animation, we are also assuming very narrow and very
6:51
short slits.
6:52
So the expected pattern is a cosine-squared variation
6:55
in the horizontal direction, and uniform
6:57
in the vertical direction.
6:59
This animation is based on the results
7:01
of two historic double slit experiments--
7:03
a 1909 experiment which used very low, but not quite single
7:06
photon levels of light, and a 1973 experiment showing
7:11
double slit interference in a system launching
7:13
single electrons.
7:15
While we wait for the pattern to finish building,
7:17

7:19

In the last video, we had a large cloud
0:03
of hydrogen atoms eventually condensing
0:06
into a high pressure, high mass, I guess you could say,
0:11
ball of hydrogen atoms.
0:13
And when the pressure and the temperature
0:16
got high enough-- and so this is what we saw the last video--
0:19
when the pressure and temperature got high enough,
0:22
we were able to get the hydrogen protons,
0:25
the hydrogen nucleuses close enough
0:27
to each other, or hydrogen nuclei
0:29
close enough to each other, for the strong force to take over
0:32
and fusion to happen and release energy.
0:35
And then that real energy begins to offset
0:40
the actual gravitational force.
0:43
So the whole star-- what's now a star--
0:45
does not collapse on itself.
0:47
And once we're there, we're now in the main sequence of a star.
0:50
What I want to do in this video is
0:51
to take off from that starting point
0:53
and think about what happens in the star next.
0:56
So in the main sequence, we have the core of the star.
0:59
So this is the core-- star's core.
1:02
And you have hydrogen fusing into helium.
1:11
And it's releasing just a ton of energy.
1:18
And that energy is what keeps the core from imploding.
1:21
It's kind of the outward force to offset
1:23
the gravitational force that wants to implode everything,
1:26
that wants to crush everything.
1:28
And so you have the core of a star, a star like the sun,
1:31
and that energy then heats up all of the other gas
1:34
on the outside of the core to create that really bright
1:38
object that we see as a star, or in our case, in our sun's case,
1:43
the sun.
1:44
Now, as the hydrogen is fusing into helium,
1:47
you could imagine that more and more helium
1:49
is forming in the core.
1:51
So I'll do the helium as green.
1:53
So more, more, and more helium forms in the core.
1:57
It'll especially form-- the closer you get to the center,
2:00
the higher the pressures will be,
2:01
and the faster that this fusion, this ignition, will happen.
2:05
In fact, the bigger the mass of the star,
2:07
the more the pressure, the faster the fusion occurs.
2:11
And so you have this helium building up inside of the core
2:16
as this hydrogen in the core gets fused.
2:19
Now what's going to happen there?
2:20
Helium is a more dense atom.
2:24
It's packing more mass in a smaller space.
2:27
So as more and more of this hydrogen
2:29
here turns into helium, what you're
2:31
going to have is the core itself is going to shrink.
2:39
So let me draw a smaller core here.
2:43
So the core itself is going to shrink.
2:47
And now it has a lot more helium in it.
2:54
And let's just take it to the extreme point
2:56
where it's all helium, where it's depleted.
2:58
But it's much denser.
3:00
That same amount of mass that was in this sphere
3:03
is now in a denser sphere, in a helium sphere.
3:06
So it's going to have just as much attraction to it,
3:08
gravitational attraction.
3:10
But things can get even closer to it.
3:12
And we know that the closer you are to a mass,
3:16
the stronger the pull of gravity.
3:18
So then instead of having just the hydrogen fusion occurring
3:25
at the core, you're now going to have
3:27
hydrogen fusion in a shell around the core.
3:33
So now you're going to have hydrogen fusing
3:38
in a shell around the core.
3:44
Let me just be clear.
3:45
This isn't just happens all of a sudden.
3:46
It is a gradual process.
3:48
As we have more and more helium in the core,
3:51
the core gets denser and denser and denser.
3:54
And so the pressures become even larger and larger near the core
3:59
because you're able to get closer to a more massive core
4:04
since it is now more dense.
4:05
And as that pressure near the core
4:08
increases even more and more, the fusion reaction
4:10
happens faster and faster and faster
4:13
until you get to this point.
4:14
So here, let me be clear.
4:16
You have a helium core.
4:17
All of the hydrogen in the core has been used up.
4:21
And then you have the hydrogen right outside
4:23
of the core is now under enormous pressure.
4:25
It's actually under more pressure
4:26
than it was when it was just a pure hydrogen core.
4:29
Because it's-- there's so much mass on the outside here,
4:36
trying to, I guess you could say, exerting downwards,
4:39
or gravitational force trying to get to that even denser helium
4:46
core because everything is able to get closer in.
4:48
And so now you have fusion occurring even faster.
4:55
And it's occurring over a larger radius.
5:00
So this faster fusion over a larger radius,
5:05
the force is now going to expel-- the energy that's
5:07
released from this fusion is now going
5:09
to expel these outer layers of the star even further.
5:14
So the whole time, this gradual process
5:16
as the hydrogen turns into helium, or fuses
5:19
into helium in the core, the hydrogen right
5:21
outside of the core, right outside that area,
5:24
starts to burn faster and faster.
5:27
I shouldn't say burn.
5:28
It starts to fuse faster and faster
5:30
and over a larger and larger radius.
5:34
The unintuitive thing is the fusion
5:36
is happening faster over a larger radius.
5:38
And the reason that is is because you have even a denser
5:40
core that is causing even more gravitational pressure.
5:44
And as that's happening, the star's getting brighter.
5:47
And it's also-- the fusion reactions, since they're
5:50
happening in a more intense way and over a larger radius,
5:54
are able to expel the material of the star even larger.
5:59
So the radius of the star itself is
6:01
getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
6:04
So if this star looked like this-- maybe
6:07
let me draw it in white-- That's not white.
6:16
Now what's happening to my color changer?
6:18
There you go.
6:19
OK, this star looked like this right over here.
6:25
Now, this star over here, since a faster fusion reaction
6:29
is happening over a larger radius,
6:30
is going to be far larger.
6:32
And I'm not even drawing it to scale.
6:34
In the case of our sun, when it gets to this point,
6:36
it's going to be 100 times the diameter.
6:39
And at this point, it is a red giant.
6:44
And the reason why it's redder than this one over here
6:47
is that even though the fusion is happening more furiously,
6:51
that energy is being dissipated over a larger surface area.
6:55
So the actual surface temperature of the red giant,
7:00
at this point, is actually going to be cooler.
7:04
So it's going to emit a light at a larger wavelength, a redder
7:10
wavelength than this thing over here.
7:12
This thing, the core, was not burning as furiously
7:15
as this thing over here.
7:17
But that energy was being dissipated
7:19
over a smaller volume.
7:21
So this has a higher surface temperature.
7:28
This over here, the core is burning more-- sorry,
7:31
the core is no longer burning.
7:32
The core is now helium that's not burning.
7:35
It's getting denser and denser as the helium packs in
7:39
on itself.
7:40
But the hydrogen fusion over here
7:41
is occurring more intensely.
7:43
It's occurring in a hotter way.
7:45
But the surface here is less hot because it's just
7:49
a larger surface area.
7:50
So it doesn't make-- the increased heat
7:52
is more than mitigated by how large the star has become.
7:56
Now, this is going to keep happening.
7:58
And this core is keep-- the pressures
8:00
keep intensifying because more and more helium is getting
8:03
produced.
8:03
And this core keeps collapsing.
8:07
And the temperature here keeps going up.
8:13
So we said that the first ignition, the first fusion,
8:15
occurs at around 10 million Kelvin.
8:20
This thing will keep heating up until it
8:22
gets to 100 million Kelvin.
8:24
And now I'm talking about a star that's
8:26
about as massive as the sun.
8:27
Some stars will never even be massive enough
8:29
to condense the core so that its temperature reaches
8:33
100 million.
8:33
But let's just talk about the case in which it does.
8:36
So eventually, you'll get to a point--
8:38
so we're still sitting in the red giant phase,
8:40
so we're this huge star over here.
8:45
We have this helium core.
8:46
And that helium core keeps getting
8:48
condensed and condensed and condensed.
8:50
And then we have a shell of hydrogen
8:53
that keeps fusing into helium around it.
8:56
So this is our hydrogen shell.
8:59
Hydrogen fusion is occurring in this yellow shell over here
9:02
that's expelling, that's allowed--
9:04
that's causing the radius of the star to get bigger and bigger,
9:09
to expand.
9:11
But when the temperature get sufficiently hot--
9:13
and now I think you're going to get a sense of how
9:15
heavier and heavier elements form in the universe, and all
9:18
of the heavy elements that you see around us, including
9:20
the ones that are in you, were formed
9:22
it this way from, initially, hydrogen--
9:26
when it gets hot enough at 100 million Kelvin, in this core,
9:32
because of such enormous pressures, then the helium
9:36
itself will start to fuse.
9:38
So then we're going to have a core in here
9:41
where the helium itself will start to fuse.
9:47
And now we're talking about a situation.
9:49
You have helium, and you had hydrogen.
9:51
And all sorts of combinations will form.
9:53
But in general, the helium is mainly
9:55
going to fuse into carbon and oxygen.
9:58
And it'll form into other things.
10:00
And it becomes much more complicated.
10:01
But I don't want to go into all of the details.
10:04
But let me just show you a periodic table.
10:06
I didn't have this in the last one.
10:07
I had somehow lost it.
10:09
But we see hydrogen here has one proton.
10:11
It actually has no neutrons.
10:13
It was getting fused in the main sequence
10:15
into helium, two protons, two neutrons.
10:18
You need four of these to get one of those.
10:20
Because this actually has an atomic mass of 4
10:23
if we're talking about helium-4.
10:24
And then the helium, once we get to 100 million Kelvin,
10:27
can start being fused.
10:28
If you get roughly three of them--
10:30
and there's all of these other things that
10:32
are coming and leaving the reactions--
10:33
you can get to a carbon.
10:35
You get four of them, four of them
10:37
at least as the starting raw material.
10:38
You get to an oxygen.
10:39
So we're starting to fuse heavier and heavier elements.
10:43
So what happens here is this helium
10:46
is fusing into carbon and oxygen.
10:48
So you start building a carbon and oxygen core.
10:51
So I'm going to leave you there.
10:53
I realize I'm already past my self-imposed limit of 10
10:56
minutes.
10:57
But what I want you to think about
10:58
is what is likely to happen.
10:59
What is likely to happen here if this star will never
11:02
have the mass to begin to fuse this carbon and oxygen?
11:06
If it does have the mass, if it is a super massive star,
11:10
it eventually will be able to raise even
11:12
this carbon and oxygen core to 600 million Kelvin
11:16
and begin to fuse that into even heavier elements.
11:18
But let's think about what's going
11:20
to happen for something like the sun, where it'll never
11:22
have the mass, it'll never have the pressure,
11:24
to start to fuse carbon and oxygen.

teded_What caused the French Revolution? - Tom Mullaney - 05:39_5,In what ways was the Third Estate prevented from having power before the revolution?,open-ended,"What rights do people have,
and where do they come from?
Who gets to make decisions for others
and on what authority?
And how can we organize society
to meet people's needs?
These questions challenged
an entire nation
during the upheaval
of the French Revolution.
By the end of the 18th century,
Europe had undergone a profound
intellectual and cultural shift
known as the Enlightenment.
Philosophers and artists promoted
reason and human freedom
over tradition and religion.
The rise of a middle class
and printed materials
encouraged political awareness,
and the American Revolution had turned
a former English colony
into an independent republic.
Yet France, one of the largest and richest
countries in Europe
was still governed by an ancient regime
of three rigid social classes
called Estates.
The monarch King Louis XVI
based his authority on divine right
and granted special privileges
to the First and Second Estates,
the Catholic clergy, and the nobles.
The Third Estate, middle class merchants
and craftsmen,
as well as over 20 million peasants,
had far less power
and they were the only ones
who paid taxes,
not just to the king,
but to the other Estates as well.
In bad harvest years,
taxation could leave peasants
with almost nothing
while the king and nobles lived lavishly
on their extracted wealth.
But as France sank into debt due to
its support of the American Revolution
and its long-running war with England,
change was needed.
King Louis appointed
finance minister Jacques Necker,
who pushed for tax reforms
and won public support by openly
publishing the government's finances.
But the king's advisors
strongly opposed these initiatives.
Desperate for a solution, the king called
a meeting of the Estates-General,
an assembly of representatives
from the Three Estates,
for the first time in 175 years.
Although the Third Estate represented
98% of the French population,
its vote was equal to each
of the other Estates.
And unsurprisingly, both of the upper
classes favored keeping their privileges.
Realizing they couldn't
get fair representation,
the Third Estate broke off,
declared themselves
the National Assembly,
and pledged to draft a new constitution
with or without the other Estates.
King Louis ordered the First
and Second Estates
to meet with the National Assembly,
but he also dismissed Necker,
his popular finance minister.
In response, thousands
of outraged Parisians
joined with sympathetic soldiers
to storm the Bastille prison,
a symbol of royal power
and a large storehouse of weapons.
The Revolution had begun.
As rebellion spread
throughout the country,
the feudal system was abolished.
The Assembly's Declaration
of the Rights of Man and Citizen
proclaimed a radical idea for the time --
that individual rights and freedoms
were fundamental to human nature
and government existed
only to protect them.
Their privileges gone,
many nobles fled abroad,
begging foreign rulers to invade France
and restore order.
And while Louis remained as the figurehead
of the constitutional monarchy,
he feared for his future.
In 1791, he tried to flee the country
but was caught.
The attempted escape shattered
people's faith in the king.
The royal family was arrested
and the king charged with treason.
After a trial,
the once-revered king
was publicly beheaded,
signaling the end of one thousand
years of monarchy
and finalizing the September 21st
declaration of the first French republic,
governed by the motto
""liberté, égalité, fraternité.""
Nine months later,
Queen Marie Antoinette,
a foreigner long-mocked
as ""Madame Déficit""
for her extravagant reputation,
was executed as well.
But the Revolution would not end there.
Some leaders, not content
with just changing the government,
sought to completely transform
French society --
its religion,
its street names,
even its calendar.
As multiple factions formed,
the extremist Jacobins
lead by Maximilien Robespierre
launched a Reign of Terror
to suppress the slightest dissent,
executing over 20,000 people
before the Jacobin's own downfall.
Meanwhile, France found itself
at war with neighboring monarchs
seeking to strangle the Revolution
before it spread.
Amidst the chaos, a general named
Napoleon Bonaparte took charge,
becoming Emperor as he claimed to defend
the Revolution's democratic values.
All in all, the Revolution
saw three constitutions
and five governments within ten years,
followed by decades
alternating between monarchy and revolt
before the next Republic formed in 1871.
And while we celebrate
the French Revolution's ideals,
we still struggle with many
of the same basic questions
raised over two centuries ago.",TED-Ed,Science,What caused the French Revolution? - Tom Mullaney - 05:39,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBn7iWzrKoI,data/teded/crawled_data/videos/What caused the French Revolution? - Tom Mullaney - 05:39,,
khan_video_30o4omX5qfo_24,"I know that 1/2mv^2 is derived from W = F D, but are there exections to the kinetic energy formula?",Essay,"•
0:01
In order to transfer energy to an object,
0:04
you've got to exert a force on that object.
0:06
The amount of energy transferred by a force
0:09
is called the work done by that force.
0:12
The formula to find the work done
0:14
by a particular force on an object
0:16
is W equals F d cosine theta.
0:20
W refers to the work done by the force F. In other words,
0:24
W is telling you the amount of energy
0:26
that the force F is giving to the object.
0:29
F refers to the size of the particular force doing
0:33
the work.
0:33
d is the displacement of the object, how far it moved
0:37
while the force was exerted on it.
0:39
And the theta and cosine theta refers
0:42
to the angle between the force doing
0:44
the work and the displacement of the object.
0:47
You might be wondering what this cosine theta is doing in here.
0:51
This cosine theta is in this formula
0:53
because the only part of the force that does work
0:56
is the component that lies along the direction
0:59
of the displacement.
1:01
The component of the force that lies perpendicular
1:04
to the direction of motion doesn't actually do any work.
1:08
We notice a few things about this formula.
1:10
The units for work are Newton's times meters,
1:13
which we called joules.
1:15
Joules are the same unit that we measure energy in,
1:18
which makes sense because work is telling you
1:20
the amount of joules given to or taken away
1:23
from an object or a system.
1:25
If the value of the work done comes out
1:27
to be positive for a particular force,
1:29
it means that that force is trying
1:31
to give the object energy.
1:33
The work done by a force will be positive
1:36
if that force or a component of that force
1:39
points in the same direction as the displacement.
1:42
And if the value of the work done comes out to be negative,
1:45
it means that that force is trying to take away energy
1:48
from the object.
1:49
The work done by a force will be negative
1:52
if that force or a component of that force
1:55
points in the opposite direction as the displacement.
1:57
If a force points in a direction that's
1:59
perpendicular to the displacement,
2:02
the work done by that force is 0,
2:04
which means it's neither giving nor taking away energy
2:07
from that object.
2:08
Another way that the work done by a force could be 0
2:12
is if the object doesn't move, since the displacement
2:15
would be 0.
2:16
So the force you exert by holding a very heavy weight
2:19
above your head does not do any work on the weight
2:22
since the weight is not moving.
2:24
So this formula represents the definition
2:26
of the work done by a particular force.
2:29
But what if we wanted to know the net work or total
2:32
work done on an object?
2:34
We could just find the individual amounts
2:36
of work done by each particular force and add them up.
2:39
But there's actually a trick to figuring out
2:42
the net work done on an object.
2:44
To keep things simple, let's assume that all the forces
2:47
already lie along the direction of the displacement.
2:50
That way we can get rid of the cosine theta term.
2:53
Since we're talking about the net work done on an object,
2:56
I'm going to replace F with the net force on that object.
3:00
Now, we know that the net force is always
3:02
equal to the mass times the acceleration.
3:05
So we replace F net with m times a.
3:08
So we find that the net work is equal to the mass
3:12
times the acceleration times the displacement.
3:15
I want to write this equation in terms of the velocities
3:18
and not the acceleration times the displacement.
3:21
So I'm going to ask you recall a 1-D kinematics
3:24
equation that looked like this.
3:26
The final velocity squared equals the initial velocity
3:29
squared plus 2 times the acceleration
3:32
times the displacement.
3:34
In order to use this kinematic formula,
3:36
we've got to assume that the acceleration is constant,
3:39
which means we're assuming that the net force on this object
3:42
is constant.
3:43
Even though it seems like we're making a lot of assumptions
3:45
here, getting rid of the cosine theta
3:47
and assuming the forces are constant,
3:50
none of those assumptions are actually
3:51
required to derive the result we're going to attain.
3:55
They just make this derivation a lot simpler.
3:57
So looking at this kinematic formula,
3:59
we see that it also has acceleration times
4:02
displacement.
4:03
So I'm just going to isolate the acceleration
4:05
times the displacement on one side of the equation
4:09
and I get that a times d equals v final squared
4:13
minus v initial squared divided by 2.
4:16
Since this is what a times d equals,
4:19
I can replace the a times d in my net work formula.
4:22
And I find that the net work is equal to the mass
4:25
times the quantity v final squared minus v
4:28
initial squared divided by 2.
4:31
If I multiply the terms in this expression,
4:33
I get that the net work is equal to 1/2 mass times
4:37
the final velocity squared minus 1/2
4:40
mass times the initial velocity squared.
4:43
In other words, the net work or total work
4:45
is equal to the difference between
4:47
the final and initial values of 1/2 mv squared.
4:52
This quantity 1/2 m times v squared
4:55
is what we call the kinetic energy of the object.
4:58
So you'll often hear that the net work done on an object
5:01
is equal to the change in the kinetic energy of that object.
5:05
And this expression is often called the work energy
5:08
principle, since it relates the net work done on an object
5:12
to the kinetic energy gained or lost by that object.
5:16
If the net work done is positive,
5:19
the kinetic energy is going to increase
5:21
and the object's going to speed up.
5:23
If the net work done on an object is negative,
5:26
the kinetic energy of that object
5:27
is going to decrease, which means it's going to slow down.
5:30
And if the net work done on an object is 0,
5:33
it means the kinetic energy of that object
5:35
is going to stay the same, which means the object maintains
5:38
a constant speed.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,30o4omX5qfo,
khan_video_o4yJF90OR9M_6,What are the major differences between DNA Pol I and DNA Pol III?,Essay,"•
0:02
- Let's take a look at a segment of DNA
0:04
that's in the process of being replicated.
0:07
I want to focus in particular
0:08
on the enzyme that replicates DNA.
0:11
That enzyme is DNA polymerase.
0:16
Actually there are a few different types
0:18
of DNA polymerases, and the one
0:19
that we're looking at right now is DNA polymerase III.
0:23
DNA polymerase III synthesizes new DNA,
0:27
and it also has the ability to proofread,
0:30
or kind of check the DNA it's putting together
0:33
and make sure there are no mistakes in it.
0:35
But before we get into that, let's just orient ourselves
0:38
and quickly summarize the diagram
0:39
that we're looking at.
0:41
This enzyme over here is DNA helicase.
0:45
That's the enzyme that unwinds
0:47
the double-stranded DNA,
0:48
so that DNA polymerase can then come in
0:50
and started replicating.
0:52
Right over here you can see
0:54
I drew the backbone in a different color.
0:55
That's the RNA primer.
1:00
Let's just label the DNA strand that's being synthesized,
1:03
it's synthesized from 5 prime to 3 prime.
1:10
Actually, the bottom strand of DNA
1:12
is synthesized in the same time as the top strand,
1:15
but I just left that out of the drawing
1:17
to keep things simple.
1:19
Let's say that the yellow bases represent
1:21
the nitrogen base thymine.
1:25
Let's say that the orange bases represent cytosine.
1:30
The green ones represent adenine.
1:34
And the blue ones represent guanine.
1:38
Thymine and cytosine are the pyramidines.
1:44
They are composed of a single ring structure,
1:46
so they're made up of one ring
1:48
that has six sides to it.
1:50
Then adenine and guanine are the purines.
1:54
They are a double-ringed structure.
1:56
They're composed of one ring with six sides to it,
2:00
and then that ring is attached to another ring
2:02
that has five sides to it.
2:04
Actually, these structures are a little bit more complex.
2:06
There are other atoms in it,
2:08
and there are some double bonds,
2:09
but we're just going to keep things simple for now
2:11
and leave it at that.
2:13
Let's get back to our DNA that's being replicated.
2:16
Right over here I left a space.
2:18
I didn't put the nucleotide in.
2:19
Let's say that by accident,
2:20
instead of it being paired up
2:22
with the proper base, which is adenine,
2:25
it accidentally gets paired up with a guanine.
2:29
That's a mistake.
2:31
DNA polymerase III actually has the ability
2:34
to sense if it made a mistake,
2:37
and if it does realize that it's going to go backwards.
2:42
It's going to actually remove the incorrect base
2:45
and replace it with the correct base.
2:47
So let's do that.
2:48
It's going to remove the incorrect base
2:52
and replace it with the correct one.
2:55
Of course, remember the nitrogen base
2:58
is attached to the sugar backbone.
3:00
This activity that I just described to you
3:02
is called exonuclease activity.
3:10
Nuclease, that tells us that means the ability
3:13
to remove a nucleotide.
3:16
Exo, just going to underline that.
3:19
Exo tells us that it can remove a nucleotide,
3:21
but only from the end of a DNA strand.
3:25
It was able to remove the nucleotide
3:26
because it was at the end of a strand.
3:28
This is in contrast to endonuclease activity.
3:35
An endonuclease can actually remove
3:38
a nucleotide from the middle of a DNA strand.
3:40
So it would be able to remove a nucleotide
3:43
from right over here, for example.
3:45
Just keep that in mind because we're going to
3:47
come across some endonucleases as well.
3:49
Anyway, back to our exonuclease activity.
3:51
If we want to be more specific,
3:53
the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase III
3:56
is actually 3 prime to 5 prime
3:59
exonuclease activity.
4:02
The reason it's called 3 prime to 5 prime
4:05
exonuclease is because
4:07
when DNA polymerase 3 makes that correction
4:10
it has to move backwards in the
4:11
3 prime to 5 prime direction
4:13
in order to do that.
4:16
There's another enzyme, DNA polymerase I.
4:21
I'm just going to abbreviate polymerase with POL.
4:23
DNA polymerase I also has exonuclease activity.
4:32
DNA polymerase I is actually the enzyme
4:35
that will remove the RNA primer
4:37
at the end of replication.
4:39
Just as a side fact, the exonuclease activity
4:41
of DNA polymerase I is actually
4:43
in the 5 prime to 3 prime direction.
4:46
If you want, you can just keep that in mind.
4:49
DNA polymerase III and DNA polymerase I
4:55
are both able to repair or fix mistakes
4:59
that happen during DNA replication.
5:02
Just to give you some perspective
5:04
as to how often this occurs with and without repairs,
5:07
normally we'll have a mistake happening in replication
5:11
between 1 in 100,000 bases to 1 in 1 million bases.
5:20
That's normally the amount of mistakes that would occur.
5:23
But, with the repair mechanisms
5:25
of DNA polymerase III and DNA polymerase I,
5:28
this is reduced to a mistake that happens
5:31
once in about 100 million bases.
5:36
They are very, very effective at lowering
5:38
the error rate in DNA replication.
5:43
The next question I want to ask is
5:45
what if this mistake over here
5:48
was somehow not corrected during replication?
5:52
Maybe there was something wrong
5:53
with one of the enzymes, something happened
5:56
and that mistake was actually sustained.
6:01
Let's take a look at that.
6:03
Here is a piece of DNA with our mistake
6:06
incorporated into it.
6:08
Before we discuss if this mistake
6:09
can be corrected or not,
6:11
let's see what happens if this mistake is not corrected.
6:16
Right here we have our original DNA.
6:23
We're replicating it.
6:25
Let's just say that this strand over here
6:28
is the same as that strand.
6:30
Let's say that the bottom strand
6:31
in our original DNA is the same as this strand.
6:34
Let's look first at the newly replicated DNA on the left.
6:41
We have right over here a thymine base.
6:44
Assuming DNA was replicated properly,
6:48
it's going to have an adenine complementary to it.
6:53
Now let's take a look at the DNA on the right.
6:55
On the bottom we had a guanine,
6:58
and it's going to be paired up, hopefully,
7:00
with the correct base, which is a cytosine.
7:04
Now, let's just quickly look back at our original DNA.
7:10
We were supposed to have a thymine
7:12
with it's complementary adenine,
7:15
and actually, that's exactly what we got over here.
7:21
Just going to circle it.
7:23
So this DNA is actually in the correct sequence.
7:26
But look at the DNA over here on the right.
7:29
This is not correct.
7:30
This is a mutation.
7:34
This is an example of how mutations can occur
7:37
if the DNA repair mechanisms are not working properly.
7:41
Let's go back to our original question.
7:44
Can we fix the original mistake
7:46
so that this mutation does not occur.
7:49
The answer to that question is yes.
7:52
Fortunately, our cells have what's called
7:56
the mismatch repair mechanism.
8:06
The mismatch repair mechanism is composed
8:08
of a number of proteins.
8:15
The first thing these proteins are going to do is
8:17
they're going to recognize if there's a problem.
8:23
The reason that they're able to recognize the problem,
8:25
is that when you have a mismatch in DNA
8:27
it tends to distort the sugar backbone a little bit.
8:31
They are going to mark the area with a cut.
8:37
They are going to cut the incorrect base
8:41
or mark it with a cut.
8:42
The next thing that's going to happen
8:45
is an exonuclease is going to remove
8:52
the incorrect nucleotide.
8:58
So we're going to remove the incorrect nucleotide.
9:07
The next step is one of the DNA polymerases
9:11
is going to insert the correct nucleotide.
9:17
So we're going to pair our thymine up with adenine.
9:23
The last step is a DNA ligase is going to
9:31
connect the new nucleotide
9:33
to the nucleotides on its sides,
9:36
and also to its complementary nucleotide
9:39
on the other strand.
9:40
I'm actually going to just correct
9:42
that distorted sugar backbone.
9:48
Here's our repaired DNA.
9:52
Just to clarify, the mismatch repair mechanism
9:55
that we're talking about here
9:56
happens after replication.
9:59
The repairs done by DNA polymerase III
10:01
and DNA polymerase I that we discussed before,
10:04
that happens during replication
10:06
or at the end of replication.
10:08
One thing you might be wondering is
10:11
how does the mismatch repair mechanism
10:15
know to distinguish between the original parental strand
10:19
and the newly synthesized strand
10:21
that has the mistake on it?
10:23
In other words, how does it know
10:24
which base over here is correct,
10:27
in our case that's the thymine,
10:28
and which one is incorrect,
10:30
in our case, well, it was a guanine.
10:35
We know the answer to that question in bacteria.
10:37
In bacteria, the parental strand will have
10:40
adenines that are methylated.
10:43
I'm just going to draw some methyl groups
10:45
on all the adenines.
10:50
That allows the mismatch repair mechanism
10:53
to kind of recognize and distinguish between
10:57
the original strand that has the correct base on it,
10:59
and the new strand that has the incorrect base on it.
11:02
But we're not quite sure how
11:04
the mismatch repair mechanism in eukaryotic cells
11:07
and in other prokaryotic cells
11:09
knows to distinguish between
11:10
the strand that has the correct nucleotide
11:12
and the strand that has the incorrect nucleotide.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,o4yJF90OR9M,

0:00
The purpose of this video is to just begin
0:03
to appreciate how vast and enormous the universe is.
0:06
And frankly, our brains really can't grasp it.
0:09
What we'll see in this video is that we can't even
0:11
grasp things that are actually super small compared
0:13
to the size of the universe.
0:14
And we actually don't even know what
0:16
the entire size of the universe is.
0:17
But with that said, let's actually
0:19
just try to appreciate how small we are.
0:21
So this is me right over here.
0:24
I am 5 foot 9 inches, depending on whether I'm wearing shoes--
0:28
maybe 5 foot 10 with shoes.
0:30
But for the sake of this video, let's just roughly
0:32
approximate around 6 feet, or around roughly--
0:35
I'm not to go into the details of the math-- around 2 meters.
0:40
Now, if I were to lie down 10 times in a row,
0:43
you'd get about the length of an 18-wheeler.
0:46
That's about 60 feet long.
0:48
So this is times 10.
0:49
Now, if you were to put an 18-wheeler-- if you were
0:53
to make it tall, as opposed to long-- somehow stand it up--
0:56
and you were to do that 10 times in a row,
0:58
you'll get to the height of roughly a 60-story skyscraper.
1:03
So once again, if you took me and you piled me up 100 times,
1:07
you'll get about a 60-story skyscraper.
1:09
Now, if you took that skyscraper and if you
1:12
were to lie it down 10 times in a row,
1:15
you'd get something of the length of the Golden Gate
1:18
Bridge.
1:19
And once again, I'm not giving you the exact numbers.
1:21
It's not always going to be exactly 10.
1:23
But we're now getting to about something that's
1:25
a little on the order of a mile long.
1:28
So the Golden Gate Bridge is actually longer than a mile.
1:30
But if you go within the twin spans, it's roughly about
1:33
a mile.
1:33
It's actually a little longer than that.
1:35
But that gives you a sense of a mile.
1:37
Now, if you multiply that by 10, you
1:40
get to the size of a large city.
1:43
And this right here is a satellite photograph
1:45
of San Francisco.
1:47
This is the actual Golden Gate Bridge here.
1:49
And when I copy and pasted this picture,
1:51
I tried to make it roughly 10 miles by 10 miles
1:54
just so you appreciate the scale.
1:56
And what's interesting here-- and this picture's interesting.
1:58
Because this is the first time we can relate to cities.
2:02
But when you look at a city on this scale,
2:04
it's starting to get larger than what
2:06
we're used to processing on a daily basis.
2:09
A bridge-- we've been on a bridge.
2:11
We know what a bridge looks like.
2:12
We know that a bridge is huge.
2:14
But it doesn't feel like something
2:15
that we can't comprehend.
2:17
Already, a city is something that we
2:19
can't comprehend all at once.
2:20
We can drive across a city.
2:21
We can look at satellite imagery.
2:23
But if I were to show a human on this,
2:26
it would be unbelievably, unbelievably small.
2:28
You wouldn't actually be able to see it.
2:30
It would be less than a pixel on this image.
2:32
A house is less than a pixel on this image.
2:35
But let's keep multiplying by 10.
2:38
If you multiply by 10 again, you get to something
2:41
roughly the size of the San Francisco Bay Area.
2:44
This whole square over here is roughly that square right
2:47
over there.
2:48
Let's multiply by 10 again.
2:52
So this square is about 100 miles by 100 miles.
2:55
So this one would be about 1,000 miles by 1,000 miles.
2:57
And now you're including a big part of the Western United
3:00
States.
3:01
You have California here.
3:03
You Nevada here.
3:04
You have Arizona and New Mexico--
3:06
so a big chunk of a big continent we're
3:08
already including.
3:09
And frankly, this is beyond the scale
3:11
that we're used to operating.
3:13
We've seen maps, so maybe we're a little used to it.
3:15
But if you ever had to walk across this type of distance,
3:18
it would take you a while.
3:19
To some degree, the fact that planes goes so fast-- almost
3:22
unimaginably fast for us-- that it's
3:25
made it feel like things like continents aren't as big.
3:28
Because you can fly across them in five or six hours.
3:30
But these are already huge, huge, huge distances.
3:33
But once again, you take this square
3:35
that's about 1,000 miles by 1,000 miles,
3:38
and you multiply that by 10.
3:40
And you get pretty close-- a little bit
3:42
over-- the diameter of the Earth-- a little bit
3:46
over the diameter of the Earth.
3:47
But once again, we're on the Earth.
3:49
We kind of relate to the Earth.
3:52
If you look carefully at the horizon,
3:54
you might see a little bit of a curvature,
3:56
especially if you were to get into the plane.
3:58
So even though this is, frankly, larger
4:01
than my brain can really grasp, we
4:03
can kind of relate to the Earth.
4:06
Now you multiply the diameter of Earth times 10.
4:10
And you get to the diameter of Jupiter.
4:13
And so if you were to sit Earth right next to Jupiter--
4:17
obviously, they're nowhere near that close.
4:19
That would destroy both of the planets.
4:21
Actually, it would definitely destroy Earth.
4:23
It would probably just be merged into Jupiter.
4:26
So if you put Earth next to Jupiter,
4:30
it would look something like that right over there.
4:34
So I would say that Jupiter is definitely-- on this diagram
4:38
that I'm drawing here-- is definitely
4:39
the first thing that I have I can't comprehend.
4:43
The Earth, itself, is so vastly huge.
4:45
Jupiter is-- it's 10 times bigger in diameter.
4:49
It's much larger in terms of mass, and volume,
4:52
and all the rest.
4:53
But just in terms of diameter, it is 10 times bigger.
4:56
But let's keep going.
4:57
10 times Jupiter gets us to the sun.
5:02
This is times 10.
5:04
So if this is the Sun-- and if I were to draw Jupiter,
5:07
it would look something like-- I'll
5:08
do Jupiter in pink-- Jupiter would be around that big.
5:13
And then the Earth would be around that big
5:17
if you were to put them all next to each other.
5:19
So the Sun, once again, is huge.
5:21
Even though we see it almost every day,
5:24
it is unimaginably huge.
5:26
Even the Earth is unimaginably huge.
5:28
And the Sun is 100 times more unimaginably bigger.
5:33
Now we're going to start getting really, really, really wacky.
5:36
You multiply the diameter of the Sun, which is already
5:40
100 times the diameter of the Earth-- you
5:43
multiply that times 100.
5:44
And that is the distance from the Earth to the Sun.
5:47
So I've drawn the Sun here as a little pixel.
5:52
And I didn't even draw the Earth as a pixel.
5:53
Because a pixel would be way too large.
5:55
It would have to be a hundredth of a pixel
5:57
in order to draw the Earth properly.
5:59
So this is a unbelievable distance
6:02
between the Earth and the Sun.
6:04
It's 100 times the distance of the diameter of the Sun itself.
6:10
So it's massive, massive.
6:11
But once again, these things are relatively close
6:15
compared to where we're about to go.
6:17
Because if we want to get to the nearest star-- so remember,
6:21
the Sun is 100 times the diameter of the Earth.
6:24
The distance between the Sun and the Earth is 100 times that.
6:29
Or you could say it's 10,000 times the diameter
6:32
of the Earth.
6:33
So these are unimaginable distances.
6:35
But to get to the nearest star, which is 4.2 light years away,
6:40
it's 200,000 times-- and once again, unimaginable.
6:45
It's 200,000 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
6:51
And to give you a rough sense of how far apart these things are,
6:59
if the Sun was roughly the size of a basketball--
7:02
if the average star was about the size of a basketball--
7:04
in our part of the galaxy in a volume the size of the Earth--
7:09
so if you had a big volume the size of the Earth,
7:13
if the stars were the sizes of basketballs,
7:16
in our part of the galaxy, you would only
7:18
have a handful of basketballs per that volume.
7:22
So unbelievably sparse.
7:26
Even though, when you look at the galaxy--
7:28
and this is just an artist's depiction of it--
7:30
it looks like something that has the spray of stars,
7:33
and it looks reasonably dense, there
7:35
is actually a huge amount of space
7:37
that the great, great, great, great, great majority
7:40
of the volume in the galaxy is just empty, empty space.
7:46
There's no stars, no planets, no nothing.
7:49
I mean, this is a huge jump that I'm talking about.
7:52
And then if you really want to realize
7:55
how large a galaxy, itself, can be,
7:57
you take this distance between the Sun,
8:00
or between our solar system and the nearest star--
8:02
so that's 200,000 times the distance between the Earth
8:07
and the Sun-- and you multiply that distance by 25,000.
8:10
So if the Sun is right here, our nearest star
8:16
will be in that same pixel.
8:18
They'll actually be within-- you'd actually
8:20
get a ton of stars within that one pixel,
8:22
even though they're so far apart.
8:24
And then this whole thing is 100,000 light years.
8:28
It's 25,000 times the distance than the distance
8:33
between the Sun and the nearest star.
8:35
So we're talking about unimaginable, unfathomable
8:39
distances, just for a galaxy.
8:42
And now we're going to get our-- frankly,
8:44
my brain is already well beyond anything
8:48
that it can really process.
8:49
At this point, it almost just becomes abstract thinking.
8:52
It just becomes playing with numbers and mathematics.
8:55
But to get a sense of the universe, itself,
8:58
the observable universe-- and we have to be clear.
9:00
Because we can only observe light
9:02
that started leaving from its source 13.7 billion years ago.
9:06
Because that's how old the universe is.
9:08
The observable universe is about 93 billion light years across.
9:13
And the reason why it's larger than 13.7 billion
9:16
is that the points in space that emitted
9:20
light 13.7 billion years ago, those
9:22
have been going away from us.
9:24
So now they're on the order of 40 billion light years away.
9:27
But this isn't about cosmology.
9:29
This is just about scale and appreciating
9:31
how huge the universe is.
9:33
Just in the part of the universe that we can theoretically
9:36
observe, you have to get-- and that we can observe,
9:43
just because we're getting electromagnetic radiation
9:47
from those parts of the universe--
9:50
you would have to multiply this number.
9:52
So let me make this clear.
9:53
100,000 light years-- that's the diameter of the Milky Way.
10:01
You would have to multiply not by 1,000.
10:04
1,000 would get you to 100 million light years.
10:10
This is 100,000 times 1,000 is 100 million.
10:13
You have to multiply by 1,000 again
10:18
to get to 100 billion light years.
10:21
And the universe, for all we know,
10:22
might be much, much, much, much, larger.
10:24
It might even be infinite.
10:26
Who knows?
10:27
But to get from just the diameter of the Milky Way
10:32
to the observable universe, you have to multiply by a million.
10:35
And already, this is an unfathomable distance.
10:38
So in the whole scheme of things,
10:42
not only are we pretty small, and not only are the things
10:46
we build pretty small, and not only is our planet ultra small,
10:51
and not only is our Sun ultra small,
10:54
and our solar system ultra small,
10:56
but our galaxy is really nothing compared
10:59
to the vastness of the universe.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,5FEjrStgcF8,

0:00
We could have a debate about what the most interesting cell
0:03
in the human body is, but I think easily the neuron would
0:07
make the top five, and it's not just because the cell
0:10
itself is interesting.
0:11
The fact that it essentially makes up our brain and our
0:14
nervous system and is responsible for the thoughts
0:17
and our feelings and maybe for all of our sentience, I think,
0:22
would easily make it the top one or two cells.
0:24
So what I want to do is first to show you what a neuron
0:26
looks like.
0:27
And, of course, this is kind of the perfect example.
0:30
This isn't what all neurons look like.
0:31
And then we're going to talk a little bit about how it
0:33
performs its function, which is essentially communication,
0:37
essentially transmitting signals across its length,
0:40
depending on the signals it receives.
0:43
So if I were to draw a neuron-- let me
0:45
pick a better color.
0:50
So let's say I have a neuron.
0:52
It looks something like this.
0:53
So in the middle you have your soma and then from the soma--
0:57
let me draw the nucleus.
1:00
This is a nucleus, just like any cell's nucleus.
1:03
And then the soma's considered the body of the neuron and
1:07
then the neuron has these little things sticking out
1:09
from it that keep branching off.
1:13
Maybe they look something like this.
1:16
I don't want to spend too much time just drawing the neuron,
1:18
but you've probably seen drawings like this before.
1:23
And these branches off of the soma of the neuron, off of its
1:27
body, these are called dendrites.
1:32
They can keep splitting off like that.
1:34
I want to do a fairly reasonable drawing so I'll
1:36
spend a little time doing that.
1:43
So these right here, these are dendrites.
1:46
And these tend to be-- and nothing is
1:48
always the case in biology.
1:49
Sometimes different parts of different cells perform other
1:53
functions, but these tend to be where the neuron receives
1:56
its signal.
1:58
And we'll talk more about what it means to receive and
2:01
transmit a signal in this video and
2:03
probably in the next few.
2:04
So this is where it receives the signal.
2:09
So this is the dendrite.
2:11
This right here is the soma.
2:13
Soma means body.
2:14
This is the body of the neuron.
2:17
And then we have kind of a-- you can almost view it as a
2:20
tail of the neuron.
2:22
It's called the axon.
2:26
A neuron can be a reasonably normal sized cell, although
2:29
there is a huge range, but the axons can be quite long.
2:32
They could be short.
2:33
Sometimes in the brain you might have very small axons,
2:36
but you might have axons that go down the spinal column or
2:39
that go along one of your limbs-- or if you're talking
2:42
about one of a dinosaur's limbs.
2:44
So the axon can actually stretch several feet.
2:47
Not all neurons' axons are several feet,
2:49
but they could be.
2:50
And this is really where a lot of the distance of the signal
2:53
gets traveled.
2:55
Let me draw the axon.
2:58
So the axon will look something like this.
3:01
And at the end, it ends at the axon terminal where it can
3:06
connect to other dendrites or maybe to other types of tissue
3:10
or muscle if the point of this neuron is to tell a muscle to
3:13
do something.
3:14
So at the end of the axon, you have the axon
3:16
terminal right there.
3:19
I'll do my best to draw it like that.
3:22
Let me label it.
3:22
So this is the axon.
3:25
This is the axon terminal.
3:29
And you'll sometimes hear the word-- the point at which the
3:33
soma or the body of the neuron connects to the axon is as
3:36
often referred to as the axon hillock-- maybe you can kind
3:39
of view it as kind of a lump.
3:40
It starts to form the axon.
3:46
And then we're going to talk about how the impulses travel.
3:54
And a huge part in what allows them to travel efficiently are
3:58
these insulating cells around the axon.
4:04
We're going to talk about this in detail and how they
4:06
actually work, but it's good just to have the anatomical
4:09
structure first. So these are called Schwann cells and
4:17
they're covering-- they make up the myelin sheath.
4:20
So this covering, this insulation, at different
4:23
intervals around the axon, this is
4:24
called the myelin sheath.
4:26
So Schwann cells make up the myelin sheath.
4:29
I'll do one more just like that.
4:40
And then these little spaces between the myelin sheath--
4:42
just so we have all of the terminology from-- so we know
4:46
the entire anatomy of the neuron-- these are called the
4:50
nodes of Ranvier.
4:56
I guess they're named after Ranvier.
4:57
Maybe he was the guy who looked and saw they had these
4:59
little slots here where you don't have myelin sheath.
5:02
So these are the nodes of Ranvier.
5:05
So the general idea, as I mentioned, is that you get a
5:07
signal here.
5:08
We're going to talk more about what the signal means-- and
5:11
then that signal gets-- actually, the signals can be
5:13
summed, so you might have one little signal right there,
5:16
another signal right there, and then you'll have maybe a
5:19
larger signal there and there-- and that the combined
5:23
effects of these signals get summed up and they travel to
5:26
the hillock and if they're a large enough, they're going to
5:30
trigger an action potential on the axon, which will cause a
5:34
signal to travel down the balance of the axon and then
5:38
over here it might be connected via synapses to
5:42
other dendrites or muscles.
5:44
And we'll talk more about synapses and those might help
5:46
trigger other things.
5:47
So you're saying, what's triggering these things here?
5:49
Well, this could be the terminal end of other neurons'
5:54
axons, like in the brain.
5:57
This could be some type of sensory neuron.
5:58
This could be on a taste bud someplace, so a salt molecule
6:02
somehow can trigger it or a sugar molecule-- or this might
6:06
be some type of sensor.
6:07
It could be a whole bunch of different things and we'll
6:09
talk more about the different types of neurons.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,ob5U8zPbAX4,
khan_video_NG-rrorZcM8_277,which method atomic mass or atomic weight is considered while solving equations?,MCQ,"•
0:00
Let's have a little bit of a primer
0:02
on weight and mass, especially if we start talking
0:04
about atomic weight and atomic mass.
0:07
If we're sitting in a physics class,
0:08
weight and mass mean something very, very ...
0:13
well, they mean different things.
0:14
It might be a discovery,
0:16
or a new learning, for some of you,
0:18
because in everyday life,
0:20
when we say something's mass, we think,
0:22
""Well, the more mass it has, the more weight it has.""
0:24
Or, if we think something has more or less weight,
0:26
we think, ""Okay, that relates to its mass.""
0:29
But in physics class, we see that these actually represent
0:32
two different ideas, albeit related ideas.
0:35
Mass is a notion of how much of something there is,
0:40
or you could say, how hard is it to accelerate
0:42
or decelerate it.
0:44
Or you could view it as a measure of an object's inertia.
0:47
We typically, it, kind of a human scale,
0:49
might measure mass in terms of grams or kilograms.
0:53
What's confusing is, if you go to Europe,
0:56
and you ask someone their weight,
0:58
they'll often give you their weight in terms of kilogram,
1:01
even though that is a unit of mass.
1:04
Now weight, on the other hand, is not ...
1:07
it's different than mass.
1:09
Weight is a force, it's how much the Earth,
1:12
or whatever planet you happen to be on,
1:14
is pulling on you.
1:16
This right over here is a force.
1:18
And, in the metric system, you measure weight,
1:21
not with grams or kilograms, but with Newtons.
1:24
Newtons.
1:26
Really, when you ask someone their weight in Europe,
1:29
they should give it to you in Newtons.
1:31
If you ask them their mass,
1:33
what they're telling you is actually their mass.
1:35
They should say, ""My mass is 60 kilograms,""
1:38
or, ""70 kilograms,"" or whatever they might be.
1:40
It's a very important difference in physics.
1:42
If I go from Earth to the Moon, my mass does not change,
1:48
but my weight does change because the force
1:51
with which the Moon is pulling on me,
1:54
or that we're pulling on each other,
1:55
is less than it would be on Earth.
1:57
In fact, even on the surface of the Earth,
1:58
if you were to even go to the top of a building,
2:01
you're just so ...
2:02
Yeah, it would be very hard to measure it,
2:04
but you're just slightly further
2:05
from the center of the Earth,
2:07
so there's a different gravitational force.
2:09
Your weight will change ever so slightly,
2:11
but your mass does not change.
2:13
You go to deep space,
2:15
and there's very little gravitational influence,
2:17
you have pretty much, or close to, zero weight.
2:20
But you're in deep space, and if there's no planets nearby,
2:25
but your mass is still going to be
2:26
whatever your mass happens to be.
2:28
That's a primer on mass and weight.
2:31
Now, with that out of the way,
2:33
I might confuse you because,
2:35
as we go into a chemistry context,
2:36
it starts getting a little bit more muddled again.
2:41
Let me go to chemistry, chemistry.
2:45
And in any science, if people just talk generally
2:48
about mass or weight, this is what they're talking about.
2:50
They're talking about a measure of inertia for mass,
2:53
and they're talking about a force
2:54
when they're talking about weight.
2:55
But in chemistry, we start thinking about things
2:58
on an atomic scale.
3:00
You'll hear ...
3:02
You'll hear the term ""Atomic,""
3:04
""Atomic mass.""
3:07
Atomic mass is, literally, a measure of mass.
3:11
It is measured in atomic mass units.
3:14
Atomic mass units, which is,
3:16
and we'll talk in the future videos,
3:18
a very, very, very, very, small fraction.
3:22
One atomic mass unit is a very, very, very, very, very,
3:26
very small fraction of a gram.
3:29
It is actually defined
3:31
using the most common isotope of carbon.
3:37
It's defined using carbon-12.
3:39
The current definition is carbon-12.
3:43
Carbon-12 has a mass,
3:47
has a mass,
3:49
has a mass of exactly,
3:53
exactly,
3:56
exactly 12
3:58
atomic mass units.
3:59
So they can then,
4:01
you or chemists, use that as the benchmark
4:05
to figure out what the atomic mass,
4:07
or the mass of any other atom.
4:10
And you might say, ""Oh, why didn't they just do a hydrogen,
4:12
""and just say that's one atomic mass unit, and all that,""
4:14
and actually, they had started there.
4:16
They had been there at an earlier stage,
4:18
but for a whole set of reasons,
4:20
carbon-12 is kind of being the benchmark,
4:22
as having 12 atomic mass units, is what people went with.
4:27
Now, what is atomic weight, then?
4:30
Atomic weight.
4:31
Let me write this in a different color.
4:34
I'll do it in blue.
4:36
Atomic weight.
4:41
So if you draw the same analogy that we did up here,
4:43
you might say, ""Okay, this must be a ...
4:45
""This must be a force.
4:47
""It should maybe, you know,
4:49
""an atomic weight unit would be a small fraction of,
4:52
""very small fraction of a unit.""
4:55
But it turns out in chemistry,
4:57
when we talk about atomic weight,
4:58
we're still measuring in atomic mass units.
5:01
This is still a mass.
5:03
Atomic mass units.
5:05
But it's not the mass of just one atom or just one molecule.
5:09
It's a weighted average across many, many ...
5:12
of how typically, what you would see,
5:16
or the makeup of what you would see on Earth.
5:18
What do I mean by that?
5:19
Well, on Earth, there are two ...
5:21
The primary isotope of carbon is carbon-12.
5:26
Carbon-12, which is defined as having a mass
5:30
of exactly 12 atomic mass units.
5:33
But there's also some carbon-14.
5:36
Carbon-14.
5:39
What do these numbers mean, just as a reminder?
5:42
Well, carbon-12 has six protons,
5:45
and the six protons are what make it carbon.
5:48
Carbon-14 is also going to have six protons.
5:53
But carbon-12, carbon-12 also has six neutrons.
5:58
Six neutrons.
6:01
While carbon-14 has eight neutrons.
6:05
I know what you're already thinking.
6:06
You're, like, ""Well, wait.
6:07
""Why don't we say that a proton or a neutron
6:09
""weighs one atomic mass unit?
6:11
""Because it looks like this is 12,
6:13
""and I'm guessing that this,
6:14
""that this, the mass of this is going to be
6:15
""pretty close to 14.""
6:17
If you're thinking that way, that's not an unreasonable way to think.
6:20
In fact, when I'm kind of just working through chemistry,
6:22
that is how I think about it.
6:24
But they don't weigh exactly one atomic mass unit
6:26
by this definition.
6:27
Remember, the electron is ever so small,
6:29
it has very small mass, but it is contributing,
6:33
or the electrons are contributing, something to the mass.
6:36
So, a proton or a neutron have very, very, very close ...
6:40
They are close to one atomic mass unit.
6:43
Let me write this down.
6:44
One proton, one proton,
6:49
or one neutron,
6:51
one neutron,
6:53
very close to one atomic mass unit,
6:57
but not exactly.
7:00
But anyway, going back to what atomic weight is,
7:02
right over here,
7:03
the most common isotope of carbon ...
7:05
Remember, when we're saying ""isotopes,""
7:06
we're saying the same element,
7:07
we have the same number of protons,
7:09
but we have different number of neutrons.
7:11
The most common isotope on Earth is carbon-12,
7:13
but there's also some carbon-14.
7:16
If you were to take a weighted average,
7:18
as found on the Earth,
7:19
of all the carbon-12 and all of the carbon-14,
7:23
the weighted average of the atomic masses
7:27
is the atomic weight.
7:29
And the atomic weight of carbon ...
7:31
And you'll see this on a periodic table.
7:32
In fact, I have one right over here.
7:34
Notice, the six protons,
7:35
this is what defines it to be carbon.
7:38
But then they write 12.011,
7:40
which is the weighted average of the masses
7:42
of all of the carbons.
7:43
Now, it's very close to 12,
7:44
as opposed to being closer to 14,
7:46
because most of the carbon on Earth is carbon-12.
7:50
We could write this down.
7:52
This is the atomic weight.
7:53
This is the atomic weight of carbon on Earth.
7:57
This is 12.011.
8:03
Typically, if people are telling you,
8:06
""Hey, I'm talking about the isotope.
8:09
""I am talking about the isotope carbon-12,""
8:11
you say, ""Okay, if you're talking about a particular atom
8:16
""of carbon-12,"" you would say,
8:18
""Okay, that's going to be 12 atomic mass units.""
8:22
But then if you said, ""Hey, you know,
8:23
""I'm randomly ...
8:24
""If I have a big bag of carbon, you could say,
8:28
""on average, the weighted average of those carbon atoms,
8:33
""they're going to have an atomic mass,
8:35
""or a weighted average atomic mass,""
8:38
which is atomic weight,
8:39
""of 12.011 atomic mass units.""
8:45

- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.
0:01
Welcome to the English parts of speech.
0:04
We're gonna begin with the noun,
0:06
the lovely wonderful noun, your friend and mine.
0:09
They're mostly what you're gonna encounter in sentences.
0:12
Most sentences in English contain at least one noun
0:15
or a pronoun, but we'll get to pronouns later.
0:18
A noun is basically anything.
0:24
And I know that's not an especially helpful definition,
0:28
but we'll get more specific in a minute.
0:31
A noun is basically anything at all.
0:34
Now the way this is taught in traditional grammar
0:36
is to say that a noun is a person, place or thing,
0:39
which is fine, I think we can make that a little bit sharper
0:44
and expand that out by saying that they are,
0:47
that nouns are people or living things,
0:51
places,
0:55
things, or ideas.
1:00
I think ideas is the one that usually gets left out.
1:03
So nouns can be people, places, things and ideas.
1:07
Let's put that in action.
1:10
So, this is Raul.
1:13
He is from Argentina.
1:15
He is a penguin.
1:17
Raul has big dreams.
1:19
Now, okay.
1:20
So, I wanna take these three sentences
1:22
and find the noun in them using the test.
1:26
So the test is, is it a person
1:30
or a living thing, a place,
1:33
a thing, or an idea?
1:37
And if it's any of those things,
1:39
then it falls into the category of words in English
1:42
which we call nouns.
1:44
So, sentence number one.
1:45
This is Raul.
1:48
What is Raul?
1:50
Well, Raul is a person or a living thing
1:52
so we're just gonna say person so noun.
1:57
Next sentence.
1:59
He is from Argentina.
2:01
Now Argentina happens to be a place
2:04
so therefore, it is also a noun.
2:06
It's a kind of noun called a proper noun,
2:08
just like Raul is but we'll get to that later.
2:10
So, Argentina is a noun.
2:12
Argentina incidentally is a country
2:15
and the word country is also a noun
2:19
because it is a thing.
2:23
So, sentence the third.
2:24
He is a penguin.
2:27
Now, a penguin is a living being or a thing
2:30
so we can say oh yes, penguin, that is a noun as well.
2:35
So, you've noticed I'm not circling he or this.
2:39
These words are pronouns, relative pronouns,
2:42
and they can sometimes behave like nouns,
2:45
but I wouldn't call them nouns.
2:48
That'll just get confusing.
2:49
So, these are pronouns and we'll get to them later.
2:53
Sentence number four.
2:54
Raul has big dreams.
2:56
So, here we have Raul again.
2:58
We know from the first sentence that it's a person's name.
3:01
So, we're just gonna say this is also a noun again.
3:04
And dreams.
3:06
Now, dreams isn't a person, a place.
3:08
It's a thing, sure.
3:12
The reason I put in idea as a fourth category is
3:14
to get it stuff that you can't pick up.
3:17
Like for example, so dream, yes, dream is a noun.
3:23
Dream is maybe a little tangible
3:24
'cause it's something you can imagine,
3:27
but the idea of like a word like bigness.
3:32
Or if you prefer, you know, size.
3:40
The size of Raul's plumage was astonishing.
3:46
Look at that gorgeous plumage.
3:48
It's a little penguin mohawk.
3:50
(high-pitched murmurs)
3:52
The size of Raul's plumage was astounding.
3:55
Now in that sentence, size is a noun,
3:58
but it's not a physical thing,
4:00
it's not a person, it's not a place,
4:02
it's not something you can pick up.
4:04
It's an idea.
4:05
So, that's why I include this fourth category.
4:08
So, if you're trying to figure out
4:10
whether or not a word is a noun,
4:12
just apply this test.
4:14
Ask yourself, is it a person, a place,
4:17
a thing, or an idea?
4:21
And you, my friend, will be golden.
4:24
You can learn anything.

0:00
In the video on black hole several people
0:03
asked what is actually a pretty good question, which
0:05
is if the mass of say a black hole is only two or three
0:10
solar masses, why is the gravity so strong?
0:13
Obviously the sun's gravity isn't so strong
0:16
that it keeps light from escaping, so why would
0:18
something, or even a star that's two or three solar masses--
0:21
its gravity isn't so strong that it keeps light from escaping.
0:24
Why would a black hole that has the same mass, why would that
0:28
keep light from escaping?
0:30
And to understand that, I'll just
0:33
do Newtonian classical physics right here.
0:36
I won't get into the whole general relativity of things.
0:39
And this really will just give us
0:40
the intuition of why a smaller, denser thing of the same mass
0:45
can exert a stronger gravitational pull.
0:48
So let's take two examples.
0:51
Let's say I have some star here that has a mass m1.
1:02
And let's say that its radius, let's just call this r.
1:10
And let's say that I have some other mass right
1:15
at the surface of the star, somehow
1:17
able to survive those surface temperatures.
1:19
And this mass over here has a mass of m2.
1:24
The universal law of gravitation tells us
1:30
that the force between these two masses
1:35
is going to be equal to the gravitational constant times
1:38
the product of the masses.
1:41
So m1 times m2, all of that over the square of the distance r
1:53
squared.
1:53
Now, let me be very clear.
1:54
You might say, wait, this magenta mass right here
1:57
is touching this larger mass.
1:59
Isn't the distance 0?
2:00
And you have to be very careful.
2:02
This is the distance between their center of masses.
2:06
So the center of mass of this large mass over here
2:08
is r away from this mass that's on the surface.
2:13
Now, with that said, let's take another example.
2:17
Let's say that this large massive star, or whatever
2:20
it might be, eventually condenses
2:22
into something 1,000 times smaller.
2:26
So let me draw it like this.
2:28
And obviously I'm not drawing it to scale.
2:30
So let's say we have another case like this.
2:34
And I'm not drawing it to scale.
2:36
So this object, maybe it's the same object
2:38
or maybe it's a different object, that
2:40
has the exact same mass as this larger object,
2:43
but now it has a much smaller radius.
2:48
Now the radius is 1/1,000 of this radius over here.
2:57
So maybe I'll just call it r/1,000.
3:00
So if this had a million kilometer radius,
3:04
so that would make it roughly about twice the radius
3:07
of the sun, if this was a million kilometer radius right
3:10
over here, this would be 1,000 kilometer radius.
3:14
So maybe we're talking about something
3:16
that's approaching a neutron star.
3:18
But we don't have to think about what it actually is.
3:20
Let's just think about the thought experiment here.
3:22
So let's say I have this thing over here.
3:23
And let's say I have something on the surface of this.
3:26
So let's say I have that same mass that's
3:29
on the surface of this thing.
3:31
So this is m2 right over here.
3:34
So what is going to be the force between these two masses?
3:39
How strong are they going to want
3:41
to-- What's the force pulling them together?
3:44
So let's just do the universal law of gravitation again.
3:48
Let's just call this force one, and let's call this force two.
3:52
Once again, it's going to be the gravitational constant times
3:54
the product of their masses.
3:56
So the big m1 times the smaller mass, m2,
4:02
all of that over this distance squared, this radius squared.
4:06
Remember, it's the distance to the center of masses.
4:08
This center of mass here, we're considering m2
4:11
to kind of be just a point mass right over there.
4:13
So what's the radius squared?
4:15
It's going to be r/1,000 squared.
4:22
Or if we simplify this what will this be?
4:24
This is the same thing.
4:27
And I'll just write it in one color,
4:29
just because it takes less time.
4:31
Gravitational constant m1 m2 over r
4:36
squared over 1,000 squared, or over 1 million.
4:44
That's just 1,000 squared.
4:46
Or we can multiply the numerator and the denominator
4:49
by 1 million, and this is going to be equal to 1 million--
4:55
I'm going to write it out, 1 million.
4:56
Let me scroll to the right a little bit--
4:59
times the gravitational constant, times m1 m2,
5:03
all of that over r squared.
5:05
Now, what is this thing right over here?
5:09
That's the same thing as this F1.
5:11
So this is going to be 1 million times F1.
5:18
So even though the masses involved are the same,
5:21
this yellow object right here is the same mass
5:24
as this larger object over here.
5:26
It's able to exert a million times the gravitational force
5:31
on this point mass.
5:32
And actually vice versa.
5:33
They're both being attracted.
5:34
They're both exerting this on each other.
5:37
And the reality is, because this thing is smaller,
5:40
because this m1 on the right here, this one I'm coloring in,
5:44
because this one is smaller and denser,
5:46
this particle is able to get closer to its center of mass.
5:50
Now, you might be saying, OK, well, I can buy that.
5:53
This just comes straight from the universal law
5:56
of gravitation.
5:56
But wouldn't something closer to this center of mass
5:59
experience that same thing?
6:00
If this was a star, wouldn't photons that are over here,
6:06
wouldn't this experience the same force?
6:09
If this distance right here is r/1,000 wouldn't some photon
6:16
here, or atom here, or molecule, or whatever it's over here,
6:20
wouldn't that experience the same force,
6:22
this million times the force as this thing?
6:25
And you've got to remember, all of a sudden
6:27
when this thing is inside of this larger mass, what's
6:29
happening?
6:31
The entire mass is no longer pulling on it
6:35
in that direction.
6:36
It's no longer pulling it in that inward direction.
6:39
You now have all of this mass over here.
6:43
Let me think of the best way that's doing it.
6:45
So you can think of it all of this mass over here
6:48
is pulling it in an outward direction.
6:53
It's not telling.
6:55
What that mass out there is doing,
6:56
since that mass itself is being pulled inward,
7:02
it is pushing down on this.
7:04
It is exerting pressure on that point.
7:06
But the actual gravitational force
7:09
that that point is experiencing is actually going to be less.
7:12
It's actually going to be mitigated by the fact
7:14
that there's so much mass over here
7:19
pulling in the other direction.
7:22
And so you could imagine if you were
7:23
in the center of a really massive object--
7:29
so that's a really massive object.
7:30
If you were in the center, there would
7:32
be no net gravitational force being pulled on you,
7:35
because you're at its center of mass.
7:37
The rest of the mass is outward.
7:40
So at every point it will be pulling you outward.
7:44
And so that's why if you were to enter the core of a star,
7:47
if you were to get a lot closer to its center of mass,
7:49
it's not going to be pulling on you with this type of force.
7:52
And the only way you can get these types of forces
7:55
is if the entire mass is contained in a very
8:00
dense region, in a very small region.
8:02
And that's why a black hole is able to exert
8:05
such strong gravity that not even light can escape.

0:01
You'll hear people talking about different ways of looking at GDP and in general they will talk about the expenditure view of GDP.
0:07
The expenditure view of GDP vs. the income view of GDP and to realize why these get you to the same number for GDP
0:17
But why you're kind of conceptually looking at 2 different things, we're gonna revisit a very very simple economy- maybe slightly more complicated than that one island economy.
0:25
So in this economy, we have some households, and that's why it's slightly more complicated, because I am talking about households, not just one house on an island.
0:34
You have some households and you have some firms. And for the sake of simplicity, we're going to assume that households own all the factors of production.
0:45
And they essentially rent them out to firms to produce all the goods and services. The firms, and this is another assumption, produce all the goods and services.
0:58
These are two very strong assumptions and these really are not true in the real world. This just helps me draw the diagram.
1:10
Obviously in the real world, households do not own all the factors of production.
1:14
Many, if not most of the factors of production the factories and the ships and whatever else are actually owned by firms in the real world
1:22
but this is not that crazy an assumption because those firms, at the end of the day are owned by people, they are owned by households.
1:28
So in theory, that they could have been transferred to the households and then the households just rent the factors of production to the firms.
1:34
And this is also a hugely simplifying assumption because we know that in the real world, we know that firms don't produce all the goods and services, households also produce goods and services,
1:43
some of which, never get measured. The service for me taking the trash out at night, or doing the lawn, or making dinner
1:52
or the service of parents taking care of their children. None of that gets accounted for.
1:57
But for this, just for simplicity, we're going to make these two assumptions. All the factors of production and the system. The labor, the land, the capital, and if we wanna throw it in, the entrepreneurship, it's all loaned by households
2:14
and all goods and services are produced by firms.
2:17
So just like we saw with that first example of the island, the households do all of the expenditures, and these ends up being all of the revenue for the firms.
2:28
And then the firms spend a lot take that revenue and then spend it to rent many of these factors of production or some or all of these factors of production
2:38
so they hire the people, which is essentially they're renting labor, they might rent the land, they might rent the capital, so all of that ends up becoming income for the households.
2:49
And whatever else is left over, so this is expenses. So if we take this revenue, what it turns into is expenses and profit. Whatever's leftover after expenses is profit.
3:03
We're assuming all the firms are also owned by all the households so the expenses plus the profit end up all going to the households and becoming income, which then becomes expenditures for the households, which then become revenue for the firms.
3:19
So when people say the expenditure vs. the income view of GDP, they're saying ""look, I can measure GDP at any one of these points."" I could measure the expenditures at a time period by households, in this very simple model which would be the same as the revenue of firms
3:36
in this very simple model, which is the same as expenses plus profit of the firms in this simple model, which is same as the income of the household.
3:45
and so, the expenditure view of GDP would be looking in this very simple model, you see, it gets very complicated very fast, especially when we start thinking about expenditures, not just coming from households, but this is simplifying,
3:58
hugely simplified model to show you that these are the same thing, and say ""hey, look at GDP at this point, maybe at that point"".
4:06
If you wanna look at the income model, you can look at GDP at that point.
4:11
What we'll see as we go into future videos, as we break things between consumption and investment and government spending and net exports,
4:17
that it isn't quite this simple to diagram out, but when we do think about that, we are thinking when we are thinking about consumption and investment and government,
4:28
we are thinking about it from the expenditure point of view. There's another way of thinking about it, where you could have looked at the aggregate income in that country's point of view
4:34
making some adjustments for things like exports and imports and things like that.
4:38
But hopefully at least this clarifies why these come up with the same number from what you can see in this very simple model
4:44
and that there are two slightly different lenses on the same thing.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Z9b8nnvpim0,

0:02
Voiceover: So the job of our lungs
0:04
on a pretty general level
0:06
is to take blood, that's without oxygen
0:09
that our bodies have used up.
0:10
So I'm going to use blue here to represent that.
0:12
To take that blood and to put oxygen in it,
0:15
and it comes out as oxygenated,
0:17
which is red blood.
0:19
I mean blood without oxygen gets a little darker,
0:22
that's why conventionally
0:23
we think of it as blue versus red.
0:25
And from there the heart
0:27
pumps this blood to the rest of the body.
0:29
So in a nutshell, that's what the lungs do.
0:32
And to do that,
0:33
they grab oxygen from the atmosphere
0:36
and take the carbon dioxide from the blood
0:40
and blow it out.
0:41
Co2, carbon dioxide.
0:44
And this exchange really is a full picture
0:46
of what you do with every breath.
0:49
Now in terms of how the lungs do this,
0:51
let's talk about the structure first for a bit.
0:54
I think it looks kind of like an upside down tree,
0:56
just because all these branches keep getting
0:59
smaller and smaller as we reached
1:01
the terminal branches.
1:03
I mean there's 20 or 30 levels here,
1:05
I can't draw them all,

1:15
Which is plural for alveolus.
1:17
And what that is essentially an air sac.
1:20
Let's blow that up down here.
1:22
So the alveolus looks kind of like a bulb,
1:27
is an air sac, it has very thin walls,
1:29
and laying along the walls,
1:32
almost, almost in contact but not quite,
1:34
is the blood supply.
1:36
This is how things get from our blood
1:39
to the lungs and back and forth.
1:41
So I'm going to draw a blue here to begin with
1:43
because there's no oxygen to begin with.
1:45
As it travels and that the air goes back and forth
1:48
between the blood supply and the alveolus,
1:52
it becomes red as it leaves,
1:55
because there's oxygen.
1:56
You can think of it as inhale,
1:58
oxygen goes in,
2:00
from here it goes to the blood supply.
2:03
It makes you exhale,
2:04
the carbon dioxide is going the opposite way.
2:07
When we exhale it can just leave the lungs.
2:10
And now the reason this exchange takes place
2:12
is just a simple loss of air pressure in physics.
2:16
So if there's more oxygen in here,
2:18
relatively more compare to the blood supply,
2:20
then the oxygen wants to escape to the blood supply.
2:23
And if there's relatively more
2:24
carbon dioxide in the blood,
2:26
then it also wants to escape to
2:28
where there's less of it,
2:29
which is into the air sac.
2:31
So conveniently this allows us to take what we want
2:34
and get rid of or it don't want anymore.
2:37
Okay, so there's your bird eye view of
2:39
how the lungs work in a nutshell.
2:41
And there's a lot of problems that can arise
2:44
in this whole system.
2:46
But I think a better way to understand it
2:47
is to break it down by the different players,
2:49
the different areas that can go wrong.
2:52
So again we think of lung problems as categories.
2:55
Now, the first one,
2:57
the first problem I can think of
2:58
is oxygen not coming in.
3:00
And so on the flip side of that,
3:02
number two would be carbon dioxide not escaping.
3:05
All right to keep going, let's go further into the lungs.
3:08
Here at the alveolus,
3:09
I would say number three
3:11
is something going on with this exchange process
3:13
where between the air sac and the blood supply,
3:16
something is not working there,
3:18
so that's number three, that's the exchange.
3:21
And lastly, if something is wrong with the blood supply,
3:24
blood cannot get to the lungs and come out,
3:27
that would be number four.
3:29
So I think these are the four
3:30
big categories of lung diseases.
3:33
And let's go through them one by one.
3:34
Now problems number one and two here,
3:37
we actually think of them as a pair of diseases,
3:39
there's restrictive and obstructive.
3:42
Let's start with restrictive.
3:45
And this just describes the fact that the lungs
3:47
which are suppose to expand when you take air in
3:50
to make room for the air,
3:51
for some reason it's not expanding properly.
3:54
So this is an intake in respiration problem.
3:57
And since oxygen is the main point of taking air in,
4:01
in restrictive diseases we lack oxygen.
4:04
So what happens is,
4:06
the lungs for a variety of reasons
4:09
becomes stiff and hard to blow up like a balloon
4:12
that's been dipped in paper mache
4:14
and it can't blow up properly.
4:16
So if you look at, if this is suppose to be
4:18
the size of the lung when it's blown up,
4:19
this smaller lung her in restrictive disease
4:23
gives us a lot of wasted space,
4:25
other space that could have had oxygen
4:27
but is now not usable.
4:29
That just makes the whole
4:30
system less efficient, right?
4:32
So there's something wrong with the actual
4:34
structure of the lungs that's making it hard to expand.
4:37
So let's think of some examples.
4:39
So there's fibrosis.
4:41
Fibrosis just means,
4:42
laying down too much scar tissue.
4:44
So if the lungs are chronically injured
4:47
or sometimes there's a genetic factor to it,
4:49
the tissue gets stiff.
4:51
Just like the scar you would have on your hand,
4:53
except you have all over your lungs.
4:55
So it's not, no longer expandable.
4:58
There's also things that can affect the chest wall.
5:01
Say if there's a muscular diseases that make it hard
5:05
for the chest to expand,
5:06
that also limits how big the lungs can get.
5:09
Or sometimes there could be things that are
5:11
deposited in the actual tissue of the lungs,
5:14
I can think of amyloidosis,
5:16
which is these protein particles that get
5:19
studded into the lungs,
5:20
making it harder to expand.
5:22
So those are our examples of restrictive disease,
5:25
oxygen cannot get in.
5:27
Now it's evil twin, or I guess they are both evil,
5:30
but it's counterpart would be obstructive disease.
5:34
Obstructive.
5:37
So if we said before that,
5:39
the restrictive is about not getting air in,
5:42
then the opposite will not be getting air out.
5:44
In restrictive diseases
5:46
we're having trouble with expiration.
5:49
So instead of letting the lungs collapse back to
5:51
it's normal size at the end of an exhale.
5:54
It stays expanded like this.
5:57
Let me just draw some of the
5:58
branches here just to show you.
6:00
There's different reasons that
6:01
obstructive diseases can occur.
6:04
Sometimes, let's say there's a mucous plug.
6:07
An air can't get out
6:08
or sometimes these airways collapse
6:10
because the walls have loss
6:12
it's elastic quality structure.
6:15
So the air is essentially stuck in there.
6:17
Let's think of all these extra air.
6:20
Can you imagine how difficult it would be
6:22
if you cannot exhale,
6:23
that's very uncomfortable.
6:25
So obstructive disease describes
6:27
large, over-inflated lungs.
6:29
And some examples would be
6:31
something you probably heard of as COPD,
6:34
which is actually a group of two different diseases.
6:36
One is emphysema,
6:38
which have to do with the lungs losing
6:40
their elastic quality,
6:42
and the other one is chronic bronchitis,
6:45
which is just a lot of irritation day in and day out,
6:48
that makes a lot of mucous.
6:50
Both of these result in this large inflated lungs.
6:53
Something more common that
6:55
a lot of people have is asthma,
6:57
which is when the air ways spasm and they close up,
7:01
blocking the air from getting out.
7:02
So restrictive and obstructive diseases
7:05
going have to do with a global picture of the lung.
7:08
Not to get into too much of the detail,
7:10
just think of restrictive as having trouble
7:12
getting air in, oxygen in,
7:13
and obstructive,
7:15
having trouble getting carbon dioxide out
7:17
with the exhale.
7:18
So now let's zoom back in to the alveoli.
7:21
What's going on down here
7:23
that could give us lung disease.
7:25
So number three I said there's
7:26
something wrong with exchange.
7:28
So let me just redraw this here.
7:30
We have our air sac,
7:32
so air has finally made it here to where
7:35
it can make contact with the blood supply.
7:38
And one thing that will really mess up this process
7:42
is let's say if this air sac is filled with fluid.
7:47
Like that.
7:48
Let's fill that in to make it,
7:49
yeah, like that.
7:51
Okay, so what would happen to your oxygen,
7:53
so it's coming in here,
7:54
it wants to get to the blood
7:55
and uh-oh, it's stuck.
7:56
As you know it's much harder for air to diffuse
8:00
through liquid than it is when it's empty space.
8:03
And then on the other hand,
8:05
carbon dioxide is here trying to get out
8:07
and uh-oh it's stuck in the fluid too.
8:09
So as you this makes
8:11
the whole exchange much less efficient.
8:14
So you have less oxygen going in
8:16
and less carbon dioxide going out.
8:18
So that when, I would say that this blue,
8:21
let's extend this a little further,
8:23
instead of turning red where it's suppose to,
8:25
since it's so inefficient,
8:27
it eventually becomes as kind of
8:29
weak red when it leaves.
8:32
So you have less oxygen in your blood
8:34
and more to carbon dioxide
8:35
than you would in a healthy lung.
8:37
So what could cause this to happen with the fluid.
8:40
One thing that's very common is an
8:42
infection such as pneumonia.
8:44
See when our lungs are not doing well,
8:46
there's a lot of secretions, mucous,
8:49
which is fluid trying to flush out,
8:51
wash out what's there.
8:52
So pneumonia, if it's bacteria or virus
8:55
this fluid happens.
8:57
There's also edema.
8:58
Edema kind of is just a general word for a
9:01
fluid being where it's not suppose to,
9:03
being pushed out.
9:04
So, if for some reason if there's too much blood
9:06
in the blood supply.
9:07
Let's say if your heart is not working well,
9:09
and all this blood is backed up,
9:11
then it will flow into the air sac
9:14
where it does not belong
9:17
and give us this picture of wet inefficient lung.
9:20
And usually the lungs works best when they are dry,
9:23
because we're talking about air exchange here.
9:25
I forgot to write a name for this category,
9:27
let's call this ventilation.
9:29
We're talking about the exchange here,
9:32
but ventilation technically means
9:34
getting carbon dioxide out of here.
9:35
But I want to use this word to just describe
9:38
the process of exchanging one gas for the other.
9:42
Which is not working well here.
9:44
And talking about wet versus dry lungs here,
9:47
it kind of goes nicely into our fourth point.
9:50
So our fourth problem,
9:52
let's call it a problem with perfusion.
9:54
So it's funny, it's kind of like the lungs are too dry.
9:58
So perfusion is the ability
10:01
to get blood where it's suppose to go.
10:03
Again let's draw our alveolus,
10:07
singular, it's alveolus.
10:09
So we have our blood supply coming in as usual
10:12
and uh-oh, sometimes there can be a clot.
10:14
So our body can make clot and they can break off
10:17
and float in the blood stream when they get
10:19
to a place that's small enough to get stuck,
10:21
they get stuck here.
10:22
And stops the blood from flowing pass this point.
10:25
So for the rest of the path, there's no blood.
10:29
And the branches of blood supply,
10:32
the branches of past this point are also gone.
10:35
So as you can see in this scenario,
10:38
no matter how much oxygen we have in here,
10:40
we only have,
10:41
we don't have any blood supply to put it into.
10:44
So not having enough perfusion is a huge problem,
10:47
and we call it a pulmonary embolus.
10:50
So pulmonary means it's in the lungs.
10:52
Embolus describes a clot that formed
10:55
somewhere else and it's travelled.
10:57
And if it gets lodged in the lungs
11:00
and it's a pulmonary embolus,
11:02
now the severity of this really has to do with
11:04
where in the blood supply get stuck.
11:07
So let me just go back here,
11:08
up here and draw some blood vessels
11:11
along these trees.
11:13
So if this embolus is all the way up here
11:16
in a major branch and it shuts off
11:18
this whole part of the lung.
11:19
They have a huge problem, people can die from this.
11:22
Now if it's a very small branch,
11:23
like down here,
11:24
then it's still uncomfortable and you'll lose a portion
11:28
of the lungs but it's not relatively
11:30
not as a big of a problem.
11:31
But of course it will still compromise
11:33
how well your lungs are working,
11:35
how much oxygen is getting in,
11:37
so on and so forth.
11:38
So here you have four very general categories
11:42
of lung disease that I think provides
11:44
a nice structure for,
11:45
okay, what are the different players involved,
11:47
and what can go wrong to give us lung disease?",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,-oHlcuS7AeU,

Over many videos now, we've been talking
0:02
about how every interstellar object is moving away
0:06
from Earth.
0:07
And we've also been talking about how the further something
0:10
is away from Earth, the faster it's moving.
0:13
What I want to do in this video is
0:14
to put a little bit of numbers behind it,
0:16
or even better conceptualize what we've been talking about.
0:19
So one way to think about it is that, if at an early stage
0:22
in the universe, I were to pick some points.
0:24
So that's one point, another point, another point,
0:28
another point.
0:30
Let me just pick nine points so that I have a proper grid.
0:33
So this at an early stage in the universe.
0:36
If we fast forward a few billion years--
0:39
and I'm clearly not drawing it to scale-- all of these points
0:42
have all moved away from each other.
0:45
So this point is over here-- actually, let me
0:48
draw another column, just to make it clear.
0:54
So if we fast forward a few billion years,
0:57
the universe has expanded.
0:58
And so everything has moved away from everything.
1:01
And let me color code it a little bit.
1:03
Let me make this point magenta.
1:05
So this point, the magenta point is now here.
1:09
This green point has now moved away from the magenta point.
1:13
And now this blue point has now moved away
1:17
from the magenta point in that direction.
1:20
And we could keep going.
1:21
This yellow point is maybe over here now.
1:24
I think you get the general idea.
1:26
And I'll just draw the other yellow points.
1:29
So they've all moved away from each other.
1:34
So there's no center here.
1:35
Everything is just expanding away from things next to it.
1:39
And what you can see here is not only did this thing expand away
1:42
from this, but this thing expanded away
1:44
from this even further.
1:46
Because it had this expansion, plus this expansion.
1:50
Or another way to think about it is,
1:55
the apparent velocity with which something is expanding
1:58
is going to be proportional to how far it is.
2:00
Because every point in between is also expanding away.
2:04
And just to review a little bit of the visualization
2:06
of this-- one way to think of this,
2:08
if you think of the universe as an infinite flat sheet.
2:11
You can imagine that we're just taking
2:12
a sheet of, I don't know, some type of sheet
2:16
of stretchy material and just stretching it out.
2:19
We're just stretching it out.
2:21
That's if we kind of imagine a more infinite universe that
2:24
just goes off in every direction.
2:25
We're just stretching that infinite sheet out.
2:28
So it has no boundaries, but we're still stretching it out.
2:30
Another way to visualize it-- and this what we did earlier
2:33
on-- Is you can imagine that the universe is the three
2:38
dimensional surface of a four dimensional sphere.
2:41
Or the three dimensional surface of a hyper-sphere.
2:44
So at an early stage in the universe,
2:45
the sphere looked like this.
2:50
And these points here-- that magenta point
2:53
is right over here.
2:54
The green point is right over there.
2:57
Then we add the blue point up here.
3:00
And then let me just draw the rest of the yellow points.
3:03
And the yellow points are here.
3:05
They're all on the surface of this sphere.
3:09
Obviously I'm only dealing with two dimensions right now
3:12
and it's nearly impossible, or maybe impossible,
3:14
to imagine a three dimensional surface of a four
3:16
dimensional sphere.
3:17
But the analogy holds.
3:19
If this is a surface the balloon,
3:21
or the surface of a bubble, if the bubble
3:23
were to expand over a few billion years-- and once again,
3:29
not drawn to scale.
3:30
So now we have a bigger bubble here.
3:33
This part of the surface is all going to expand.
3:36
So once again, you have your magenta.
3:38
You have your blue dot.
3:41
You have your green dot right over here.
3:45
And then let me just draw the rest in yellow.
3:47
So they will have all expanded away from each other
3:51
on the surface of this sphere.
3:53
And just to make it clear that this is a sphere,
3:56
let me draw some contour lines.
3:58
So this is a contour line.
3:59
Just to make it clear that we are
4:00
on the surface of an actual sphere.
4:05
Now with that out of the way, let's think
4:07
about what is the apparent velocity with which things
4:11
are moving away?
4:11
And remember, we're going have to say, not only how far things
4:14
are moving away, but we're going to say how far they are moving
4:17
away from-- if the observer is us--
4:20
depending on how far they already are.
4:23
So what we're going to do-- we could say
4:26
is-- let me write this down.
4:28
All objects moving away from each other.
4:43
And the apparent relative velocity
4:56
is proportional to distance.
5:04
And what I've just written down here--
5:06
and this is why I wrote it down--
5:07
this is a rephrasing of, essentially, Hubble's Law.
5:14
And he came up with this by just observing
5:16
that when he looks-- especially the further out he looks,
5:18
the more redshifted objects are.
5:21
And not only were they moving faster and faster away
5:23
from Earth, but they seem to be moving faster and faster
5:27
away from each other.
5:28
So this is just a restating of Hubble's Law.
5:31
Or another way to say it is, from any point,
5:35
let's say from the earth, the velocity
5:37
that something appears to be moving
5:39
is going to be some constant times the distance
5:46
that it is away from the observer.
5:48
In this case, we are the observer.
5:50
And we put this little zero-- so this H here
5:53
is called Hubble's Constant.
5:59
And it's a very non-constant constant.
6:01
Because this constant will change depending
6:04
on where we are in the evolution of the universe.
6:07
So we put this little zero here, this little sub 0 right
6:11
over here, to show that this is Hubble's Constant right now.
6:16
And when we talk about distance, we're
6:17
talking about the proper distance right now.
6:25
And this has to be very important
6:26
because that proper distance is constantly
6:28
changing as the universe expands.
6:30
So the now will actually change slightly
6:33
from the beginning of this video to the end of this video.
6:35
But we could roughly say in kind of our current period of time.
6:40
And when we say proper distance, we're
6:41
talking about if you actually had rulers.
6:43
And if you were to just lay them down instantaneously--
6:46
obviously we can't do something like that.
6:48
But we can imagine doing something like that.
6:50
So that's what we're talking about it.
6:51
So just to give a sense of, or do a little bit of math
6:55
of how fast things are actually moving apart-- let
7:04
me actually write it someplace where
7:05
I have more space-- the current Hubble
7:08
Constant is 70.6 plus or minus 3.1.
7:16
So we have observed some variation here.
7:19
There is some error to our actual measurements.
7:23
Kilometers per second per megaparsec.
7:33
And remember, a parsec is roughly 3.2, 3.3 light years.
7:39
So another way to think about it is,
7:42
if this is where we are in the universe right now.
7:47
And if this object right over here--
7:49
if this distance right over here is one megaparsec, so 1 million
7:55
parsecs.
7:56
Or 3.26 million light years from Earth.
8:03
So just so we have a sense, this is
8:06
roughly 3.26 million light years from Earth.
8:11
Then this object will appear to be moving away.
8:14
Although it's not moving in space,
8:16
just the space that it's in is stretching in such a way
8:18
that it looks to be moving at, based on its redshift,
8:25
70.6 kilometers per second away from us.
8:31
So this is a huge velocity.
8:33
70.6 kilometers per second.
8:38
So this is a pretty fast velocity.
8:42
But you have to remember, this is over one megaparsec.
8:45
The Andromeda galaxy is not even a megaparsec away.
8:49
It is about 2.5 million light years.
8:51
So it's about 0.7 or 0.8 of a megaparsec.
8:55
So if you look at a point in space
8:56
a little bit further than the Andromeda galaxy,
8:59
it will look to be, right now, receding
9:01
at about 70.6 kilometers per second.
9:04
But what if you were to go twice that distance?
9:06
If you were to look at something that's almost 7 light years
9:09
away?
9:10
2 megaparsecs away?
9:12
So if you were to look at this object over here,
9:18
how fast would that be receding?
9:20
Well, if you just look at it over here,
9:22
it's 2 megaparsecs away.
9:24
So it's going to be twice this.
9:26
You're just going to multiply its distance-- 2
9:28
megaparsecs times this.
9:30
The megaparsecs cancel out.
9:31
So 70.6 times 2 is-- it's going to look to be moving,
9:38
It's not moving in space.
9:39
Remember, space is just stretching.
9:42
So its velocity, It's apparent velocity, will be 70.6 times 2.
9:46
So that's 141.2 kilometers per second.
9:51
And one question you say, well how did Hubble
9:54
know-- you can observe the redshift of objects moving away
9:58
from us.
9:58
But how did he know that they were moving away
10:00
from each other?
10:01
Well, if you were look at the redshift of this object,
10:03
and say, wow, that's moving away is 70.6 kilometers per second.
10:06
And then you were to look at the redshift of this
10:08
and say, wow, that's moving away from us
10:10
at 141.2 kilometers per second.
10:13
Then you also know that these two objects are moving away
10:17
from each other at 70.6 kilometers per second.
10:22
And we could keep doing this over different distances.
10:24
But hopefully this gives you a little bit bigger sense
10:28
of things.
10:29
And just remember, even though I said this is a huge distance--
10:31
a megaparsec is further than it is to the Andromeda galaxy.
10:35
The Andromeda galaxy is the nearest large galaxy to us.
10:38
There are some smaller galaxies that
10:40
are closer to us that are kind of satellite
10:42
galaxies around the Milky Way.
10:43
But the Andromeda is the nearest large galaxy to us.
10:48
And we also know that we're talking about hundreds
10:51
of billions of galaxies in just the observable universe.
10:57
So very quickly, as you go near the edge
10:59
of the observable universe, these velocities,
11:03
the apparent distance at which things move are moving away
11:06
from us, start to become pretty significant.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,1V9wVmO0Tfg,

Let's imagine we have a huge cloud
0:02
of hydrogen atoms floating in space.
0:05
Huge, and when I say huge cloud, huge both in distance
0:08
and in mass.
0:09
If you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,
0:11
it would just be this really, really massive thing.
0:15
So you have this huge cloud.
0:16
Well, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually
0:20
attracted to each other.
0:21
It's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.
0:25
But it would slowly affect these atoms.
0:27
And they would slowly draw close to each other.
0:30
It would slowly condense.
0:31
They'd slowly move towards the center
0:34
of mass of all of the atoms.
0:37
They'd slowly move in.
0:39
So if we fast forward, this cloud's
0:42
going to get denser and denser.
0:46
And the hydrogen atoms are going to start
0:48
bumping into each other and rubbing up against each other
0:51
and interacting with each other.
0:53
And so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.
0:56
Now remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.
0:58
So the temperature is going up.
1:03
And it'll-- they'll keep condensing.
1:05
They'll just keep condensing and condensing
1:07
until something really interesting happens.
1:09
So let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here
1:12
in the center.
1:16
And there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.
1:19
It's really dense.
1:20
I could never draw the actual number of atoms here.
1:22
This is really to give you an idea.
1:24
There's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,
1:28
from everything that wants to get
1:29
to that center of mass of our entire cloud.
1:32
The temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.
1:38
And at that point, something neat happens.
1:40
And to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,
1:43
let's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.
1:46
A hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just
1:48
going to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.
1:49
So the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.
1:50
If you want to think about a hydrogen atom,
1:52
it also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.
1:57
And let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.
1:59
And obviously this distance isn't to scale.
2:02
This distance is also not to scale.
2:04
Atoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms
2:05
are actually much, much, much, much smaller
2:07
than the actual radius of an atom.
2:10
And so is the electron.
2:11
But anyway, this just gives you an idea.
2:13
So we know from the Coulomb forces,
2:14
from electromagnetic forces, that these two positively
2:17
charged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere
2:20
near each other.
2:22
But we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four
2:25
forces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,
2:28
that if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures
2:31
and huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close
2:35
enough to each other, then all of a sudden,
2:37
the strong force will overtake.
2:39
It's much stronger than the Coulomb force.
2:41
And then these two hydrogens will actually--
2:43
these nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?
2:48
Well, anyway, they would actually fuse together.
2:50
And so that is what actually happens
2:53
once this gets hot and dense enough.
2:57
You now have enough pressure and enough temperature
2:59
to overcome the Coulomb force and bring
3:02
these protons close enough to each other for fusion
3:05
to occur, for fusion ignition.
3:12
And the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.
3:14
It's not ignition.
3:15
It's not combustion in the traditional sense.
3:16
It's not like you're burning a carbon molecule
3:20
in the presence of oxygen.
3:22
It's not combustion.
3:23
It's ignition.
3:24
And the reason why it's called ignition
3:25
is because when two of these protons,
3:27
or two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus
3:32
has a slightly smaller mass.
3:35
And so in the first stage of this,
3:36
you actually have two protons under enough pressure--
3:42
obviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--
3:44
with enough pressure they get close enough.
3:46
And then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.
3:51
One of these guys degrades into a neutron.
3:56
And the resulting mass of the combined protons
3:59
is lower than the mass of each of the original.
4:01
By a little bit, but that little bit of mass
4:04
results in a lot of energy-- plus energy.
4:11
And this energy is why we call it ignition.
4:13
And so what this energy does is it provides
4:16
a little bit of outward pressure,
4:17
so that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.
4:21
So once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.
4:24
And then that energy provides outward pressure
4:26
to balance what is now a star.
4:30
So now we are at where we actually
4:32
have the ignition at the center.
4:35
We have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying
4:39
to get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.
4:43
Now, what is the hydrogen being fused into?
4:46
Well, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just
4:50
kind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens
4:54
in stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.
5:00
I have trouble spelling.
5:01
Which is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.
5:03
This is still hydrogen because it
5:04
has one proton and one neutron now.
5:07
It is not helium yet.
5:08
This does not have two-- it does not have two protons.
5:12
But then the deuterium keeps fusing.
5:14
And then we eventually end up with helium.
5:19
And we can even see that on the periodic table.
5:21
Oh, I lost my periodic table.
5:22
Well, I'll show you the next video.
5:23
But we know hydrogen in its atomic state
5:30
has an atomic number of 1.
5:32
And it also has a mass of 1.
5:34
It only has one nucleon in its nucleus.
5:38
But it's being fused.
5:39
It goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,
5:42
which is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.
5:46
And then that eventually gets fused--
5:48
and I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--
5:50
into helium.
5:51
And by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.
5:56
So it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,
5:58
in particular, that isotope of helium--
6:00
it has an atomic mass of 4.
6:03
And this process releases a ton of energy.
6:06
Because the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced
6:09
is slightly lower than four times the atomic mass
6:15
of each of the constituent hydrogens.
6:17
So all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it
6:21
needs super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--
6:24
keeps the star from collapsing.
6:28
And once a star is in this stage,
6:31
once it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen
6:35
in its core, where the pressure and the temperature
6:37
is the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.
6:41
This is now a main sequence star.
6:48
And that's actually where the sun is right now.
6:50
Now there's questions of, well, what if there just
6:53
wasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?
6:56
And there actually are things that
6:57
never get to quite that threshold
6:59
to fuse all the way into helium.
7:00
There are a few things that don't quite
7:02
make the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.
7:05
So they are generating some of their heat.
7:06
Or there are even smaller objects
7:08
that just get to the point there's
7:10
a huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually
7:13
occurring inside of the core.
7:15
And something like Jupiter would be an example.
7:17
And you could go several masses above Jupiter
7:20
where you get something like that.
7:21
So you have to reach a certain threshold
7:23
where the mass, where the pressure and the temperature
7:25
due to the heavy mass, get so large that you
7:27
start this fusion.
7:28
And-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,
7:31
the slower the fusion will occur.
7:33
But if you're super massive, the fusion
7:35
will occur really, really fast.
7:37
So that's the general idea of just how stars get formed
7:40
and why they don't collapse on themselves
7:43
and why they are these kind of balls
7:45
of fusion reactions existing in the universe.
7:48
In the next few videos, we'll talk
7:50

0:00
In talking about the adaptive immune system, we've already
0:04
seen that there's a couple of actors.
0:16
You have your humoral response.
0:20
So this is responding to things that are floating
0:22
around in the fluids of the body and not necessarily
0:24
things that have infiltrated your body cells and then you
0:27
have your cell mediated response.
0:35
And then in the humoral response-- and we're talking
0:38
about specific humoral response-- this is where the B
0:40
cells, the B lymphocytes are at their most active.
0:45
And essentially what they do is, you got a B cell here.
0:48
It has a very specific antibody, specific to just
0:52
this B cell, not B cells in general.
0:55
If this happens to be the one of the billions of B cells
0:59
that happens to have the matching key-- or maybe I
1:02
should say the matching lock for the key that is the
1:05
intruding pathogen-- that pathogen will
1:09
bind to that B cell.
1:11
Maybe it's a virus, maybe it's a bacteria.
1:14
And then the B cell will get activated and we'll talk about
1:17
in this video that the activation
1:19
doesn't always happen.
1:20
In fact, it usually doesn't happen just from this, but so
1:23
far we've said it gets activated, it goes into memory
1:28
B cells, which are essentially multiple versions of this
1:31
original B cell-- just saying, hey, let's have multiple
1:33
versions of this-- because it tends to recognize this virus.
1:36
So in the future if we get this virus, those multiple
1:39
versions, those memory cells are going to be there to have
1:42
this interaction.
1:43
This interaction's going to be more likely to happen in the
1:45
future because I'm going to have more of this
1:47
variety of B cell.
1:48
And then you have effector cells.
1:53
And these are essentially-- so both of these are B cells.
1:56
So this guy, once he gets activated, he proliferates,
2:00
keeps dividing and cloning himself.
2:02
The memory cells just stick around waiting to be activated
2:05
in the future.
2:06
And I'm only drawing one of these membrane bound
2:10
antibodies, but there are actually 10,000 on them.
2:13
I mean, I could draw a bunch of these.
2:15
I don't have to just draw one.
2:17
The memories just wade around in the future, but there's
2:19
more of them now.
2:19
So in the future, if we get this virus again, this
2:23
interaction's going to happen faster and so they're going to
2:26
get activated faster.
2:27
And then the effector B cells essentially turn
2:32
into antibody factories.
2:35
This antibody goes in and it says, let me just produce--
2:39
I've been activated.
2:39
Let me produce many, many more versions
2:42
of that exact antibody.
2:44
So they get spit out.
2:46
I drew that one little wrong.
2:48
So that exact antibody, that can then be spit out to go
2:53
disable or tag antigens-- and not just any antigen-- this
2:57
antigen right here.
3:00
And we also saw that the other thing that the B cell does is
3:03
it becomes an antigen presenting cell.
3:06
So what it does is, as soon as it recognizes this, it's had
3:11
this interaction with an antigen that just matches the
3:14
variable portion of its membrane bound antibody.
3:17
It endocytosizes that.
3:19
It brings that into itself.
3:22
It's membrane facilitated so it just kind of pulls it in,
3:25
chunks it up, and then presents a piece of that
3:27
antibody on an MHC II molecule.
3:31
We saw that in the last video.
3:33
So it cuts that up and presents a piece of it right
3:36
there and that's why we call it an antigen presenting cell.
3:39
Now in this video, we're going to talk about why we even have
3:42
these MHC II molecules.
3:44
What are we presenting these antigens to?
3:47
So we're going to start talking about the cell
3:48
mediated-- and actually, even more than the cell mediated,
3:50
we're going to talk about T cells.
3:56
And I said in the first video, they're called T cells because
3:59
they mature in the thymus.
4:07
And there are two types of T cells and it's all very
4:09
confusing because you have B cells and T cells, but then
4:11
there are two types of T cells.
4:13
You have helper T cells-- and most people just write T with
4:18
a lower-case or subscript h there.
4:21
And then you have cytotoxic T cells-- or T cells that kill
4:26
other cells.
4:32
Now just so that you have a big, overarching impression of
4:36
what does what-- B cells.
4:39
When they are activated, they generate antibodies.
4:43
At 30,000 feet, that's the best summary of what an
4:46
activated B cell does.
4:47
It actually generate antibodies.
4:49
Those antibodies attach to viruses and bacteria and other
4:53
types of pathogens and disables them-- either tags
4:55
them so that macrophages can go and eat them up or just by
5:02
throwing all of those antibodies on to the surface
5:06
of the pathogen in question.
5:08
It might disable the pathogens or essentially bundle them
5:11
altogether so that it'll be easier for macrophages to pick
5:14
them up, but this is only effective for things that are
5:17
floating around.
5:19
Free floating antibodies are only effective for things that
5:21
are floating around.
5:24
Cytotoxic T cells, which I'll cover in more detail in a
5:27
future video-- these actually attack cells that have been
5:32
infiltrated.
5:34
So this is attack, kill, infiltrated cells-- and when I
5:42
say infiltrated, it could be a cell that a virus has gone
5:45
into or some bacteria has penetrated it.
5:47
And when I say infiltrated, it doesn't necessarily even mean
5:49
something from the outside.
5:50
It could even be a cancerous cell that shows itself to be
5:53
abnormal in some way and so the cytotoxic T cells will at
5:57
least attempt to kill them.
5:59
But what I want to focus on-- out of the three types of
6:02
lymphocytes-- remember, everything we've been talking
6:06
about was leukocytes, white blood cells, but lymphocytes
6:09
are a subset of that and these three are lymphocytes.
6:12
And they're called that because they began their
6:14
development in the bone marrow.
6:18
So this guy and this guy actually do stuff.
6:24
This guy generates antibodies that attach to pathogens
6:27
floating around.
6:28
This guy directly attacks cells that are
6:31
broken in some way.
6:32
They've either been infiltrated, they're abnormal,
6:34
they're cancerous-- who knows what.
6:36
And I'll do a whole video on that, but that leads us to a
6:39
very obvious question.
6:40
What does this guy do?
6:42
What does the helper T cell do if he doesn't directly
6:47
interface either with pathogens or produce things
6:50
that interface with pathogens-- or if he himself
6:53
doesn't go and directly kill cells?
6:55
And the answer is that the helper T cell's kind of the
6:58
alarm of the immune system.
7:01
And on some level, it's almost the most important.
7:03
So we talked already in the last video about antigen
7:08
presenting cells-- that either when a macrophage or a
7:11
dendritic cell takes things in, it cuts them up and
7:15
presents it on its surface as these MHC II proteins or in
7:19
complex with these MHC II complexes or proteins.
7:24
And so do B cells.
7:27
B cells are more specific.
7:28
Now, once something is presented, now the helper T
7:33
cell can come into the picture.
7:34
So this is a-- let me do a dendritic cell-- and I'm doing
7:39
dendritic cells actually on purpose because dendritic
7:42
cells are actually the best cells at
7:45
activating helper T cells.
7:46
We're going to talk about in a second what happens when a
7:49
helper T cell gets activated.
7:51
So let's say I have this dendritic cell.
7:54
It's called dendritic so it looks like it has
7:55
dendrites on it.
8:01
So I have this dendritic cell here.
8:03
It's a phagocyte.
8:06
Let's say it's already consumed some type of bacteria
8:10
or virus and it's cut it up and now it's presenting kind
8:14
of the body parts of that virus on the MHC II complex.
8:23
It's kind of its way of saying, hey, I found this
8:25
shady thing floating around in the body's tissues.
8:29
Maybe someone ought to raise an alarm.
8:32
Maybe this is part of some type of bigger thing going on
8:35
and some type of alarm bell has to be released.
8:37
And that's what the helper T cell does.
8:40
So let's say this guy-- he's presented it.
8:42
He says, I found this thing.
8:43
I killed it.
8:43
Here's a part of it.
8:44
The helper T cell has a T cell receptor on it.
8:49
Let's say this is the helper T cell right here.
8:55
And it has a T cell receptor on it and the T cell receptors
9:00
bond to-- and I'll be very particular here.
9:03
So this is the T cell receptor.
9:07
It's just like a protein, but like the membrane bound
9:11
antibodies on B cells that every B cell or almost every B
9:16
cell has a different version, different variable chain,
9:18
that's also true of helper T cells-- that just like the B
9:24
cells, this has some variation in where it binds.
9:27
So this right here is going to be variable from one helper T
9:31
cell to another.
9:31
For example, I might have another helper T cell here.
9:35
That also has a T cell receptor, but the variable
9:41
portion on that T cell receptor is different than the
9:47
variable portion on this T cell receptor.
9:49
So this helper T cell will not bind to this dendritic cell or
9:55
the MHC II complex of this dendritic cell.
9:58
Only this one would.
9:59
And the mechanism of how you get this variation is very
10:02
similar to the mechanism in how you get the variation on
10:05
the antibodies and the B cells.
10:07
During these helper T cells' development, at some point the
10:12
genes that code for this part of this receptor get shuffled
10:15
around and they get shuffled around intentionally so that
10:18
each T cell has a certain specificity to a combination
10:23
of an MHC II complex and a certain polypeptide, a certain
10:28
part of a virus.
10:29
So only this guy's going to be activated, not this guy.
10:32
So this is why we call it the specific immune system.
10:35
Now we said, what does that helper T
10:36
cell do at that point?
10:40
He said, hey, I happen to be the one helper T cell that can
10:44
bond to this guy, this antigen that's presented.
10:46
It becomes activated.
10:49
And I won't go into the details, but in general,
10:51
dendritic cells are the best ones at activating it,
10:54
especially a naive T cell.
11:02
In general, when we talk about a naive B cell or a naive
11:05
helper T cell, these are cells that are non-memory,
11:08
non-effector, that have never been touched by-- they've
11:11
never been activated, in the case of a B cell.
11:14
They've never been activated by something binding to their
11:18
membrane bound antibody-- or a naive helper T cell is a
11:23
non-effector, non-memory helper T cell that's never had
11:26
anything bound to it.
11:28
So if this guy is naive and then he finally has a reaction
11:33
with this antigen presenting cell, he becomes non-naive.
11:37
He becomes activated and when activated, two things happen.
11:41
Well, just like with B cells, he proliferates many, many,
11:44
many copies of himself and some subset of those copies
11:48
differentiate into effector cells.
11:54
And effector just means it does something.
11:56
It does something now instead of saving the memory.
12:01
And then some subset of them become memory helper T cells
12:08
after getting activated.
12:12
Now the memory T cells, just like memory B cells-- now you
12:15
have more copies of this.
12:16
So in 10 years in the future, if something like this
12:17
happens, this interaction's going to be
12:19
more likely to happen.
12:20
These guys have the same T cell receptor as their parent.
12:33
It's just that the memory T cells-- or actually even the
12:36
memory B cells-- they last longer.
12:38
They don't kill themselves.
12:39
They'll last for years so that if 10 years later, something
12:42
like this starts presenting itself, you're going to have
12:44
more of these guys around to bump into this guy so that you
12:47
can raise the alarm bells.
12:49
This guy's also going to have the same chain right there.
12:56
So you're saying, fine.
12:57
I have these memory cells.
12:58
They're going to stick around so that this reaction can
13:00
happen in the future, but I still haven't answered the
13:02
question, what does the effector T cell do?
13:05
What the effector T cell does is it raises the alarm.
13:16
So there's an effector T cell.
13:18
It has been activated.
13:22
Remember, this is very particular.
13:23
Only this version of T cells, but once it got activated, it
13:27
produced many copies of itself because it says, hey, I'm
13:29
responding to a particular type of pathogen.
13:32
So that this is a helper T cell.
13:34
This is an effector.
13:37
And what these do is they start releasing these
13:39
molecules called cytokines.
13:42
So they start releasing cytokines.
13:50
There are many, many different types of cytokines and I'm not
13:52
going to go into detail on all that, but what cytokines do is
13:56
that they really raise the alarm.
13:58
So if you have other activated lymphatic cells or other
14:03
activated immunological cells-- when the cytokines
14:07
enter those cells-- remember, cytokines
14:08
are really just proteins.
14:10
When the cytokines enter-- or polypeptides-- when they enter
14:14
those cells, it makes them get in gear.
14:17
It makes them multiply more often or it makes them get
14:21
more active in their immune response.
14:24
So what this does-- these cytokines you can view as
14:26
chemical alarm bells chemical or peptide alarm bells alarm
14:34
bells it it tells everyone to get in gear.
14:38
So that's one role, and so you can see this is actually a
14:40
very central role and it'll tell both activated cytotoxic
14:45
T cells to get in gear, which we haven't talked about yet.
14:47
And it'll also tell B cells to keep proliferating.
14:50
So when an activated B cell gets some of-- so this is an
14:53
activated B cell.
14:55
When it gets some of these cytokines, that maybe come
14:58
from a local helper T cell, it'll tell it, hey no, divide
15:01
more often.
15:02
Divide more often.
15:03
Only if you've been activated already.
15:04
And we'll talk more about why it has to be that case,
15:07
because you don't want all the B cells to be activated.
15:10
And the other thing that the effector T cell does-- in the
15:13
B cell discussion, I said, OK, if I have a B cell, and it has
15:21
its membrane bound antibody, has its
15:24
membrane bound antibody.
15:25
And remember, this is a particular version, it has its
15:29
particular variable chain right here.
15:31
And this guy binds to a pathogen.
15:34
So this binds to a pathogen.
15:36
Maybe it's a virus right there.
15:38
Up to now, I've been saying that this guy's activated.
15:41
And he's going to-- well, when he binds to the pathogen he'll
15:44
take this in and he'll take part of the pathogen and cut
15:49
it up and place it on an MHC II molecule.
15:55
And we said, then he'll be activated.
15:57
He'll proliferate and he'll differentiate into memory and
16:00
effector B cells-- but that's not quite true.
16:02
This first stage happens.
16:04
This guy bonds.
16:05
This B cell happened to be specific to this virus.
16:08
Cuts up the virus.
16:10
Puts parts of the virus on its surface and presents parts of
16:13
the antigen.
16:14
But in most cases, this B cell isn't yet activated.
16:19
You can kind of view it as in its resting state, ready to be
16:22
activated, but it hasn't started proliferating and
16:24
differentiating into effector and memory molecules yet.
16:27
And in order for that to happen, an activated helper T
16:36
cell that is also specific to this very same virus-- so you
16:40
could imagine someplace else in the cell-- this virus was
16:45
eaten by a dendritic cell.
16:52
So this exact same virus, this exact same species of virus,
16:55
is eaten by that dendritic cell and so the dendritic cell
16:59
eats it up, it cuts it up, and then it presents it-- it's
17:05
antigen presenting so it presents it just like that.
17:10
Then this will activate a very specific T
17:12
cell, maybe that one.
17:14
So a very specific T cell will come and bump into it.
17:20
Not just any T cell, the one with the
17:23
right variable portion.
17:24
So think about what's happening.
17:25
The variable portion for this T cell, it connects to this
17:33
part of the virus plus the MHC II, but it's really reacting
17:38
to the same virus.
17:39
It might be a different part.
17:40
This little part that was cut off might be someplace inside
17:43
the virus while the epitope for the B cell might be some
17:47
place on the outside of the virus, but they're both
17:50
specific to the same virus.
17:53
Now once this guy gets activated and he starts
17:56
producing memory and effector cells-- or they're descended
17:59
from him, one of those effector cells specific to
18:02
this virus are needed to come bind to this guy.
18:06
So then this guy could then go along and bump around and
18:09
eventually end up here.
18:11
And he is also specific to this virus.
18:14
So this binding site right here is the same as this
18:16
binding site.
18:17
This combination of antigen plus MHC II.
18:21
And so when this guy binds-- and remember, this binding
18:29
site is the same as this and it only binds to this
18:31
combination right here-- this is what activates the B cell
18:36
in most cases.
18:37
This is T-dependent activation, which
18:41
is usually the case.
18:42
Sometimes all you need is this first thing, but in general
18:45
you need the first thing and then you also need a T cell to
18:48
come and activate it, and only then will the B cell get
18:52
activated and start proliferating and dividing and
18:55
differentiating itself and producing-- when its effector
18:58
cells will produce a lot of antibodies.
19:00
And so there's a natural question.
19:01
Why do biological systems-- or why do we
19:04
have this double system?
19:05
And at least my sense of it is, it's a failsafe mechanism.
19:10
If every time a virus came and attached this, this guy just
19:13
started going crazy and producing antibodies against
19:15
this thing, there's some chance that maybe after
19:20
development, this chain right here or his genes for
19:26
generating these chains become specific, not for foreign
19:30
pathogens, but maybe they become specific for self
19:35
molecules, molecules that are naturally
19:37
produced within the body.
19:38
It's just a random mutation, but if he started going crazy
19:40
for that, his antibodies will start attacking molecules that
19:45
are naturally in the body and then that could really hurt.
19:47
That what causes autoimmune diseases, where your own
19:51
immune cells start activating yourself.
19:53
But if you have this double handshake system where this
19:55
has to happen and this has to happen, the likelihood of both
19:59
of these guys after they leave their development stage
20:03
becoming specific to a self protein or a self cell or a
20:09
self molecule is very unlikely.
20:12
So it kind of inhibits this guy from going wild, even if
20:15
he has some type of a mutation.
20:17
Anyway, hopefully that explains a little bit of what
20:19
helper T cells do.
20:20
We'll talk a lot more about it.
20:22
I know it can be a little bit confusing.
20:23
In the next video, we'll talk about cytotoxic T cells.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,uwMYpTYsNZM,
khan_video_aubZU0iWtgI_379,"Wouldn't the concentration of substances be equal since Sal said that the molecules would continue to diffuse into each other until equilibrium is reached, and doesn't equilibrium mean equal?",Essay,"•
0:00
In this video, I want to cover several topics
0:02
that are all related.
0:03
And on some level, they're really simple, but on a whole
0:05
other level, they tend to confuse people a lot.
0:07
So hopefully we can make some headway.
0:10
So a good place to start-- let's just imagine that I have
0:12
some type of container here.
0:15
Let's say that's my container and inside of that container,
0:18
I have a bunch of water molecules.
0:21
It's just got a bunch of water molecules.
0:24
They're all rubbing against each other.
0:25
It's in its liquid form, this is liquid water.
0:27
and inside of the water molecules, I
0:30
have some sugar molecules.
0:33
Maybe I'll do sugar in this pink color.
0:35
So I have a bunch of sugar molecules right here.
0:40
I have many, many more water molecules though.
0:43
I want to make that clear.
0:49
Now in this type of situation, we call the thing that there's
0:55
more of, the solvent.
1:00
So in this case, there's more water molecules and you can
1:03
literally just view more as the number of molecules.
1:07
I'm not going to go into a whole discussion of moles and
1:10
all of that because you may or may not have been exposed to
1:13
that yet, but just imagine whatever there's more of,
1:15
that's what we're going to call the solvent.
1:17
So in this case, water is the solvent.
1:24
And whatever there is less of-- in this case, that is the
1:30
sugar-- that is considered the solute.
1:36
It doesn't have to be sugar.
1:37
It can be any molecule that there's less of, in the water,
1:40
in this case.
1:45
And we say that the sugar has been dissolved into the water.
2:03
And this whole thing right here, the combination of the
2:06
water and the sugar molecules, we call a solution.
2:10
We call this whole thing a solution.
2:14
And a solution has the solvent and the solute.
2:16
The solvent is water.
2:18
That's the thing doing the dissolving and the thing that
2:21
is dissolved is the sugar.
2:23
That's the solute.
2:24
Now all of this may or may not be review for you, but I'm
2:27
doing it for a reason-- because I want to talk about
2:32
the idea of a diffusion.
2:39
And the idea is actually pretty straightforward.
2:43
If I have, let's say, the same container.
2:46
Let me do it in a slightly different container here, just
2:49
to talk about diffusion.
2:50
We'll go back to water and sugar--
2:52
especially back to water.
2:54
Let's say we have a container here and let's say it just has
2:58
a bunch of-- let's say it just has some air particles in it.
3:00
It could be anything-- oxygen or carbon dioxide.
3:03
So let me just draw a couple of air molecules here.
3:07
So let's say that that is a gaseous-- just for the sake of
3:11
argument-- gaseous oxygen.
3:12
So each of this is an O2-- each of those, right?
3:14
And let's say that this is the current configuration, that
3:16
all of this is a vacuum here and that there's some
3:19
temperatures.
3:20
So these water molecules, they have some
3:22
type of kinetic energy.
3:25
They're moving in some type of random directions right there.
3:29
So my question is, what is going to happen in this type
3:34
of container?
3:35
Well, any of these guys are going to be randomly bumping
3:38
into each other.
3:39
They're more likely to bump into things in this down-left
3:43
direction than they are in the up-right direction.
3:45
So if this guy was happening to go in this down-left
3:47
direction, he's going to bump into something and then
3:50
ricochet into the up-right direction.
3:52
But in the up-right direction, there's
3:53
nothing to bounce into.
3:55
So in general, everything is moving in random directions,
3:57
but you're more likely to be able to move in
4:00
the rightward direction.
4:01
When you go to the left, you're more likely to bump
4:02
into something.
4:04
So it's almost common sense.
4:06
Over time, if you just let this system come to some type
4:09
of equilibrium-- I'm not going to go into detail
4:11
on what that means.
4:12
You can watch the thermodynamics videos if you'd
4:14
like to see that.
4:15
You'll eventually see the container will look
4:18
something like this.
4:19
I can't guarantee it.
4:20
There's some probability it would actually stay like this,
4:22
but very likely that those five particles are going to
4:25
get relatively spread out.
4:27
This is diffusion and so it's really just the spreading of
4:32
particles or molecules from high concentration to low
4:36
concentration areas, right?
4:39
In this case, the molecules are going to spread in that
4:41
direction from a high concentration to a low
4:43
concentration area.
4:45
Now you're saying, Sal, what is concentration?
4:47
And there's many ways to measure concentration and you
4:51
can go into molarity and molality and all of that.
4:54
But the very simple idea is, how much of that particle do
4:57
you have per unit space?
4:59
So here, you have a lot of those particles per unit space
5:02
and here you have very few of those
5:04
particles per unit space.
5:05
So this is a high concentration and that's a low
5:09
concentration.
5:09
So you could imagine other experiments like this.
5:12
You could imagine a solution like-- let's do
5:17
something like this.
5:21
Let's say I have two containers.
5:25
Let's go back to the solution situation.
5:27
This was a gas, but I started off with that example so let's
5:29
stay with that example.
5:31
So let's say that I have a door right there that's larger
5:35
than either the water or the sugar molecules.
5:38
On either side, I have a bunch of water molecules.
5:52
So I have a lot of water molecules.
5:53
So if I just had water molecules here-- they're all
5:55
bouncing around in random directions-- and so the odds
5:58
of a water molecule going this way, equivalent to odds of a
6:01
water molecule going that way, assuming that both sides have
6:04
the same level of water molecule, otherwise the
6:06
pressures would be different.
6:07
But let's say that the top of this is the same
6:10
as the top of this.
6:11
So there's no more pressure going in one
6:12
direction or another.
6:13
So if for whatever reason, a bunch more water molecules
6:17
were going in the rightward direction, then all of a
6:18
sudden this would fill up with more water and we know that
6:20
that isn't likely to occur.
6:22
So this is just two containers of water.
6:28
Now let's put some solute in it.
6:30
Let's dissolve some solute in it and let's say we do all the
6:33
dissolving on the left-hand side.
6:35
So we put some sugar molecules on the left-hand side.
6:40
And these are small enough to fit through this little pipe.
6:42
That's one assumption that I'm making.
6:44
So what's going to happen?
6:45
All of these things have some type of kinetic energy.
6:47
They're all bouncing around.
6:52
Well, over time, the water's going back and forth.
6:56
This water molecule might go that way.
6:57
That water molecule might go that way, but they net each
7:00
other out, but over time one of these big sugar molecules
7:03
will be going in just the right direction to go
7:06
through-- maybe this guy's, instead of going that
7:08
direction, he starts off going in that direction.
7:10
He goes just through this tunnel connecting the two
7:15
containers and he'll end up there, right?
7:18
And this guy will still be bouncing around.
7:20
There's some probability he goes back, but there's still
7:23
more sugar particles here than there.
7:25
So there's still more probability that one of these
7:31
guys will go to that side than one of these guys
7:33
will go to that side.
7:34
So you can imagine if you're doing this with gazillions of
7:36
particles-- I'm only doing it with four-- over time, the
7:40
particles will have spread out so that their concentrations
7:43
are roughly equal.
7:44
So that maybe you'll have two here over time.
7:46
But when you're only dealing with three or four or five
7:49
particles, there's some probability it doesn't happen,
7:51
but when you're doing it with a gazillion and they're super
7:53
small, it's a very, very, very high likelihood.
7:56
But anyway, this whole process-- we went from a
7:59
container of high concentration to a container
8:02
of low concentration and the particles would have spread
8:06
from the low concentration container to the high
8:08
concentration container.
8:09
So they diffused.
8:11
This is diffusion.
8:16
And just so that we learn some other words that tend to be
8:18
used with the idea of diffusion-- when we started
8:21
off, this had a higher concentration.
8:24
The left-hand side container had higher concentration.
8:33
It's all relative, right?
8:34
It's higher than this guy.
8:37
And this right here had a lower concentration.
8:42
And there are words for these things.
8:44
This solution with a high concentration is called a
8:47
hypertonic solution.
8:50
Let me write that in yellow.
8:58
Hyper, in general, meaning having a lot of something,
9:01
having too much of something.
9:02
And this lower concentration is hypotonic.
9:13
You might have heard maybe one of your relatives, if they
9:16
haven't had a meal in awhile say, I'm hypoglycemic.
9:20
That means that they have not-- they're feeling
9:22
lightheaded.
9:22
There's not enough sugar in their bloodstream and they
9:24
want to pass out so they want a meal.
9:26
If you just had a candy bar, maybe you're hyperglycemic--
9:29
or maybe you're just hyper in general.
9:32
So these are just good prefixes to know, but
9:35
hypertonic-- you have a lot of the solute.
9:38
You have a high concentration.
9:40
And then in hypotonic, not too much of the solute so you have
9:44
a low concentration.
9:46
These are good words to know.
9:47
So in general, diffusion-- if there's no barriers to the
9:51
diffusion like we had here, you will have the solute go
9:54
from a high concentration or hypertonic solution if they
9:58
can travel to a hypotonic solution, to a hypo, where the
10:03
concentration is lower.
10:05
Now let's do an interesting experiment here.
10:08
We've talked about diffusion and so far we've been talking
10:10
about the diffusion of the solute, right?
10:14
And in general-- and this is not always the case-- if you
10:17
want to be as general as possible, the solute is
10:19
whatever you have less of, the solvent is whatever
10:22
you have more of.
10:23
And the most common solvent tends to be water, but it
10:26
doesn't have to be water.
10:27
It could be some type of alcohol.
10:28
It could be mercury.
10:31
It could be a whole set of molecules, but water in most
10:34
biological or chemical systems tends to be the
10:38
most typical solvent.
10:39
It's what other things are dissolved into.
10:41
But what happens if we have a tunnel where the solute is too
10:46
big to travel, but water is small enough to travel?
10:51
Let's think about that situation.
10:55
In order to think about it, I'm going to do something
10:57
interesting.
10:58
Let's say we have a container here.
11:02
Actually, I won't even draw a container.
11:03
Let's just say we have an outside environment that has a
11:07
bunch of water.
11:09
This is the outside environment and then you have
11:12
some type of membrane.
11:19
Water can go in and out of this membrane.
11:22
So it's semi-permeable.
11:23
Well, it's permeable to water, but the solute cannot go
11:26
through the membrane.
11:27
So let's say that the solute is sugar.
11:28
So we have water on the outside and
11:33
also inside the membrane.
11:36
So these are little small water molecules.
11:39
This is a membrane right here.
11:43
And let's say that we have some sugar molecules again--
11:46
I'm just picking on sugar.
11:47
It could have been anything.
11:48
So we have some sugar molecules here that are just a
11:51
little bit bigger-- or they could be a lot bigger.
11:55
Actually, they're a lot bigger than water molecules.
11:57
You have a bunch of-- and I only draw four, but you have a
11:59
gazillion of them, right?
12:01
You have that much more water molecules.
12:03
I'm just trying to show you have more water molecules than
12:05
sugar molecules.
12:06
And this membrane is semi-permeable.
12:13
Permeable means it allows things to pass.
12:15
Semi-permeables means it's not completely permeable.
12:18
So semi-permeable-- in this context, I'm saying I allow
12:20
water to pass through the membrane.
12:22
So water can pass, but sugar cannot.
12:28
Sugar is too large.
12:35
So if we were to zoom in on the actual membrane itself--
12:39
maybe the membrane looks like this.
12:40
I'm going to zoom in on this membrane.
12:44
So it has little holes in the membrane, just like that.
12:48
And maybe the water molecules are about that size.
12:51
So they can go through those holes.
12:53
So the water molecules can go back and forth through the
12:56
holes, but the sugar molecules are about that big.
13:01
So they cannot go through that hole.
13:04
They're too big for this opening right here to go back
13:07
and forth between them.
13:08
Now what do you think is going to happen in this situation?
13:12
So first of all, let's use our terminology.
13:14
Remember, sugar is our solute.
13:15
Water is our solvent.
13:17
Semi-permeable membrane.
13:18
Which side of the membrane has a higher or lower
13:21
concentration of solute?
13:24
Well, the inside does.
13:25
The inside is hypertonic.
13:32
The outside has a lower
13:33
concentration so it's hypotonic.
13:44
Now, if these openings were big enough, based on what we
13:47
just talked about-- these guys are bouncing around, water is
13:51
travelling in either direction, and equal
13:53
probability or-- actually I'm going to talk
13:56
about that in a second.
13:58
If everything was wide open, it would be equal probability,
14:01
but if it was wide open, these guys eventually would bounce
14:03
their ways over to this side and you'd probably end up with
14:06
equal concentrations eventually.
14:08
And so you would have your traditional diffusion, where
14:10
high concentration of solute to low
14:13
concentrations of solute.
14:14
But in this case, these guys-- they can't
14:17
fit through the hole.
14:18
Only water can go back and forth.
14:20
If these guys were not here, water would have an equal
14:25
likelihood of going in this direction as they would be
14:28
going in that direction, a completely equal likelihood.
14:33
But because these guys are on the right-hand side of-- or in
14:40
this case, on the inside of our membrane.
14:42
This is our inside of our membrane zoomed up-- it's less
14:47
likely because these guys might be in the approach
14:50
position of the holes-- that's slightly less likely for water
14:55
to be in the approach position for the holes so it's actually
14:58
more probable that water could enter than water exit.
15:02
And I want to make that very clear.
15:04
If these sugar molecules were not here, obviously it's
15:07
equally likely for water to go in either direction.
15:09
Now that these sugar molecules are there, these sugar
15:12
molecules might be on the right-hand side.
15:15
They might be blocking-- I guess the best way to think
15:18
about it is blocking the approach to the hole.
15:20
They'll never be able to go through the hole themselves
15:22
and might not even be blocking the hole, but they're going in
15:24
some random direction.
15:25
So if a water molecule was approaching-- it's all
15:29
probabilistic and we're dealing with gazillions of
15:31
molecules-- it's that much more likely to be blocked to
15:34
get outside.
15:35
But the water molecules from the outside-- there's nothing
15:37
blocking them to get in so you're going to have a flow of
15:40
water inside.
15:41
So in this situation, with a semi-permeable membrane,
15:44
you're going to have water.
15:45
You're going to have a net inward flow of water.
15:49
And so this is kind of interesting.
15:51
We have the solvent flowing from a hypotonic situation to
15:56
a hypertonic solution, but it's only
15:59
hypotonic in the solute.
16:07
But water-- if you flip it the other way-- if you've used
16:11
sugar as the solvent, then you could say, we're going from a
16:15
high concentration of water to a low concentration of water.
16:19
I don't want to confuse you too much.
16:20
This is what tends to confuse people, but just think about
16:23
what's going to happen.
16:24
No matter in what situation, the solution is going to do
16:27
what it can to try to equilibriate the
16:30
concentration.
16:30
To make the concentrations on both
16:32
sides as close as possible.
16:33
And it's not just some magic.
16:35
It's not like the solution knows.
16:36
It's all based on probabilities and these things
16:38
bumping around, but in this situation, water is more
16:41
likely to flow into the container.
16:43
So it's actually going to go from the hypotonic side when
16:46
we talk about low concentration of solute to the
16:50
side that has high concentrations of solute, of
16:53
sugar-- and actually, if this thing is stretchable, more
16:57
water will keep flowing in and this membrane
17:01
will stretch out.
17:04
I won't go to too much detail here, but this idea of water--
17:08
of the solvent-- if in this case, water is the solvent--
17:12
of water as a solvent diffusing through a
17:15
semi-permeable membrane, this is called osmosis.
17:22
You've probably heard learning by osmosis-- if you put a book
17:25
against your head, maybe it'll just seep into your brain.
17:27
Same idea.
17:28
That's where the word comes from.
17:29
This idea of water seeping through membranes to try to
17:33
make concentrations more equal.
17:35
So if you say, well, I have high concentration here, low
17:38
concentration here.
17:39
If there was no membrane here, these big molecules would
17:43
exit, but because there's this semi-permeable membrane here,
17:48
they can't.
17:48
So the system just probabilistically-- no magic
17:52
here-- more water will enter to try to equilibriate
17:56
concentration.
17:57
Eventually-- if maybe there's a few molecules out here-- not
18:01
as high concentration here-- eventually if everything was
18:06
allowed to happen fully, you'll get to the point where
18:08
you have just as many-- you have just as high
18:11
concentration on this side as you have on the right-hand
18:13
side because this right-hand side is going to fill with
18:16
water and also probably become a larger volume.
18:19
And then, once again, the probabilities of a water
18:21
molecule going to the right and to the left will be the
18:23
same and you'll get to some type of equilibrium.
18:25
But I want to make it very clear-- diffusion is the idea
18:29
of any particle going from higher concentration and
18:33
spreading into a region that has a lower concentration and
18:35
just spreading out.
18:36
Osmosis is the diffusion of water.
18:41
And usually you're talking about the diffusion of water
18:44
as a solvent and usually it's in the context of a
18:47
semi-permeable membrane, where the actual solute cannot
18:51
travel through the membrane.
18:53
Anyway, hopefully you've found that useful and
18:55
not completely confusing.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,aubZU0iWtgI,

0:00
In talking about the adaptive immune system, we've already
0:04
seen that there's a couple of actors.
0:16
You have your humoral response.
0:20
So this is responding to things that are floating
0:22
around in the fluids of the body and not necessarily
0:24
things that have infiltrated your body cells and then you
0:27
have your cell mediated response.
0:35
And then in the humoral response-- and we're talking
0:38
about specific humoral response-- this is where the B
0:40
cells, the B lymphocytes are at their most active.
0:45
And essentially what they do is, you got a B cell here.
0:48
It has a very specific antibody, specific to just
0:52
this B cell, not B cells in general.
0:55
If this happens to be the one of the billions of B cells
0:59
that happens to have the matching key-- or maybe I
1:02
should say the matching lock for the key that is the
1:05
intruding pathogen-- that pathogen will
1:09
bind to that B cell.
1:11
Maybe it's a virus, maybe it's a bacteria.
1:14
And then the B cell will get activated and we'll talk about
1:17
in this video that the activation
1:19
doesn't always happen.
1:20
In fact, it usually doesn't happen just from this, but so
1:23
far we've said it gets activated, it goes into memory
1:28
B cells, which are essentially multiple versions of this
1:31
original B cell-- just saying, hey, let's have multiple
1:33
versions of this-- because it tends to recognize this virus.
1:36
So in the future if we get this virus, those multiple
1:39
versions, those memory cells are going to be there to have
1:42
this interaction.
1:43
This interaction's going to be more likely to happen in the
1:45
future because I'm going to have more of this
1:47
variety of B cell.
1:48
And then you have effector cells.
1:53
And these are essentially-- so both of these are B cells.
1:56
So this guy, once he gets activated, he proliferates,
2:00
keeps dividing and cloning himself.
2:02
The memory cells just stick around waiting to be activated
2:05
in the future.
2:06
And I'm only drawing one of these membrane bound
2:10
antibodies, but there are actually 10,000 on them.
2:13
I mean, I could draw a bunch of these.
2:15
I don't have to just draw one.
2:17
The memories just wade around in the future, but there's
2:19
more of them now.
2:19
So in the future, if we get this virus again, this
2:23
interaction's going to happen faster and so they're going to
2:26
get activated faster.
2:27
And then the effector B cells essentially turn
2:32
into antibody factories.
2:35
This antibody goes in and it says, let me just produce--
2:39
I've been activated.
2:39
Let me produce many, many more versions
2:42
of that exact antibody.
2:44
So they get spit out.
2:46
I drew that one little wrong.
2:48
So that exact antibody, that can then be spit out to go
2:53
disable or tag antigens-- and not just any antigen-- this
2:57
antigen right here.
3:00
And we also saw that the other thing that the B cell does is
3:03
it becomes an antigen presenting cell.
3:06
So what it does is, as soon as it recognizes this, it's had
3:11
this interaction with an antigen that just matches the
3:14
variable portion of its membrane bound antibody.
3:17
It endocytosizes that.
3:19
It brings that into itself.
3:22
It's membrane facilitated so it just kind of pulls it in,
3:25
chunks it up, and then presents a piece of that
3:27
antibody on an MHC II molecule.
3:31
We saw that in the last video.
3:33
So it cuts that up and presents a piece of it right
3:36
there and that's why we call it an antigen presenting cell.
3:39
Now in this video, we're going to talk about why we even have
3:42
these MHC II molecules.
3:44
What are we presenting these antigens to?
3:47
So we're going to start talking about the cell
3:48
mediated-- and actually, even more than the cell mediated,
3:50
we're going to talk about T cells.
3:56
And I said in the first video, they're called T cells because
3:59
they mature in the thymus.
4:07
And there are two types of T cells and it's all very
4:09
confusing because you have B cells and T cells, but then
4:11
there are two types of T cells.
4:13
You have helper T cells-- and most people just write T with
4:18
a lower-case or subscript h there.
4:21
And then you have cytotoxic T cells-- or T cells that kill
4:26
other cells.
4:32
Now just so that you have a big, overarching impression of
4:36
what does what-- B cells.
4:39
When they are activated, they generate antibodies.
4:43
At 30,000 feet, that's the best summary of what an
4:46
activated B cell does.
4:47
It actually generate antibodies.
4:49
Those antibodies attach to viruses and bacteria and other
4:53
types of pathogens and disables them-- either tags
4:55
them so that macrophages can go and eat them up or just by
5:02
throwing all of those antibodies on to the surface
5:06
of the pathogen in question.
5:08
It might disable the pathogens or essentially bundle them
5:11
altogether so that it'll be easier for macrophages to pick
5:14
them up, but this is only effective for things that are
5:17
floating around.
5:19
Free floating antibodies are only effective for things that
5:21
are floating around.
5:24
Cytotoxic T cells, which I'll cover in more detail in a
5:27
future video-- these actually attack cells that have been
5:32
infiltrated.
5:34
So this is attack, kill, infiltrated cells-- and when I
5:42
say infiltrated, it could be a cell that a virus has gone
5:45
into or some bacteria has penetrated it.
5:47
And when I say infiltrated, it doesn't necessarily even mean
5:49
something from the outside.
5:50
It could even be a cancerous cell that shows itself to be
5:53
abnormal in some way and so the cytotoxic T cells will at
5:57
least attempt to kill them.
5:59
But what I want to focus on-- out of the three types of
6:02
lymphocytes-- remember, everything we've been talking
6:06
about was leukocytes, white blood cells, but lymphocytes
6:09
are a subset of that and these three are lymphocytes.
6:12
And they're called that because they began their
6:14
development in the bone marrow.
6:18
So this guy and this guy actually do stuff.
6:24
This guy generates antibodies that attach to pathogens
6:27
floating around.
6:28
This guy directly attacks cells that are
6:31
broken in some way.
6:32
They've either been infiltrated, they're abnormal,
6:34
they're cancerous-- who knows what.
6:36
And I'll do a whole video on that, but that leads us to a
6:39
very obvious question.
6:40
What does this guy do?
6:42
What does the helper T cell do if he doesn't directly
6:47
interface either with pathogens or produce things
6:50
that interface with pathogens-- or if he himself
6:53
doesn't go and directly kill cells?
6:55
And the answer is that the helper T cell's kind of the
6:58
alarm of the immune system.
7:01
And on some level, it's almost the most important.
7:03
So we talked already in the last video about antigen
7:08
presenting cells-- that either when a macrophage or a
7:11
dendritic cell takes things in, it cuts them up and
7:15
presents it on its surface as these MHC II proteins or in
7:19
complex with these MHC II complexes or proteins.
7:24
And so do B cells.
7:27
B cells are more specific.
7:28
Now, once something is presented, now the helper T
7:33
cell can come into the picture.
7:34
So this is a-- let me do a dendritic cell-- and I'm doing
7:39
dendritic cells actually on purpose because dendritic
7:42
cells are actually the best cells at
7:45
activating helper T cells.
7:46
We're going to talk about in a second what happens when a
7:49
helper T cell gets activated.
7:51
So let's say I have this dendritic cell.
7:54
It's called dendritic so it looks like it has
7:55
dendrites on it.
8:01
So I have this dendritic cell here.
8:03
It's a phagocyte.
8:06
Let's say it's already consumed some type of bacteria
8:10
or virus and it's cut it up and now it's presenting kind
8:14
of the body parts of that virus on the MHC II complex.
8:23
It's kind of its way of saying, hey, I found this
8:25
shady thing floating around in the body's tissues.
8:29
Maybe someone ought to raise an alarm.
8:32
Maybe this is part of some type of bigger thing going on
8:35
and some type of alarm bell has to be released.
8:37
And that's what the helper T cell does.
8:40
So let's say this guy-- he's presented it.
8:42
He says, I found this thing.
8:43
I killed it.
8:43
Here's a part of it.
8:44
The helper T cell has a T cell receptor on it.
8:49
Let's say this is the helper T cell right here.
8:55
And it has a T cell receptor on it and the T cell receptors
9:00
bond to-- and I'll be very particular here.
9:03
So this is the T cell receptor.
9:07
It's just like a protein, but like the membrane bound
9:11
antibodies on B cells that every B cell or almost every B
9:16
cell has a different version, different variable chain,
9:18
that's also true of helper T cells-- that just like the B
9:24
cells, this has some variation in where it binds.
9:27
So this right here is going to be variable from one helper T
9:31
cell to another.
9:31
For example, I might have another helper T cell here.
9:35
That also has a T cell receptor, but the variable
9:41
portion on that T cell receptor is different than the
9:47
variable portion on this T cell receptor.
9:49
So this helper T cell will not bind to this dendritic cell or
9:55
the MHC II complex of this dendritic cell.
9:58
Only this one would.
9:59
And the mechanism of how you get this variation is very
10:02
similar to the mechanism in how you get the variation on
10:05
the antibodies and the B cells.
10:07
During these helper T cells' development, at some point the
10:12
genes that code for this part of this receptor get shuffled
10:15
around and they get shuffled around intentionally so that
10:18
each T cell has a certain specificity to a combination
10:23
of an MHC II complex and a certain polypeptide, a certain
10:28
part of a virus.
10:29
So only this guy's going to be activated, not this guy.
10:32
So this is why we call it the specific immune system.
10:35
Now we said, what does that helper T
10:36
cell do at that point?
10:40
He said, hey, I happen to be the one helper T cell that can
10:44
bond to this guy, this antigen that's presented.
10:46
It becomes activated.
10:49
And I won't go into the details, but in general,
10:51
dendritic cells are the best ones at activating it,
10:54
especially a naive T cell.
11:02
In general, when we talk about a naive B cell or a naive
11:05
helper T cell, these are cells that are non-memory,
11:08
non-effector, that have never been touched by-- they've
11:11
never been activated, in the case of a B cell.
11:14
They've never been activated by something binding to their
11:18
membrane bound antibody-- or a naive helper T cell is a
11:23
non-effector, non-memory helper T cell that's never had
11:26
anything bound to it.
11:28
So if this guy is naive and then he finally has a reaction
11:33
with this antigen presenting cell, he becomes non-naive.
11:37
He becomes activated and when activated, two things happen.
11:41
Well, just like with B cells, he proliferates many, many,
11:44
many copies of himself and some subset of those copies
11:48
differentiate into effector cells.
11:54
And effector just means it does something.
11:56
It does something now instead of saving the memory.
12:01
And then some subset of them become memory helper T cells
12:08
after getting activated.
12:12
Now the memory T cells, just like memory B cells-- now you
12:15
have more copies of this.
12:16
So in 10 years in the future, if something like this
12:17
happens, this interaction's going to be
12:19
more likely to happen.
12:20
These guys have the same T cell receptor as their parent.
12:33
It's just that the memory T cells-- or actually even the
12:36
memory B cells-- they last longer.
12:38
They don't kill themselves.
12:39
They'll last for years so that if 10 years later, something
12:42
like this starts presenting itself, you're going to have
12:44
more of these guys around to bump into this guy so that you
12:47
can raise the alarm bells.
12:49
This guy's also going to have the same chain right there.
12:56
So you're saying, fine.
12:57
I have these memory cells.
12:58
They're going to stick around so that this reaction can
13:00
happen in the future, but I still haven't answered the
13:02
question, what does the effector T cell do?
13:05
What the effector T cell does is it raises the alarm.
13:16
So there's an effector T cell.
13:18
It has been activated.
13:22
Remember, this is very particular.
13:23
Only this version of T cells, but once it got activated, it
13:27
produced many copies of itself because it says, hey, I'm
13:29
responding to a particular type of pathogen.
13:32
So that this is a helper T cell.
13:34
This is an effector.
13:37
And what these do is they start releasing these
13:39
molecules called cytokines.
13:42
So they start releasing cytokines.
13:50
There are many, many different types of cytokines and I'm not
13:52
going to go into detail on all that, but what cytokines do is
13:56
that they really raise the alarm.
13:58
So if you have other activated lymphatic cells or other
14:03
activated immunological cells-- when the cytokines
14:07
enter those cells-- remember, cytokines
14:08
are really just proteins.
14:10
When the cytokines enter-- or polypeptides-- when they enter
14:14
those cells, it makes them get in gear.
14:17
It makes them multiply more often or it makes them get
14:21
more active in their immune response.
14:24
So what this does-- these cytokines you can view as
14:26
chemical alarm bells chemical or peptide alarm bells alarm
14:34
bells it it tells everyone to get in gear.
14:38
So that's one role, and so you can see this is actually a
14:40
very central role and it'll tell both activated cytotoxic
14:45
T cells to get in gear, which we haven't talked about yet.
14:47
And it'll also tell B cells to keep proliferating.
14:50
So when an activated B cell gets some of-- so this is an
14:53
activated B cell.
14:55
When it gets some of these cytokines, that maybe come
14:58
from a local helper T cell, it'll tell it, hey no, divide
15:01
more often.
15:02
Divide more often.
15:03
Only if you've been activated already.
15:04
And we'll talk more about why it has to be that case,
15:07
because you don't want all the B cells to be activated.
15:10
And the other thing that the effector T cell does-- in the
15:13
B cell discussion, I said, OK, if I have a B cell, and it has
15:21
its membrane bound antibody, has its
15:24
membrane bound antibody.
15:25
And remember, this is a particular version, it has its
15:29
particular variable chain right here.
15:31
And this guy binds to a pathogen.
15:34
So this binds to a pathogen.
15:36
Maybe it's a virus right there.
15:38
Up to now, I've been saying that this guy's activated.
15:41
And he's going to-- well, when he binds to the pathogen he'll
15:44
take this in and he'll take part of the pathogen and cut
15:49
it up and place it on an MHC II molecule.
15:55
And we said, then he'll be activated.
15:57
He'll proliferate and he'll differentiate into memory and
16:00
effector B cells-- but that's not quite true.
16:02
This first stage happens.
16:04
This guy bonds.
16:05
This B cell happened to be specific to this virus.
16:08
Cuts up the virus.
16:10
Puts parts of the virus on its surface and presents parts of
16:13
the antigen.
16:14
But in most cases, this B cell isn't yet activated.
16:19
You can kind of view it as in its resting state, ready to be
16:22
activated, but it hasn't started proliferating and
16:24
differentiating into effector and memory molecules yet.
16:27
And in order for that to happen, an activated helper T
16:36
cell that is also specific to this very same virus-- so you
16:40
could imagine someplace else in the cell-- this virus was
16:45
eaten by a dendritic cell.
16:52
So this exact same virus, this exact same species of virus,
16:55
is eaten by that dendritic cell and so the dendritic cell
16:59
eats it up, it cuts it up, and then it presents it-- it's
17:05
antigen presenting so it presents it just like that.
17:10
Then this will activate a very specific T
17:12
cell, maybe that one.
17:14
So a very specific T cell will come and bump into it.
17:20
Not just any T cell, the one with the
17:23
right variable portion.
17:24
So think about what's happening.
17:25
The variable portion for this T cell, it connects to this
17:33
part of the virus plus the MHC II, but it's really reacting
17:38
to the same virus.
17:39
It might be a different part.
17:40
This little part that was cut off might be someplace inside
17:43
the virus while the epitope for the B cell might be some
17:47
place on the outside of the virus, but they're both
17:50
specific to the same virus.
17:53
Now once this guy gets activated and he starts
17:56
producing memory and effector cells-- or they're descended
17:59
from him, one of those effector cells specific to
18:02
this virus are needed to come bind to this guy.
18:06
So then this guy could then go along and bump around and
18:09
eventually end up here.
18:11
And he is also specific to this virus.
18:14
So this binding site right here is the same as this
18:16
binding site.
18:17
This combination of antigen plus MHC II.
18:21
And so when this guy binds-- and remember, this binding
18:29
site is the same as this and it only binds to this
18:31
combination right here-- this is what activates the B cell
18:36
in most cases.
18:37
This is T-dependent activation, which
18:41
is usually the case.
18:42
Sometimes all you need is this first thing, but in general
18:45
you need the first thing and then you also need a T cell to
18:48
come and activate it, and only then will the B cell get
18:52
activated and start proliferating and dividing and
18:55
differentiating itself and producing-- when its effector
18:58
cells will produce a lot of antibodies.
19:00
And so there's a natural question.
19:01
Why do biological systems-- or why do we
19:04
have this double system?
19:05
And at least my sense of it is, it's a failsafe mechanism.
19:10
If every time a virus came and attached this, this guy just
19:13
started going crazy and producing antibodies against
19:15
this thing, there's some chance that maybe after
19:20
development, this chain right here or his genes for
19:26
generating these chains become specific, not for foreign
19:30
pathogens, but maybe they become specific for self
19:35
molecules, molecules that are naturally
19:37
produced within the body.
19:38
It's just a random mutation, but if he started going crazy
19:40
for that, his antibodies will start attacking molecules that
19:45
are naturally in the body and then that could really hurt.
19:47
That what causes autoimmune diseases, where your own
19:51
immune cells start activating yourself.
19:53
But if you have this double handshake system where this
19:55
has to happen and this has to happen, the likelihood of both
19:59
of these guys after they leave their development stage
20:03
becoming specific to a self protein or a self cell or a
20:09
self molecule is very unlikely.
20:12
So it kind of inhibits this guy from going wild, even if
20:15
he has some type of a mutation.
20:17
Anyway, hopefully that explains a little bit of what
20:19
helper T cells do.
20:20
We'll talk a lot more about it.
20:22
I know it can be a little bit confusing.
20:23
In the next video, we'll talk about cytotoxic T cells.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,uwMYpTYsNZM,
khan_video_TJUm860AjNw_60,"Around 13:30...when systematically naming the iso-butyl group as 1-methylpropyl, thus giving the entire molecule the systematic name of (1-methylpropyl) cyclopentane....is it necessary to include the 1- or is it implied that the methyl group is on the first carbon in your propyl substituent?",Essay,"•
0:00
Let's see if we can get the molecular structure for
0:03
butylcyclopentane.
0:11
So you just break this up the way we've done it in the last
0:13
several videos, the suffix is -ane, so it is an alkane, all
0:18
single bonds.
0:20
So single bonds.
0:25
It's pentane, so we're dealing with five carbons on the base,
0:29
or on the backbone.
0:31
So this is five carbons and it's a cyclopentane, so it's
0:35
five carbons in a ring.
0:37
So its five-carbon ring is the backbone, and then we have a
0:42
butyl group added to that five-carbon ring.
0:45
Now, you might say, hey, Sal, how do I know which
0:46
carbon to add it to?
0:47
When you're dealing with a ring and you only have one
0:50
group on the ring, it doesn't matter.
0:52
Let me just show you what I mean.
0:53
So let's draw the five-carbon ring.
0:55
Let's draw the cyclopentane.
0:57
So it'll just be a pentagon, so one, two, three, four,
1:02
five, and it's a ring, so you can connect them.
1:04
One, two, three, four, five.
1:07
Now, it doesn't matter where I draw the butyl group.
1:09
It's all symmetric around there.
1:11
We just have a ring and it's connected to a butyl group at
1:13
some point.
1:14
It'll start to matter once we add more than one group.
1:16
So we can just pick any of these carbons to add
1:18
the butyl group to.
1:19
Now, just as a review, the but- prefix, that refers to,
1:24
remember, methyl, ethyl, propyl, or meth-,
1:28
eth-, prop-, but-.
1:29
This is four carbons.
1:31
This is a four-carbon alkyl group.
1:35
So let me just add it here.
1:37
I could have added it to any of these carbons around this
1:39
cyclopentane ring.
1:40
So if I just add it right here, so I'm going to have
1:42
four carbons.
1:43
So one, two, three, four.
1:48
That is the butyl part of this whole thing.
1:51
And then let me just attach them up.
1:53
So you might be tempted to just draw this right there.
1:56
And actually, this would be right.
1:57
This is butylcyclopentane.
2:00
But a question might arise.
2:02
I just happened to connect the cyclopentane to the butyl at
2:07
this first carbon on the butyl right there.
2:09
I could have just as easily done it like this.
2:16
I could have just as easily had it like this, where-- let
2:21
me draw my butyl again, so I have one, two, three, four.
2:27
So, once again, this is a butyl, but instead of being
2:30
bonded to the cyclopentane on my first carbon, maybe it's
2:34
bonded right here.
2:37
Let me do it with that yellow color.
2:39
Maybe it's bonded right here.
2:42
This seems like maybe this could also be
2:45
butylcyclopentane.
2:47
It looks like we have a butyl group.
2:49
This is a butyl right here.
2:50
I drew a butyl group right over here, and I also drew a
2:54
butyl group right over here.
2:56
But these are fundamentally two different molecular
2:59
structures.
3:00
I'm touching the first carbon here.
3:01
I'm touching the second carbon over here.
3:03
Now, there's two ways to differentiate this.
3:06
One is the common naming and one is the systematic naming.
3:10
So let me differentiate between the two.
3:12
So in the common naming, and this can get a little bit
3:15
involved, and this frankly is probably the most complicated
3:19
part of naming organic compounds.
3:22
Systematic is often more complicated, but it's easier
3:25
to systematically come up with it.
3:27
So there's a common and then there's a systematic.
3:35
So the common way of doing it is, if you just say
3:38
butylcyclopentane, that implies that you are bonding
3:42
to the first or, depending on how you view it, the last
3:44
carbon in the chain.
3:45
So this right here is butylcyclopentane.
3:47
This right here is not just butylcyclopentane.
3:51
What you would do is you definitely have a cyclopentane
3:54
ring, so this would definitely be a cyclopentane.
3:58
Let me put some space here.
4:01
This is definitely going to be a cyclopentane.
4:06
And you do have a butyl group on it, so we do have a butyl
4:11
group, but because we are bonded-- we aren't bonded to
4:17
the first carbon.
4:18
We're bonded to a carbon that is bonded
4:20
to two other carbons.
4:21
We call this
4:22
sec-butylcyclopentane, so this is sec-.
4:29
And everything I'm doing is obviously free-hand.
4:31
If you were to see this in a book, the sec- would be
4:34
italicized, or sometimes it would be written as
4:38
s-butylcyclopentane.
4:48
And this sec- means that we have attached to a carbon that
4:51
is touching two other carbons.
4:53
So you look at the butyl group, and say, well, which of
4:55
these carbons is attached to two others?
4:56
It's either that one or that one.
4:57
And regardless of whether you're attached to this or
4:59
this, if you think about it, it's fundamentally the same
5:02
molecular structure.
5:04
So that's what you do when you're attached to that guy
5:06
right over there.
5:07
But what about the situation where we're dealing with just
5:09
the common names right here?
5:10
What about the situation where it looks like this?
5:13
So we have our cyclopentane right there, and we have a-- I
5:18
guess we could call it a butyl group.
5:19
It'll have four carbons in it, but let's say that the four
5:23
carbons look something like this.
5:25
Let's say there are four carbons, so we have one, two,
5:30
three, four carbons and we're bonded to this
5:36
one right over here.
5:37
So whenever you're bonded to one end of the four-carbon
5:42
group and it branches off at the other end, and it seems a
5:46
little complicated, this only deals for alkyl groups below
5:50
five or six carbons, this we call an isobutyl group.
5:55
So let me write this down.
5:56
So this right here, is sec-butyl, or s-butyl
6:02
sometimes for short.
6:04
This right here, this right there is iso-butyl.
6:11
It's actually-- iso- that is an iso-butyl group.
6:17
And then the last thing to worry about when you're
6:18
dealing with butyl groups is something like this.
6:24
Let me draw it.
6:26
So you could also draw four carbons like this.
6:28
You have one carbon, two, three, four.
6:30
One, two, three, four carbons and you're attached over here.
6:34
Now this naming, this group right here-- and you're going
6:38
see the systematic naming is much
6:39
easier for these compounds.
6:41
This group right here, over here the carbon you're
6:44
attached to is attached to two other
6:45
carbons, so it is sec-butyl.
6:49
When you're attached to three carbons, it is t-butyl, or
6:52
tert-butyl, so this right here is a tert-butyl group, or
7:00
sometimes called a t-butyl.
7:02
And I really want you to understand
7:03
the difference here.
7:04
The common naming, it's easier to say and easier to spell,
7:07
but it's sometimes a little confusing.
7:08
This is just straight up butyl so you would call this
7:11
butylcyclopentane.
7:13
This is sec-butyl, because you have this guy
7:16
connected to two carbons.
7:17
That's where the sec- comes from.
7:21
Sometimes it'll be s-butyl.
7:22
So this could be called sec-butylcyclopentane or
7:27
s-butylcyclopentane.
7:29
This, because we're attached to the end away from this
7:32
branching off, is still a butyl group, since we have
7:35
four carbons.
7:36
But since we're attached here, this is iso-butyl, so this is
7:39
iso-butylcyclopentane,
7:41
And then finally, since the carbon we're attaching to is
7:44
attached to one, two, three other carbons, it is a
7:48
tert-butyl or a t-butyl group.
7:50
So this is t-butylcyclopentane.
7:54
That's the common naming.
7:55
So maybe I should clear out systematic here just so it's
7:57
clear to you that everything we've done
8:01
here is common naming.
8:04
So let me write it down.
8:05
It won't hurt to write them down again because the more
8:08
familiar you are with these, the better.
8:10
So this is just butylcyclopentane.
8:18
This is s- or sec- butylcyclopentane.
8:26
And this is iso-butylcyclopentane.
8:37
I'm going off the screen here.
8:38
And then finally, this is tert-butyl, or
8:41
t-butylcyclopentane.
8:45
Now, I said these are the common naming.
8:48
What are the systematic naming?
8:50
Well, in the systematic, this is still butylcyclopentane.
8:54
So let me write this down.
8:55
Systematic, this is still
9:01
butylcyclopentane, which makes sense.
9:02
This is very clearly a cyclopentane.
9:05
This is very clearly a butyl group.
9:08
But in the systematic naming, what we try to do is we try to
9:11
name this group right here just as we would name a
9:16
traditional chain, but we ended it with an -yl.
9:19
So if you look at this right here, what we do is we just
9:22
consider the chain where we attach.
9:26
We attached over here, so the longest chain from that point
9:30
is there and there.
9:33
So if you look at it like that, it looks like you have
9:35
one, two, three carbons, and you have one carbon attached
9:39
on the beginning.
9:40
So this little group right here in the systematic naming,
9:43
this looks like a one, two, three.
9:45
Three carbons, that's the prop- prefix, so we're dealing
9:49
with a prop-, and it's all going to be one group, so it's
9:52
a propyl group.
9:54
This is a propyl group, but it has a methyl-- remember, meth-
9:59
is one carbon.
10:00
It has a methyl group attached on the first carbon.
10:03
So this is 1-methylpropyl.
10:11
Now, that describes just the group.
10:15
1-methylpropyl describes just this part right here.
10:18
That describes just that right over there.
10:21
And then to have the whole compound, to describe the
10:25
whole compound, you put this in parentheses, so this is the
10:27
systematic naming.
10:29
So 1-methyl-- I put an L there.
10:33
Let me do it in the same color.
10:34
1-methyl, because you're starting
10:38
where you're attaching.
10:39
So 1-methyl, you have a methyl group right there on that
10:43
first carbon.
10:44
It's a propyl chain.
10:45
One, two, three, propyl, and then you would say
10:48
cyclopentane.
10:54
That's the systematic name for that.
10:56
Now if you look at this one right here, and the common
10:59
name is iso-butyl, what you do is you
11:01
look at where we attach.
11:03
Where we attached is one, two, three carbons.
11:07
So once again, I'm doing that same one, two, three carbons.
11:11
So once again, this is a propyl.
11:15
Prop- is for three, but with a methyl group now is attached
11:19
to the one, two, the second carbon.
11:23
So this is 2-methyl.
11:26
Let me make some space here.
11:28
This is 2-methyl.
11:31
So that describes this group right here.
11:34
That describes this entire group cyclopentane.
11:39
Remember, this is a systematic name.
11:41
You might sometimes see this referred to as
11:43
iso-butylcyclopentane or 2-methylpropylcyclopentane.
11:47
And this is actually a -yl.
11:48
I spelled it wrong.
11:50
And then finally, we do the same exact idea here, but it
11:53
becomes a little bit more interesting.
11:55
Over here, we are attached to this carbon and the longest
11:59
chain I can do starting with that carbon is just one chain
12:03
right there.
12:04
So we just have a two-carbon chain, right?
12:06
One, two.
12:07
The prefix for a two carbon is ethyl, or eth-.
12:11
Eth-, and since it's a group, ethyl.
12:14
And then we have two methyl groups attached right over
12:22
there, and it's attached on the one carbon, right?
12:25
This is one and this is two.
12:27
We call the one carbon where we are attached
12:29
to the broader chain.
12:30
So what this is going to be, you would actually write one
12:34
comma one to show that we have two groups attached to the
12:36
first carbon and both of them are methyl.
12:40
So we write 1,1-dimethyl, di- for two, dimethyl.
12:48
So this entire group right here, which we also called
12:50
t-butyl, in systematic naming is 1,1-.
12:53
We have two groups attached to this first carbon.
12:56
1,1-dimethylethyl.
12:58
That's this whole thing.
12:59
This is the ethyl, and then we have two methyls attached
13:02
there. that's why we write 1,1-.
13:03
They're both attached to the one.
13:04
We have two of them.
13:06
That's why we wrote di- over there.
13:08
So it's 1,1-dimethylethyl- and then finally, cyclopentane.
13:15
So hopefully, that doesn't confuse you too much.
13:16
I think if you watch the video over and over and try to
13:18
practice it with your own problems, you'll see that the
13:20
systematic name way is actually
13:22
pretty, pretty logical.
13:23
And actually, if you have more than five or six carbons in
13:26
the group, they always or they tend to always use the
13:29
systematic naming.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,TJUm860AjNw,

0:00
In the last video, we talked a little bit
0:02
about the immune system.
0:04
In that video, we focused on the nonspecific or the innate
0:09
immune system.
0:10
So let me write that.
0:17
And even in the nonspecific immune system, we subdivided
0:20
that into kind of the first line barriers.
0:24
And those were things like the skin, or the stomach acid, or
0:30
the acidity of the oils on the outside of your skin.
0:33
These are just natural barriers to not allowing
0:35
things inside of your body, but then once they get in-- so
0:38
you can almost imagine these were the
0:39
first line of defense.
0:42
And then you had your second line of defense, but these are
0:45
still nonspecific-- and when we say nonspecific, it means
0:48
that they don't necessarily know what type of virus, what
0:51
type of protein, what type of bacteria.
0:53
They just know that this thing looks shady.

Let me eat it up.
0:56
Let me kill it.
0:56
Let me have an inflammatory response.
0:59
So in there, we said, well, there's an inflammatory
1:01
response, which I'm actually going to talk about after we
1:06
do videos on the specific immune system.
1:09
You have your inflammatory response, which really just
1:11
gets things to where the action is at and then you also
1:14
have your phagocytes, which are these cells that are
1:20
engulfing things.
1:22
And just so you know, all the phagocytes that we talked
1:24
about in the last video, these are all instances of white
1:29
blood cells or leukocytes.
1:35
These phagocytes right here, these are all-- I talk about
1:38
dendritic cells and macrophages and neutrophils.
1:43
These were all white blood cells.
1:45
These weren't all the kinds of white blood cells.
1:47
We're about to talk about more-- and the other word for
1:50
white blood cell is also leukocyte.
1:55
So that is nonspecific.
1:57
Well, one, it just doesn't let you in, but then when you're
1:59
in, it says, hey, you're just shady.
2:01
I'm going to eat you up.
2:02
I have receptors.
2:03
You have some double stranded DNA floating around.
2:06
Only viruses have double strand DNA.
2:08
I'm going to eat you up.
2:08
I don't know what type of virus you are.
2:10
I don't know if I've seen you before or not.
2:12
That's why it's nonspecific.
2:14
Now the really interesting thing about our immune
2:16
system-- and this nonspecific, this exists across many, many,
2:22
many species and types of organisms. But the specific is
2:28
kind of a-- it's thought to be a newer adaptation.
2:32
What I'm going to talk about is the specific immune system
2:34
that's particular to humans.
2:41
That's our other classification.
2:42
Let me do it like that.
2:45
So then you have your specific-- or you can imagine
2:50
it's an adaptive immune system.
2:52
You've probably heard of things like that.
2:54
I have resistance to that bacteria or that virus.
3:00
So this is adaptive.
3:03
And it's really all based on having exposure to things.
3:06
And within the specific immune system, we talked a little--
3:12
when we talked about the antigen presenting molecules
3:16
that phagocytes do-- that plays a role in this.
3:18
We're going to go into more detail, but I don't want to
3:20
confuse you.
3:21
But the main actors here are called lymphocytes, not to be
3:24
confused with leukocytes-- because they still are
3:26
leukocytes.
3:28
So let me write this down.
3:38
These are specific.
3:40
Phagocytes, for the most part, are nonspecific, but both of
3:44
these are white blood cells.
3:45
Lymphocytes are another type of white
3:47
blood cell or leukocyte.
3:49
Don't want to confuse you with this convoluted diagram, but I
3:53
just want to make the terminology clear.
3:54
When someone talks about a white blood cell, they're
3:56
really just talking about a set of cells that when people
3:58
first tried to separate the components of blood-- you'd
4:01
have your red blood cells that would kind of settle in the
4:03
bottom, then you'd have this layer of white frothy stuff in
4:06
the middle that was really made of white blood cells, and
4:08
then on the top, you had the fluid, the plasma from your
4:11
blood, kind of the watery part.
4:13
So that's where the name came from, but they have different
4:15
roles, but they interact with each other.
4:17
Now lymphocytes can be divided into B lymphocytes, usually
4:24
referred to as B cells-- and T lymphocytes.
4:36
And the B and T just come from where they're developed.
4:39
B lymphocytes were first recognized in
4:42
the bursa of Fabricius.
4:44
That's why it's called B.
4:45
That's actually a part of birds that participate in the
4:48
immune system.
4:49
And so the B came from bursa, but B also applies to the
4:52
human immune system because it's produced in bone marrow.
4:56
So that might be an easier way to remember.
4:58
It's produced in bone marrow.
5:01
It's developed in bone marrow, but historically, the B came
5:08
from the bursa of Fabricius, just in case you want to know.
5:11
But it's easy to remember.
5:12
The B could also stand for bone marrow because that's
5:14
where it's produced.
5:16
T lymphocytes actually do start off in the bone marrow,
5:18
but they mature and become what they are in the thymus.
5:22
So that's where the T comes from.
5:26
Now in this video, I'm going to focus just on the B
5:29
lymphocytes-- because frankly, if I focused on everything, it
5:31
would be an hour-long video.
5:32
But the B lymphocytes frankly on some level-- well, I don't
5:36
want to pick and choose favorites, but something in my
5:39
brain-- I just really like the B lymphocytes.
5:41
So the B lymphocytes participate in what's called
5:44
the humoral response.
5:49
And I'll tell you what humoral means in a second.
5:58
You'll see that T lymphocytes participate in what's called
6:00
the cell mediated response and we're going to do that in a
6:02
future video.
6:07
They actually do certain classes of T lymphocytes.
6:10
We'll see that there are helper T cells and there are
6:15
cytotoxic T cells.
6:16
I know it's all very confusing the first time you see it, but
6:19
that's why I just want to focus on just
6:21
this part right here.
6:22
We're going to see in the future that the helper T cells
6:25
play a role in amplifying and really activating
6:28
this humoral response.
6:30
But a simple way to think about the difference between
6:33
the humoral response and the cell mediated response is,
6:36
when I get infected-- let's say I get
6:38
infected by a virus, right?
6:45
At first, when a virus comes into my system, it's just
6:48
floating around in the fluids in my system.
6:51
The fluids of our system-- that's really what humoral
6:54
responds to, into the humoral fluids of your body.
6:59
So you have your viruses.
7:05
These are little viruses floating around.
7:08
So while they're floating around and they're not sitting
7:11
inside of cells, that's where the humoral response
7:17
can come into play.
7:18
Same thing if we have little bacteria floating around and
7:22
they haven't infiltrated cells yet.
7:23
They're just floating around in the fluid, then the humoral
7:27
response can be useful for that.
7:31
Now if all of a sudden, these guys have infiltrated cells--
7:37
so if the cells are now infected with the virus and
7:40
they're producing the viruses using the mechanisms of the
7:43
cell to produce more, then all of a sudden we have to be a
7:46
little bit more sophisticated in how we deal with these
7:49
cells and how we deal with the viruses because they're not
7:52
just going to be floating around anymore.
7:53
We probably want to just kill this cell even though it was
7:56
one of our own, but now it's helping to make viruses.
7:59
Or maybe it's been colonized by bacteria.
8:02
So in either case, you want to kill this.
8:03
And we'll talk more about that in the cell mediating.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,rp7T4IItbtM,

0:00
In this video, I want to cover several topics
0:02
that are all related.
0:03
And on some level, they're really simple, but on a whole
0:05
other level, they tend to confuse people a lot.
0:07
So hopefully we can make some headway.
0:10
So a good place to start-- let's just imagine that I have
0:12
some type of container here.
0:15
Let's say that's my container and inside of that container,
0:18
I have a bunch of water molecules.
0:21
It's just got a bunch of water molecules.
0:24
They're all rubbing against each other.
0:25
It's in its liquid form, this is liquid water.
0:27
and inside of the water molecules, I
0:30
have some sugar molecules.
0:33
Maybe I'll do sugar in this pink color.
0:35
So I have a bunch of sugar molecules right here.
0:40
I have many, many more water molecules though.
0:43
I want to make that clear.
0:49
Now in this type of situation, we call the thing that there's
0:55
more of, the solvent.
1:00
So in this case, there's more water molecules and you can
1:03
literally just view more as the number of molecules.
1:07
I'm not going to go into a whole discussion of moles and
1:10
all of that because you may or may not have been exposed to
1:13
that yet, but just imagine whatever there's more of,
1:15
that's what we're going to call the solvent.
1:17
So in this case, water is the solvent.
1:24
And whatever there is less of-- in this case, that is the
1:30
sugar-- that is considered the solute.
1:36
It doesn't have to be sugar.
1:37
It can be any molecule that there's less of, in the water,
1:40
in this case.
1:45
And we say that the sugar has been dissolved into the water.
2:03
And this whole thing right here, the combination of the
2:06
water and the sugar molecules, we call a solution.
2:10
We call this whole thing a solution.
2:14
And a solution has the solvent and the solute.
2:16
The solvent is water.
2:18
That's the thing doing the dissolving and the thing that
2:21
is dissolved is the sugar.
2:23
That's the solute.
2:24
Now all of this may or may not be review for you, but I'm
2:27
doing it for a reason-- because I want to talk about
2:32
the idea of a diffusion.
2:39
And the idea is actually pretty straightforward.
2:43
If I have, let's say, the same container.
2:46
Let me do it in a slightly different container here, just
2:49
to talk about diffusion.
2:50
We'll go back to water and sugar--
2:52
especially back to water.
2:54
Let's say we have a container here and let's say it just has
2:58
a bunch of-- let's say it just has some air particles in it.
3:00
It could be anything-- oxygen or carbon dioxide.
3:03
So let me just draw a couple of air molecules here.
3:07
So let's say that that is a gaseous-- just for the sake of
3:11
argument-- gaseous oxygen.
3:12
So each of this is an O2-- each of those, right?
3:14
And let's say that this is the current configuration, that
3:16
all of this is a vacuum here and that there's some
3:19
temperatures.
3:20
So these water molecules, they have some
3:22
type of kinetic energy.
3:25
They're moving in some type of random directions right there.
3:29
So my question is, what is going to happen in this type
3:34
of container?
3:35
Well, any of these guys are going to be randomly bumping
3:38
into each other.
3:39
They're more likely to bump into things in this down-left
3:43
direction than they are in the up-right direction.
3:45
So if this guy was happening to go in this down-left
3:47
direction, he's going to bump into something and then
3:50
ricochet into the up-right direction.
3:52
But in the up-right direction, there's
3:53
nothing to bounce into.
3:55
So in general, everything is moving in random directions,
3:57
but you're more likely to be able to move in
4:00
the rightward direction.
4:01
When you go to the left, you're more likely to bump
4:02
into something.
4:04
So it's almost common sense.
4:06
Over time, if you just let this system come to some type
4:09
of equilibrium-- I'm not going to go into detail
4:11
on what that means.
4:12
You can watch the thermodynamics videos if you'd
4:14
like to see that.
4:15
You'll eventually see the container will look
4:18
something like this.
4:19
I can't guarantee it.
4:20
There's some probability it would actually stay like this,
4:22
but very likely that those five particles are going to
4:25
get relatively spread out.
4:27
This is diffusion and so it's really just the spreading of
4:32
particles or molecules from high concentration to low
4:36
concentration areas, right?
4:39
In this case, the molecules are going to spread in that
4:41
direction from a high concentration to a low
4:43
concentration area.
4:45
Now you're saying, Sal, what is concentration?
4:47
And there's many ways to measure concentration and you
4:51
can go into molarity and molality and all of that.
4:54
But the very simple idea is, how much of that particle do
4:57
you have per unit space?
4:59
So here, you have a lot of those particles per unit space
5:02
and here you have very few of those
5:04
particles per unit space.
5:05
So this is a high concentration and that's a low
5:09
concentration.
5:09
So you could imagine other experiments like this.
5:12
You could imagine a solution like-- let's do
5:17
something like this.
5:21
Let's say I have two containers.
5:25
Let's go back to the solution situation.
5:27
This was a gas, but I started off with that example so let's
5:29
stay with that example.
5:31
So let's say that I have a door right there that's larger
5:35
than either the water or the sugar molecules.
5:38
On either side, I have a bunch of water molecules.
5:52
So I have a lot of water molecules.
5:53
So if I just had water molecules here-- they're all
5:55
bouncing around in random directions-- and so the odds
5:58
of a water molecule going this way, equivalent to odds of a
6:01
water molecule going that way, assuming that both sides have
6:04
the same level of water molecule, otherwise the
6:06
pressures would be different.
6:07
But let's say that the top of this is the same
6:10
as the top of this.
6:11
So there's no more pressure going in one
6:12
direction or another.
6:13
So if for whatever reason, a bunch more water molecules
6:17
were going in the rightward direction, then all of a
6:18
sudden this would fill up with more water and we know that
6:20
that isn't likely to occur.
6:22
So this is just two containers of water.
6:28
Now let's put some solute in it.
6:30
Let's dissolve some solute in it and let's say we do all the
6:33
dissolving on the left-hand side.
6:35
So we put some sugar molecules on the left-hand side.
6:40
And these are small enough to fit through this little pipe.
6:42
That's one assumption that I'm making.
6:44
So what's going to happen?
6:45
All of these things have some type of kinetic energy.
6:47
They're all bouncing around.
6:52
Well, over time, the water's going back and forth.
6:56
This water molecule might go that way.
6:57
That water molecule might go that way, but they net each
7:00
other out, but over time one of these big sugar molecules
7:03
will be going in just the right direction to go
7:06
through-- maybe this guy's, instead of going that
7:08
direction, he starts off going in that direction.
7:10
He goes just through this tunnel connecting the two
7:15
containers and he'll end up there, right?
7:18
And this guy will still be bouncing around.
7:20
There's some probability he goes back, but there's still
7:23
more sugar particles here than there.
7:25
So there's still more probability that one of these
7:31
guys will go to that side than one of these guys
7:33
will go to that side.
7:34
So you can imagine if you're doing this with gazillions of
7:36
particles-- I'm only doing it with four-- over time, the
7:40
particles will have spread out so that their concentrations
7:43
are roughly equal.
7:44
So that maybe you'll have two here over time.
7:46
But when you're only dealing with three or four or five
7:49
particles, there's some probability it doesn't happen,
7:51
but when you're doing it with a gazillion and they're super
7:53
small, it's a very, very, very high likelihood.
7:56
But anyway, this whole process-- we went from a
7:59
container of high concentration to a container
8:02
of low concentration and the particles would have spread
8:06
from the low concentration container to the high
8:08
concentration container.
8:09
So they diffused.
8:11
This is diffusion.
8:16
And just so that we learn some other words that tend to be
8:18
used with the idea of diffusion-- when we started
8:21
off, this had a higher concentration.
8:24
The left-hand side container had higher concentration.
8:33
It's all relative, right?
8:34
It's higher than this guy.
8:37
And this right here had a lower concentration.
8:42
And there are words for these things.
8:44
This solution with a high concentration is called a
8:47
hypertonic solution.
8:50
Let me write that in yellow.
8:58
Hyper, in general, meaning having a lot of something,
9:01
having too much of something.
9:02
And this lower concentration is hypotonic.
9:13
You might have heard maybe one of your relatives, if they
9:16
haven't had a meal in awhile say, I'm hypoglycemic.
9:20
That means that they have not-- they're feeling
9:22
lightheaded.
9:22
There's not enough sugar in their bloodstream and they
9:24
want to pass out so they want a meal.
9:26
If you just had a candy bar, maybe you're hyperglycemic--
9:29
or maybe you're just hyper in general.
9:32
So these are just good prefixes to know, but
9:35
hypertonic-- you have a lot of the solute.
9:38
You have a high concentration.
9:40
And then in hypotonic, not too much of the solute so you have
9:44
a low concentration.
9:46
These are good words to know.
9:47
So in general, diffusion-- if there's no barriers to the
9:51
diffusion like we had here, you will have the solute go
9:54
from a high concentration or hypertonic solution if they
9:58
can travel to a hypotonic solution, to a hypo, where the
10:03
concentration is lower.
10:05
Now let's do an interesting experiment here.
10:08
We've talked about diffusion and so far we've been talking
10:10
about the diffusion of the solute, right?
10:14
And in general-- and this is not always the case-- if you
10:17
want to be as general as possible, the solute is
10:19
whatever you have less of, the solvent is whatever
10:22
you have more of.
10:23
And the most common solvent tends to be water, but it
10:26
doesn't have to be water.
10:27
It could be some type of alcohol.
10:28
It could be mercury.
10:31
It could be a whole set of molecules, but water in most
10:34
biological or chemical systems tends to be the
10:38
most typical solvent.
10:39
It's what other things are dissolved into.
10:41
But what happens if we have a tunnel where the solute is too
10:46
big to travel, but water is small enough to travel?
10:51
Let's think about that situation.
10:55
In order to think about it, I'm going to do something
10:57
interesting.
10:58
Let's say we have a container here.
11:02
Actually, I won't even draw a container.
11:03
Let's just say we have an outside environment that has a
11:07
bunch of water.
11:09
This is the outside environment and then you have
11:12
some type of membrane.
11:19
Water can go in and out of this membrane.
11:22
So it's semi-permeable.
11:23
Well, it's permeable to water, but the solute cannot go
11:26
through the membrane.
11:27
So let's say that the solute is sugar.
11:28
So we have water on the outside and
11:33
also inside the membrane.
11:36
So these are little small water molecules.
11:39
This is a membrane right here.
11:43
And let's say that we have some sugar molecules again--
11:46
I'm just picking on sugar.
11:47
It could have been anything.
11:48
So we have some sugar molecules here that are just a
11:51
little bit bigger-- or they could be a lot bigger.
11:55
Actually, they're a lot bigger than water molecules.
11:57
You have a bunch of-- and I only draw four, but you have a
11:59
gazillion of them, right?
12:01
You have that much more water molecules.
12:03
I'm just trying to show you have more water molecules than
12:05
sugar molecules.
12:06
And this membrane is semi-permeable.
12:13
Permeable means it allows things to pass.
12:15
Semi-permeables means it's not completely permeable.
12:18
So semi-permeable-- in this context, I'm saying I allow
12:20
water to pass through the membrane.
12:22
So water can pass, but sugar cannot.
12:28
Sugar is too large.
12:35
So if we were to zoom in on the actual membrane itself--
12:39
maybe the membrane looks like this.
12:40
I'm going to zoom in on this membrane.
12:44
So it has little holes in the membrane, just like that.
12:48
And maybe the water molecules are about that size.
12:51
So they can go through those holes.
12:53
So the water molecules can go back and forth through the
12:56
holes, but the sugar molecules are about that big.
13:01
So they cannot go through that hole.
13:04
They're too big for this opening right here to go back
13:07
and forth between them.
13:08
Now what do you think is going to happen in this situation?
13:12
So first of all, let's use our terminology.
13:14
Remember, sugar is our solute.
13:15
Water is our solvent.
13:17
Semi-permeable membrane.
13:18
Which side of the membrane has a higher or lower
13:21
concentration of solute?
13:24
Well, the inside does.
13:25
The inside is hypertonic.
13:32
The outside has a lower
13:33
concentration so it's hypotonic.
13:44
Now, if these openings were big enough, based on what we
13:47
just talked about-- these guys are bouncing around, water is
13:51
travelling in either direction, and equal
13:53
probability or-- actually I'm going to talk
13:56
about that in a second.
13:58
If everything was wide open, it would be equal probability,
14:01
but if it was wide open, these guys eventually would bounce
14:03
their ways over to this side and you'd probably end up with
14:06
equal concentrations eventually.
14:08
And so you would have your traditional diffusion, where
14:10
high concentration of solute to low
14:13
concentrations of solute.
14:14
But in this case, these guys-- they can't
14:17
fit through the hole.
14:18
Only water can go back and forth.
14:20
If these guys were not here, water would have an equal
14:25
likelihood of going in this direction as they would be
14:28
going in that direction, a completely equal likelihood.
14:33
But because these guys are on the right-hand side of-- or in
14:40
this case, on the inside of our membrane.
14:42
This is our inside of our membrane zoomed up-- it's less
14:47
likely because these guys might be in the approach
14:50
position of the holes-- that's slightly less likely for water
14:55
to be in the approach position for the holes so it's actually
14:58
more probable that water could enter than water exit.
15:02
And I want to make that very clear.
15:04
If these sugar molecules were not here, obviously it's
15:07
equally likely for water to go in either direction.
15:09
Now that these sugar molecules are there, these sugar
15:12
molecules might be on the right-hand side.
15:15
They might be blocking-- I guess the best way to think
15:18
about it is blocking the approach to the hole.
15:20
They'll never be able to go through the hole themselves
15:22
and might not even be blocking the hole, but they're going in
15:24
some random direction.
15:25
So if a water molecule was approaching-- it's all
15:29
probabilistic and we're dealing with gazillions of
15:31
molecules-- it's that much more likely to be blocked to
15:34
get outside.
15:35
But the water molecules from the outside-- there's nothing
15:37
blocking them to get in so you're going to have a flow of
15:40
water inside.
15:41
So in this situation, with a semi-permeable membrane,
15:44
you're going to have water.
15:45
You're going to have a net inward flow of water.
15:49
And so this is kind of interesting.
15:51
We have the solvent flowing from a hypotonic situation to
15:56
a hypertonic solution, but it's only
15:59
hypotonic in the solute.
16:07
But water-- if you flip it the other way-- if you've used
16:11
sugar as the solvent, then you could say, we're going from a
16:15
high concentration of water to a low concentration of water.
16:19
I don't want to confuse you too much.
16:20
This is what tends to confuse people, but just think about
16:23
what's going to happen.
16:24
No matter in what situation, the solution is going to do
16:27
what it can to try to equilibriate the
16:30
concentration.
16:30
To make the concentrations on both
16:32
sides as close as possible.
16:33
And it's not just some magic.
16:35
It's not like the solution knows.
16:36
It's all based on probabilities and these things
16:38
bumping around, but in this situation, water is more
16:41
likely to flow into the container.
16:43
So it's actually going to go from the hypotonic side when
16:46
we talk about low concentration of solute to the
16:50
side that has high concentrations of solute, of
16:53
sugar-- and actually, if this thing is stretchable, more
16:57
water will keep flowing in and this membrane
17:01
will stretch out.
17:04
I won't go to too much detail here, but this idea of water--
17:08
of the solvent-- if in this case, water is the solvent--
17:12
of water as a solvent diffusing through a
17:15
semi-permeable membrane, this is called osmosis.
17:22
You've probably heard learning by osmosis-- if you put a book
17:25
against your head, maybe it'll just seep into your brain.
17:27
Same idea.
17:28
That's where the word comes from.
17:29
This idea of water seeping through membranes to try to
17:33
make concentrations more equal.
17:35
So if you say, well, I have high concentration here, low
17:38
concentration here.
17:39
If there was no membrane here, these big molecules would
17:43
exit, but because there's this semi-permeable membrane here,
17:48
they can't.
17:48
So the system just probabilistically-- no magic
17:52
here-- more water will enter to try to equilibriate
17:56
concentration.
17:57
Eventually-- if maybe there's a few molecules out here-- not
18:01
as high concentration here-- eventually if everything was
18:06
allowed to happen fully, you'll get to the point where
18:08
you have just as many-- you have just as high
18:11
concentration on this side as you have on the right-hand
18:13
side because this right-hand side is going to fill with
18:16
water and also probably become a larger volume.
18:19
And then, once again, the probabilities of a water
18:21
molecule going to the right and to the left will be the
18:23
same and you'll get to some type of equilibrium.
18:25
But I want to make it very clear-- diffusion is the idea
18:29
of any particle going from higher concentration and
18:33
spreading into a region that has a lower concentration and
18:35
just spreading out.
18:36
Osmosis is the diffusion of water.
18:41
And usually you're talking about the diffusion of water
18:44
as a solvent and usually it's in the context of a
18:47
semi-permeable membrane, where the actual solute cannot
18:51
travel through the membrane.

Young man: I'm gonna be totally honest with you.
0:03
I don't really spend a lot of time thinking
0:04
about my bodily functions for the most part - maybe sometimes.
0:08
But in the next few episodes,
0:09
I'm going to be talking about all
0:10
of the organ systems that make our lives possible,
0:13
even occasionally pleasant.
0:15
To start it all off, I'm going
0:17
to go straight to mission control - the nervous system.
0:20
(bouncy music)
0:30
Pretty much every single animal,
0:31
except for some really simple ones,
0:33
have nervous systems, which is great
0:35
because it's what lets things do things,
0:37
like have behaviors.
0:39
It makes you the sentient living thing that you are.
0:42
The whole set-up here - your brain, your nerves,
0:44
your spinal cord - everything is made up
0:45
of specialized cells that you don't find
0:47
anywhere else in the body.
0:49
Most of those are neurons.
0:50
You've seen them before.
0:52
They look kind of like a tree,
0:53
with the roots, and the trunk, and the branches.
0:55
Neurons bundle together to form nerves,
0:58
pathways that transmit electrochemical signals
1:01
from one part of your body to another.
1:02
So, when you bit into a piece of pizza -
1:04
I love it when there's pizza in the videos -
1:07
the receptor neurons in my taste buds
1:09
recognize I'm eating something salty, and fatty and awesome,
1:13
and they carry that information
1:14
along a nerve pathway to my brain.
1:16
Then, my brain can be like, ""Yeah! Pizza!""
1:20
Then, it can respond by sending back information
1:22
through different nerve pathways that say,
1:24
""You should eat more of that pizza.""
1:27
Despite what my brain is telling me,
1:28
I'm going to try to not eat any more of that pizza.
1:31
You wouldn't think that it's terribly complicated
1:32
to know that pizza tastes good, and to tell someone
1:34
to eat more pizza, but it turns out
1:37
that our brains and our nervous systems are crazy complicated.
1:40
Your nervous system, basically, has a big ol' bureaucracy
1:42
of neurons and it's divided into two main departments -
1:47
the central nervous system, and the peripheral nervous system.
1:50
Central and peripheral.
1:52
The central nervous system, basically your brain and your spinal cord,
1:54
is responsible for analyzing and interpreting
1:56
all of those data that your peripheral nervous system -
1:59
all of the nerves outside of your brain and spine -
2:02
collects and sends its way.
2:03
Once the central nervous system makes a decision about data,
2:06
it sends a signal back through to the peripheral nervous system,
2:09
saying, ""Do this thing,""
2:11
which the peripheral nervous system then does.
2:14
Both of these systems contain two different types of neurons -
2:17
afferent and efferent.
2:20
Afferent and efferent are biological terms,
2:22
and they're horribly confusing,
2:24
and I apologize on behalf of the entire institution
2:26
of biology for them.
2:28
Afferent systems carry things to a central point,
2:30
and efferent systems carry things away from a central point.
2:33
So, afferent neurons carry information
2:36
to the brain and spinal cord for analysis.
2:39
In the peripheral nervous system,
2:40
afferent neurons are called sensory neurons,
2:42
and they're activated by external stimuli,
2:44
like the complex and glorious flavor of pizza,
2:47
and then they convert those data into a signal
2:49
for the central nervous system to process.
2:50
The central nervous system has afferent neurons, too,
2:53
and there, they bring information
2:55
into special parts of the brain,
2:57
like the part of the brain that goes, ""Hmmm, salty.""
2:58
that goes, ""Mmmm, salt.""
3:00
The efferent neurons carry information
3:01
out of the center.
3:03
In the peripheral nervous system,
3:04
they're called motor neurons,
3:06
because many of them carry information
3:08
from the brain and spinal cord to muscles
3:09
to make us move, but they also go
3:11
to pretty much every other organ in your body,
3:13
thus making them work and do stuff to keep you alive.
3:16
In the central system, efferent neurons carry information
3:19
from special parts of the brain
3:20
to other parts of the brain or spinal cord.
3:23
Of course, if it ended there, it would be way too simple,
3:25
and no good bureaucracy has just two departments.
3:27
So, the peripheral nervous system is actually made up
3:30
of two different systems, with two very different jobs,
3:32
the somatic nervous system
3:34
and the autonomic nervous system.
3:36
The somatic system controls all the stuff
3:38
you think about doing, like all the information coming
3:40
through your senses, and the movement
3:42
of your body that it makes
3:44
when you want it to make movements.
3:45
But here's something interesting.
3:46
Since we're totally in love with our brains
3:48
as sort of the center of all being of ourselves,
3:50
we think that all the information
3:52
about everything going on in our bodies goes
3:55
to our brain for some kind of decision.
3:57
Not so!
3:57
Sometimes, like when we touch a hot stove,
3:59
the afferent neurons carry the signal, ""Hot!""
4:02
to the central nervous system,
4:03
but that information doesn't even ever get to the brain.
4:06
The spinal cord actually makes that decision
4:08
before it gets to the brain.
4:09
It sends a message directly back to the muscle,
4:11
saying, ""Get your hand off the friggin' stove!""
4:13
(bleeping noise)
4:14
Young man: This bit of fancy nerve work lets the
4:15
spinal cord make decisions, rather than the brain,
4:17
and it's called the reflex loop.
4:19
So, the other branch of the peripheral nervous system,
4:21
the autonomic system, carries signals
4:23
from the central nervous system
4:25
that drive all of the things that your body does
4:27
without thinking about them -
4:28
your heart beat, your digesion,
4:30
breathing, saliva production,
4:32
all of your organ functions.
4:33
But, we're not done yet here.
4:34
We need to go deeper.
4:36
The autonomic nervous system has two divisions of its own,
4:38
the sympathetic and the parasympathetic.
4:40
The jobs that these two perform aren't just different.
4:43
They're completely opposite and, frankly,
4:45
they're always vying for control of the body
4:48
in some kind of nervous system cage match.
4:50
The sympathetic division is responsible
4:53
for, like, freakin' out.
4:55
You probably heard this talked about
4:56
as the fight-or-flight response -
4:58
in other words, stress.
5:00
But, stress isn't all bad.
5:02
It's what saves our lives when we're being chased
5:04
by saber-tooth tigers, right?
5:05
The sympathetic system prepared our body for action
5:07
by increasing the heart rate, and the blood pressure,
5:10
enhancing our sense of smell,
5:12
dilating the pupils, activating our adrenal cortex
5:14
to make adrenaline, shutting down blood supply
5:17
to our digestive and reproductive systems
5:19
so that there'll be more blood available
5:21
for our lungs and muscles when we have to, like, run!
5:23
And even though you're not in a constant state of panic -
5:25
at least I hope not - I kind of am -
5:27
that system's running all the time every day.
5:30
But, right next to it is the parasympathetic division,
5:33
working hard to make sure we take it nice and easy.
5:35
It dials down the heart rate, and the blood pressure,
5:38
constricts our lungs, makes our nose run,
5:41
increases blood flow to our reproductive junk,
5:44
our mouths produce saliva, encourages us to poop and pee.
5:48
That's basically what we have to thank
5:50
for taking a nap sitting in front of the TV,
5:52
going to the bathroom, and getting it on.
5:55
So, consider yourself lucky you got both
5:57
the stress response and the chill-the-heck-out response
5:59
working side-by-side,
6:00
because together, they create a balance, or a homeostasis.
6:04
Now, That's what the nervous system does.
6:06
Next, we have to talk about how it does it.
6:10
The neurons that make up our nervous systems
6:12
make it possible for our bodies to have
6:14
their very own little electric systems.
6:15
To understand how they work,
6:17
you have to understand their anatomy.
6:18
Like I've said before, the typical neuron
6:20
has branches like a tree.
6:22
These are called dendrites,
6:23
and they receive information from other neurons.
6:25
Neurons also have a single axon,
6:27
the trunk of the tree, which is branched at the end
6:30
and sends signals to other neurons.
6:32
The axon is also covered
6:34
in a fatty material called myelin,
6:36
which acts as insulation.
6:37
The myelin sheath isn't continuous.
6:39
There are these little bits of exposed neuron
6:41
along the axon, which have the sweetest names in this whole episode.
6:44
They're called the nodes of Ranvier,
6:48
which seems like an excellent working title
6:49
for the eighth Harry Potter novel,
6:51
""Harry Potter and the Nodes of Ranvier.""
6:53
Anyway, these nodes allow signals to hop from node to node,
6:57
which lets the signal travel down a nerve faster.
6:59
This node-hopping, by the way, has a name.
7:01
It's called saltatory condution -
7:04
conduction because it's electrical conduction,
7:06
and saltatory because saltatory means leaping.
7:08
Finally, the place where an axon's branches come
7:10
in contact with the next cell dendrite
7:12
is called a synapse.
7:14
That's where neurotransmitters pass information
7:16
from one neuron to the next.
7:17
Now, think back to, or just go watch the episode
7:20
that we did on cell membranes,
7:21
where we talked about how materials travel
7:23
down concetration gradients.
7:25
Well, in much the same way, all of the neurons
7:27
in your body have a membrane potential,
7:28
a difference in voltage or electrical charge
7:31
between the inside and the outside of the membrane.
7:33
You might also remember that this build-up
7:35
of voltage is handled in part by a sexy little protein
7:38
called the sodium-potassium pump.
7:40
Basically, the pump creates a voltage differential,
7:42
like charging a battery,
7:43
by moving three positively-charged sodium ions out
7:46
for every two potassium ions it lets in,
7:49
creating a net negative charge
7:51
inside the cell relative to the outside.
7:53
When a neuron is inactive,
7:55
this is called its resting potential,
7:56
and its voltage is at about negative 70 millivolts.
7:59
In addition to the pumps,
8:01
neurons also have ion channels.
8:02
These are proteins that straddle the membranes,
8:04
but they're a lot simpler and don't need ATP to power them.
8:08
Each cell can have more than 300 different kinds of ion channels,
8:11
each tailored to accept a specific ion.
8:14
Now, don't zone out here because all of this stuff
8:17
is going to come into play when a neuron becomes active.
8:20
This happens when an input or stimulus creates a change
8:22
in the neuron that eventually reaches the axon,
8:24
creating what's called an action potential,
8:27
a brief event where the electrical potential
8:29
of a cell rapidly rises and falls.
8:30
When an action potential begins - like when a molecule
8:33
of sugar touches one of my sweet taste buds -
8:35
some ion channels open and let those
8:37
positive sodium ions rush in,
8:39
so that the inside starts to become less negative.
8:41
With enough stimulus, the internal [unintelligible]
8:42
of the neuron reaches a certain threshhold,
8:44
which triggers more sodium channels to respond,
8:46
and open the floodgates to let even more ions in.
8:49
That's happening on one tiny little area of the neuron,
8:52
but this change in voltage creeps over
8:54
to the next bunch of soium channels,
8:55
which are also sensitive to voltage, and so they open.
8:59
That exchange triggers the next batch,
9:00
and the next batch, and so on down the line.
9:02
This signal-changing voltage travels
9:04
down the neuron's membrane like a wave.
9:06
But remember, the myelin sheath insulates most of the neurons,
9:07
and just leaves those little nodes exposed.
9:11
Instead of being a steady wave, the wave jumps from node to node,
9:14
speeding up the travel time of action potential down a neuron.
9:18
That's your saltatory condution at work.
9:20
When a wave reaches the end of the neuron,
9:21
it triggers a release of neurotransmitters
9:23
from the neuron through exocytosis.
9:25
Those neurotransmitters, then, flow across the synapse
9:28
to the next neuron,
9:29
where they trigger another action potential over there.
9:32
By this time, so many sodium ions have gotten
9:35
inside the first neuron that the difference
9:37
between the outside and the inside is actually reversed.
9:39
The inside is positive, and the outside is negative.
9:42
It seems like neurons hate that more than pretty much anything else,
9:45
so it fixes itself.
9:46
The sodium channels close and the potassium channels open up.
9:49
The positive potassium ions rush down
9:52
both the concentration and the electro-chemical gradients,
9:55
to get the heck out of the cell.
9:57
That brings the charge inside the cell back
9:58
down to negative on the inside,
10:00
and positive on the outside.
10:01
Notice, though, that now the sodium is on the inside of the cell,
10:04
and the potassium is on the outside,
10:06
and in the opposite places of where they started.
10:08
The sodium-potassium pumps get back to work,
10:10
burn up some ATP to pump the sodium back out and the potassium back in.
10:15
Whew!
10:16
Things are now back at the resting potential again.
10:19
That, my friends, is how action potential allows neurons
10:22
to communicate signals down a whole chain of neurons,
10:25
from the outer reaches of the peripheral nervous system,
10:28
all the way up the spinal cord, into the brain,
10:30
and then back out again.
10:32
Let's zoom out, and look at the broad view here.
10:34
I'm gonna think about it as pizza.
10:36
All my taste buds have neurons in 'em.
10:37
Each of my taste buds contain
10:39
between 50 to 100 specialized taste-receptor neurons.
10:42
Chemicals from this beautiful pizza dissolve
10:44
in saliva and then stimulate the dendrites on the afferent neuron.
10:48
This generates a bunch of action-potentials
10:49
that travel from the afferent neurons in my tongue,
10:52
all the way to my brain, which is like,
10:54
""My goodness!
10:55
""I think that's pizza!
10:56
""Let's have another bite.""
10:58
The brain then sends messages
10:59
through the efferent nerve pathways
11:01
to do all sorts of things.
11:02
One, chew, which involves constricting the muscles
11:05
in my jaw over and over again;
11:07
two, lower my head down to catch another bite,
11:10
which involves moving all kinds of neck muscles;
11:12
three, swallowing, which involves constricting
11:16
the muscles in my throat and esophagus;
11:18
four, opening my mouth again to receive another bite.
11:22
That signal is also going to my jaw,
11:24
and that's not even to mention
11:25
what's going to go on with the digestion
11:27
of this bad boy, driven by the autonomic nervous system.

Paula Deen can't do that, and she makes
0:25
fried egg bacon doughnut burgers.
0:32
I'm telling you, this is surprisingly good.
0:34
This is a different kind of magic, but part of this is plants.
0:39
Everything in it, in fact everything that is in this [McDonalds],
0:42
in fact, everything you have ever eaten in your life
0:44
is either made from plants or made from something that ate plants.
0:47
So let's talk about plants.
0:49
(cheerful music)
0:58
Plants probably evolved more than 500 million years ago.
1:01
The earliest land plant fossils date back
1:03
to more than 400 million years ago.
1:05
These plants were lycophytes,
1:06
which are still around today and which reproduce
1:09
through making a bunch of spores, shedding them,
1:11
saying a couple of Hail Marys, and hoping for the best.
1:14
Some of these lycophytes went on to evolve
1:15
into scale trees, which are now extinct, but huge,
1:18
swampy forests of them used to cover the earth.
1:21
Some people call these scale tree forests coal forest
1:23
because there were so many of them,
1:25
they were so dense and they covered the whole earth,
1:26
that they eventually fossilized into giant seams of coal,
1:30
which are very important to our lifestyles today.
1:32
This is now called the Carboniferous Period.
1:34
See what we did there?
1:35
Because coal is made of carbon, so they named
1:37
the epoch of geological history over how face-meltingly
1:40
intense and productive these forests were.
1:42
I would give my left eyeball,
1:46
three fingers on my left hand, the middle ones so that
1:50
I could hang loose, and my pinky toe,
1:54
if I were able to go back and see these scale forests,
1:56
because they would be freaking awesome.
1:58
Anyway, angiosperms, or plants that used flowers
2:01
to reproduce, didn't develop until the end of
2:03
the Cretaceous Period, about 65 million years ago,
2:06
just as the dinosaurs were dying out.
2:08
Which makes you wonder if, in fact,
2:10
the first angiosperms assassinated all the dinosaurs.
2:13
I'm not saying that's definitely what happened.
2:15
I'm just, it's a little bit suspicious.
2:16
Anyway, on a cellular level, plant and animal cells
2:19
are actually pretty similar.
2:21
They're called eukaryotic cells, which means they have
2:24
a good kernel, and that kernel is the nucleus.
2:27
Not ""nuculus"".
2:30
The nucleus can be found in all sorts of cells:
2:32
animal cells, plant cells, algae cells.
2:34
Basically, all the popular kids.
2:36
Eukaryotic cells are way more advanced than prokaryotic cells.
2:40
We have the eukaryotic cell and we have the prokaryotic cell.
2:43
Prokaryotic basically means before the kernel, pro-kernel.
2:48
Then we have the eukaryotic, which means good kernel.
2:50
The prokaryotes include your bacteria and your archea,
2:53
which you've probably met before in your lifetime.
2:56
Every time you've had strep throat, for example.
2:58
Or if you've ever been in a hot spring,
2:59
or an oil well or something, they're everywhere:
3:02
they cover the planet; they cover you.
3:05
Like I said, eukaryotes have that separately enclosed nucleus,
3:08
that is, that all-important nucleus that contains its DNA
3:12
and is enclosed by a separate membrane,
3:14
because a eukaryotic cell is a busy place.
3:15
There's chemical reactions going on in all different parts of the cell.
3:18
It's important to keep those places divided up.
3:21
Eukaryotic cells also have these little stuff-doing
3:23
factories called organelles, because we decided that
3:25
we'd name everything something weird.
3:27
But organelles, and they're suspended in cytoplasm,
3:30
continuing with the really esoteric terminology
3:33
that you're going to have to know.
3:34
Cytoplasm is mostly just water, but it's some other stuff, too.
3:36
Well, basically, if you want to know about
3:38
the structure of the eukaryotic cell,
3:40
you should watch my video on animal cells,
3:42
which let's just link to it right here.
3:45
Plant and animal cells are very similar environments.
3:47
They control themselves in very similar ways.
3:50
But obviously plants and animals are very different things,
3:53
so what are the differences in a plant cell
3:55
that makes it so different from an animal?
3:59
That's what we're going to go over now.
4:00
First, plants are thought to have evolved from green algae,
4:03
which evolved from some more primitive prokaryotes.
4:05
Something plants inherited from their ancestors was a rigid
4:08
cell wall surrounding the plasma membrane of each cell.
4:11
This cell wall of plants is mainly made out of cellulose
4:13
and lignin, which are two really tough compounds.
4:16
Cellulose is by far the most common and
4:19
easy to find complex carbohydrate in nature,
4:21
though if you were to include simple carbohydrates
4:23
as well, glucose would win that one.
4:25
This is because, fascinating fact, cellulose is in fact
4:29
just a chain of glucose molecules.
4:30
You're welcome.
4:31
If you want to jog your memory about
4:33
carbohydrates and other organic molecules,
4:34
you can watch this episode right here.
4:37
Anyway, as it happens, you know who
4:38
needs carbohydrates to live?
4:40
Animals.
4:41
But you know what's a real pain in the ass to digest?
4:43
Cellulose.
4:44
Plants weren't born yesterday.
4:45
Cellulose is a far more complex structure
4:47
than you'll generally find in a prokaryotic cell,
4:50
and it's also one of the main things that
4:51
differentiates a plant cell from an animal cell.
4:54
Animals do not have this rigid cell wall.
4:56
They have a flexible membrane that frees them up to
4:58
move around and eat plants and stuff.
4:59
However, the cell wall gives structure
5:01
to a plant's leaves, roots and stems,
5:04
and also protects it, to a degree.
5:06
Which is why trees aren't squishy,
5:07
and they don't giggle when you poke them.
5:10
The combination of lignin and cellulose
5:11
is what makes trees, for example,
5:13
able to grow really, really freaking tall.
5:15
Both of these compounds are extremely strong
5:18
and resistant to deterioration.
5:19
When we eat food, lignin and cellulose
5:22
is what we call roughage because we can't digest it.
5:25
It's still useful for us on certain aspects
5:29
of our digestive system, but it's not nutritious.
5:32
Which is why eating a stick
5:33
is really unappetizing and like your shirt.
5:37
This is a 100% plant shirt, but it doesn't taste good.
5:41
We can't go around eating wood like a beaver,
5:43
or grass like a cow, because our digestive systems
5:46
just aren't set up for that.
5:48
A lot of other animals that don't have access
5:49
to delicious donut burgers have either
5:52
developed gigantic stomachs, like sloths,
5:54
or multipe stomachs, like goats,
5:56
in order to make a living eating cellulose.
5:58
These animals have a kind of bacteria in their stomachs
5:59
that actually does the digestion of the cellulose for it.
6:02
It breaks the cellulose into individual
6:04
glucose molecules which can then be used for food.
6:07
Other animals, like humans, mostly carnivores,
6:09
don't have any of that kind of bacteria,
6:11
which is why it's so difficult for us to digest sticks.
6:14
But there is another reason why cellulose and lignin
6:17
are very, very useful to us as humans.
6:20
It burns, my friends.
6:23
This is basically what would happen in our stomachs.
6:25
It's oxidizing.
6:26
It's producing the energy that we would get out of it if
6:28
we were able to, except it's doing it very, very quickly.
6:31
This is the kind of energy,
6:33
like this energy that's coming out of it right now,
6:35
is the energy that would be useful to us if we were cows.
6:39
But we're not, so instead, we just use it
6:42
to keep ourselves warm on the cold winter nights.
6:46
(blows air)
6:47
Ow; it's on me; ow.
6:50
Anyway, while we animals are walking around,
6:52
spending our lives searching for ever more digestable
6:55
plant materials, plants don't have to do any of that.
6:58
They just sit there and they make their own food.
7:00
We know how they do that.
7:01
They do it with photosynthesis.
7:03
Another thing that plant cells have
7:05
that animal cells just don't have are plastids,
7:08
the organelles that plants use to
7:10
make and store compounds that they need.
7:12
You want to know something super interesting about plastids?
7:14
They and their fellow organelles, the mitochondria,
7:16
that generate energy for the cell,
7:18
actually started as bacteria that were absorbed
7:21
into plant cells very early in their evolution.
7:24
Like maybe some [produ-select] cell absorbed a bacteria
7:27
and it found that instead of just digesting that bacteria
7:29
for the energy that it had, it could use that bacteria.
7:32
That bacteria could create energy for the cell
7:34
or convert light into lovely glucose compounds,
7:37
which is crazy.
7:39
Nobody's really precisely sure how this happened,
7:41
but they know that it did happen because plastids
7:43
and mitochondria have double membranes:
7:45
one from the original bacteria,
7:46
and one from the cell as it wrapped around it.
7:49
Cool, huh?
7:50
Anyway, the most important of the plastids are
7:52
the chloroplasts, which convert light energy
7:54
from the sun into sugar and into oxygen,
7:57
which the plant doesn't need, so it just gets rid of it.
8:00
All of the green parts of a plant that you see:
8:01
the leaves, the non-woody stems, the unripened oranges,
8:05
are all filled with cells that are filled with chloroplasts,
8:08
which are making food and oxygen for you.
8:11
You're very welcome, I'm sure.
8:12
Another big difference between plant cell and
8:15
an animal cell is the large central vacuole.
8:18
Plant cells can push water into vacuoles,
8:20
which provides turgor pressure from inside the cell,
8:24
which reinforces the already stiff cellulose wall
8:26
and makes the plant rigid,
8:27
like a crunchy piece of celery or something.
8:30
Usually, when the soil dries out or the celery stalk
8:32
sits in your refrigerator for too long,
8:34
the cells lose some water, turgor pressure drops,
8:37
and the plant wilts or gets all floppy.
8:39
So the vacuole is also a kind of storage container for the cell.
8:41
It can contain water, which plants need to save up, just in case,
8:45
and also other compounds that the cell might need.
8:47
It can also contain an export stuff that
8:49
the cell doesn't need anymore, like wastes.
8:51
Some animal cells also have vacuoles,
8:53
but they aren't as large, and they don't have
8:56
this very important job of giving the animal shape.
8:58
Now, let's do this.
8:59
Let's just go over the basics of plant cell anatomy.
9:02
One, they have a cell wall that's made out of cellulose,
9:04
and so it's really rigid and not messing around.
9:07
Two, they've got a nucleus in its own little baggie
9:10
that's separate from all the other organelles.
9:12
This is basically the headquarters of any eukaryotic cell.
9:16
It stores the genetic information for a plant
9:18
and also access the cell's activities director,
9:20
telling it how to grow, when to split,
9:22
when to jump and how high, that sort of thing.
9:24
Animal cells have this kind of nucleus, too,
9:26
but prokaryotes don't, which is why they're stuck,
9:29
hanging around in oil wells and stuff.
9:30
Three, they've got plastids, including chloroplasts,
9:33
which are awesome, green, food-making machines.
9:36
Four, they have a central vacuole that stores water and
9:39
other stuff, and helps give the cell structural support.
9:42
And so, stack these cells on top of one another,
9:46
like apartments in an apartment building, and you had a plant.
9:48
All of these unique features are what makes it possible
9:50
for plants to put food on our table and air in our lungs.
9:54
So next time you see a plant,
9:55
just go ahead and shake its hand.

0:00
In most topics you have to get pretty advanced before you
0:03
start addressing the philosophically interesting
0:05
things, but in chemistry it just starts right from the
0:08
get-go with what's arguably the most philosophically
0:11
interesting part of the whole topic, and that's the atom.
0:15
And the idea of the atom, as philosophers long ago, and you
0:18
could look it up on the different philosophers who
0:21
first philosophized about it, they said, hey, you know, if I
0:23
started off with, I don't know, if I started off with an
0:28
apple, and I just kept cutting the apple -- let me draw a
0:32
nice looking apple just so it doesn't look just
0:34
like a heart .
0:36
There you go.
0:36
You have a nice looking apple, And you just kept cutting it,
0:38
smaller and smaller pieces.
0:40
So eventually, you get a piece so small, so tiny, that you
0:44
can't cut it anymore.
0:46
And I'm sure some of these philosophers went out there
0:48
with a knife and tried to do it and they just felt that,
0:50
oh, if I could just get my knife a little bit sharper, I
0:52
could cut it again and again.
0:53
So it's a completely philosophical construct, which
0:56
frankly, in a lot of ways, isn't too different to how the
0:59
atom is today.
1:00
It's really just a mental abstraction that allows us to
1:04
describe a lot of observations we see in the universe.
1:07
But anyway, these philosophers said, well, at some point we
1:10
think that there's going to be some little part of an apple
1:15
that they won't be able to divide anymore.
1:16
And they called that an atom.
1:18
And it doesn't just have to just be for an apple they said
1:19
this is true for any substance or any element to that you
1:23
encounter in the universe.
1:25
And so the word atom is really Greek for uncuttable.
1:29
Uncuttable or indivisible.
1:34
Now we know that it actually is cuttable and even though it
1:37
is not a trivial thing, it's not the smallest form of
1:42
matter we know.
1:43
We now know that an atom is made up of other more
1:47
fundamental particles.
1:48
And let me write that.
1:50
So the we have the neutron.
1:55
And I'll draw in a second how they all fit together and the
1:59
structure of an atom.
2:00
We have a neutron.
2:02
We have a proton.
2:05
And we have electrons.
2:09
Electrons.
2:11
And you might already be familiar with this if you look
2:13
at old videos about atomic projects, you'll see a drawing
2:18
that looks something like this.
2:20
Let me see if I can draw one.
2:21
So you'll have something like that.
2:24
And you'll have these things spinning around
2:27
that look like this.
2:28
They have orbits that look like that.
2:30
And maybe something that looks like that.
2:33
And the general notion behind these kind of nuclear drawings
2:36
-- and I'm sure that they still show up at some
2:39
government defense labs or something like that -- is that
2:41
you have a nucleus at the center of an atom.
2:46
You have a nucleus at the center of an atom.
2:48
And we know that a nucleus has neutrons and protons.
2:52
Neutrons and protons.
2:53
And we'll talk a little bit more about which elements have
2:56
how many neutrons and how many protons.
2:59
And then orbiting, and I'm going to use the word orbit
3:02
right now, although we'll learn in about two minutes
3:05
that the word orbit is actually the incorrect or even
3:08
the mentally incorrect way of visualizing what
3:10
an electron is doing.
3:11
But the old idea was that you have these electrons that are
3:14
orbiting around the nucleus very similar to the way the
3:17
Earth orbits around the Sun or the moon
3:19
orbits around the Earth.
3:21
And it's been shown that that's actually
3:23
a very wrong way.
3:26
And when we cover quantum mechanics we'll learn why this
3:30
doesn't work, what are the contradictions that emerge
3:34
when you try to model an electron like a planet going
3:38
around the Sun.
3:40
But this was kind of the original idea, and frankly I
3:41
think this is kind of the idea that is the most mainstream
3:45
way of viewing an atom.
3:50
Now, I said an atom is philosophically interesting.
3:52
Why is it philosophically interesting?
3:53
Because what we now view as the accepted way of viewing an
3:58
atom really starts to blur the line between our physical
4:04
reality and everything in the world is just information, and
4:09
there really isn't any such thing as true matter or true
4:12
particles as the way we define them in our everyday life.
4:15
You know, for me a particle, oh, it looks
4:16
like a grain of sand.
4:17
I can pick it up, touch it.
4:19
While a wave, that could be like a soundwave. It could be
4:21
just this change in energy over time.
4:23
But we'll learn, especially when we do quantum mechanics,
4:25
that it all gets jumbled up as we start approaching the
4:29
scales or the size of an atom.
4:31
Anyway, I said this was an incorrect way of doing it.
4:34
What's the correct way?
4:37
So it turns out-- this is a picture, not a picture really,
4:40
this is also a depiction.
4:42
So it's an interesting question, what I just said.
4:44
How can you have a picture of an atom?
4:47
Because is actually turns out that most wavelengths of
4:49
light, especially the visible wavelengths of light, are much
4:52
larger than the size of an atom.
4:56
Everything else we quote-unquote, observe in
4:58
life, it's by reflected light.
5:00
But all of a sudden when you're dealing with an atom,
5:02
reflected light you could almost view it as too big, or
5:06
too blunt of an instrument with which to observe an atom.
5:09
Anyway, this is a depiction of a helium atom.
5:14
A helium atom has two protons and two neutrons.
5:18
Or at least this helium atom has two
5:19
protons and two neutrons.
5:21
And the way they depict it here in the nucleus, right
5:24
there, maybe these are the two-- I'm assuming they're
5:26
using red for proton and purple for neutron.
5:32
Purple seems like more of a neutral color.
5:34
And they're sitting at the center of this atom.
5:39
And then this whole haze around there, those are the
5:42
two electrons that helium has, or that at least
5:45
this helium atom has.
5:47
Maybe you could gain or lose an electron.
5:49
But these are the two electrons.
5:50
And you say, hey, Sal, how can two electrons be this blur
5:55
that's kind of smeared around this atom.
5:58
And that's where it gets philosophically interesting.
6:01
So you cannot describe an electron's path around a
6:09
nucleus with the traditional orbit idea that we've
6:12
encountered when we look at planets or if we just imagine
6:16
things at kind of a larger scale.
6:18
It turns out that an electron, you cannot know exactly its
6:24
momentum and location at any given point in time.
6:28
All you can know is a probability distribution of
6:31
where it is likely to be.
6:33
And the way they depicted this, black is a higher
6:36
probability, so you're much more likely to find the
6:39
electron here than you are here.
6:42
But the electron really could be anywhere.
6:43
It could even to be here, even though it's completely white
6:46
there, with some very, very, very, very, very low
6:49
probability.
6:50
And so this function of where an electron is, this is called
6:55
an orbital.
6:56
Orbital.
6:57
Not to be confused with orbit.
7:00
Orbital.
7:02
Remember, an orbit was something like this.
7:05
It's like Venus going around the Sun.
7:08
So it's very physically easy for us to imagine.
7:12
While an orbital is actually a mathematical probability
7:16
function that tells us where we're
7:17
likely to find an electron.
7:18
We'll deal a lot more with that when we cover quantum
7:21
mechanics, but that's not going to be in the scope of
7:23
this kind of introductory set of chemistry lectures.
7:26
But it's interesting, right?
7:28
An electron's behavior is so bizarre at that scale that you
7:32
can't-- I mean, to call it a particle is almost misleading.
7:35
It is called a particle, but it's not a particle in the
7:38
sense that we're used to in our everyday life.
7:40
It's this thing that you can't even say exactly where it is.
7:45
It can be anywhere in this haze.
7:47
And we'll learn later that there are different shapes of
7:49
the hazes is as we add more and more electrons to an atom.
7:53
But to me, it starts to address philosophical issues
7:57
of what matter even is, or do the things we look at, how
8:01
real are they?
8:02
Or how real are they, at least as we've defined reality?
8:04
Anyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.
8:07
But the whole notion of electrons, protons, they're
8:12
all kind of predicated on this notion of charge.
8:15
And we've talked about it before when we learned about
8:17
Coulomb's law.
8:18
You could review Coulomb's laws videos in the physics
8:22
playlist. But the idea is that an electron
8:27
has a negative charge.
8:29
A proton, sometimes written like that,
8:31
has a positive charge.
8:33
And a neutron has no charge.
8:37
And so that's what was tempting about the original
8:39
model of an electron.
8:42
If they say, OK, if this thing has positive charges, right?
8:45
So let's say this is two neutrons and two protons.
8:47
Let's say it's a helium atom.
8:48
Then we'll have some positive charges here.
8:51
We have some negative charges out here.
8:54
Opposite charges attract.
8:56
And so if these things had some velocity, enough
9:03
velocity, they would orbit around this, just the way a
9:08
planet will orbit around the Sun.
9:10
But now we learn, even though this is partially true, that
9:15
the further away an electron is from the nucleus, it does
9:23
have more, it's true, potential energy.
9:27
In that it will want to move towards the nucleus, but
9:31
because of all the mechanics at the quantum level, it won't
9:34
just do something simple like move in a path like that, like
9:37
a comet would do around the Sun, it actually has this kind
9:41
of wave-like behavior, where it just has this probability
9:43
function that describes it.
9:45
But the further away an orbital, it
9:48
does have more potential.
9:50
We're going to go a lot more into that in future videos.
9:53
But anyway, how do you recognize what an element is?
9:56
I've talked a lot about the philosophy and all of that,
9:58
but how do I know that this is helium?
10:00
Is it by the number of neutrons it has?
10:03
Is it by the number of protons it has?
10:05
Is it by the number of electrons?
10:07
Well the answer is, it's by the number of protons.
10:09
So if you know the number of protons in an element, you
10:13
know what that element is.
10:14
And the number of protons, this is defined
10:21
as the atomic number.
10:26
Now, so let's say I said something has four protons.
10:33
How do we know what it is?
10:34
Well if we haven't memorized it, we could look it up on the
10:37
periodic table of elements, which we'll be dealing with a
10:39
lot in this playlist. And you'd say, oh, four protons,
10:43
that is beryllium.
10:45
Right there.
10:46
And the atomic number is the number that you see up there.
10:50
And that' s literally the number of protons.
10:52
And that is what differentiates
10:55
one atom from another.
10:56
If you have fifteen protons, you're dealing with
10:59
phosphorus.
11:00
And all of a sudden, if you have seven protons, you're
11:06
dealing with nitrogen.
11:07
If you have eight, you're dealing with oxygen.
11:09
That is what defines the element.
11:11
Now, we'll talk in the future about what happens with charge
11:15
and all of that.
11:17
Or what happens when you gain or lose electrons.
11:19
But that does not change what element you're dealing with.
11:21
And likewise, when you change the number of neutrons, that
11:26
also does not change the element you're dealing with.
11:30
But that leads to an obvious question of, well, how many
11:32
neutrons and electrons do you have?
11:35
Well, if an atom is charge-neutral, that means it
11:43
has the same number of electrons.
11:46
So let's say that I have carbon.
11:52
Its atomic number is six.
11:53
And let's say its mass number is twelve.
12:00
Now what does this mean?
12:01
And let me say further that this is a neutral particle.
12:05
This is a neutral atom.
12:07
So the atomic number for carbon is six.
12:10
That tells us exactly how many protons it has.
12:13
So if I were to draw a little model here, and this is in no
12:16
way an accurate model.
12:17
I'll draw six-- two, three, four, five, six
12:21
protons in the center.
12:23
And the weight of these protons, each proton is one
12:26
atomic mass unit, and we'll talk more about how that
12:28
relates to kilograms. It's a very small
12:31
fraction of a kilogram.
12:32
Roughly I think it's 1.6 times 10 to the
12:36
minus 27th of a kilogram.
12:38
So let's say each of these are one atomic mass unit, and
12:45
that's approximately equal to, I think, 1.67 times 10 to the
12:48
minus 27 kilograms. This is a very small number.
12:53
It's actually almost impossible to visualize.
12:57
At least it is for me.
12:58
This tells me the mass of the entire carbon atom, of this
13:03
particular carbon atom.
13:04
And this can actually change from carbon
13:05
atom to carbon atom.
13:07
And this is essentially the mass of all of the protons
13:10
plus all of the neutrons.
13:12
And each proton has an atomic mass of one, in atomic mass
13:17
units, and each neutron has an atomic mass of
13:20
one atomic mass unit.
13:22
So this is really the number of protons plus
13:28
the number of neutrons.
13:33
So in this case we have six protons, so we must also have
13:37
six neutrons.
13:39
Six neutrons plus six protons.
13:42
Now, where are the electrons?
13:44
Well, I said it's neutral, so the proton has an equal
13:49
positive charge as the electron's negative charge.
13:51
So this is a neutral atom, and it has six protons, so it also
13:55
has six electrons.
13:56
Let me draw that.
13:57
So we said it has six neutrons in here.
13:59
One, two, three, four, five, six.
14:01
So that's the nucleus right there.
14:04
And then if we were to draw the electons-- well, I could
14:09
draw it as a smear, but if we want to kind of visualize it a
14:12
little better, we could say, OK, there's going to be six
14:13
electrons orbiting.
14:15
One, two, three, four, five, six.
14:18
And they're going to be moving around in this unpredictable
14:21
way that we would have to describe with
14:22
a probability function.
14:24
And so the interesting thing about it is, most of the mass
14:30
of an atom is sitting right in here.
14:32
I mean, you might notice that when people care about the
14:34
mass, when they care about the atomic mass number of an atom,
14:40
they ignore the electrons.
14:41
And that's because the mass of a proton, one proton
14:47
mass-wise, is equal to 1,836 electons.
14:52
So for thinking about the mass of an atom, for all basic
14:58
purposes, you can ignore the mass of an electron.
15:01
It's really the mass of the nucleus that counts as the
15:08
mass of the atom.
15:10
Now, you might see this periodic table here, and you
15:12
say, OK, they gave us the atomic number up there.
15:15
The atomic number of oxygen is eight.
15:18
It means it has eight protons.
15:20
The atomic number of silicon is 14.
15:22
It has 14 protons.
15:24
Now what is this right here?
15:27
Let's see, in carbon.
15:28
In carbon they have this 12.0107.
15:34
That is the atomic weight of carbon.
15:36
Let me write this.
15:41
Atomic weight of carbon.
15:47
The atomic weight of carbon is 12.0107.
15:56
Now, what does that mean?
15:57
Does that mean that carbon has six protons and then the
16:03
remainder, the remaining 6.0107 neutrons, it has kind
16:09
of this fraction of a neutron?
16:11
No.
16:12
It means if you were to average all the different
16:16
versions of carbon you find on the planet and you were to
16:19
average the number of neutrons based on the quantity of the
16:25
different types of carbon, this is the
16:27
average you would get.
16:28
So it turns out that carbon, the two major forms, the main
16:32
one you'll find is carbon-12.
16:35
So that's like this.
16:36
So that has six protons and six neutrons.
16:39
And then another isotope of carbon.
16:42
Now an isotope is the same element with a different
16:45
number of neutrons.
16:46
Another isotope of carbon is carbon-14, which is much more
16:50
scarce on the planet.
16:52
We don't know how much in the universe, but on the planet.
16:55
Now, if you were to average these, not just a straight-up
16:58
average, then you would get carbon-13 and then the atomic
17:01
weight would be 13, but you weight this one much higher
17:04
because this exists in much larger quantities on Earth.
17:07
I mean, this is pretty much all of the
17:08
carbon that you see.
17:09
But there's a little bit of this.
17:10
So if you weight them appropriately, the average
17:13
becomes this.
17:14
So most of the carbon you'll find-- if you just found
17:17
carbon someplace, on average its weight in atomic mass
17:22
units is going to be 12.0107.
17:27
But that idea of an isotope is an interesting one.
17:29
Remember, when you change the neutrons, you're not changing
17:32
the actual, fundamental element.
17:33
You're just getting a different isotope, a different
17:36
version, of the element.
17:37
So these two versions of carbon are both isotopes.
17:41
Now, I want to leave this video with what I think is
17:43
kind of the neatest idea behind atoms. And it's the
17:46
most philosophically interesting things about them.
17:49
It's that the relative size-- so, we have these electrons,
17:54
which represent very little of the mass of an atom.
17:58
It's 1/2000 of the mass of an atom are the electrons.
18:01
And even those, it's hard to even describe them as
18:04
particles, because you can't even tell me exactly where and
18:08
how fast one of these particles is moving.
18:11
They just have a probability function.
18:12
So most of the atom is sitting inside the nucleus.
18:16
And this is the interesting thing.
18:17
If you look at an atom on average, if you
18:21
say this is my atom.
18:23
Let's say I had two atoms that are bonded to each other.
18:26
And I were to say, how much of this is actual stuff?
18:29
And when I say stuff, that's a very abstract concept, because
18:32
we're talking about the nucleus, right?
18:33
Because the nucleus is where all the
18:34
mass is, all the stuff.
18:36
It turns out that it's actually an infinitesimally
18:39
small fraction of the volume of the atom where-- the volume
18:44
of the atom is hard to define, because the electron can
18:45
pretty much be anywhere, but if you view the volume as
18:48
where you're most likely to find the electron, or with 90%
18:52
probability you're likely to find the electron, then the
18:55
nucleus is, in a lot of cases and the way I think about it,
18:59
it's about 1/10,000 of the volume.
19:01
So if you think about it, when you look at something, if you
19:03
look at your hand or if you look at the wall or if you
19:06
look at your computer, 99.999% of it is free space.
19:14
It's nothing.
19:15
It's vacuum.
19:18
If you had ultra-small-- I guess we could call them
19:20
particles or something-- most of them would pass straight
19:23
through whatever you look at.
19:24
So it already starts to kind of
19:26
question our hold on reality.
19:28
What is there when, if-- and this is fact, this isn't
19:32
theory right here-- that if you take anything down to the
19:35
building blocks, down to the atomic level, most of the
19:39
space of that kind of, quote-unquote object, is free
19:43
vacuum space.
19:44
You could go straight through it if you could get down to
19:46
that scale.
19:47
This image of a helium atom, they say right here this is
19:50
one femtometer.
19:52
Right?
19:52
One femtometer.
19:57
This is the scale of the nucleus of a
20:00
helium atom, right?
20:01
One femtometer.
20:03
This is one angstrom, right?
20:04
And they say that equals 100,000 femtometers.
20:06
And just to get a sense of scale, one angstrom is 1 times
20:10
10 to the negative 10 meters, right?
20:13
So the atom is roughly on the scale of an angstrom.
20:15
In the case of helium, the nucleus is
20:17
even a smaller fraction.
20:18
It's 1/100,000.
20:20
So if you had-- let's say you had liquid helium, which you'd
20:23
have to get very cold to get.
20:25
If you're looking at that, most of it is free space.
20:27
If you're looking at an iron bar, the great, great, great,
20:30
great, great, great majority of it is free space.
20:33
And we're not even talking about, maybe there's some free
20:35
space inside the nucleus that we could talk
20:37
about in the future.
20:38
But to me, that just blows my mind that most things we look
20:41
at are not really solid.
20:44
They're really just empty space, but they look solid
20:47
because of the way light reflects on them or the forces
20:50
that repel us.
20:51
But there really isn't something to touch there.
20:55
That most of this right here is all free space.
20:57
I think I've said the word free space now, and I think
21:00
I'll leave further
21:02
mind-blowing to the next video.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,1xSQlwWGT8M,
khan_video_5FEjrStgcF8_107,How many galaxies are suspected to be in the universe?,MCQ,"•
0:00
The purpose of this video is to just begin
0:03
to appreciate how vast and enormous the universe is.
0:06
And frankly, our brains really can't grasp it.
0:09
What we'll see in this video is that we can't even
0:11
grasp things that are actually super small compared
0:13
to the size of the universe.
0:14
And we actually don't even know what
0:16
the entire size of the universe is.
0:17
But with that said, let's actually
0:19
just try to appreciate how small we are.
0:21
So this is me right over here.
0:24
I am 5 foot 9 inches, depending on whether I'm wearing shoes--
0:28
maybe 5 foot 10 with shoes.
0:30
But for the sake of this video, let's just roughly
0:32
approximate around 6 feet, or around roughly--
0:35
I'm not to go into the details of the math-- around 2 meters.
0:40
Now, if I were to lie down 10 times in a row,
0:43
you'd get about the length of an 18-wheeler.
0:46
That's about 60 feet long.
0:48
So this is times 10.
0:49
Now, if you were to put an 18-wheeler-- if you were
0:53
to make it tall, as opposed to long-- somehow stand it up--
0:56
and you were to do that 10 times in a row,
0:58
you'll get to the height of roughly a 60-story skyscraper.
1:03
So once again, if you took me and you piled me up 100 times,
1:07
you'll get about a 60-story skyscraper.
1:09
Now, if you took that skyscraper and if you
1:12
were to lie it down 10 times in a row,
1:15
you'd get something of the length of the Golden Gate
1:18
Bridge.
1:19
And once again, I'm not giving you the exact numbers.
1:21
It's not always going to be exactly 10.
1:23
But we're now getting to about something that's
1:25
a little on the order of a mile long.
1:28
So the Golden Gate Bridge is actually longer than a mile.
1:30
But if you go within the twin spans, it's roughly about
1:33
a mile.
1:33
It's actually a little longer than that.
1:35
But that gives you a sense of a mile.
1:37
Now, if you multiply that by 10, you
1:40
get to the size of a large city.
1:43
And this right here is a satellite photograph
1:45
of San Francisco.
1:47
This is the actual Golden Gate Bridge here.
1:49
And when I copy and pasted this picture,
1:51
I tried to make it roughly 10 miles by 10 miles
1:54
just so you appreciate the scale.
1:56
And what's interesting here-- and this picture's interesting.
1:58
Because this is the first time we can relate to cities.
2:02
But when you look at a city on this scale,
2:04
it's starting to get larger than what
2:06
we're used to processing on a daily basis.
2:09
A bridge-- we've been on a bridge.
2:11
We know what a bridge looks like.
2:12
We know that a bridge is huge.
2:14
But it doesn't feel like something
2:15
that we can't comprehend.
2:17
Already, a city is something that we
2:19
can't comprehend all at once.
2:20
We can drive across a city.
2:21
We can look at satellite imagery.
2:23
But if I were to show a human on this,
2:26
it would be unbelievably, unbelievably small.
2:28
You wouldn't actually be able to see it.
2:30
It would be less than a pixel on this image.
2:32
A house is less than a pixel on this image.
2:35
But let's keep multiplying by 10.
2:38
If you multiply by 10 again, you get to something
2:41
roughly the size of the San Francisco Bay Area.
2:44
This whole square over here is roughly that square right
2:47
over there.
2:48
Let's multiply by 10 again.
2:52
So this square is about 100 miles by 100 miles.
2:55
So this one would be about 1,000 miles by 1,000 miles.
2:57
And now you're including a big part of the Western United
3:00
States.
3:01
You have California here.
3:03
You Nevada here.
3:04
You have Arizona and New Mexico--
3:06
so a big chunk of a big continent we're
3:08
already including.
3:09
And frankly, this is beyond the scale
3:11
that we're used to operating.
3:13
We've seen maps, so maybe we're a little used to it.
3:15
But if you ever had to walk across this type of distance,
3:18
it would take you a while.
3:19
To some degree, the fact that planes goes so fast-- almost
3:22
unimaginably fast for us-- that it's
3:25
made it feel like things like continents aren't as big.
3:28
Because you can fly across them in five or six hours.
3:30
But these are already huge, huge, huge distances.
3:33
But once again, you take this square
3:35
that's about 1,000 miles by 1,000 miles,
3:38
and you multiply that by 10.
3:40
And you get pretty close-- a little bit
3:42
over-- the diameter of the Earth-- a little bit
3:46
over the diameter of the Earth.
3:47
But once again, we're on the Earth.
3:49
We kind of relate to the Earth.
3:52
If you look carefully at the horizon,
3:54
you might see a little bit of a curvature,
3:56
especially if you were to get into the plane.
3:58
So even though this is, frankly, larger
4:01
than my brain can really grasp, we
4:03
can kind of relate to the Earth.
4:06
Now you multiply the diameter of Earth times 10.
4:10
And you get to the diameter of Jupiter.
4:13
And so if you were to sit Earth right next to Jupiter--
4:17
obviously, they're nowhere near that close.
4:19
That would destroy both of the planets.
4:21
Actually, it would definitely destroy Earth.
4:23
It would probably just be merged into Jupiter.
4:26
So if you put Earth next to Jupiter,
4:30
it would look something like that right over there.
4:34
So I would say that Jupiter is definitely-- on this diagram
4:38
that I'm drawing here-- is definitely
4:39
the first thing that I have I can't comprehend.
4:43
The Earth, itself, is so vastly huge.
4:45
Jupiter is-- it's 10 times bigger in diameter.
4:49
It's much larger in terms of mass, and volume,
4:52
and all the rest.
4:53
But just in terms of diameter, it is 10 times bigger.
4:56
But let's keep going.
4:57
10 times Jupiter gets us to the sun.
5:02
This is times 10.
5:04
So if this is the Sun-- and if I were to draw Jupiter,
5:07
it would look something like-- I'll
5:08
do Jupiter in pink-- Jupiter would be around that big.
5:13
And then the Earth would be around that big
5:17
if you were to put them all next to each other.
5:19
So the Sun, once again, is huge.
5:21
Even though we see it almost every day,
5:24
it is unimaginably huge.
5:26
Even the Earth is unimaginably huge.
5:28
And the Sun is 100 times more unimaginably bigger.
5:33
Now we're going to start getting really, really, really wacky.
5:36
You multiply the diameter of the Sun, which is already
5:40
100 times the diameter of the Earth-- you
5:43
multiply that times 100.
5:44
And that is the distance from the Earth to the Sun.
5:47
So I've drawn the Sun here as a little pixel.
5:52
And I didn't even draw the Earth as a pixel.
5:53
Because a pixel would be way too large.
5:55
It would have to be a hundredth of a pixel
5:57
in order to draw the Earth properly.
5:59
So this is a unbelievable distance
6:02
between the Earth and the Sun.
6:04
It's 100 times the distance of the diameter of the Sun itself.
6:10
So it's massive, massive.
6:11
But once again, these things are relatively close
6:15
compared to where we're about to go.
6:17
Because if we want to get to the nearest star-- so remember,
6:21
the Sun is 100 times the diameter of the Earth.
6:24
The distance between the Sun and the Earth is 100 times that.
6:29
Or you could say it's 10,000 times the diameter
6:32
of the Earth.
6:33
So these are unimaginable distances.
6:35
But to get to the nearest star, which is 4.2 light years away,
6:40
it's 200,000 times-- and once again, unimaginable.
6:45
It's 200,000 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
6:51
And to give you a rough sense of how far apart these things are,
6:59
if the Sun was roughly the size of a basketball--
7:02
if the average star was about the size of a basketball--
7:04
in our part of the galaxy in a volume the size of the Earth--
7:09
so if you had a big volume the size of the Earth,
7:13
if the stars were the sizes of basketballs,
7:16
in our part of the galaxy, you would only
7:18
have a handful of basketballs per that volume.
7:22
So unbelievably sparse.
7:26
Even though, when you look at the galaxy--
7:28
and this is just an artist's depiction of it--
7:30
it looks like something that has the spray of stars,
7:33
and it looks reasonably dense, there
7:35
is actually a huge amount of space
7:37
that the great, great, great, great, great majority
7:40
of the volume in the galaxy is just empty, empty space.
7:46
There's no stars, no planets, no nothing.
7:49
I mean, this is a huge jump that I'm talking about.
7:52
And then if you really want to realize
7:55
how large a galaxy, itself, can be,
7:57
you take this distance between the Sun,
8:00
or between our solar system and the nearest star--
8:02
so that's 200,000 times the distance between the Earth
8:07
and the Sun-- and you multiply that distance by 25,000.
8:10
So if the Sun is right here, our nearest star
8:16
will be in that same pixel.
8:18
They'll actually be within-- you'd actually
8:20
get a ton of stars within that one pixel,
8:22
even though they're so far apart.
8:24
And then this whole thing is 100,000 light years.
8:28
It's 25,000 times the distance than the distance
8:33
between the Sun and the nearest star.
8:35
So we're talking about unimaginable, unfathomable
8:39
distances, just for a galaxy.
8:42
And now we're going to get our-- frankly,
8:44
my brain is already well beyond anything
8:48
that it can really process.
8:49
At this point, it almost just becomes abstract thinking.
8:52
It just becomes playing with numbers and mathematics.
8:55
But to get a sense of the universe, itself,
8:58
the observable universe-- and we have to be clear.
9:00
Because we can only observe light
9:02
that started leaving from its source 13.7 billion years ago.
9:06
Because that's how old the universe is.
9:08
The observable universe is about 93 billion light years across.
9:13
And the reason why it's larger than 13.7 billion
9:16
is that the points in space that emitted
9:20
light 13.7 billion years ago, those
9:22
have been going away from us.
9:24
So now they're on the order of 40 billion light years away.
9:27
But this isn't about cosmology.
9:29
This is just about scale and appreciating
9:31
how huge the universe is.
9:33
Just in the part of the universe that we can theoretically
9:36
observe, you have to get-- and that we can observe,
9:43
just because we're getting electromagnetic radiation
9:47
from those parts of the universe--
9:50
you would have to multiply this number.
9:52
So let me make this clear.
9:53
100,000 light years-- that's the diameter of the Milky Way.
10:01
You would have to multiply not by 1,000.
10:04
1,000 would get you to 100 million light years.
10:10
This is 100,000 times 1,000 is 100 million.
10:13
You have to multiply by 1,000 again
10:18
to get to 100 billion light years.
10:21
And the universe, for all we know,
10:22
might be much, much, much, much, larger.
10:24
It might even be infinite.
10:26
Who knows?
10:27
But to get from just the diameter of the Milky Way
10:32
to the observable universe, you have to multiply by a million.
10:35
And already, this is an unfathomable distance.
10:38
So in the whole scheme of things,
10:42
not only are we pretty small, and not only are the things
10:46
we build pretty small, and not only is our planet ultra small,
10:51
and not only is our Sun ultra small,
10:54
and our solar system ultra small,
10:56
but our galaxy is really nothing compared
10:59
to the vastness of the universe.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,5FEjrStgcF8,

0:01
I'm a Character TD here at Pixar.
0:03
- Hi, I'm Jacob Speirs, I'm also a Character TD at Pixar.
0:07
- [Lou] We started here at Pixar on WALL-E as interns
0:10
and our task was to make a huge cast of background robots.
0:12
- Today's lesson is going to be about how to create
0:15
a huge crowd of robots using only a few simple parts.
0:18
(mechanical clicks)
0:21
- I wanna take WALL-E from a world
0:22
where there's no robots anymore
0:23
and it's just him to a world where there's tons of them.
0:26
I just like that contrast and suddenly making him feel
0:28
like he was alone in a crowd.
0:31
- We're trying to create a world where robots do every task
0:34
that you would want done.
0:36
What we did first was to look at cruise ships.
0:39
We got a list of every single job on a cruise ship
0:41
and then went through and tried to think of
0:43
the robotic equivalent of that job
0:46
and it became apparent quickly that that was more robots
0:49
than we would ever be able to build in one lifetime.
0:51
- So as interns, Jacob and I had the task of making this
0:54
huge cast of robots, but we didn't want to design each
0:57
individual one specifically.
0:58
- Right, so luckily there was an animator, Angus,
1:01
and he had a great idea about how to approach the process.
1:05
- I'm a huge Lego fan and I really wanted
1:07
the background characters to be the best they could be
1:09
and I figured if we designed a modular system
1:12
that would allow for us to add and subtract different parts
1:15
onto the character for the background characters
1:17
then we could kinda make whatever we needed
1:20
and it would all feel like the same world.
1:22
- [Lou] Doing it this way, modularly,
1:23
meant we could build 10 heads, 10 arms, and 10 bodies
1:26
and though we'd only built 30 pieces
1:27
we could make a thousand different combinations.
1:30
- Yeah, and there's actually a branch of mathematics
1:32
about that sort of thing, counting and combinations
1:35
and it's called combinatorics.
1:37

1:39

0:00
Let's talk about a concept that probably
0:03
confuses chemistry students the most on some level.
0:06
But on some level it's also one of the simplest concepts.
0:09
And that's the idea of a mole,
0:12
which in chemistry is different
0:13
that the thing digging up your backyard,
0:15
or the thing you want to get removed from your left eye.
0:19
A mole in chemistry is just a number.
0:21
It's just a number,
0:23
and the number is 6.02 times 10 to the 23.
0:28
So it's a very huge number.
0:29
And this is also called Avogadro's number.
0:31
Maybe I will do a video on Avogadro.
0:35
Avogadro's number
0:39
But that's all you need to know.
0:41
A mole is just a number.
0:43
There are kind of more Byzantine definitions of a mole.
0:47
This actually is not
0:49
-- actually, let me copy and paste it from Wikipedia.
0:51
This is Wikipedia's definition of a mole.
0:55
And you hopefully at the end of this video
0:58
you'll see that they're equivalent.
0:59
But if you're just getting exposed to the concept,
1:01
this to me, it's just not an easy concept.
1:07
Basically, ""a mole is defined as the amount of substance
1:10
of a system that contains as many elemental entities
1:16
as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon 12.""
1:19
Well, I just told you that a mole is 6.02 times 10 to the 23.
1:24
So if you just take the last part,
1:26
atoms in 12 grams of carbon 12.
1:30
So that means that there are 1 mole of carbon 12
1:39
-- let me write it like that -- carbon 12.
1:42
There are 1 mole of carbon 12 atoms in 12 grams of carbon.
1:57
And so that's why a mole is useful.
1:59
So I could have just instead of writing 1 mole,
2:02
I could have replaced this as there's 6.02 times 10
2:06
to the 23 carbon atoms, carbon 12 atoms in 12 grams of carbon.
2:12
How do you figure that out?
2:13
Or I guess, what else does this mean?
2:15
I mean, we just added in carbon,
2:17
they said it's the amount of substance of any molecule,
2:19
if you convert between atomic mass units and grams.
2:22
This I find very confusing.
2:24
How can we apply this in other places?
2:26
So the first thing to realize is a mole is just a way
2:29
of translating between grams and atomic mass units.
2:32
One carbon 12 atom is what?
2:35
What's its mass number?
2:37
It's 12.
2:39
That's why it's called carbon 12 instead of carbon 14.
2:41
So its mass is 12 atomic mass units.
2:46
So if you have something that has a mass of 12 atomic mass units
2:50
and you have a mole of them,
2:52
or you have 6.02 times 10 to the 23 of them,
2:55
all of those atoms combined will have a mass of 12 grams.
3:01
So another way to think about it is
3:04
1 gram is equal to 1 mole of atomic mass units.
3:13
I'll write amu's like that.
3:16
Or you can write 1 gram is equal to 6.02
3:22
times 10 to the 23 atomic mass units.
3:26
And the reason why this is useful
3:28
-- and it's kind of addressed in this Wikipedia definition there
3:30
-- is it helps us translate between the atomic world
3:33
-- where we deal with atomic mass units and we deal with,
3:36
oh, we've got an extra neutron now,
3:37
let's add one to our atomic mass number
3:41
-- and translating between that atomic world
3:43
and our everyday world where we deal in grams.
3:45
And just so you know, a gram is still
3:47
a pretty small amount of mass.
3:50
It's 1/1,000 of a kilogram.
3:52
A kilogram is about 2 pounds.
3:54
So this is about 1/500 of a pound.
3:56
So this is not much.
3:58
So there's a ton of atoms in a very small amount of
4:02
-- in 1 gram of carbon, or at least in 12 grams of carbon,
4:06
you have a ton of atoms. You have 6.02 times 10 to the 23.
4:10
And just to hit the point home,
4:12
I probably should have talked about this in the atom.
4:13
This is a huge number.
4:15
To maybe visualize it, if you think of -- I was told that
4:22
in the diameter of a hair, if this is a hair
4:25
and this is diameter of the hair,
4:27
if you go this way there 1 million carbon atoms.
4:32
1 million carbon atoms that way.
4:35
Or if you were to take an apple
4:41
and you were to try to figure out what fraction,
4:45
if you were to make one of the atoms of an apple
4:48
-- and obviously,
4:50
an apple has a bunch of different types of atoms in it
4:52
-- but if you were to take one of the atoms
4:53
and make it the size of the apple,
4:55
then the apple would be the size of the earth.
4:58
So an apple atom is to an apple
5:00
as an apple is to the earth.
5:03
So these are obviously-- it's hard for us
5:06
to even process things of this size.
5:08
When you just have one gram of
5:12
-- well, let's say you have 1 gram of hydrogen.
5:14
1 gram of hydrogen. 1 gram of hydrogen.
5:22
If you have 1 gram of hydrogen,
5:24
that means you have 1 mole of hydrogen.
5:29
How do I know that?
5:31
Because hydrogen's atomic mass number is 1.
5:34
So in general, if you just take any element
5:39
-- so what is the mass of,
5:41
let me just pick, 1 mole of aluminum?
5:45
So if I were to take 6.02 times 10 to the 23 aluminum atoms,
5:54
what is the mass of that collection?
5:56
Well, each of them have an atomic mass number of 13.
6:00
So it's 13 amu's-- I don't have to put the s there
6:08
-- times six point
6:11
-- well, I won't write that way, actually.
6:14
That'll probably just confuse you.
6:15
The easy way to think about is if you have a mole of an atom,
6:18
you take its mass-- I was taking its atomic number,
6:21
that's not good-- you take its mass number.
6:23
In this case let's say it's 27.
6:26
So we're dealing with aluminum 27.
6:30
You take its mass number, and if you have 1 mole of it,
6:34
then the mass of that will be 27 grams.
6:41
So that literally, when you have one mole of an atom
6:44
it's a direct translation between its mass number and grams.
6:48
1 mole of iron, let's say iron 56--
6:53
there's obviously many isotopes or iron
6:55
-- let's say we're dealing with iron 56.
6:58
You normally don't hear it like that,
6:59
but let's say we're dealing with the isotope of iron
7:02
that has a mass number of 56.
7:04
So if I have 1 mole of this, 1 mole of this atom right here,
7:11
that's going to have a mass of
7:15
-- the math isn't difficult here
7:16
-- 56 grams. Right? And if you think about it,
7:23
how many atomic mass units is this?
7:24
Well, this is 56 atomic mass units per atom.
7:30
Then you have a mole of those, so you have
7:32
6.02 times 10 to the 23 times 56 atomic mass units.
7:37
And then you divide it
7:39
by the number of atomic mass units per gram.
7:41
And you end up with 56 grams.
7:43
But the easy way to think about it is
7:44
you just take whatever the mass number is.
7:46
If you have silicon, if you have a mole of silicon,
7:49
a mole of silicon will have a mass
7:52
-- I don't want to say weight
7:53
because this should apply to any planet
7:54
-- of 28 grams.
7:56
What about 2 moles of silicon? 2 moles of silicon.
8:04
And I'll write its mass number.
8:05
Let's say silicon has a mass number of 28.
8:10
Two moles of silicon.
8:12
Well, 1 more would have a mass of 28 grams,
8:15
so 2 moles is going to have a mass of 56 grams.
8:23
If I were to say, let's say I had 4 moles of oxygen,
8:29
which has a mass number of 16.
8:32
What is the mass of that?
8:34
This is a huge number of oxygen atoms
8:37
-- what would be the mass of that?
8:38
Well, it would be 4 times-- 1 mole of oxygen
8:44
would have a mass of 16 grams,
8:47
so 4 moles has 64 grams.
8:52
It's confusing because we're not used to using a word
8:55
like moles as a number, but all it is, is a number.
8:58
And the easy way to think about is that it lets us
9:00
translate between this atomic mass unit number and grams.
9:06
And you say, well, how do I get that many grams?
9:08
Well, I have to have 6.02 times 10 to the 23 carbon atoms
9:12
for that collection of carbon to have a mass of 12 grams.
9:16
That's all that mole means.
9:18
It's just a number.
9:19
And I encourage you to kind of play around
9:21
with a lot of what we talked about.
9:22
Because it's super important
9:24
to have the intuition behind moles,
9:25
otherwise, you'll get confused later on
9:27
when we start getting into energies
9:29
in terms of it requires kilojoules per mole,
9:31
and what is the energy of this reaction
9:34
and all that type of stuff.
9:35
So just really try to make sure
9:37
you digest this as well as possible.
9:38
And let me know if you don't
9:40
and I'll maybe make another video on this

0:00
- [Voiceover] Let's now see if we can balance a chemical
0:02
equation with slightly more complex molecules.
0:07
So, here we have a chemical equation,
0:10
describing a chemical reaction.
0:11
This is actually a combustion reaction.
0:14
You have some ethylene right over here,
0:17
in the presence of oxygen, and you need to get a
0:20
little bit of energy to get this going, but then you're
0:22
going to have this reaction that's actually going to
0:24
release energy as well, but we're not accounting for
0:26
the energy, at least the way we've written it.
0:28
Right over here, you have some ethylene, and this little
0:32
g in parentheses, says it's in the gas form
0:35
or gaseous form, so gaseous ethylene plus some
0:40
dioxygen molecule, which is the most prevalent form of
0:43
oxygen molecule that you would find in the atmosphere.
0:47
And so, that's also in the gas form.
0:49
Put them together, you end up with some carbon dioxide
0:52
gas and some liquid water.
0:55
This is the classic combustion reaction.
0:58
But now let's think about, how do we balance this thing?
1:01
Let's make sure we have the same number
1:03
of each atom on both sides.
1:07
And when you see something more complicated like this,
1:09
where, you know, here I have an oxygen and two different
1:13
molecules over here, and a lot of these molecules have
1:17
multiple elements in it.
1:19
It might be very daunting.
1:20
Where do I start?
1:21
And this is where the art of balancing chemical
1:23
equations starts to come into play.
1:26
The general idea is,
1:28
Try to balance the...
1:30
try to balance the molecules that have multiple
1:33
elements in them first, and leave the...
1:37
molecules that only have one element in them for last.
1:40
And the idea there is, is that these are harder.
1:43
They're going to have all sorts of implications,
1:44
and then, at the end of the day, you can just set
1:46
a number here for the number of dioxygens.
1:50
If you saved, say the ethylene for last,
1:54
then every time, and you're trying to balance the carbons,
1:57
you try to change the number of carbons, you're going to
1:59
change the number of hydrogens,
2:00
which is going to change the...
2:01
You're going to have to balance over and over, and you're
2:03
going to go into this really really really confusing circle.
2:05
So, the best thing to do, try to balance
2:08
the complex molecules first, and then
2:11
save the single element molecules for last.
2:15
So let's do that.
2:16
So, let's start with the carbons.
2:19
So, over here, I have two carbons.
2:22
Over here, I only have one carbon.
2:26
I only have one carbon.
2:28
So, it seems like the best way to balance it is, I should
2:31
have two molecules of carbon dioxide,
2:35
and I haven't even thought about the oxygens yet.
2:37
By putting that two there, that's going to change the
2:39
number of oxygens I have on the righthand side.
2:42
But at least it balances my carbons.
2:44
I now have two carbons on the lefthand side,
2:47
and I have two carbons on the righthand side.
2:49
I’m no longer magically destroying
2:52
a carbon atom, all right.
2:55
Now, let's move on to the hydrogens, and remember,
2:57
what I said is, let's wait to do the oxygens last,
3:00
because we have a molecule
3:03
that only contains oxygen right over here,
3:06
so we'll save oxygen for last.
3:08
So, let's do hydrogen next.
3:11
So, hydrogen, right over here, we have four hydrogens.
3:15
And on the righthand side, we have two hydrogens.
3:18
So, it seems like the easiest thing to do to balance
3:21
the hydrogens is to have two of these water molecules.
3:25
Now I have four hydrogens here,
3:27
and I have four hydrogens there.
3:30
Now, let's do the oxygen.
3:33
Now, let's do the oxygen.
3:34
I've balanced the carbons and the hydrogens.
3:36
And the reason why oxygen's going to be interesting,
3:38
I can just count the amount of oxygen I now have here,
3:41
after changing the amount of molecules I have.
3:45
And then I can adjust this accordingly, because this is
3:48
only going to affect the number of oxygens
3:50
that I have on the lefthand side.
3:52
Right now, on the lefthand side, I have two oxygens,
3:54
and on the righthand side, let me count this,
3:57
I have two O two's, really.
4:00
So, this is going to be four oxygens here,
4:02
and then I have, each of these water molecules has
4:05
one oxygen, but I have two water molecules,
4:07
so this is going to be two oxygens, two oxygens here.
4:11
So, on the righthand side, I have four plus two oxygens.
4:15
So, I have six oxygens on the righthand side.
4:17
I need six oxygens on the lefthand side.
4:19
I need this number to be six.
4:21
So, how do I do that?
4:23
Well, I just need three of these molecules.
4:24
If I have three molecules, each of them have two oxygens,
4:27
I'm going to have a total of six oxygens.

0:00
Welcome back.
0:01
So we have this green spring here, and let's see,
0:03
there's a wall here.
0:04
This connected to the wall.
0:06
And let's say that this is where the spring is naturally.
0:09
So if I were not to push on the spring, it would stretch
0:12
all the way out here.
0:14
But in this situation, I pushed on the spring, so it
0:16
has a displacement of x to the left.
0:19
And we'll just worry about magnitude, so we won't worry
0:21
too much about direction.
0:23
So what I want to do is think a little bit-- well, first I
0:25
want to graph how much force I've applied at different
0:29
points as I compress this spring.
0:31
And then I want to use that graph to maybe figure out how
0:35
much work we did in compressing the spring.
0:38
So let's look at-- I know I'm compressing to the left.
0:45
Maybe I should compress to the right, so that you can-- well,
0:48
we're just worrying about the magnitude of the x-axis.
0:51
Let's draw a little graph here.
0:53
That's my y-axis, x-axis.
1:03
So this axis is how much I've compressed it, x, and then
1:09
this axis, the y-axis, is how much force I have to apply.
1:14
So when the spring was initially all the way out
1:18
here, to compress it a little bit, how much force
1:21
do I have to apply?
1:22
Well, this was its natural state, right?
1:25
And we know from-- well, Hooke's Law told us that the
1:29
restorative force-- I'll write a little r down here-- is
1:34
equal to negative K, where K is the spring constant, times
1:39
the displacement, right?
1:42
That's the restorative force, so that's the force that the
1:44
spring applies to whoever's pushing on it.
1:47
The force to compress it is just the same thing, but it's
1:50
going in the same direction as the x.
1:51
If I'm moving the spring, if I'm compressing the spring to
1:55
the left, then the force I'm applying is also to the left.
1:58
So I'll call that the force of compression.
2:01
The force of compression is going to be
2:03
equal to K times x.
2:05
And when the spring is compressed and not
2:07
accelerating in either direction, the force of
2:09
compression is going to be equal to
2:11
the restorative force.
2:12
So what I want to do here is plot the force of compression
2:16
with respect to x.
2:17
And I should have drawn it the other way, but I think you
2:20
understand that x is increasing to the left in my
2:22
example, right?
2:23
This is where x is equal to 0 right here.
2:30
And say, this might be x is equal to 10 because we've
2:33
compressed it by 10 meters.
2:36
So let's see how much force we've applied.
2:38
So when x is 0, which is right here, how much force do we
2:43
need to apply to compress the spring?
2:45
Well, if we give zero force, the spring won't move, but if
2:48
we just give a little, little bit of force, if we just give
2:52
infinitesimal, super-small amount of force, we'll
2:55
compress the spring just a little bit, right?
2:58
Because at that point, the force of compression is going
3:01
to be pretty much zero.
3:03
So when the spring is barely compressed, we're going to
3:06
apply a little, little bit of force, so almost at zero.
3:12
To displace the spring zero, we apply zero force.
3:15
To displace the spring a little bit, we have to apply a
3:17
little bit more force.
3:19
To displace soon. the spring 1 meter, so if this is say, 1
3:22
meter, how much force will we have to
3:28
apply to keep it there?
3:31
So let's say if this is 1 meter, the force of
3:36
compression is going to be K times 1, so it's
3:38
just going to be K.
3:42
And realize, you didn't apply zero and then apply K force.
3:46
You keep applying a little bit more force.
3:49
Every time you compress the spring a little bit, it takes
3:52
a little bit more force to compress it a little bit more.
3:55
So to compress it 1 meters, you need to apply K.
3:58
And to get it there, you have to keep increasing the amount
4:01
of force you apply.
4:02
At 2 meters, you would've been up to 2K, et cetera.
4:10
I think you see a line is forming.
4:11
Let me draw that line.
4:14
The line looks something like that.
4:17
And so this is how much force you need to apply as a
4:20
function of the displacement of the spring from its natural
4:24
rest state, right?
4:26
And here I have positive x going to the right, but in
4:28
this case, positive x is to the left.
4:30
I'm just measuring its actual displacement.
4:32
I'm not worried too much about direction right now.
4:36
So I just want you to think a little bit about what's
4:38
happening here.
4:39
You just have to slowly keep on-- you could apply a very
4:42
large force initially.
4:43
If you apply a very large force initially, the spring
4:46
will actually accelerate much faster, because you're
4:48
applying a much larger force than its restorative force,
4:52
and so it might accelerate and then it'll spring back, and
4:54
actually, we'll do a little example of that.
4:55
But really, just to displace the spring a certain distance,
4:59
you have to just gradually increase the force, just so
5:01
that you offset the restorative force.
5:04
Hopefully, that makes sense, and you understand that the
5:06
force just increases proportionally as a function
5:09
of the distance, and that's just because
5:11
this is a linear equation.
5:12
And what's the slope of this?
5:14
Well, slope is rise over run, right?
5:17
So if I run 1, this is 1, what's my rise?
5:23
It's K.
5:24
So the slope of this graph is K.
5:28
So using this graph, let's figure out how much work we
5:31
need to do to compress this spring.
5:35
I don't know, let's say this is x0.
5:39
So x is where it's the general variable.
5:41
X0 is a particular value for x.
5:42
That could be 10 or whatever.
5:44
Let's see how much work we need.
5:46
So what's the definition of work?
5:48
Work is equal to the force in the direction of your
5:52
displacement times the displacement, right?
5:57
So let's see how much we've displaced.
5:59
So when we go from zero to here, we've
6:05
displaced this much.
6:06
And what was the force of the displacement?
6:08
Well, the force was gradually increasing the entire time, so
6:11
the force is going to be be roughly about that big.
6:16
I'm approximating.
6:17
And I'll show you that you actually have to approximate.
6:19
So the force is kind of that square right there.
6:25
And then to displace the next little distance-- that's not
6:31
bright enough-- my force is going to increase a little
6:34
bit, right?
6:35
So this is the force, this is the distance.
6:38
So if you you see, the work I'm doing is actually going to
6:41
be the area under the curve, each of
6:42
these rectangles, right?
6:43
Because the height of the rectangle is the force I'm
6:46
applying and the width is the distance, right?
6:50
So the work is just going to be the sum of all of these
6:52
rectangles.
6:53
And the rectangles I drew are just kind of approximations,
6:56
because they don't get right under the line.
6:57
You have to keep making the rectangle smaller, smaller,
6:59
smaller, and smaller, and just sum up more and more and more
7:02
rectangles, right?
7:04
And actually I'm touching on integral calculus right now.
7:07
But if you don't know integral calculus,
7:09
don't worry about it.
7:09
But the bottom line is the work we're doing-- hopefully I
7:12
showed you-- is just going to be the area under this line.
7:16
So the work I'm doing to displace the spring x meters
7:20
is the area from here to here.
7:26
And what's that area?
7:27
Well, this is a triangle, so we just need to know the base,
7:30
the height, and multiply it times 1/2, right?
7:32
That's just the area of a triangle.
7:34
So what's the base?
7:36
So this is just x0.
7:39
What's the height?
7:41
Well, we know the slope is K, so this height is going to be
7:44
x0 times K.
7:47
So this point right here is the point x0, and
7:51
then x0 times K.
7:54
And so what's the area under the curve, which is the total
7:57
work I did to compress the spring x0 meters?
8:02
Well, it's the base, x0, times the height, x0, times K.
8:09
And then, of course, multiply by 1/2, because we're dealing
8:12
with a triangle, right?
8:14
So that equals 1/2K x0 squared.
8:19
And for those of you who know calculus, that, of course, is
8:22
the same thing as the integral of Kx dx.
8:25
And that should make sense.
8:27
Each of these are little dx's.
8:28
But I don't want to go too much into calculus now.
8:29
It'll confuse people.
8:31
So that's the total work necessary to compress the
8:33
spring by distance of x0.
8:36
Or if we set a distance of x, you can just get
8:38
rid of this 0 here.
8:40
And why is that useful?
8:41
Because the work necessary to compress the spring that much
8:44
is also how much potential energy there is
8:47
stored in the spring.
8:49
So if I told you that I had a spring and its spring constant
8:57
is 10, and I compressed it 5 meters, so x is equal to 5
9:03
meters, at the time that it's compressed, how much potential
9:08
energy is in that spring?
9:10
We can just say the potential energy is equal to 1/2K times
9:15
x squared equals 1/2.
9:18
K is 10 times 25, and that equals 125.
9:25
And, of course, work and potential energy
9:26
are measured in joules.
9:29
So this is really what you just have to memorize.
9:33
Or hopefully you don't memorize it.
9:34
Hopefully, you understand where I got it, and that's why
9:36
I spent 10 minutes doing it.
9:38
But this is how much work is necessary to compress the
9:39
spring to that point and how much potential energy is
9:43
stored once it is compressed to that point, or actually
9:45
stretched that much.
9:47
We've been compressing, but you can
9:48
also stretch the spring.
9:50
If you know that, then we can start doing some problems with
9:53
potential energy in springs, which I will
9:56
do in the next video.

teded_Will future spacecraft fit in our pockets? - Dhonam Pemba - 04:37_4,How fast do the charged ions shoot out of the emitters?,multiple-choices,"When you picture a spaceship,
you probably think of something like this,
or this, or maybe this.
What do they all have in common?
Among other things, they're huge
because they have to carry people, fuel,
and all sorts of supplies, 
scientific instruments,
and, in rare cases, planet-killing lasers.
But the next real-world generation 
of spacecraft may be much, much smaller.
We're talking fit-inside-your-pocket tiny.
Imagine sending a swarm of these
microspacecraft out into the galaxy.
They could explore 
distant stars and planets
by carrying sophisticated 
electronic sensors
that would measure everything
from temperature to cosmic rays.
You could deploy thousands of them
for the cost of a single 
space shuttle mission,
exponentially increasing 
the amount of data
we could collect about the universe.
And they're individually expendable,
meaning that we could send them 
into environments
that are too risky 
for a billion dollar rocket or probe.
Several hundred small spacecraft
are already orbiting the Earth,
taking pictures of outer space,
and collecting data on things,
like the behavior of bacteria 
in the Earth's atmosphere
and magnetic signals that could help
predict earthquakes.
But imagine how much more we could learn
if they could fly beyond Earth's orbit.
That's exactly what organizations,
like NASA, want to do:
send microspacecraft 
to scout habitable planets
and describe astronomical phenomena
we can't study from Earth.
But something so small can't carry 
a large engine or tons of fuel,
so how would such a vessel propel itself?
For microspacecraft, it turns out, 
you need micropropulsion.
On really small scales,
some of the familiar 
rules of physics don't apply,
in particular, everyday 
Newtonian mechanics break down,
and forces that are normally negligible
become powerful.
Those forces include surface tension
and capillary action,
the phenomena 
that govern other small things.
Micropropulsion systems can harness
these forces to power spacecraft.
One example of how this might work
is called microfluidic 
electrospray propulsion.
It's a type of ion thruster,
which means that it shoots out
charged particles to generate momentum.
One model being developed at NASA's
jet propulsion laboratory
is only a couple centimeters 
on each side.
Here's how it works.
That postage-stamp sized metal plate
is studded with a hundred skinny needles
and coated with a metal 
that has a low melting point, like indium.
A metal grid sits above the needles,
and an electric field is set up
between the grid and the plate.
When the plate is heated,
the indium melts
and capillary action draws 
the liquid metal up the needles.
The electric field tugs 
the molten metal upwards,
while surface tension pulls it back,
causing the indium to deform into a cone.
The small radius of the tips 
of the needles
makes it possible for the electric field
to overcome the surface tension,
and when that happens,
positively charged ions shoot off at
speeds of tens of kilometers per second.
That stream of ions propels the spacecraft
in the opposite direction,
thanks to Newton's third law.
And while each ion 
is an extremely small particle,
the combined force of so many of them
pushing away from the craft
is enough to generate 
significant acceleration.
And unlike the exhaust 
that pours out of a rocket engine,
this stream is much smaller
and far more fuel efficient,
which makes it better suited
for long deep-space missions.
These micropropulsion systems
haven't been fully tested yet,
but some scientists think that they
will provide enough thrust
to break small craft out of Earth's orbit.
In fact, they're predicting that thousands
of microspacecraft
will be launched in the next ten years
to gather data that today 
we can only dream about.
And that is micro-rocket science.",TED-Ed,Science,Will future spacecraft fit in our pockets? - Dhonam Pemba - 04:37,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7IsyjFROHE,data/teded/crawled_data/videos/Will future spacecraft fit in our pockets? - Dhonam Pemba - 04:37,,

0:00
Let's start again with a point.
0:02
Let's call that point point A. And what I'm curious about
0:05
is all of the points on my screen right over here,
0:08
that are exactly 2 centimeters away from A.
0:11
So 2 centimeters on my screen is about that far.
0:16
So clearly if I start at A and I go
0:17
2 centimeters in that direction, this point right over there,
0:20
is 2 centimeters from A. If I call that point, point B,
0:23
then I could say line segment AB is 2 centimeters.
0:27
The length is 2 centimeters.
0:28
Remember this would refer to the actual line segment.
0:33
I could say this looks nice, but if I talk about its length,
0:36
I would get rid of that line on top
0:37
and I would just say AB is equal to 2.
0:39
If I wanted to put units I could say 2 centimenters.
0:42
But I'm not curious just about B, I want to think about all
0:45
of the points, the set of all of the points
0:47
that are exactly 2 centimeters away from A.
0:51
So I could go 2 centimeters in the other direction,
0:53
maybe get to point C right over here.
0:57
So AC is also going to be equal to 2 centimeters,
1:00
but I could go 2 centimeters in any direction.
1:02
And so if I find the set of all of the points
1:04
that are exactly 2 centimeters away from A,
1:07
I will get a very familiar looking shape, like this,
1:11
and I'm trying to draw it freehand.
1:13
So I would get a shape that looks like this.
1:16
Actually, let me draw it in.
1:17
I don't want to make you think that it's only the points where
1:20
there's white, it's all of these points right over here.
1:22
I don't want to draw a dashed line over there, which maybe I
1:25
should just, let me clear out all of these
1:28
and I'll just draw it as a solid line.
1:31
So this could look something like that.
1:36
My best attempt.
1:38
And this set of all of the points that
1:40
are exactly 2 centimeters away from A,
1:43
this is a circle, as I'm sure you are already familiar with.
1:47
But that is the formal definition-- the set
1:49
of all points that are a fixed distance,
1:51
or that have a fixed distance, from A
1:53
that are a given distance from A.
1:55
If I said the set of all points that are 3 centimeters from A,
1:58
it might look something like this.
2:00
It might look something like that.
2:02
That would give us another circle.
2:06
I think you get the general idea.
2:07
Now what I want to do in this video
2:09
is introduce ourselves into some of the concepts and words
2:14
that we use when dealing with circles.
2:16
So let me get rid of that 3-centimeter circle.
2:18
So first of all, let's think about this distance.
2:22
This distance, or one of these line segments
2:26
that join A, which we would call the center of the circle.
2:30
So we'll call A the center of the circle,
2:32
and it makes sense just from the way
2:33
we use the word center in everyday life.
2:36
What I want to do is think about what line segment AB is.
2:41
AB connects the center and it connects a point on the circle
2:45
itself.
2:46
Remember, the circle itself is all of the points that
2:48
are equal distance from the center.
2:50
So AB, any line segment, I should say,
2:53
that connects the center to a point on the circle,
2:56
we would call a radius.
3:01
And so the length of the radius, AB over here,
3:03
is equal to 2 centimeters.
3:05
And you're probably already familiar with the word radius,
3:07
but I'm just being a little bit more formal.
3:09
And what's interesting about geometry,
3:11
at least when you start learning it at the high school level,
3:13
is it's probably the first class where you're
3:15
introduced into a slightly more formal mathematics, where we're
3:18
a little bit more careful about giving our definitions
3:21
and then building on those definitions
3:23
to come up with interesting results
3:24
and proving to ourselves that we definitely
3:27
know what we think we know.
3:28
And so that's why we're being a little bit more
3:30
careful with our language over here.
3:33
So AB is our radius, line segment AB, and so
3:36
is line segment-- let me draw another point on here,
3:41
let's say this is X-- so line segment AX is also a radius.
3:52
Now you can also have other forms of lines and line
3:55
segments that interact in interesting ways
3:58
with the circle.
3:59
So you could have a line that just intersects
4:02
that circle at exactly one point.
4:05
So let's call that point right over there, let's call that D.
4:08
And let's say you have a line, and the only point
4:12
on the circle-- the only point in the set of all of the points
4:16
that are equal distant from A, the only point on that circle
4:19
that is also on that line is point D.
4:22
And we could call that line l.
4:25
So sometimes you'll see lines specified
4:27
by some of the points on them.
4:29
So for example, if I had another point right over here called E,
4:32
we could call this line line DE, or we could just
4:37
put a little script letter here with an l
4:39
and say this is line l.
4:41
But this line that only has one point in common
4:44
with our circle, we call this a tangent line.
4:47
So line l is a tangent.
4:49
It is tangent to the circle.
4:54
So let me write it this way, line l
4:58
is tangent-- you normally wouldn't write it
5:01
in caps like this, I'm just doing
5:02
that for emphasis-- is tangent to-- instead of writing
5:06
the circle centered at A, you'll sometimes
5:09
see this notation-- to the circle centered at A.
5:13
So this tells us that this is the circle we're talking about.
5:15
Because who knows, maybe we had another circle over here
5:18
that is centered at M, another circle.
5:21
So we have to specify it's not tangent to that one,
5:23
it's tangent to this one.
5:24
So this circle with a dot in the middle
5:26
tells we're talking about a circle,
5:28
and this is a circle centered at point
5:30
A. I want to be very clear, point A is not on the circle,
5:33
point A is the center of the circle.
5:35
The points on the circle are the points equal distant
5:38
from point A. Now, l is tangent, because it only
5:42
intersects the circle in one point.
5:44
You could just as easily imagine a line
5:48
that intersects the circle at two points.
5:51
So we could call, maybe this is F and this is G,
5:55
you could call that line FG.
5:58
So we could write it like this, line FG.
6:01
And this line that intersects it at two points,
6:03
we call this a secant of circle A.
6:09
It is a secant line to this circle right over here,
6:14
because it intersects it in two points.
6:16
Now, if FG was just a segment, if it
6:19
didn't keep on going forever, like lines like to do,
6:22
if we only spoke about this line segment--
6:25
let me do this in a new color-- if we only spoke
6:28
about this line segment between F and G,
6:32
and not thinking about going on forever, then all of a sudden
6:35
we have a line segment, which we would specify there.
6:38
And we would call this a chord of the circle,
6:43
a chord of circle A. It starts at a point on the circle,
6:49
a point that is exactly in this case 2 centimeters away,
6:52
and then it finishes at a point on the circle.
6:54
So it connects two points on the circle.
6:58
Now, you could have chords like this,
7:00
and you can also have a chord, as you can imagine,
7:02
a chord that actually goes through the center
7:04
of the circle.
7:06
So let's call this point, point H,
7:09
and you have a straight line connecting F to H through A.
7:14
So that's about as straight as I could draw it.
7:16
So if you have a chord like that,
7:20
that contains the actual center of the circle,
7:23
of course it goes from one point of the circle
7:25
to another point of the circle, and it goes
7:26
through the center of the circle,
7:28
we call that a diameter of A.
7:39
And you've probably seen this in tons of problems
7:42
before, when we were not talking about geometry as formally,
7:46
but the diameter is made up of exactly two radiuses.
7:51
We already know that a radius connects a point to the center.
7:54
So you have one radius right over here
7:56
that connects F and A, that's one radius,
8:00
and then you have another radius connecting
8:02
A and H, the center to a point on the circle.
8:05
So the diameter is made up of these two radiuses,
8:07
or radii I should call it, I think
8:09
that's the plural for radius.
8:11
And so the length of a diameter is
8:13
going to be twice the length of a radius.
8:15
So we could say the length of the diameter, so the length
8:19
of FH-- and once again I don't put the line on top of it
8:22
when I'm just talking about the length--
8:24
is going to be equal to FA, the length of segment
8:28
FA, plus the length of segment AH.
8:34
Now there's one last thing I want
8:36
to talk about when we're dealing with circles,
8:38
and that's the idea of an arc.
8:40
So we also have the parts of the circle itself.
8:43
So let me draw another circle over here.
8:46
Let's center this circle right over here at B.
8:49
And I'm going to find all of the points that
8:52
are a given distance from B. So it has some radius,
8:56
I'm not going to specify it right over here,
8:59
and let me pick some random points on the circle.
9:01
So let's call this J, let's call that K, let's call this S,
9:10
let's call this T, let's call this U right over here.
9:14
And I know it doesn't look that centered, let me try to center
9:16
B a little bit better.
9:17
Let me erase that.
9:19
And if I put B a little bit closer
9:21
to the center of the circle, so that's my best shot, so let's
9:25
put B right over there.
9:27
Now, one interesting thing is, what do you
9:29
call the length of the circle that goes between two points?
9:33
So what would you call-- let me get a good color here--
9:37
what would you call this?
9:38
Well, you could imagine in everyday language
9:40
we would call something that looks like that an arc,
9:41
and we would also call that an arc in geometry.
9:44
To specify this arc we would call
9:46
this JK, the two endpoints of the arc,
9:50
the two points on the circle that
9:51
are the endpoints of the arc, and you
9:53
use a little notation like that.
9:55
So you put a little curve on top instead of a straight line.
9:59
Now you could also have another arc that connects JK,
10:01
this is the minor arc.
10:03
It is the shortest way along the circle to connect J and K,
10:06
but you could also go the other way around.
10:08
You could also have this thing that
10:10
goes all the way around the circle.
10:13
And we would call that the major arc.
10:15
And normally when you specify a major arc, just
10:17
to show that you're going the long way around,
10:21
it's not the shortest way to get between J and K,
10:23
you'll often specify another point
10:24
that you're going through.
10:25
So for example, this major arc we could specify we start at J,
10:30
we went through-- we could have said U, T, or S,
10:32
but I'll put T right over there-- we went through T
10:34
and then we went all the way to K.
10:37
And so this specifies the major arc
10:40
and this thing could have been the same thing as if I wrote
10:42
JUK, these are specifying the same thing, or JSK.
10:48
So there's multiple ways to specify this major arc
10:51
right over here.
10:51
But the one thing I make clear is,
10:53
is that the minor arc is the shortest distance,
10:56
so this is the minor arc, and the longer distance around
11:01
is the major arc.
11:06
And I'll leave you there and maybe the next few videos we'll
11:09
start playing with some of this notation a little bit more.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,U2W7HPyC0cM,
khan_video_rNJPNlgmhbk_14,"At 9:50, the guy drops the Oxygen bond to the rest of the ester molecule...

How does that happen?",Essay,"•
0:00
In the last video, we saw that sodium borohydride
0:03
will reduce aldehydes or ketones to form
0:06
primary or secondary alcohols.
0:08
And if we look at this general reaction,
0:10
this is either an aldehyde or a ketone over here.
0:13
If we add lithium aluminum hydride in the first step
0:16
and then a source of protons in the second step-- which
0:19
is water-- we will form either a primary or a secondary alcohol,
0:23
depending on our starting materials.
0:24
So in that respect, lithium aluminum hydride
0:26
will react in the same way as sodium borohydride.
0:29
However, sodium borohydride will only
0:32
reduce aldehydes or ketones.
0:34
It won't reduce carboxylic acids or esters.
0:37
And that's what lithium aluminum hydride does.
0:39
So we can see that-- if this is an OH right here--
0:43
that would be a carboxylic acid functional group.
0:45
And if we take off the H and put in an alkyl group
0:47
in our prime group there, we would have an ester.
0:50
So lithium aluminum hydride, not only
0:52
reduces aldehydes and ketones, it also
0:54
reduces carboxylic acids and esters
0:56
since it's more reactive, which is also
0:58
why we have to separate these two.
1:00
We can't have water in the same reaction vessel
1:02
as our lithium aluminum hydride because it
1:04
will react with that faster.
1:06
And so once again, our product will
1:09
depend on what our starting material is.
1:11
So the mechanism for the reduction
1:13
of aldehydes or ketones with lithium aluminum hydride
1:15
is just like the one for sodium borohydride.
1:18
So we'll move on to a mechanism for the reduction of an ester.
1:22
So let's go ahead and do that.
1:24
So let's start with an ester down here.
1:26
So we have our carbonyl.
1:28
Like that.
1:29
So we'll put in our lone pairs.
1:31
And down here, we have our R prime group.
1:34
Like that.
1:35
So there's our ester.
1:36
And we add lithium aluminum hydride in excess.
1:40
So in terms of molar equivalence,
1:43
let's go ahead and put lithium aluminum hydride down here,
1:46
Li+.
1:47
And then, we have Al bonded to 4 hydrogens.
1:51
Like that.
1:51
And that's going to give the aluminum
1:53
a negative 1 formal charge.
1:55
Like that.
1:56
So the first step in the mechanism
1:58
is just like the one we did in the previous video.
2:00
All right.
2:01
We think about the carbonyl up here and the difference
2:04
in electronegativity between this carbon and this oxygen--
2:08
oxygen being more electronegative,
2:10
pulling these electrons closer towards it and the double bond,
2:13
giving it a partial negative charge.
2:16
Whereas the carbon down here is losing some electron density,
2:18
becoming partially positive.
2:20
So the carbonyl carbon is an electrophile.
2:23
It wants electrons.
2:24
And of course, it's going to get electrons
2:26
from these 2 electrons in here.
2:28
So these 2 electrons are going to attack this carbon.
2:32
All right.
2:32
So a nucleophilic attack.
2:34
And kick these electrons off onto our oxygen.
2:38
So that's our first step-- the nucleophilic attack portion.
2:41
So now, we have R. And it used to have
2:45
2 bonds to carbon and oxygen.
2:46
Now, it has only 1 bond because those electrons
2:49
moved off onto the oxygen, giving the oxygen
2:52
a negative 1 formal charge.
2:54
Like that.
2:55
So we added on our hydrogen.
2:57
Like that.
2:58
And then, we still have our O and our R prime group
3:02
over here.
3:02
So it will look like that.
3:04
In the next step of this reaction,
3:07
the carbonyl's going to reform.
3:09
So the electrons in here are going to kick back into here
3:12
to reform our carbonyl.
3:14
That would mean 5 bonds to carbon--
3:16
which we know never happens-- so that these electrons are going
3:18
to have to break and come off onto the oxygen.
3:22
So let's go ahead and draw the results of that.
3:24
So now, we have R bonded to carbon.
3:27
Now, we reformed our carbonyls.
3:29
Now, we have only two lone pairs of electrons
3:31
on that oxygen now.
3:32
And then, we still have a hydrogen.
3:34
Right here.
3:35
All right.
3:35
So we lost an oxygen with an R prime group.
3:40
And that oxygen is going to have three lone pairs around it
3:43
with a negative 1 formal charge.
3:44
Oxygen being relatively electronegative,
3:47
it can handle that formal charge fairly well
3:49
and be relatively stable.
3:51
So now we have an aldehyde.
3:53
And we know that this reaction can occur again
3:57
with an aldehyde.
3:58
So since you have extra lithium aluminum hydride floating
4:01
around, what's going to happen is another reaction.
4:03
Right?
4:04
So another reaction just like the one we just did.
4:07
We're going to have our lithium aluminum hydride again.
4:11
It's so reactive, you can't stop this reaction
4:14
from occurring a second time.
4:16
And same idea.
4:18
Right?
4:18
Exact same idea.
4:20
Partial negative oxygen, partial positive carbon.
4:23
The carbon wants electrons.
4:27
It's going to get these electrons right in here.
4:30
So these electrons are going to attack this carbon, bring
4:33
the hydrogen along with it, and then
4:35
these electrons kick off onto the oxygen.
4:38
So let's go ahead and draw the product
4:40
of that nucleophilic attack.
4:42
Right now, we have an R group here
4:44
and we have our carbon bonded to an oxygen.
4:47
Once again, it used to have two lone pairs.
4:49
Now it has three, giving it a negative 1 formal charge.
4:52
And this hydrogen over here on the right
4:54
is going to stay here.
4:55
And we added on another hydrogen.
4:57
Like that.
4:58
All right.
4:58
So in the second step of this reaction,
5:01
we're going to add water.
5:03
So we go back up here to refresh our memory.
5:05
In the second step of this reaction,
5:08
you add water as a proton source.
5:11
So let's go ahead and draw water floating around there.
5:15
So here is our H20 molecule.
5:17
And we're going to get an acid-base reaction.
5:20
We're going to get a lone pair of electrons
5:23
attacking and grabbing that proton
5:25
there, kicking these electrons off onto the oxygen.
5:28
So we're going to protonate that alkoxide anion.
5:31
So you form our alcohol finally.
5:34
So we're finally done.
5:35
Now, we have r and then we have oxygen bonded
5:37
to that hydrogen there.
5:39
And now only two lone pairs, the formal charge goes away.
5:42
And you can see what we've done here.
5:44
We've actually added on two hydrogens
5:48
to our original carbonyl carbon.
5:50
All right.
5:52
This is my original carbonyl carbon.
5:54
And if I look at it over here, there's
5:57
actually no hydrogen attached to it over here.
5:59
Both of those hydrogens came from our lithium aluminum
6:03
hydride.
6:04
So this one and this one.
6:06
So the reaction happened twice.
6:09
All right.
6:09
So if you're doing this reaction with a carboxylic acid,
6:13
it's a similar mechanism.
6:15
We don't have time to go through it.
6:16
But you're going to end up with the same product.
6:20
You're going to add on two hydrogens
6:22
on to that original carbonyl carbon.
6:24
Like that.
6:25
So let's look at the chemoselectivity
6:28
of this reaction.
6:29
OK.
6:29
So now that we've covered sodium borohydride and lithium
6:32
aluminum hydride, let's see how you
6:35
can choose which one of those reagents is the best to use.
6:38
So if I start here with our reactants-- so let's
6:43
make it a benzene ring.
6:44
Like that.
6:45
And let's put stuff on the benzene ring.
6:47
OK.
6:47
So let's go ahead and put a double bond here.
6:50
And then, we'll make this an aldehyde functional group
6:53
on one end.
6:54
And then over here on this end, I'm going to put an ester.
7:00
Like that.
7:01
And let's look at how we can selectively
7:06
transform different parts of this molecule using
7:08
different reagents.
7:10
So let's say we were to do a reaction wherein
7:15
we add on sodium borohydride.
7:18
And then, the proton source in the second step.
7:22
So we need to think about what's going to happen.
7:25
Sodium borohydride is selective for aldehydes and ketones only.
7:30
It will not reduce carboxylic acids or esters.
7:34
So it's only going to react with the aldehyde at the top right
7:39
portion of this molecule.
7:41
So let's see if we can draw this in here.
7:43
So it's going to react with the aldehyde in the top right
7:46
portion.
7:47
All right.
7:47
So we are still going to have our double bond here.
7:51
And the aldehyde's going to go away to form a primary alcohol.
7:56
So we're going to get primary alcohol
7:58
where the aldehyde used to be.
7:59
Sodium borohydride has reduced that carbonyl.
8:02
And the second step-- the protonation of the alkyloxide--
8:04
forms your primary alcohol as your product.
8:07
And the rest of the molecule's going to stay the same.
8:10
So this ester is going to remain untouched down here.
8:13
So it's the chemoselectivity of that reaction.
8:17
All right.
8:17
Let's say we start with the same starting material.
8:21
And the first step-- this time we
8:22
add lithium aluminum hydride.
8:24
Like that.
8:25
And the second step-- we add some water.
8:29
Well, lithium aluminum hydride will
8:31
reduce aldehydes and ketones, and it will also reduce esters.
8:36
So lithium aluminum hydride in excess--
8:38
so let's just assume this is at an excess
8:40
here-- it's going to react with this aldehyde portion
8:44
of the molecule.
8:45
It's also going to react with this ester
8:47
portion of the molecule.
8:48
So it's going to reduce both of those and form alcohol.
8:51
So let's go ahead and try to draw the product here.
8:53
All right.
8:53
So we have our benzene ring, which is untouched.
8:56
And up here, we know that lithium aluminum hydride
9:01
is going to form a primary alcohol as well.
9:03
Like that.
9:04
And then, down here, what used to be our ester functional
9:08
group, we're going to add two molar equivalents of hydrogen
9:11
to that carbonyl.
9:12
And we're going to end up breaking
9:16
that bond between the carbonyl carbon and that oxygen.
9:20
All of this over here is going to go away
9:22
as a leaving group in our mechanism.
9:24
And we're going to add on two hydrogens to that carbon.
9:29
And then, that's going to form our alcohol.
9:31
So we're going to add two hydrogens onto that carbon,
9:34
forming a primary alcohol down here as well-- just
9:37
like in the mechanism that we just discussed.
9:39
So reduction of esters using lithium aluminum hydride.
9:43
What about if we were to add a hydrogen gas
9:47
and palladium as our metal catalyst here?
9:51
Well, this is also a reduction reaction
9:54
that we talked about earlier.
9:55
Hydrogenation is an example of a reduction reaction.
9:59
And it's going to be chemoselective.
10:01
If you just used the normal conditions for a hydrogenation
10:05
reaction, the only thing the hydrogenation reaction
10:08
is going to touch is this double bond.
10:10
It's going to reduce this double bond.
10:13
So let's go ahead and draw the product.
10:14
It's not going to touch the aldehyde.
10:16
It's not going to touch the ester.
10:17
And it's not going to touch the benzene ring.
10:19
So let's go ahead and draw the product.
10:21
The benzene ring is not hydrogenated
10:25
under normal conditions, but we're
10:27
going to add on two hydrogens across that double bond.
10:30
And the aldehyde is untouched.
10:32
And down here, the ester is going to be untouched as well.
10:37
So that would be our product from a hydrogenation.
10:40
So three different reductions, three different products.
10:44
Now, hydrogen will reduce carbonyls
10:47
under the right conditions.
10:48
Usually, if you have increased pressure and increased
10:51
temperatures, you actually can reduce those carbonyls.
10:55
But again, you can control those conditions.
10:58
So you can control what part of the molecule is reduced.
11:01
So that sums up the ways to reduce carbonyl compounds using
11:07
sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride.
11:10
In the next video or two, we'll take a look

0:00
I think we're all reasonably familiar with the three states
0:03
of matter in our everyday world.
0:05
At very high temperatures you get a fourth.
0:07
But the three ones that we normally deal with are, things
0:10
could be a solid, a liquid, or it could be a gas.
0:22
And we have this general notion, and I think water is
0:25
the example that always comes to at least my mind.
0:29
Is that solid happens when things are
0:30
colder, relatively colder.
0:33
And then as you warm up, you go into a liquid state.
0:37
And as your warm up even more you go into a gaseous state.
0:40
So you go from colder to hotter.
0:44
And in the case of water, when you're a solid, you're ice.
0:51
When you're a liquid, some people would call ice water,
0:55
but let's call it liquid water.
0:58
I think we know what that is.
1:01
And then when it's in the gas state, you're essentially
1:04
vapor or steam.
1:12
So let's think a little bit about what, at least in the
1:14
case of water, and the analogy will extend to
1:17
other types of molecules.
1:19
But what is it about water that makes it solid, and when
1:22
it's colder, what allows it to be liquid.
1:24
And I'll be frank, liquids are kind of fascinating because
1:28
you can never nail them down, I guess is the
1:31
best way to view them.
1:32
Or a gas.
1:34
So let's just draw a water molecule.
1:39
So you have oxygen there.
1:42
You have some bonds to hydrogen.
1:47
And then you have two extra pairs of valence electrons in
1:50
the oxygen.
1:51
And a couple of videos ago, we said oxygen is a lot more
1:55
electronegative than the hydrogen.
1:58
It likes to hog the electrons.
2:00
So even though this shows that they're sharing
2:04
electrons here and here.
2:06
At both sides of those lines, you can kind of view that
2:08
hydrogen is contributing an electron and oxygen is
2:10
contributing an electron on both sides of that line.
2:13
But we know because of the electronegativity, or the
2:15
relative electronegativity of oxygen, that it's hogging
2:18
these electrons.
2:19
And so the electrons spend a lot more time around the
2:22
oxygen than they do around the hydrogen.
2:24
And what that results is that on the oxygen side of the
2:27
molecule, you end up with a partial negative charge.
2:32
And we talked about that a little bit.
2:33
And on the hydrogen side of the molecules, you end up with
2:35
a slightly positive charge.
2:44
Now, if these molecules have very little kinetic energy,
2:51
they're not moving around a whole lot, then the positive
2:56
sides of the hydrogens are very attracted to the negative
2:59
sides of oxygen in other molecules.
3:03
Let me draw some more molecules.
3:04
When we talk about the whole state of the whole matter, we
3:06
actually think about how the molecules are interacting with
3:10
each other.
3:10
Not just how the atoms are interacting with each other
3:13
within a molecule.
3:16
I just drew one oxygen, let me copy and paste that.
3:20
But I could do multiple oxygens.
3:22
And let's say that that hydrogen is going to want to
3:26
be near this oxygen.
3:28
Because this has partial negative charge, this has a
3:30
partial positive charge.
3:32
And then I could do another one right there.
3:37
And then maybe we'll have, and just to make the point clear,
3:40
you have two hydrogens here, maybe an oxygen
3:43
wants to hang out there.
3:45
So maybe you have an oxygen that wants to be here because
3:49
it's got its partial negative here.
3:52
And it's connected to two hydrogens right there that
3:55
have their partial positives.
3:57
But you can kind of see a lattice structure.
4:00
Let me draw these bonds, these polar bonds that start forming
4:05
between the particles.
4:08
These bonds, they're called polar bonds because the
4:10
molecules themselves are polar.
4:14
And you can see it forms this lattice structure.
4:16
And if each of these molecules don't have a
4:19
lot of kinetic energy.
4:21
Or we could say the average kinetic energy of this matter
4:26
is fairly low.
4:27
And what do we know is average kinetic energy?
4:29
Well, that's temperature.
4:30
Then this lattice structure will be solid.
4:33
These molecules will not move relative to each other.
4:37
I could draw a gazillion more, but I think you get the point
4:40
that we're forming this kind of fixed structure.
4:44
And while we're in the solid state, as we add kinetic
4:48
energy, as we add heat, what it does to molecules is, it
4:52
just makes them vibrate around a little bit.
4:57
If I was a cartoonist, they way you'd draw a vibration is
4:59
to put quotation marks there.
5:01
That's not very scientific.
5:03
But they would vibrate around, they would buzz around a
5:05
little bit.
5:06
I'm drawing arrows to show that they are vibrating.
5:08
It doesn't have to be just
5:09
left-right it could be up-down.
5:10
But as you add more and more heat in a solid, these
5:14
molecules are going to keep their structure.
5:16
So they're not going to move around relative to each other.
5:19
But they will convert that heat, and heat is just a form
5:23
of energy, into kinetic energy which is expressed as the
5:27
vibration of these molecules.
5:29
Now, if you make these molecules start to vibrate
5:33
enough, and if you put enough kinetic energy into these
5:35
molecules, what do you think is going to happen?
5:37
Well this guy is vibrating pretty hard, and he's
5:39
vibrating harder and harder as you add more and more heat.
5:42
This guy is doing the same thing.
5:43
At some point, these polar bonds that they have to each
5:46
other are going to start not being strong enough to contain
5:50
the vibrations.
5:52
And once that happens, the molecules-- let me draw a
5:57
couple more.
5:58
Once that happens, the molecules are going to start
6:01
moving past each other.
6:07
So now all of a sudden, the molecule will start shifting.
6:13
But they're still attracted.
6:14
Maybe this side is moving here, that's moving there.
6:17
You have other molecules moving around that way.
6:19
But they're still attracted to each other.
6:22
Even though we've gotten the kinetic energy to the point
6:25
that the vibrations can kind of break the bonds between the
6:31
polar sides of the molecules.
6:34
Our vibration, or our kinetic energy for each molecule,
6:38
still isn't strong enough to completely separate them.
6:40
They're starting to slide past each other.
6:43
And this is essentially what happens when you're in a
6:44
liquid state.
6:46
You have a lot of atoms that want be touching each other
6:49
but they're sliding.
6:50
They have enough kinetic energy to slide past each
6:53
other and break that solid lattice structure here.
6:57
And then if you add even more kinetic energy, even more
7:00
heat, at this point it's a solution now.
7:05
They're not even going to be able to stay together.
7:07
They're not going to be able to stay near each other.
7:08
If you add enough kinetic energy they're going to start
7:11
looking like this.
7:12
They're going to completely separate and then kind of
7:15
bounce around independently.
7:17
Especially independently if they're an ideal gas.
7:19
But in general, in gases, they're no longer touching
7:22
each other.
7:22
They might bump into each other.
7:25
But they have so much kinetic energy on their own that
7:28
they're all doing their own thing
7:29
and they're not touching.
7:31
I think that makes intuitive sense if you just think about
7:33
what a gas is.
7:36
For example, it's hard to see a gas.
7:37
Why is it hard to see a gas?
7:39
Because the molecules are much further apart.
7:41
So they're not acting on the light in the way that a liquid
7:46
or a solid would.
7:47
And if we keep making that extended further, a solid--
7:50
well, I probably shouldn't use the example with ice.
7:53
Because ice or water is one of the few situations where the
7:56
solid is less dense than the liquid.
7:58
That's why ice floats.
8:00
And that's why icebergs don't just all fall to the
8:02
bottom of the ocean.
8:03
And ponds don't completely freeze solid.
8:07
But you can imagine that, because a liquid is in most
8:11
cases other than water, less dense.
8:13
That's another reason why you can see through it a little
8:15
bit better.
8:15
Or it's not diffracting-- well I won't go into that too much,
8:18
than maybe even a solid.
8:20
But the gas is the most obvious.
8:21
And it is true with water.
8:23
The liquid form is definitely more dense than the gas form.
8:27
In the gas form, the molecules are going to jump around, not
8:31
touch each other.
8:32
And because of that, more light can
8:35
get through the substance.
8:37
Now the question is, how do we measure the amount of heat
8:40
that it takes to do this to water?
8:44
And to explain that, I'll actually draw a
8:47
phase change diagram.
8:49
Which is a fancy way of describing something fairly
8:53
straightforward.
8:54
Let me say that this is the amount of heat I'm adding.
8:57
And this is the temperature.
8:59
We'll talk about the states of matter in a second.
9:02
So heat is often denoted by q.
9:06
Sometimes people will talk about change in heat.
9:09
They'll use H, lowercase and uppercase H.
9:11
They'll put a delta in front of the H.
9:13
Delta just means change in.
9:15
And sometimes you'll hear the word enthalpy.
9:17
Let me write that.
9:18
Because I used to say what is enthalpy?
9:26
It sounds like empathy, but it's
9:29
quite a different concept.
9:30
At least, as far as my neural connections could make it.
9:33
But enthalpy is closely related to heat.
9:36
It's heat content.
9:45
For our purposes, when you hear someone say change in
9:49
enthalpy, you should really just be thinking
9:51
of change in heat.
9:52
I think this word was really just introduced to confuse
9:56
chemistry students and introduce a non-intuitive word
10:00
into their vocabulary.
10:02
The best way to think about it is heat content.
10:04
Change in enthalpy is really just change in heat.
10:07
And just remember, all of these things, whether we're
10:09
talking about heat, kinetic energy,
10:13
potential energy, enthalpy.
10:16
You'll hear them in different contexts, and you're like, I
10:18
thought I should be using heat and they're
10:19
talking about enthalpy.
10:21
These are all forms of energy.
10:23
And these are all measured in joules.
10:26
And they might be measured in other ways, but the
10:28
traditional way is in joules.
10:29
And energy is the ability to do work.
10:31
And what's the unit for work?
10:33
Well, it's joules.
10:34
Force times distance.
10:35
But anyway, that's a side-note.
10:37
But it's good to know this word enthalpy.
10:38
Especially in a chemistry context, because it's used all
10:40
the time and it can be very confusing and non-intuitive.
10:43
Because you're like, I don't know what enthalpy is in my
10:46
everyday life.
10:47
Just think of it as heat contact, because that's really
10:50
what it is.
10:50
But anyway, on this axis, I have heat.
10:55
So this is when I have very little heat and I'm
10:57
increasing my heat.
10:58
And this is temperature.
11:05
Now let's say at low temperatures I'm here and as I
11:09
add heat my temperature will go up.
11:12
Temperature is average kinetic energy.
11:14
Let's say I'm in the solid state here.
11:16
And I'll do the solid state in purple.
11:21
No I already was using purple.
11:23
I'll use magenta.
11:26
So as I add heat, my temperature will go up.
11:29
Heat is a form of energy.
11:31
And when I add it to these molecules, as I did in this
11:36
example, what did it do?
11:37
It made them vibrate more.
11:38
Or it made them have higher kinetic energy, or higher
11:41
average kinetic engery, and that's what temperature is a
11:43
measure of; average kinetic energy.
11:46
So as I add heat in the solid phase, my average kinetic
11:50
energy will go up.
11:51
And let me write this down.
11:52
This is in the solid phase, or the solid state of matter.
11:58
Now something very interesting happens.
12:01
Let's say this is water.
12:03
So what happens at zero degrees?
12:09
Which is also 273.15 Kelvin.
12:14
Let's say that's that line.
12:15
What happens to a solid?
12:18
Well, it turns into a liquid.
12:19
Ice melts.
12:20
Not all solids, we're talking in particular about
12:22
water, about H2O.
12:25
So this is ice in our example.
12:27
All solids aren't ice.
12:29
Although, you could think of a rock as solid magma.
12:33
Because that's what it is.
12:38
I could take that analogy a bunch of different ways.
12:41
But the interesting thing that happens at zero degrees.
12:49
Depending on what direction you're going, either the
12:51
freezing point of water or the melting point of ice,
12:53
something interesting happens.
12:55
As I add more heat, the temperature does not to go up.
13:00
As I add more heat, the temperature does not go up for
13:03
a little period.
13:05
Let me draw that.
13:07
For a little period, the temperature stays constant.
13:10
And then while the temperature is constant, it stays a solid.
13:14
We're still a solid.
13:16
And then, we finally turn into a liquid.
13:22
Let's say right there.
13:23
So we added a certain amount of heat and it
13:25
just stayed a solid.
13:26
But it got us to the point that the ice
13:28
turned into a liquid.
13:29
It was kind of melting the entire time.
13:31
That's the best way to think about it.
13:32
And then, once we keep adding more and more heat, then the
13:36
liquid warms up too.
13:42
Now, we get to, what temperature becomes
13:45
interesting again for water?
13:46
Well, obviously 100 degrees Celsius or 373 degrees Kelvin.
13:56
I'll do it in Celsius because that's what
13:57
we're familiar with.
13:59
What happens?
13:59
That's the temperature at which water will vaporize or
14:03
which water will boil.
14:05
But something happens.
14:07
And they're really getting kinetically active.
14:13
But just like when you went from solid to liquid, there's
14:16
a certain amount of energy that you have to contribute to
14:19
the system.
14:20
And actually, it's a good amount at this point.
14:23
Where the water is turning into vapor, but it's not
14:26
getting any hotter.
14:31
So we have to keep adding heat, but notice that the
14:34
temperature didn't go up.
14:35
We'll talk about it in a second what
14:37
was happening then.
14:38
And then finally, after that point, we're completely
14:43
vaporized, or we're completely steam.
14:46
Then we can start getting hot, the steam can then get hotter
14:48
as we add more and more heat to the system.
14:53
So the interesting question, I think it's intuitive, that as
14:55
you add heat here, our temperature is going to go up.
15:01
But the interesting thing is, what was going on here?
15:03
We were adding heat.
15:04
So over here we were turning our heat into kinetic energy.
15:07
Temperature is average kinetic energy.
15:10
But over here, what was our heat doing?
15:12
Well, our heat was was not adding kinetic
15:15
energy to the system.
15:16
The temperature was not increasing.
15:17
But the ice was going from ice to water.
15:20
So what was happening at that state, is that the kinetic
15:24
energy, the heat, was being used to essentially break
15:29
these bonds.
15:32
And essentially bring the molecules into a
15:34
higher energy state.
15:35
So you're saying, Sal, what does that mean,
15:37
higher energy state?
15:38
Well, if there wasn't all of this heat and all this kinetic
15:42
energy, these molecules want to be very
15:44
close to each other.
15:46
For example, I want to be close to the
15:49
surface of the earth.
15:50
When you put me in a plane you have put me in a
15:52
higher energy state.
15:53
I have a lot more potential energy.
15:56
I have the potential to fall towards the earth.
15:58
Likewise, when you move these molecules apart, and you go
16:02
from a solid to a liquid, they want to fall
16:05
towards each other.
16:06
But because they have so much kinetic energy, they never
16:08
quite are able to do it.
16:10
But their energy goes up.
16:12
Their potential energy is higher because they want to
16:14
fall towards each other.
16:15
By falling towards each other, in theory, they
16:18
could do some work.
16:21
So what's happening here is, when we're contributing heat--
16:26
and this amount of heat we're contributing, it's called the
16:32
heat of fusion.
16:36
Because it's the same amount of heat regardless how much
16:39
direction we go in.
16:40
When we go from solid to liquid, you view it as the
16:43
heat of melting.
16:45
It's the head that you need to put in to melt
16:48
the ice into liquid.
16:49
When you're going in this direction, it's the heat you
16:51
have to take out of the zero degree water to
16:55
turn it into ice.
16:58
So you're taking that potential energy and you're
17:01
bringing the molecules closer and closer to each other.
17:05
So the way to think about it is, right here this heat is
17:08
being converted to kinetic energy.
17:10
Then, when we're at this phase change from solid to liquid,
17:15
that heat is being used to add potential
17:16
energy into the system.
17:18
To pull the molecules apart, to give them
17:21
more potential energy.
17:22
If you pull me apart from the earth, you're giving me
17:25
potential energy.
17:26
Because gravity wants to pull me back to the earth.
17:29
And I could do work when I'm falling back to the earth.
17:32
A waterfall does work.
17:33
It can move a turbine.
17:35
You could have a bunch of falling Sals move
17:37
a turbine as well.
17:39
And then, once you are fully a liquid, then you just become a
17:42
warmer and warmer liquid.
17:43
Now the heat is, once again, being used for kinetic energy.
17:48
You're making the water molecules move past each other
17:51
faster, and faster, and faster.
17:53
To some point where they want to completely disassociate
17:57
from each other.
17:58
They want to not even slide past each other, just
18:00
completely jump away from each other.
18:03
And that's right here.
18:04
This is the heat of vaporization.
18:13
And the same idea is happening.
18:15
Before we were sliding next to each other, now we're pulling
18:17
apart altogether.
18:19
So they could definitely fall closer together.
18:22
And then once we've added this much heat, now we're just
18:27
heating up the steam.
18:28
We're just heating up the gaseous water.
18:30
And it's just getting hotter and hotter and hotter.
18:33
But the interesting thing there, and I mean at least the
18:35
interesting thing to me when I first learned this, whenever I
18:41
think of zero degrees water I'll say, oh it must be ice.
18:43
But that's not necessarily the case.
18:45
If you start with water and you make it colder and colder
18:48
and colder to zero degrees, you're essentially taking heat
18:52
out of the water.
18:53
You can have zero degree water and it hasn't
18:57
turned into ice yet.
18:58
And likewise, you could have 100 degree water that hasn't
19:01
turned into steam yeat.
19:03
You have to add more energy.
19:04
You can also have 100 degree steam.
19:05
You can also have zero degree water.
19:08
Anyway, hopefully that gives you a little bit of intuition
19:10
of what the different states of matter are.
19:12
And in the next problem, we'll talk about how much heat
19:15
exactly it does take to move along this line.
19:18
And maybe we can solve some problems on how much ice we
19:21
might need to make our drink cool.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,pKvo0XWZtjo,

0:00
What I want to do with this video is talk about
0:02
nucleophilicity.
0:14
This is really just how good of a nucleophile something is.
0:17
Or I'll just make up a definition right now: the
0:20
ability for an atom slash ion slash molecule to act as a
0:35
nucleophile, or to give away extra electrons and bond with
0:51
a nucleus or with something else.
0:53
I'll say with a nucleus.
1:01
I want to say with a nucleus, because that's what
1:03
nucleophilicity is saying.
1:04
It loves nucleuses, especially positive ones, that it can
1:07
give its extra electrons to it.
1:09
Now, as a first cut, if you want to identify a good
1:13
nucleophile, it should have extra electrons to give away.
1:32
The best things that have extra electrons to give away
1:35
are negative ions or anions, so just at a very high level,
1:40
something like the fluoride anion.
1:44
Normally, fluorine has seven valence electrons: one, two,
1:48
three, four, five, six, seven, but it's so electronegative,
1:53
it might be able swipe off another electron from
1:55
something else and then it becomes the fluoride anion.
1:59
Then it becomes the fluoride anion with a negative charge.
2:03
You can do that for all of the halides.
2:05
You could do that for chlorine.
2:06
It can become chloride.
2:07
Bromine can be bromide.
2:09
Iodine could be iodide.
2:11
Let me do iodine, too.
2:13
Iodine, once again, it's a halide.
2:15
It has seven valence electrons.
2:16
It has many, many more electrons than fluorine, but
2:19
if you just look at its valence shell,
2:21
it has seven electrons.
2:23
And then it is also reasonably electronegative, not as
2:26
electronegative as fluorine.
2:28
Remember, the trend goes like this from the bottom left to
2:32
the top right.
2:32
So fluorine is extremely electronegative, but iodine is
2:36
still pretty electronegative.
2:39
It is a halogen so it also might be able to swipe off an
2:43
electron from someone else and become iodide.
2:48
In general, things with extra electrons, lone pairs of
2:52
electrons, and especially a negative charge, are going to
2:54
be pretty good nucleophiles.
2:59
Another example that's not a halide is the
3:01
hydroxide anion, so OH.
3:05
This is an example of something that is a molecule.
3:09
Maybe traditionally water would look like this.
3:12
Traditionally, this is just neutral water, and oxygen has
3:17
two lone pairs like that, but oxygen is pretty
3:19
electronegative.
3:20
It is already kind of taking the electrons away from one of
3:23
the hydrogens, and at some point, it might just take it
3:26
altogether and then you have the hydroxide anion.
3:31
This would look like this.
3:33
You have your original two lone pairs, just like that,
3:36
and then you have this pair that's going to be taken.
3:39
It already had that electron.
3:40
It takes that electron from the hydrogen, so now it has
3:42
two more electrons.
3:44
Let me color code it so you see what it took.
3:45
It took this electron from the hydrogen and now this also has
3:49
a negative charge.
3:50
That's also a reasonably good nucleophile.
3:55
And, of course, you have your hydrogen now.
3:56
It lost its one electron.
3:58
It only has a proton in its nucleus.
4:01
Whenever you see H plus, this is really just a proton.
4:03
There's nothing else to that hydrogen.
4:05
So that's hydroxide.
4:06
These are all reasonably good nucleophiles in that they have
4:11
something to give away.
4:12
They have extra charge.
4:14
Now, what I want to do is think about between these, how
4:17
do you think about what's going to be a stronger or
4:19
weaker nucleophile?
4:21
And here, it becomes a little bit more nuanced.
4:25
What we're going to do is differentiate what happens in
4:27
a protic solvent versus what happens in an aprotic solvent.
4:31
Let me write down.
4:33
Let me start with a protic solvent.
4:40
I'll make two columns here, protic solvent and then we'll
4:43
do aprotic solvent right over here.
4:54
Once again, these are fancy words, but they mean something
4:56
pretty simple.
4:57
Protic solvent is something that has hydrogens that can be
5:01
taken away or might have free protons floating around.
5:04
An example of a protic solvent is water
5:07
or really any alcohol.
5:08
Water is the simplest example or maybe the most common.
5:12
The reason why you might have protons floating around is
5:15
exactly this reaction I showed right here.
5:18
Maybe every now and then a hydroxide anion forms. Even
5:21
more likely, maybe a water takes a hydrogen from one of
5:26
the other waters.
5:27
One of the water molecules takes hydrogen from one of the
5:29
other water molecules and becomes a hydronium, where
5:33
it's not a proton necessarily, but it's an oxygen.
5:41
Let's say if you start with water and one of these
5:44
electrons were to be given to some proton floating around,
5:48
it would look like this.
5:50
And it has a positive charge and then this
5:53
proton is very available.
5:56
You can almost imagine it's almost floating around because
5:58
that oxygen really wants to take back that electron.
6:01
So protic solvent is water.
6:03
In water, you might see a little bit of hydroxide, a
6:05
little bit of proton, a little bit a hydronium.
6:07
You see all of it in there, but the bottom line is that
6:09
there are protons that can react with other things.
6:15
Let me clear this away so that I have some real estate.
6:19
Let me just write down water.
6:21
Water is a protic solvent.
6:24
Now, wait.
6:25
Is that always the case?
6:27
It seems like hydrogens are everywhere.
6:28
Well, no, it's not always the case.
6:29
Let me show you an aprotic solvent.
6:32
Diethyl ether looks like this.
6:41
And just so you know the naming, it's an ether because
6:43
it has oxygen, and it's diethyl because it has two
6:46
ethyl groups.
6:47
That's one ethyl group right there and that is the second.
6:50
So it's diethyl ether.
6:53
Now, you might say, hey, this guy's got hydrogens lying
6:56
around as well.
6:56
Maybe those can get released.
6:58
But, no, these hydrogens are bonded to the carbon and
7:01
carbon is not anywhere near as electronegative as oxygen.
7:06
Carbon is unlikely to steal these hydrogens' electrons and
7:10
these hydrogens to be loose.
7:12
If they were bonded to the oxygen, that would have been a
7:14
possibility.
7:16
With water, you have obviously H-O-H.
7:20
In alcohols, you have some maybe carbon chain bonded to
7:27
an oxygen, which is then bonded to a hydrogen.
7:29
So in either of these cases, in either water or alcohol,
7:32
you have these hydrogens where the electron might be taken by
7:36
the oxygen because it's so electronegative and then the
7:38
hydrogen floats around.
7:39
Anyway, that's a review of protic versus aprotic.
7:42
In a protic solvent-- and this is actually a general rule of
7:45
thumb-- if a nucleophile is likely to react with its
7:51
solvent, it will be bad at being a nucleophile.
7:54
Think about it.
7:54
If it's reacting with the solvent, it's not going to be
7:57
able to do this.
7:58
It's not going to be able to give its electrons away to
8:01
what it needs to give it away, to maybe what we saw in an
8:04
Sn2-type reaction.
8:07
In a protic solvent, what happens is that the things
8:09
that are really electronegative and really
8:11
small, like a fluoride anion-- let me draw a fluoride anion.
8:19
In a protic solvent, what's going to happen is it's going
8:26
to be blocked by hydrogen bonds.
8:29
It's very negative, right?
8:30
It has a negative charge.
8:31
And it's also tightly packed.
8:33
As you can see right here, its electrons are
8:36
very close, tied in.
8:38
It's a much smaller atom or ion, in this case.
8:42
If we looked at iodide, iodide has 53
8:45
electrons, many orbitals.
8:48
Actually, iodide would have 54.
8:49
It would have the same as iodine plus one.
8:52
Fluoride will have 10 electrons, nine from fluorine
8:55
plus it gains another one, so it's a much smaller atom.
9:00
So when you have water hanging around it, let's say you have
9:03
something like water.
9:04
That has a negative charge.
9:06
Water is polar.
9:11
Actually, both of these are polar, so I should write down
9:14
polar for both of these.
9:15
This is a polar protic solvent.
9:18
This is a polar aprotic solvent.
9:21
In this case, water is still more electronegative than the
9:23
carbon, so it still has a partial negative charge.
9:26
These parts still have a partial negative.
9:27
Water still has a partial negative charge.
9:30
The hydrogen has a partial positive charge so it is going
9:33
to be attracted to the fluorine.
9:35
This is going to happen all around the fluorine.
9:38
And if these waters are attracted to the fluorine in
9:40
kind of forming a tight shell around it, it makes it hard
9:44
for fluorine to react.
9:52
So it's a worse nucleophile than, say, iodide or hydroxide
9:58
in a polar protic solvent.
10:00
Hydroxide has the same issue.
10:02
It's still forming hydrogen bonds, but if you wanted to
10:05
compare them, iodide is much bigger.
10:10
Maybe I'll draw it like this.
10:12
I'll draw its valence shell like this.
10:14
It's a much bigger ion.
10:20
It has all these electrons in here.
10:22
And so, it still will form hydrogen bonds with the water.
10:26
It still will form hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen end of
10:29
the water because they're partially positive, but it's
10:31
going to be less tightly packed.
10:34
And on top of that, iodide is more polarizable, which means
10:47
that its electron cloud is so big and the valence electrons
10:50
are so far away from the nucleus that they can be
10:53
influenced by things and then be more likely to react.
10:56
So let's say this iodide is getting close to a carbon that
11:00
has a partial positive charge.
11:02
So let's say carbon is attached to a bromine and then
11:09
it's attached to three hydrogens.
11:12
We've seen that this will have a partial negative charge.
11:14
It's more electronegative than the carbon, which will have a
11:17
partial positive charge.
11:19
When this guy, this big guy with the electrons really far
11:22
away, gets close to this, more of the electron cloud is going
11:28
to be attracted to the partial positive charge.
11:30
It'll get distorted a little bit and so it is more likely
11:33
to react in a polar protic solvent.
11:37
Fluoride, on the other hand, is very tightly packed,
11:40
blocked by the hydrogen bonds.
11:43
It's less likely to react.
11:45
If you were to look at the Periodic Table, if you look at
11:49
just the halogens in a polar protic solvent, the halides--
11:57
this would be the ion version of the halogens-- the halide's
12:00
iodide will be the best nucleophile.
12:03
Fluoride will be the worst. So in a polar protic solvent--
12:07
let me write this down-- we have a situation where the
12:21
iodide is the best nucleophile, followed by
12:25
bromide, followed by chloride, and then last
12:30
of all is the fluoride.
12:33
The exact opposite is true in an aprotic solvent.
12:38
In an aprotic solvent, the fluoride, which is-- fluorine
12:42
is far more electronegative.
12:44
Fluoride is more basic.
12:48
It will be more stable if it is able to form a bond with
12:52
something than iodide.
12:54
Iodide is pretty stable.
12:56
If you look at a hydrogen iodide, it's actually a highly
13:01
acidic molecule.
13:02
So iodide itself, the conjugate base of hydrogen
13:05
iodide, is going to be a very bad base.
13:09
When you're dealing with an aprotic solvent, you go in the
13:12
direction of basicity.
13:14
We're going to learn in the next video that actually
13:15
basicity and nucleophilicity are related, but they aren't
13:19
the same concept.
13:20
We're going to talk about that in a little bit.
13:23
If you're in an aprotic solvent, you're not reacting
13:27
with the solvent as much.
13:28
And then in this situation, fluoride is actually the best
13:32
nucleophile, followed by chloride, followed by bromide,
13:37
followed by iodide.
13:39
So here, you're going in the direction of basicity.
13:42
This is the best. This is the worse in an aprotic solvent.
13:47
If it was in a protic solvent, this is flipped around.
13:50
This becomes the best and this becomes the worst.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Z9Jh-Q59xso,
khan_video_BM-My1AheLw_1,Doesn't it already have 3 valence electrons in the 2p orbitals to pair up with the 3 electrons from the 3 hydrogen atoms?,Essay,"•
0:01
Voiceover: The concept of steric number is very useful,
0:03
because it tells us the number of hybridized
0:05
orbitals that we have.
0:07
So to find the steric number, you add up the number
0:09
of stigma bonds, or single-bonds, and to that,
0:12
you add the number of lone pairs of electrons.
0:15
So, let's go ahead and do it for methane.
0:17
So, if I wanted to find the steric number,
0:20
the steric number is equal to the number of sigma bonds,
0:23
so I look around my carbon here, and I see
0:24
one, two, three, and four sigma, or single-bonds.
0:29
So I have four sigma bonds; I have zero lone pairs
0:31
of electrons around that carbon, so four plus zero
0:34
gives me a steric number of four.
0:36
In the last video, we saw that SP three hybridized
0:40
situation, we get four hybrid orbitals,
0:42
and that's how many we need, the steric number
0:44
tells us we need four hybridized orbitals,
0:46
so we took one S orbital, and three P orbitals,
0:49
and that gave us four, SP three hybrid orbitals,
0:52
so this carbon must be SP three hybridized.
0:56
So let's go ahead, and draw that in here.
0:57
So this carbon is SP three hybridized,
0:59
and in the last video, we also drew everything out,
1:02
so we drew in those four, SP three hybrid orbitals,
1:06
for that carbon, and we had one valence electron
1:10
in each of those four, SP three hybrid orbitals,
1:14
and then hydrogen had one valence electron,
1:17
in an un-hybridized S orbital, so we drew in our hydrogens,
1:21
and the one valence electron, like that.
1:24
This head-on overlap; this is, of course, a sigma bond,
1:28
so we talked about this in the last video.
1:31
And so now that we have this picture
1:34
of the methane molecule, we can think about
1:36
these electron pairs, so these electron pairs
1:39
are going to repel each other: like charges repel.
1:43
And so, the idea of the VSEPR theory, tell us these
1:45
electron pairs are going to repel, and try
1:47
to get as far away from each other
1:48
as they possibly can, in space.
1:51
And this means that the arrangement
1:52
of those electron pairs, ends up being tetrahedral.
1:55
So let's go ahead and write that.
1:57
So we have a tetrahedral arrangement of electron pairs
2:00
around our carbon, like that.
2:04
When we think about the molecular geometry,
2:06
so that's like electron group geometry,
2:08
you wanna think about the geometry of the entire molecule.
2:11
I could think about drawing in those electrons,
2:15
those bonding electrons, like that.
2:17
So we have a wedge coming out at us in space,
2:20
a dash going away from us in space,
2:21
and then, these lines mean, ""in the plane of the page.""
2:25
And so, we can go ahead a draw in our hydrogens,
2:27
and this is just one way to represent the methane molecule,
2:32
which attempts to show the geometry
2:33
of the entire molecule.
2:35
So the arrangement of the atoms turns out to also
2:37
be tetrahedral, so let's go ahead and write that.
2:40
So, tetrahedral.
2:42
And, let's see if we can see that four-sided figure,
2:45
so a tetrahedron is a four-sided figure,
2:47
so we can think about this being one face,
2:51
and then let's go ahead and draw a second face.
2:53
And if I draw a line back here, that gives us
2:55
four faces to our tetrahedron.
2:58
So our electron group geometry is tetrahedral,
3:01
the molecular geometry of methane is tetrahedral,
3:04
and then we also have a bond angle, let me go ahead
3:06
and draw that in, so a bond angle,
3:08
this hydrogen-carbon-hydrogen bond angle in here,
3:11
is approximately 109 point five degrees.
3:15
All right, let's go ahead and do the same type
3:17
of analysis for a different molecule, here.
3:21
So let's do it for ammonia, next.
3:24
So we have NH three, if I want to find the steric number,
3:27
the steric number is equal to the number of sigma bonds,
3:31
so that's one, two, three; so three sigma bonds.
3:35
Plus number of lone pairs of electrons, so I have
3:38
one lone pair of electrons here, so three plus one
3:40
gives me a steric number of four.
3:42
So I need four hybridized orbitals, and once again,
3:45
when I need four hybridized orbitals, I know that
3:48
this nitrogen must be SP three hybridized,
3:51
because SP three hybridization gives us
3:54
four hybrid orbitals, and so let's go ahead
3:56
and draw those four hybrid orbitals.
3:58
So we would have nitrogen, and let's go ahead
4:00
and draw in all four of those.
4:01
So, one, two, three, and four;
4:04
those are the four hybrid orbitals.
4:06
When you're drawing the dot structure for nitrogen,
4:08
you would have one electron, another electron,
4:11
another electron, and then you'd have two
4:13
in this one, like that.
4:15
And then you'd go ahead, and put in your hydrogens,
4:16
so, once again, each hydrogen has one electron,
4:20
in a hybridized S orbital, so we go ahead
4:23
and draw in those hydrogens, so our overlap
4:27
of orbitals, so here's a sigma bond, here's
4:30
a sigma bond, and here's a sigma bond;
4:32
so three sigma bonds in ammonia,
4:34
and then we have this lone pair up here.
4:37
So the arrangement of these electron pairs,
4:39
is just what we talked about before:
4:42
So we have this tetrahedral arrangement
4:44
of electron pairs, or electron groups,
4:46
so the VSEPR theory tells us
4:48
that's how they're going to repel.
4:50
However, that's not the shape of the molecule,
4:52
so if I go ahead and draw in another picture
4:54
over here, to talk about the molecular geometry,
4:57
and go ahead and draw in the bonding electrons,
4:59
like that, and then I'll put in my non-bonding
5:02
electrons, up here: this lone pair right here,
5:05
housed in an SP three hybridized orbital.
5:08
So, the arrangement of the atoms turns out
5:10
not to be tetrahedral, and that has to do
5:12
with this lone pair of electrons up here, at the top.
5:15
So, this lone pair of electrons is going to
5:18
repel these bonding electrons more strongly
5:21
than in our previous example, and because it's
5:24
going to repel those electrons a little bit
5:26
more strongly, you're not gonna get a bond angle
5:28
of 109 point five; it's going to decrease the bond angle.
5:31
So let me go ahead, and use the same color
5:33
we used before, so this bond angle is not 109 point five;
5:37
it goes down a bit, because of the extra repulsion,
5:40
so it turns out to be approximately 107 degrees.
5:44
And in terms of the shape of the molecule,
5:47
we don't say ""tetrahedral""; we say ""trigonal-pyramidal.""
5:50
So let me go ahead, and write that here,
5:52
so the geometry of the ammonia molecule
5:54
is trigonal-pyramidal, and let's analyze that a little bit.
6:01
So, ""trigonal"" refers to the fact
6:03
that nitrogen is bonded to three atoms here,
6:06
so nitrogen is bonded to three hydrogens,
6:07
so that takes care of the trigonal part.
6:09
The ""pyramidal"" part comes in, because when you're
6:12
doing molecular geometry,
6:13
you ignore lone pairs of electrons.
6:15
So if you ignore that lone pair of electrons,
6:17
and just look at this nitrogen,
6:18
at the top of this pyramid right here,
6:21
so that's where the ""pyramidal"" term comes in.
6:24
So bonded to three other atoms,
6:25
like this, this, and this; for our pyramid.
6:28
So trigonal-pyramidal is the geometry
6:30
of the ammonia molecule, but the nitrogen
6:33
is SP three hybridized.
6:36
All right, let's do one more example; let's do water.
6:39
So, first we calculate the steric number,
6:42
so the steric number is equal to the number of sigma bonds,
6:45
so that's one, two; so, two sigma bonds.
6:48
Plus numbers of lone pairs of electrons,
6:50
so here's a lone pair, here's a lone pair;
6:52
so we have two plus two, which is equal to four,
6:55
so we need four hybridized orbitals.
6:57
As we've seen in the previous two examples,
6:59
when you need four hybridized orbitals,
7:01
that's an SP three hybridization situation;
7:05
you have four SP three hybridized orbitals.
7:07
So this oxygen is SP three hybridized, so I'll
7:11
go ahead and write that in here, so oxygen
7:12
is SP three hybridized.
7:14
So we can draw that out, showing oxygen
7:17
with its four SP three hybrid orbitals;
7:21
so there's four of them.
7:22
So I'm gonna go ahead and draw in all four.
7:24
In terms of electrons, this orbital gets one,
7:28
this orbital gets one, and these orbitals
7:30
are going to get two, like that;
7:33
so that takes care of oxygen's six valence electrons.
7:37
When you're drawing in your hyrdogens,
7:39
so let's go ahead and put in the hydrogen here,
7:41
so, once again, each hydrogen with one electron,
7:44
in a un-hybridized S orbital, like that.
7:48
So in terms of overlap of bonds, here's one
7:50
sigma bond, and here's another sigma bond;
7:54
so that's our two sigma bonds for water.
7:57
Once again, the arrangement of these electron pairs
8:00
is tetrahedral, so VSEPR theory says the electrons repel,
8:04
and so the electron group geometry, you could say,
8:07
is tetrahedral, but that's not the geometry
8:10
of the entire molecule, 'cause I was just
8:13
thinking about electron groups, and these hybrid orbitals.
8:17
The geometry of the molecule is different,
8:19
so we'll go ahead and draw that over here.
8:21
So we have our water molecule, and draw in our
8:25
bonding electrons, and now let's put in our
8:27
non-bonding electrons, like that, so we have
8:30
a different situation than with ammonia.
8:33
With ammonia, we had one lone pair of electrons
8:35
repelling these bonding electrons up here;
8:38
for water, we have two lone pairs of electrons
8:40
repelling these bonding electrons,
8:42
and so that's going to change the bond angle;
8:44
it's going to short it even more
8:46
than in the previous example.
8:48
So the bond angle decreases, so this bond angle in here
8:51
decreases to approximately 105 degrees,
8:54
rounded up a little bit.
8:56
So, thinking about the molecular geometry,
8:59
or the shape of the water molecule,
9:02
so we actually call this ""bent,"" or ""angular,""
9:05
so this is, ""bent geometry,"" because you ignore
9:08
the lone pairs of electrons, and that would
9:10
just give you this oxygen here, and then this angle;
9:13
so you could also call this, ""angular.""
9:15
So we have this bent molecular geometry, like that,
9:19
or angular, and once again, for molecular geometry,
9:23
ignore your lone pairs of electrons.
9:25
So these are examples of three molecules,
9:28
and the central atom in all three of these molecules
9:30
is SP three hybridized,
9:33
and so, this is one way to figure out
9:37
your overall molecular geometry,
9:39
and to think about bond angles,
9:41
and to think about how those hybrid orbitals
9:43
affect the structure of these molecules.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,BM-My1AheLw,

would be the mitochondria.
0:55
So let's draw some mitochondria right over here.
0:58
So I'll talk a little bit more about
1:00
what these little squiggly lines that I'm drawing
1:02
inside of the mitochondria are
1:04
and this is actually a little bit more
1:05
of a textbook visualization, as we'll learn
1:06
in a few minutes or seconds that we now have more
1:09
sophisticated visualizations of what's actually going on
1:12
inside of a mitochondria, but we haven't actually
1:13
answered all of our questions,
1:15
but you might have already learned that,
1:17
so let me make it clear, these are mitochondria.
1:20
That's the plural.
1:21
If we're just talking about one of them,
1:22
we're talking about a mitochondrion.
1:24
That's the singular of mitochondria.
1:26
But you might have already learned,
1:27
some time in your past or in another Khan Academy video,
1:31
that these are viewed as the ATP factories for cells.
1:35
So let me right it this way.
1:38
So ATP factories.
1:40
A-T-P factories and if you watched the videos on ATP
1:45
or cellular respiration or other videos,
1:48
I'd repeatedly talk about how ATP is really the currency
1:51
for energy in the cell that when it's in its ATP form
1:55
you have adenosine triphosphate.
1:57
If you pop one of the phosphate groups off,
2:00
you pop one of the P's off, it release energy
2:02
and that's what your body uses to do all sort of things
2:05
from movement to thinking to all sorts of things
2:08
that actually go on in your bodies,
2:10
so you can imagine mitochondria are really important
2:12
for energy, for when the cell has to do things.
2:16
And that's why you'll find more mitochondria
2:18
in things like muscle cells, things that have to use
2:21
a lot of energy.
2:22
Now before I get into the structure of mitochondria,
2:25
I wanna talk a little bit about its fascinating past
2:28
because we think of cells as the most basic unit of life
2:31
and that is true, that comes straight out of cell theory,
2:33
but it turns out the most prevalent theory
2:36
of how mitochondria got into our cells
2:39
is that at one time the predecessors,
2:43
the ancestors to our mitochondria,
2:45
were free, independent organisms, microorganisms.
2:49
So they're descendent from bacterial-like microorganisms
2:54
that might have been living on their own
2:57
and they were maybe really good at processing energy
2:59
or maybe they were even good at other things,
3:01
but at some point in the evolutionary past,
3:04
they got ingested by what the ancestors of our cells
3:08
and instead of just being engulfed and being torn to shreds
3:10
and kind of being digested and eaten,
3:12
it was like, ""Hey, wait, if these things stick around,
3:15
""those cells are more likely to survive
3:17
""because they're able to help process glucose
3:19
""or help generate more energy out of things.""
3:24
And so the cells that were able to kind of live
3:27
in symbiosis have them kind of give a place
3:30
for the mitochondria to live or the pre-mitochondria,
3:33
the ancestor mitochondria, those survived
3:35
and then through kind of the processes of natural selection,
3:38
this is what we now associate,
3:41
we now associate eukaryotic cells
3:43
as having mitochondria,
3:44
so I find this whole idea of one organism being inside
3:47
of another organism in symbiosis even at the cellular level,
3:52
that's kind of mind-boggling, but anyway,
3:55
I'll stop talking about that and now let's just talk
3:57
about the present, let's talk about
3:59
what the actual structure of mitochondria are.
4:03
And I'll first draw kind of a simplified drawing
4:06
of a mitochondion and I'll draw a cross section.
4:10
So, I'm gonna draw a cross section.
4:13
So if we were to kind of cut it in half.
4:15
So what I've drawn right over here
4:16
this would be its outer membrane.
4:18
This is the outer membrane right over here
4:24
and we label that.
4:25
Outer membrane.
4:28
And all of these membranes that I'm gonna draw,
4:30
they're all going to be phospholipid bilayers.
4:34
So if I were to zoom in right over here,
4:38
so let me, if I were to zoom in,
4:41
we would see a bilayer of phospholipids.
4:44
So you have your
4:47
hydrophilic heads facing outwards,
4:50
hydrophilic heads facing outwards
4:53
and your hydrophobic tails facing inwards.
4:57
So.
5:00
You see something just like that,
5:02
so they're all phospholipid bilayers.
5:05
But they aren't just phospholipids.
5:07
All of these membranes have all sorts of proteins imbedded,
5:10
I mean cells are incredibly complex structures,
5:13
but even organelles like mitochondria have a fascinating,
5:16
I guess you would say sub-structure to them.
5:18
They themselves have all sorts of interesting proteins,
5:21
enzymes imbedded in their membranes
5:23
and are able to help regulate what's going on
5:25
inside and outside of these organelles.
5:28
And one of the proteins that you have in the outer membrane
5:34
of mitochondria, they're called porins
5:38
and porins aren't found only in mitochondria,
5:40
but they're kind of tunnel proteins,
5:41
they're structured so they kind of form a hole
5:44
in the outer membrane.
5:46
So I'm drawing them the best that I can.
5:49
These are porins
5:51
and what's interesting about porins is they don't allow
5:54
large molecules to pass through passively,
5:57
but small molecules like sugars or ions can pass passively
6:02
through the porins.
6:04
And so, because of that, your ion concentration
6:06
and well, I should actually say,
6:07
your small molecule concentrations tend
6:09
to be similar on either side of this membrane,
6:12
on either side of this outer membrane.
6:15
But that's not the only membrane involved
6:17
in a mitochondrion.
6:18
We also have a inner membrane.
6:20
I'll do that in yellow.
6:22
We also have a inner membrane
6:24
and I'm gonna draw it with a textbook model first
6:27
and then we'll talk a little bit about,
6:28
since we think this model is not quite right,
6:32
but in this, so we have this inner membrane,
6:36
inner membrane,
6:41
and this inner membrane has these folds in it
6:45
to increase their surface area
6:46
and the surface area is really important
6:48
for the inner membrane because that's
6:50
where the processes of the electron transport chain
6:53
occur across, essentially, these membranes.
6:55
So you want this extra surface area
6:57
so you can essentially have more of that going on.
7:00
And these folds have a name.
7:02
So if you're talking about one of them,
7:04
if you're talking about one of these folds,
7:05
you're talking about a crista,
7:10
but if you're talking about more than one of them,
7:14
you would call that a cristae, cristae.
7:18
Sometimes I've seen the pronunciation of this
7:20
as cristae, cristae or cristae, that's plural for crista.
7:24
These are just folds in the inner membrane
7:27
and once again the inner membrane is also
7:30
a phospholipid bilayer.
7:33
Now inside of the inner membranes,
7:36
so between the outer membrane and the inner membrane
7:40
you could imagine what this is gonna be called.
7:42
That space is called the intermembrane space,
7:46
not too creative of a name, intermembrane space
7:51
and because of the porins,
7:53
the small molecule concentration
7:56
of the intermembrane space and then outside
7:58
of the mitochondria,
8:02
out in the cytosol,
8:03
those concentrations are gonna be similar,
8:05
but then the inner membrane does not have the porins
8:08
in it and so you can actually have a different concentration
8:11
on either side and that is essential
8:12
for the electron transport chain.
8:14
The electron transport chain really culminates
8:16
with hydrogen, a hydrogen ion gradient
8:19
being built between the two sides
8:20
and then they flow down that gradient through a protein
8:24
called ATP synthase which helps us synthesize ATP,
8:28
but we'll talk more about that maybe in this video
8:29
or in a future video,
8:31
but let's finish talking about the different parts
8:33
of a mitochondrion.
8:36
So inside the inner membrane you have
8:40
this area right over here is called the matrix.
8:42
It's called, let me use this in a different color,
8:45
this is
8:48
the matrix
8:49
and it's called the matrix 'cause it actually has
8:50
a much higher protein concentration,
8:53
it's actually more viscous than the cytosol
8:58
that would be outside of the
9:03
mitochondria.
9:05
So this right over here is the matrix.
9:07
When we we talk about cellular respiration,
9:09
cellular respiration has many phases in it.
9:11
We talk about glycolysis.
9:13
Glycolysis is actually occurring in the cytosol.
9:15
So glycolysis can occur in the cytosol.
9:20
Glycolysis.
9:22
But the other major phases of cellular respiration.
9:26
Remember we talk about the citric acid cycle
9:28
also known as the Krebs cycle,
9:29
that is occuring in the matrix.
9:32
So Krebs cycle
9:35
is occuring in the matrix
9:37
and then I said the electron transport chain
9:40
which is really what's responsible for producing
9:42
the bulk of the ATP, that is happening through proteins
9:46
that are straddling the inner membrane
9:49
or straddling the cristae right over here.
9:55
Now we're just done.
9:56
Probably one of the most fascinating parts of mitochondria,
9:59
we said that we think that they are descendent
10:01
from these ancient independent lifeforms
10:04
and in order to be an ancient independent life form,
10:06
they'd would have to have some information,
10:09
some way to actually transmit their genetic information
10:13
and, it turns out, mitochondria actually have
10:16
their own genetic information.
10:18
They have mitochondrial DNA
10:19
and they often don't just even have one copy of it,
10:21
they have multiple copies of it
10:23
and they're in loops very similar to bacterial DNA.
10:28
In fact, they have a lot in common
10:29
with bacterial DNA and that's why we think
10:30
that the ancestor to mitochondria that live independently
10:34
was probably a form of bacteria or related to bacteria
10:38
in some way.
10:39
So this is, this right over there,
10:41
that is the loop of mitochondrial DNA.
10:43
So all the DNA that's inside of you, the bulk of it,
10:46
yes, it is in your nuclear DNA, but you still have
10:50
a little bit of DNA in your mitochondria
10:52
and what's interesting is your mitochondrial DNA,
10:55
your mitochondria, are inherited, essentially,
10:59
from your mother's side, because when a egg is fertilized,
11:05
a human egg has tons of mitochondria in it
11:09
and I'm obviously not drawing all of the things
11:11
in the human egg.
11:12
It obviously has a nucleus and all of that.
11:14
The sperm has some mitochondria in it,
11:17
you could imagine it needs to be able
11:20
to win that very competitive fight
11:22
to get to fertilize the egg,
11:24
but the current theory is all or most of that
11:26
gets digested or dissolved once it actually gets
11:30
into the egg.
11:31
And anyway, the egg itself has way more mitochondria,
11:34
so the DNA in your mitochondria is
11:38
from your mother or is essentially from your mother's side
11:42
and that's actually used, mitochondrial DNA,
11:43
when people talk about kind of an ancient Eve
11:45
or tracing back to having kind
11:47
of one common mother,
11:48
people are looking at the mitochondrial DNA,
11:52
so it is actually quite, quite fascinating.
11:56
Now I said a little bit earlier,
11:58
and you know, obviously, it has its own DNA
12:00
and then because it has its own DNA
12:02
it's able to synthesize some of its own RNA,
12:04
its own ribosomes, so it also has ribosomes here.
12:07
But it doesn't synthesize all of the proteins
12:10
that are sitting in mitochondria.
12:11
A lot of those are still synthesized by
12:14
or encoded for by your nuclear DNA
12:17
and are actually synthesized outside of the mitochondria
12:19
and then make their way into the mitochondria,
12:22
but mitochondria are these fascinating, fascinating things.
12:25
They're these little creatures living in symbiosis
12:29
in our cells and they're able to replicate themselves
12:32
and I don't know, I find all of this mind boggling.
12:34
But anyway.
12:35
I said that this was the textbook model
12:37
because it turns out, when you look
12:39
at a micrograph, a picture of mitochondria,
12:43
it seems to back up this textbook model
12:45
of these folds, these cristae just kind of folding in,
12:49
but when we've been able to have more sophisticated
12:51
visualizations it actually turns out
12:53
that it's not just these simple folds
12:55
that the inner membrane essentially hooks
12:59
into the matrix and it turns out it has
13:02
these little tunnels that connect the space
13:05
inside of the cristae to the intermembrane space.
13:10
So I like to think about this because it makes you realize,
13:12
you know, we look in textbooks and we take these things
13:14
like mitochondria for granted, like, ""Oh yeah, of course.
13:17
""That's where ATP factories are,""
13:18
but it's still an area for visualization research
13:21
to fully understand exactly how they work
13:24
and even how they are structured
13:25
that this Baffle Model where you see these cristae
13:28
kind of just coming in and out of the different sides.
13:31
This is actually no longer the accepted model
13:33
for the actual visualization, the structure of mitochondria.
13:36
Something more like this, something more where
13:39
you have this cristae junction model
13:42
where you have, if I were to draw a cross section
13:46
where this is the,
13:50
I drew the outer membrane and the inner membrane,
13:52
I'll just draw has these little tunnels
13:54
to the actual space inside of the cristae.
13:59
This is actually now the more accepted visualization,
14:03
so I want you to appreciate
14:04
that when in Biology, you read something in a textbook
14:06
you kind of say, ""Oh, people have figured all
14:08
""of this stuff out,"" but people are still think about,
14:10
""Well, how does this structure work?
14:11
""What is the actual structure?"" and then,
14:12
""How does it actually let this organelle,
14:14
""this fascinating organelle do all of the things
14:16
""that it needs to do?""",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,i1dAnpSFbyI,
khan_video_-ROhfKyxgCo_153,Can anyone give me examples of reptiles in which gender is determined by environmental conditions ?,Essay,"•
0:00
By this point in the biology playlist,
0:02
you're probably wondering a very natural question,
0:06
how is gender determined in an organism?
0:09
And it's not an obvious answer,because throughout the animal kingdom,
0:12
it's actually determined in different ways.
0:15
In some creatures,especially some types of reptiles,it's environmental
0:23
Not all reptiles,but certain cases of it.
0:26
It could be maybe the temperature in which the
0:29
embryo develops will dictate whether it turns into a male or female
0:32
or other environmental factors.
0:34
And in other types of animals,especially mammals,
0:38
of which we are one example,it's a genetic basis.
0:45
And so your next question is,hey,Sal,so--
0:47
let me write this down,in mammals it's genetic--
0:55
so,OK,maybe they're different alleles,a male or a female allele.
1:01
But then you're like,hey,but there's so many different characteristics
1:04
that differentiate a man from a woman.
1:08
Maybe it would have to be a whole set of genes
1:09
that have to work together.
1:11
And to some degree,your second answer would be more correct.
1:16
It's even more than just a set of genes.
1:18
It's actually whole chromosomes determine it.
1:21
So let me draw a nucleus.That's going to be my nucleus.
1:25
And this is going to be the nucleus for a man.
1:27
So 22 of the pairs of chromosomes
1:29
are just regular non-sex-determining chromosomes.
1:33
So I could just do,that's one of the homologous,2,4,6,8,10,12,14.
1:41
I can just keep going.And eventually you have 22 pairs.
1:45
So these 22 pairs right there,they're called autosomal.
1:51
And those are just our standard pairs of chromosomes
1:54
that code for different things.
1:55
Each of these right here is a homologous pair,homologous,
2:02
which we learned before you get one from each of your parents.
2:05
They don't necessarily code for the same thing,
2:07
for the same versions of the genes,but they code for the same genes.
2:11
If eye color is on this gene,it's also on that gene,
2:13
on the other gene of the homologous pair.
2:15
Although you might have different versions of eye color
2:17
on either one and that determines what you display.
2:20
But these are just kind of the standard genes
2:23
that have nothing to do with our gender.
2:25
And then you have these two other special chromosomes.
2:31
I'll do this one.
2:32
It'll be a long brown one,and then I'll do a short blue one.
2:36
And the first thing you'll notice is that they don't look homologous.
2:39
How could they code for the same thing
2:41
when the blue one is short and the brown one's long?
2:44
And that's true.They aren't homologous.
2:46
And these we'll call our sex-determining chromosomes.
2:59
And the long one right here,
3:01
it's been the convention to call that the x chromosome.
3:07
Let me scroll down a little bit.
3:09
And the blue one right there,we refer to that as the y chromosome.
3:16
And to figure out whether something is a male or a female,
3:19
it's a pretty simple system.
3:20
If you've got a y chromosome,you are a male.
3:23
So let me write that down.
3:26
So this nucleus that I drew just here--
3:28
obviously you could have the whole broader cell all around here--
3:31
this is the nucleus for a man.
3:34
So if you have an x chromosome--
3:35
and we'll talk about in a second
3:37
why you can only get that from your mom--
3:39
an x chromosome from your mom and a y chromosome from your dad,
3:43
you will be a male.
3:46
If you get an x chromosome from your mom
3:49
and an x chromosome from your dad,you're going to be a female.
3:54
And so we could actually even draw a Punnett square.
3:56
This is almost a trivially easy Punnett square,
3:58
but it kind of shows what all of the different possibilities are.
4:02
So let's say this is your mom's genotype
4:04
for her sex-determining chromosome.
4:07
She's got two x's.
4:09
That's what makes her your mom and not your dad.
4:11
And then your dad has an x and a y--
4:14
I should do it in capital--and has a Y chromosome.
4:19
And we can do a Punnett square.
4:20
What are all the different combinations of offspring?
4:23
Well,your mom could give this X chromosome,
4:25
in conjunction with this X chromosome from your dad.
4:28
This would produce a female.
4:29
Your mom could give this other X chromosome with that X chromosome.
4:32
That would be a female as well.
4:35
Well,your mom's always going to be donating an X chromosome.
4:38
And then your dad is going to donate either the X or the Y.
4:42
So in this case,it'll be the Y chromosome.
4:44
So these would be female,and those would be male.
4:46
And it works out nicely that half are female and half are male.
4:50
But a very interesting and somewhat ironic fact
4:55
might pop out at you when you see this.
4:57
what determines whether someone is
4:59
or Who determines whether their offspring are male or female?
5:04
Is it the mom or the dad?
5:07
Well,the mom always donates an X chromosome,
5:09
so in no way does- what the haploid genetic makeup of the mom's eggs
5:16
of the gamete from the female,
5:18
in no way does that determine the gender of the offspring.
5:22
It's all determined by whether--let me just draw a bunch of--
5:26
dad's got a lot of sperm,and they're all racing towards the egg.
5:34
And some of them have an X chromosome in them
5:37
and some of them have a Y chromosome in them.
5:41
And obviously they have others.
5:42
And obviously if this guy up here wins the race.
5:46
Or maybe I should say this girl.If she wins the race,
5:49
then the fertilized egg will develop into a female.
5:53
If this sperm wins the race,
5:55
then the fertilized egg will develop into a male.
5:59
And the reason why I said it's ironic is throughout history,
6:01
and probably the most famous example of this is Henry the VIII.
6:09
I mean it's not just the case with kings.
6:11
It's probably true,because most of our civilization is male dominated,
6:15
that you've had these men who are obsessed with producing a male heir
6:19
to kind of take over the family name.
6:21
And,in the case of Henry the VIII,take over a country.
6:24
And they become very disappointed and they tend to blame their wives
6:28
when the wives keep producing females,but it's all their fault.
6:33
Henry the VIII,I mean the most famous case was with Ann Boleyn.
6:39
I'm not an expert here,but the general notion is that
6:43
he became upset with her that she wasn't producing a male heir.
6:47
And then he found a reason to get her essentially decapitated,
6:52
even though it was all his fault.
6:58
He was maybe producing a lot more sperm
7:01
that looked like that than was looking like this.
7:03
He eventually does produce a male heir so he was--
7:04
and if we assume that it was his child--
7:07
then obviously he was producing some of these,but for the most part,
7:11
it was all Henry the VIII's fault.
7:13
So that's why I say there's a little bit of irony here.
7:15
Is that the people doing the blame are the people
7:17
to blame for the lack of a male heir?
7:20
Now one question that might immediately pop up in your head is,
7:24
Sal,is everything on these chromosomes
7:28
related to just our sex-determining traits
7:31
or are there other stuff on them?
7:34
So let me draw some chromosomes.
7:38
So let's say that's an X chromosome and this is a Y chromosome.
7:43
Now the X chromosome,it does code for a lot more things,
7:47
although it is kind of famously gene poor.
7:50
It codes for on the order of 1,500 genes.
7:55
And the Y chromosome,it's the most gene poor of all the chromosomes.
8:00
It only codes for on the order of 78 genes.
8:05
I just looked this up,but who knows if it's exactly 78.
8:09
But what it tells you is it does very little
8:11
other than determining what the gender is.
8:13
And the way it determines that,
8:15
it does have one gene on it called the SRY gene.
8:19
You don't have to know that.
8:21
SRY,that plays a role in the development of testes
8:30
or the male sexual organ.So if you have this around,
8:35
this gene right here can start coding for things
8:38
that will eventually lead to the development of the testicles.
8:42
And if you don't have that around,that won't happen,
8:43
so you'll end up with a female.
8:45
And I'm making gross oversimplifications here.
8:48
But everything I've dealt with so far,OK,
8:50
this clearly plays a role in determining sex.
8:53
But you do have other traits on these genes.
8:58
And the famous cases all deal with specific disorders.
9:02
So,for example,color blindness.
9:05
The genes,or the mutations I should say.
9:08
So the mutations that cause color blindness.
9:15
Red-green color blindness,which I did in green,
9:20
which is maybe a little bit inappropriate.
9:24
Color blindness and also hemophilia.
9:28
This is an inability of your blood to clot.
9:30
Actually, there's several types of hemophilia.
9:32
But hemophilia is an inability for your blood to clot properly.
9:36
And both of these are mutations on the X chromosome.
9:45
And they're recessive mutations.So what does that mean?
9:51
It means both of your X chromosomes have to have--
9:54
let's take the case for hemophilia--
9:56
both of your X chromosomes have to have the hemophilia mutation
9:59
in order for you to show the phenotype of having hemophilia.
10:04
So,for example,if there's a woman,
10:06
and let's say this is her genotype.
10:09
She has one regular X chromosome
10:10
and then she has one X chromosome that has the--
10:13
I'll put a little superscript there for hemophilia--
10:16
she has the hemophilia mutation.She's just going to be a carrier.
10:21
Her phenotype right here is going to be no hemophilia.
10:29
She'll have no problem clotting her blood.
10:32
The only way that a woman could be a hemophiliac is
10:35
if she gets two versions of this,
10:36
because this is a recessive mutation.
10:42
Now this individual will have hemophilia.
10:49
Now men,they only have one X chromosome.
10:54
So for a man to exhibit hemophilia to have this phenotype,
10:57
he just needs it only on the one X chromosome he has.
11:03
And then the other one's a Y chromosome.
11:07
So this man will have hemophilia.
11:11
So a natural question should be arising is, hey, you know this guy--
11:14
let's just say that this is a relatively infrequent mutation
11:19
that arises on an X chromosome--
11:22
the question is who's more likely to have hemophilia?
11:25
A male or a female?
11:27
All else equal,who's more likely to have it?
11:29
Well if this is a relatively infrequent allele,a female,
11:33
in order to display it,has to get two versions of it.
11:35
So let's say that the frequency of it--
11:38
and I looked it up before this video--
11:41
roughly they say between 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 men exhibit hemophilia.
11:46
So let's say that the allele frequency of this is 1 in 7,000,
11:51
the frequency of Xh,the hemophilia version of the X chromosome.
12:01
And that's why 1 in 7,000 men display it,
12:03
because it's completely determined whether--
12:05
there's a 1 in 7,000 chance that
12:07
this X chromosome they get is the hemophilia version.
12:11
Who cares what the Y chromosome they get is, cause
12:14
that essentially doesn't code at all for the blood clotting factors
12:17
and all of the things that drive hemophilia.
12:19
Now,for a woman to get hemophilia,what has to happen?
12:23
She has to have two X chromosomes with the mutation.
12:26
Well the probability of each of them having the mutation is 1 in 7,000
12:33
So the probability of her having hemophilia is
12:37
1 in 7,000 times 1 in 7,000,or that's 1 in what,49 million.
12:46
So as you can imagine,the incidence of hemophilia in women
12:49
is much lower than the incidence of hemophilia in men.
12:54
And in general for any sex-linked trait, if it's recessive,
12:56
if it's a recessive sex-linked trait,which means men,
13:00
if they have it,they're going to show it,
13:02
because they don't have another X chromosome to dominate it.
13:06
Or for women to show it, she has to have both versions of it.
13:09
The incidence in men is going to be,
13:14
so let's say that m is the incidence in men.I'm spelling badly.
13:29
Then the incidence in women will be what?
13:33
You could view this as the allele frequency
13:35
of that mutation on the X chromosome.
13:38
So women have to get two versions of it.
13:40
So the woman's frequency is m squared.
13:42
And you might say,hey,that looks like a bigger number.
13:44
I'm squaring it. But you have to remember that these numbers,
13:47
the frequency is less than 1,
13:49
so in the case of hemophilia,that was 1 in 7,000.
13:53
So if you square 1 in 7,000,you get 1 in 49 million.
13:58
Anyway,hopefully you found that interesting
14:00
and now you know how we all become men and women.

0:02
So the story begins with the WHO, the World Health
0:06
Organization.
0:08
And the WHO actually works with a few of the regional labs.
0:12
So there are actually five labs sprinkled around the world.
0:16
And these labs collect specimens from hundreds of countries.
0:20
So hundreds and hundreds of countries
0:22
do surveillance to figure out what type of flu
0:24
is affecting their particular population.
0:27
And they will send this information over
0:30
to these five regional labs.
0:32
And I'm just going to quickly draw out
0:34
for you where the regional labs are.
0:36
There's one over here in the US.
0:38
There's also one down here in China.
0:42
And then there's another one over here in Japan.
0:47
And a fourth one in the southern hemisphere in Australia.
0:53
And finally, there's one in the United Kingdom.
0:56
So this is the last one.
0:57
There are five in total.
0:58
The WHO will take a look at all the different strains that
1:02
have come into these five labs again from all over the world.
1:05
And they'll try to make a decision
1:07
as to what makes the most sense.
1:09
Because flu usually moves around the world
1:12
in a very predictable way.
1:14
So they can make an educated guess
1:15
as to what strains they should include in the vaccine
1:18
to protect people most effectively.
1:20
Sometimes they'll use a strain that they
1:22
used in previous years.
1:23
And sometimes they'll pick something brand new.
1:25
So let's go through the three strains
1:28
that they actually picked for the most
1:29
recent vaccine, the 2012-2013 vaccine.
1:34
I'll start with the type of virus they put in there.
1:36
And generally it's two type A's and one type B.
1:40
That's the usual formula that they use.
1:44
The WHO recommends that for the trivalent, or three strain
1:48
vaccine.
1:49
And the exact one that they choose
1:51
can be actually followed.
1:52
They usually name it in part based on location.
1:55
So they'll say, OK, the type is A.
1:59
And they'll say the location is-- in this case,
2:02
the first one actually came from California.
2:05
The second one came from Victoria, Australia.
2:09
And the final one came from Wisconsin in the United States.
2:13
So this is the location of the three strains.
2:15
In fact, if you ever see it named,
2:17
you'll see a slash between these two.
2:19
So I'll put a slash here as well.
2:20
Next, they actually have strain numbers.
2:22
So they'll give you a number and what that number refers to.
2:26
It doesn't mean a whole heck of a lot to us.
2:27
But we're going to put it in there just because that's
2:30
how they name things.
2:31
The strain number is, for the first one, 7.
2:34
This is 361.
2:36
And this is strain 1.
2:37
And then finally, they'll put the year that they actually
2:40
identified this thing.
2:41
So the year of identification.
2:44
And this first one, this type A, was actually
2:45
identified back in 2009.
2:48
Whereas the other ones are a little bit newer,
2:49
identified in 2011 and 2010.
2:52
So, that's what comes after the strain number.
2:55
And finally, the last thing, which
2:58
only applies to the first two, is that if it's a type A,
3:02
they'll actually tell you the H and N type.
3:05
So, for example, the first one, the California strain,
3:09
this one is actually a type H1N1.
3:13
And the second one is an H3N2.
3:16
And the third one, because it's a type B,
3:18
we don't really use that H and N classification.
3:21
So I'll just put a hash there, meaning nothing.
3:23
So if you ever come across these things
3:25
in some sort of formal document, at least now
3:27
you know what the heck all these numbers and words refer to.
3:31
So this is literally how they name the strains.
3:33
And just for you and I to know, this first one here,
3:37
this one is actually an old strain.
3:39
So, this is actually part of the last few vaccines.
3:42
This is not a new one that was included.
3:44
Whereas these other ones down here, these ones,
3:47
are actually new strains.
3:49
They were not part of the vaccine in previous years.
3:52
These are new additions or changes to the vaccine.
3:56
So just to remember, we always include
3:58
two type A's and one type B. And the type A's, one is a H1N1
4:05
and the other is a H3N2.
4:07
That's how we've been doing it in recent years.
4:09
Now let me bring up a little bit more canvas
4:11
because I want to talk you through exactly what happens
4:13
once the WHO decides that these are
4:16
the strains they're going to use.
4:17
And this decision was actually made back in February of 2012.
4:22
So months and months in advance they're figuring out what
4:24
strain we're going to use.
4:27
And that information then goes to the next group
4:30
of folks, which is the manufacturers.
4:32
The manufacturers are going to take this information
4:35
and they're literally going to start putting things together.
4:38
They're going to start the manufacturing process.
4:41
And one of the key parts of this process, which a lot of people
4:44
don't realize, and it's pretty mind boggling,
4:46
is that you need millions, actually
4:48
hundreds of millions of eggs.
4:51
The same kind of eggs you might eat for breakfast.
4:54
But these eggs are actually laboratory grade
4:56
and they're needed for making this process work.
4:59
And once it's made, one of the key things,
5:01
and this reassures a lot of folks, is safety.
5:04
We want to make sure that these things are safe.
5:06
And so a lot of testing goes into making sure
5:08
that all of these vaccines that they make are safe.
5:12
So once that's done and people feel comfortable that it's
5:15
a safe vaccine, we start distributing it.
5:18
So distribution is next.
5:19
And we're going to go through each of these stages
5:21
and think just a little bit about which people
5:24
are involved in all these steps.
5:25
But I just want to lay out all the steps first
5:28
so you get an appreciation for how many players there are
5:32
and how many steps are in getting a vaccine to you.
5:36
So it goes, of course, from distribution,
5:38
it goes to these clinics.
5:39
And then finally, at the end of the day there is a person.
5:43
There might be you.
5:44
This is you getting your flu shot
5:46
and you're very happy because you're now
5:49
protected from the vaccine.
5:51
And I'll draw a little shield around you,
5:55
a little protection for you, to make sure
5:57
that it's clear that you're protected-- not completely--
6:00
I'll draw a little hole in the protection--
6:02
not completely because a vaccine isn't perfect.
6:05
But it's pretty good.
6:06
And in fact, this year, in terms of how well the vaccine is
6:09
working-- not in studies, but in the real world-- in terms
6:13
of how it's doing as people are getting it--
6:15
about 62% effectiveness.
6:17
So it's actually really quite good.
6:19
In studies we always see around 60% to 70%.
6:22
And now, in real life, we're seeing a 62% effectiveness
6:26
in terms of vaccine effectiveness.
6:29
The word effectiveness just means real world data,
6:32
versus efficacy-- is what we see in studies.
6:35
That's the difference in the two words.
6:37
So let me list out some of the different folks involved
6:40
at each step of the way.
6:42
So in terms of selecting the strain,
6:44
we said that the WHO is responsible in working
6:47
with all the different countries and the public health
6:50
groups and laboratories and scientists that
6:52
are looking at all the strain data.
6:54
And then in terms of manufacturing, there
6:56
you got to think about the vaccine industry.
6:58
There are many, many big players here.
7:00
Big business is involved in terms
7:03
of churning out millions of doses of vaccine.
7:06
So here the vaccine industry is a major player.
7:09
And then, you think of all the other groups that are involved.
7:11
So I said that you have to get hundreds of millions of eggs
7:16
to make this process work.
7:18
And so of course, then you have to really work with farmers.
7:20
And if you have a year where the flu is really
7:23
hurting the birds and the chicken population
7:26
then that's going to make it really hard because there
7:28
are fewer eggs to contribute to the vaccine manufacturing.
7:32
So it's actually an interesting thought process.
7:35
Flu obviously affects chickens as well as humans.
7:38
And so if those populations start dying out,
7:41
then even humans suffer because we don't have the vaccine.
7:44
Now, then safety is huge.
7:45
So you have to think of all the different countries that
7:48
have organizations that care about safety.
7:51
And in the US the one that comes to mind
7:53
is the FDA, or the Food and Drug Administration.
7:56
So each country has its own process
7:58
of thinking about safety.
8:00
And those groups are obviously very involved
8:02
in making the vaccine as well.
8:04
Then you've got all these logistic things to think about.
8:06
I mean, if you're making hundreds of millions
8:08
of vaccines, you've got to distribute them
8:10
around the world.
8:11
You've got to think about airplanes that can actually
8:13
take your flu vaccine and move it around.
8:16
You've got to think about refrigeration.
8:18
Maybe ships if you're moving across large bodies of water.
8:23
Maybe trucks to get vaccine inland
8:26
if it's cheaper that way.
8:27
So lots of logistical issues to think about how to get vaccine
8:31
distributed.
8:32
And then finally, you've got nurses and doctors
8:34
in the clinics that have to be informed.
8:36
They need to know when to start making appointments
8:38
for their patients and how to set up
8:40
clinics to actually administer the vaccine to all the folks.
8:44
And finally we've got you.
8:46
You're at the end of this chain.
8:48
And not just you, but there are about 250 million folks just
8:52
like you getting vaccines.
8:54
So 250 million doses are actually put together.
8:58
And this is quite an effort.
9:00
You can see the countries involved.
9:02
And getting all that information to all these different groups
9:05
that have to get involved in terms
9:06
of making this even possible.
9:08
So, to me, this is actually one of the most impressive feats
9:11
out there.

0:00
By this point in the biology playlist,
0:02
you're probably wondering a very natural question,
0:06
how is gender determined in an organism?
0:09
And it's not an obvious answer,because throughout the animal kingdom,
0:12
it's actually determined in different ways.
0:15
In some creatures,especially some types of reptiles,it's environmental
0:23
Not all reptiles,but certain cases of it.
0:26
It could be maybe the temperature in which the
0:29
embryo develops will dictate whether it turns into a male or female
0:32
or other environmental factors.
0:34
And in other types of animals,especially mammals,
0:38
of which we are one example,it's a genetic basis.
0:45
And so your next question is,hey,Sal,so--
0:47
let me write this down,in mammals it's genetic--
0:55
so,OK,maybe they're different alleles,a male or a female allele.
1:01
But then you're like,hey,but there's so many different characteristics
1:04
that differentiate a man from a woman.
1:08
Maybe it would have to be a whole set of genes
1:09
that have to work together.
1:11
And to some degree,your second answer would be more correct.
1:16
It's even more than just a set of genes.
1:18
It's actually whole chromosomes determine it.
1:21
So let me draw a nucleus.That's going to be my nucleus.
1:25
And this is going to be the nucleus for a man.
1:27
So 22 of the pairs of chromosomes
1:29
are just regular non-sex-determining chromosomes.
1:33
So I could just do,that's one of the homologous,2,4,6,8,10,12,14.
1:41
I can just keep going.And eventually you have 22 pairs.
1:45
So these 22 pairs right there,they're called autosomal.
1:51
And those are just our standard pairs of chromosomes
1:54
that code for different things.
1:55
Each of these right here is a homologous pair,homologous,
2:02
which we learned before you get one from each of your parents.
2:05
They don't necessarily code for the same thing,
2:07
for the same versions of the genes,but they code for the same genes.
2:11
If eye color is on this gene,it's also on that gene,
2:13
on the other gene of the homologous pair.
2:15
Although you might have different versions of eye color
2:17
on either one and that determines what you display.
2:20
But these are just kind of the standard genes
2:23
that have nothing to do with our gender.
2:25
And then you have these two other special chromosomes.
2:31
I'll do this one.
2:32
It'll be a long brown one,and then I'll do a short blue one.
2:36
And the first thing you'll notice is that they don't look homologous.
2:39
How could they code for the same thing
2:41
when the blue one is short and the brown one's long?
2:44
And that's true.They aren't homologous.
2:46
And these we'll call our sex-determining chromosomes.
2:59
And the long one right here,
3:01
it's been the convention to call that the x chromosome.
3:07
Let me scroll down a little bit.
3:09
And the blue one right there,we refer to that as the y chromosome.
3:16
And to figure out whether something is a male or a female,
3:19
it's a pretty simple system.
3:20
If you've got a y chromosome,you are a male.
3:23
So let me write that down.
3:26
So this nucleus that I drew just here--
3:28
obviously you could have the whole broader cell all around here--
3:31
this is the nucleus for a man.
3:34
So if you have an x chromosome--
3:35
and we'll talk about in a second
3:37
why you can only get that from your mom--
3:39
an x chromosome from your mom and a y chromosome from your dad,
3:43
you will be a male.
3:46
If you get an x chromosome from your mom
3:49
and an x chromosome from your dad,you're going to be a female.
3:54
And so we could actually even draw a Punnett square.
3:56
This is almost a trivially easy Punnett square,
3:58
but it kind of shows what all of the different possibilities are.
4:02
So let's say this is your mom's genotype
4:04
for her sex-determining chromosome.
4:07
She's got two x's.
4:09
That's what makes her your mom and not your dad.
4:11
And then your dad has an x and a y--
4:14
I should do it in capital--and has a Y chromosome.
4:19
And we can do a Punnett square.
4:20
What are all the different combinations of offspring?
4:23
Well,your mom could give this X chromosome,
4:25
in conjunction with this X chromosome from your dad.
4:28
This would produce a female.
4:29
Your mom could give this other X chromosome with that X chromosome.
4:32
That would be a female as well.
4:35
Well,your mom's always going to be donating an X chromosome.
4:38
And then your dad is going to donate either the X or the Y.
4:42
So in this case,it'll be the Y chromosome.
4:44
So these would be female,and those would be male.
4:46
And it works out nicely that half are female and half are male.
4:50
But a very interesting and somewhat ironic fact
4:55
might pop out at you when you see this.
4:57
what determines whether someone is
4:59
or Who determines whether their offspring are male or female?
5:04
Is it the mom or the dad?
5:07
Well,the mom always donates an X chromosome,
5:09
so in no way does- what the haploid genetic makeup of the mom's eggs
5:16
of the gamete from the female,
5:18
in no way does that determine the gender of the offspring.
5:22
It's all determined by whether--let me just draw a bunch of--
5:26
dad's got a lot of sperm,and they're all racing towards the egg.
5:34
And some of them have an X chromosome in them
5:37
and some of them have a Y chromosome in them.
5:41
And obviously they have others.
5:42
And obviously if this guy up here wins the race.
5:46
Or maybe I should say this girl.If she wins the race,
5:49
then the fertilized egg will develop into a female.
5:53
If this sperm wins the race,
5:55
then the fertilized egg will develop into a male.
5:59
And the reason why I said it's ironic is throughout history,
6:01
and probably the most famous example of this is Henry the VIII.
6:09
I mean it's not just the case with kings.
6:11
It's probably true,because most of our civilization is male dominated,
6:15
that you've had these men who are obsessed with producing a male heir
6:19
to kind of take over the family name.
6:21
And,in the case of Henry the VIII,take over a country.
6:24
And they become very disappointed and they tend to blame their wives
6:28
when the wives keep producing females,but it's all their fault.
6:33
Henry the VIII,I mean the most famous case was with Ann Boleyn.
6:39
I'm not an expert here,but the general notion is that
6:43
he became upset with her that she wasn't producing a male heir.
6:47
And then he found a reason to get her essentially decapitated,
6:52
even though it was all his fault.
6:58
He was maybe producing a lot more sperm
7:01
that looked like that than was looking like this.
7:03
He eventually does produce a male heir so he was--
7:04
and if we assume that it was his child--
7:07
then obviously he was producing some of these,but for the most part,
7:11
it was all Henry the VIII's fault.
7:13
So that's why I say there's a little bit of irony here.
7:15
Is that the people doing the blame are the people
7:17
to blame for the lack of a male heir?
7:20
Now one question that might immediately pop up in your head is,
7:24
Sal,is everything on these chromosomes
7:28
related to just our sex-determining traits
7:31
or are there other stuff on them?
7:34
So let me draw some chromosomes.
7:38
So let's say that's an X chromosome and this is a Y chromosome.
7:43
Now the X chromosome,it does code for a lot more things,
7:47
although it is kind of famously gene poor.
7:50
It codes for on the order of 1,500 genes.
7:55
And the Y chromosome,it's the most gene poor of all the chromosomes.
8:00
It only codes for on the order of 78 genes.
8:05
I just looked this up,but who knows if it's exactly 78.
8:09
But what it tells you is it does very little
8:11
other than determining what the gender is.
8:13
And the way it determines that,
8:15
it does have one gene on it called the SRY gene.
8:19
You don't have to know that.
8:21
SRY,that plays a role in the development of testes
8:30
or the male sexual organ.So if you have this around,
8:35
this gene right here can start coding for things
8:38
that will eventually lead to the development of the testicles.
8:42
And if you don't have that around,that won't happen,
8:43
so you'll end up with a female.
8:45
And I'm making gross oversimplifications here.
8:48
But everything I've dealt with so far,OK,
8:50
this clearly plays a role in determining sex.
8:53
But you do have other traits on these genes.
8:58
And the famous cases all deal with specific disorders.
9:02
So,for example,color blindness.
9:05
The genes,or the mutations I should say.
9:08
So the mutations that cause color blindness.
9:15
Red-green color blindness,which I did in green,
9:20
which is maybe a little bit inappropriate.
9:24
Color blindness and also hemophilia.
9:28
This is an inability of your blood to clot.
9:30
Actually, there's several types of hemophilia.
9:32
But hemophilia is an inability for your blood to clot properly.
9:36
And both of these are mutations on the X chromosome.
9:45
And they're recessive mutations.So what does that mean?
9:51
It means both of your X chromosomes have to have--
9:54
let's take the case for hemophilia--
9:56
both of your X chromosomes have to have the hemophilia mutation
9:59
in order for you to show the phenotype of having hemophilia.
10:04
So,for example,if there's a woman,
10:06
and let's say this is her genotype.
10:09
She has one regular X chromosome
10:10
and then she has one X chromosome that has the--
10:13
I'll put a little superscript there for hemophilia--
10:16
she has the hemophilia mutation.She's just going to be a carrier.
10:21
Her phenotype right here is going to be no hemophilia.
10:29
She'll have no problem clotting her blood.
10:32
The only way that a woman could be a hemophiliac is
10:35
if she gets two versions of this,
10:36
because this is a recessive mutation.
10:42
Now this individual will have hemophilia.
10:49
Now men,they only have one X chromosome.
10:54
So for a man to exhibit hemophilia to have this phenotype,
10:57
he just needs it only on the one X chromosome he has.
11:03
And then the other one's a Y chromosome.
11:07
So this man will have hemophilia.
11:11
So a natural question should be arising is, hey, you know this guy--
11:14
let's just say that this is a relatively infrequent mutation
11:19
that arises on an X chromosome--
11:22
the question is who's more likely to have hemophilia?
11:25
A male or a female?
11:27
All else equal,who's more likely to have it?
11:29
Well if this is a relatively infrequent allele,a female,
11:33
in order to display it,has to get two versions of it.
11:35
So let's say that the frequency of it--
11:38
and I looked it up before this video--
11:41
roughly they say between 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 men exhibit hemophilia.
11:46
So let's say that the allele frequency of this is 1 in 7,000,
11:51
the frequency of Xh,the hemophilia version of the X chromosome.
12:01
And that's why 1 in 7,000 men display it,
12:03
because it's completely determined whether--
12:05
there's a 1 in 7,000 chance that
12:07
this X chromosome they get is the hemophilia version.
12:11
Who cares what the Y chromosome they get is, cause
12:14
that essentially doesn't code at all for the blood clotting factors
12:17
and all of the things that drive hemophilia.
12:19
Now,for a woman to get hemophilia,what has to happen?
12:23
She has to have two X chromosomes with the mutation.
12:26
Well the probability of each of them having the mutation is 1 in 7,000
12:33
So the probability of her having hemophilia is
12:37
1 in 7,000 times 1 in 7,000,or that's 1 in what,49 million.
12:46
So as you can imagine,the incidence of hemophilia in women
12:49
is much lower than the incidence of hemophilia in men.
12:54
And in general for any sex-linked trait, if it's recessive,
12:56
if it's a recessive sex-linked trait,which means men,
13:00
if they have it,they're going to show it,
13:02
because they don't have another X chromosome to dominate it.
13:06
Or for women to show it, she has to have both versions of it.
13:09
The incidence in men is going to be,
13:14
so let's say that m is the incidence in men.I'm spelling badly.
13:29
Then the incidence in women will be what?
13:33
You could view this as the allele frequency
13:35
of that mutation on the X chromosome.
13:38
So women have to get two versions of it.
13:40
So the woman's frequency is m squared.
13:42
And you might say,hey,that looks like a bigger number.
13:44
I'm squaring it. But you have to remember that these numbers,
13:47
the frequency is less than 1,
13:49
so in the case of hemophilia,that was 1 in 7,000.
13:53
So if you square 1 in 7,000,you get 1 in 49 million.
13:58
Anyway,hopefully you found that interesting
14:00

0:02
Voiceover: You'll very rarely hear anyone say that
0:04
the patient has leukemia.
0:06
Instead, they're more likely to say something like
0:08
the patient has acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.
0:11
So, what do all of those other words mean?
0:13
Well, to understand that we'd have to
0:15
go back to this diagram, which at this point
0:18
is probably showing up in your dreams,
0:20
because of how many times I've used it,
0:21
but we're going to use it this time
0:23
to show how the different leukemias are divided,
0:26
how they're split up and organized.
0:28
So, the first thing I'm going to do is,
0:30
I'm going to divide this diagram in half.
0:32
I'm going to divide it in half horizontally.
0:34
So, I'm going to draw this line down the middle,
0:36
and that would split up the cells according to
0:38
how mature they are, right?
0:40
So, you'd end up with a row of cells on top that has
0:43
the most immature blood cells
0:45
that you could possibly have and a row of cells
0:48
at the bottom which has some still immature cells,
0:51
but these cells are a little bit more developed,
0:54
a little bit further along.
0:56
So, this is actually the first way that
0:58
you can split up the leukemias.
1:00
If a leukemia comes from one of these cells up here,
1:02
it's called an acute leukemia, and if it comes from
1:07
one of these cells down here,
1:08
it's called a chronic leukemia.
1:10
So, the first way to split up the leukemias
1:13
is by how immature the originating cell is.
1:17
So, what do the words acute and chronic
1:19
have to do with maturity?
1:21
That seems like a really random word choice, right?
1:24
Well, it's actually not, because acute leukemias,
1:27
turns out they grow very fast, they grow very fast.
1:31
So, a person with an acute leukemia
1:33
can start to feel sick, can start to show signs and symptoms
1:36
within weeks, not years but weeks of the leukemia forming.
1:41
So, it's a very acute onset of disease, okay?
1:46
Now, chronic leukemias, turns out they grow very slowly.
1:49
So, a patient with a chronic leukemia can sometimes
1:53
go years without having any symptoms at all.
1:56
So, it's a very chronic onset of disease.
2:01
So, I just want to clarify, guys, that the whole process
2:04
by which the leukemia occurs is still the same.
2:07
So, we still have this immature blood cell
2:09
that loses the ability to mature and then starts
2:12
dividing rapidly and out of control.
2:15
That's still going on, but what we're doing now is
2:17
we're fine-tuning what we mean by the word, immature.
2:21
So, we're asking the question,
2:22
just how immature is that blood cell?
2:25
And so, I want to go back to the diagram
2:29
that we used to show how leukemias occur.
2:31
So, we said that this is what normal blood cell
2:34
maturation looks like, right?
2:36
And this is what happens when leukemia occurs.
2:39
So, you have this blood cell that's stuck.
2:41
It's arrested in the immature state,
2:44
and it can't move any further, and then it starts
2:46
to divide really rapidly and out of control.
2:49
So, look at the leukemia cells.
2:51
Since they're in the first stage of development,
2:53
they're the most immature blood cells
2:55
that you could possibly have.
2:56
This must be a picture of acute leukemia.
2:59
So, let's compare that with what
3:01
chronic leukemias look like.
3:03
So, a chronic leukemia picture looks more like this,
3:07
where you still have these blood cells,
3:09
these immature blood cells that are arrested
3:11
in their maturation, they can't move forward,
3:14
and they start dividing really rapidly.
3:15
The only difference is, is that this time
3:18
the leukemia cells are a little bit more developed.
3:20
They're at the next stage of maturation,
3:22
and not only do these chronic leukemia cells
3:25
divide really rapidly, but they also live longer
3:29
than the average normal blood cell does.
3:32
So, there's a degree of immortality
3:34
that these chronic leukemia cells have.
3:36
So, this is a picture of chronic leukemia.
3:42
Now, something else that I think this diagram
3:45
does a pretty decent job of illustrating is that
3:47
when you have an acute leukemia,
3:49
your leukemia cells look nothing like your
3:51
mature specialized cells.
3:52
I mean, they bear no resemblance whatsoever,
3:55
and we said before that these cells
3:57
perform almost no function.
3:59
They're just kind of like a waste of space
4:01
versus if you look at your chronic leukemia cells,
4:03
they don't look exactly like your
4:06
mature specialized cells, but they certainly
4:07
resemble them just a little bit more, right?
4:10
And in terms of their function, they leave a lot
4:14
to be wanted, but it's not unreasonable to say that
4:17
they can do a couple of things correctly.
4:20
You know, they won't do everything,
4:21
but they can do a couple of things correctly.
4:24
So, this is the first way you can split up
4:26
the leukemias, acute versus chronic,
4:28
where acute leukemias come from the most immature cells,
4:31
chronic a little bit more developed,
4:33
a little bit more mature cells.
4:34
Acute leukemias grow very rapidly.
4:37
Chronic leukemias grow slowly.
4:39
And acute leukemia cells bear no resemblance
4:41
in appearance or in function to the
4:43
mature specialized cells versus chronic leukemia cells
4:47
resemble the mature specialized cells
4:49
a little bit more, in terms of appearance
4:51
and what they're able to do, okay?
4:55
So, now let's talk about the second way
4:56
you can split up the leukemias.
4:57
And so, this time we're going to take this diagram,
4:59
and we're going to split it in half vertically,
5:02
and if we did that, we drew a line down the middle,
5:05
we'd be splitting up the cells not according to
5:07
how mature they are but according to what cell type,
5:10
what type of cell they are.
5:12
So, you'd end up with the myeloid cells over here
5:15
and the lymphoid cells over here, and you can leave
5:17
things as broad as myeloid versus lymphoid, or you can
5:20
specify a little bit more about what cell lineage,
5:24
particular cell lineage you're talking about.
5:26
So, this is the second way that the leukemias
5:28
are split up, according to cell type.
5:30
So, I want to go back to that first example
5:33
that I gave you in the beginning of the video,
5:35
acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.
5:38
What cell does that leukemia develop from?
5:40
Well, if we're talking about acute, it must come from
5:44
this row over here, right?
5:45
And we said acute megakaryoblastic,
5:48
so that must be this cell right here, this cell right here.
5:52
So, an acute megakaryoblastic leukemia
5:54
comes from this cell right here.
5:56
So, let's take another example.
5:57
What about chronic lymphocytic leukemia?
6:00
So, chronic means that it must come from
6:02
one of these cells down here.
6:03
Lymphocytic must be pointing to either
6:05
this cell or this cell, right, one of the lymphocytes.
6:09
And you can leave it as broad as that
6:11
or you can specify whether you're talking about a
6:12
B lymphocyte or a T lymphocyte, okay?
6:15
So, that's how all the leukemias are split up.
6:17
Now, we're ready to go into the details
6:19
about the different leukemias.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,frUCL0snbPk,
khan_video_bJMUKNbAsTY_8,"For the last example, can someone please clarify it that equation can be considered as a disproportionation reaction in because a carbon undergoes both oxidation and reduction in that example when having one carbon atom going from 0 to -1 and 0 and +1 ?",Essay,"•
0:00
- Now that we know how to assign oxidation states
0:02
to Carbon let's look at some organic redox reactions,
0:06
and remember these definition from general chemistry.
0:09
Oxidation involves an increase in the oxidation state
0:14
and reduction involves a decrease
0:17
or a reduction in the oxidation state.
0:20
You might also remember that loss of electrons is oxidation
0:25
and gain of electrons is reduction.
0:28
So, LEO the lion goes GER as a good way to remember that.
0:33
Let's look at this starting compound here
0:35
and this reaction, and let's figure out
0:37
whether the starting compound
0:38
has been oxidized, reduced, or neither.
0:41
If you look at these three carbons on the left
0:44
and these three carbons on the right.
0:47
All right, there's no change to those carbons
0:49
so there should be no change
0:50
in the oxidation states of those carbons
0:53
but when you look at this carbon right here,
0:55
the one I just marked in yellow, right,
0:57
on the left it's bonded to,
0:59
let me go ahead and draw
0:59
that out, Is double bonded to an oxygen,
1:03
and on the right it's bonded to a hydrogen,
1:06
and on the left it's bonded to a carbon.
1:08
But on the right here that same carbon, right,
1:12
is now bonded to an oxygen on the right.
1:14
So, it still double bonded it to an oxygen
1:17
and has a, has a bond to a carbon on the left,
1:20
but on the right now, it has a bond to an OH.
1:23
So, that carbon has likely changed its oxidation state
1:27
and we can go ahead and find the oxidation state
1:30
using what we learned in the last video.
1:33
So, remember you need to put in your bonding electrons.
1:36
So, let's put in our bonding electrons here.
1:38
Each bond consists of two electrons.
1:42
All right, so we know that when we're doing oxidation states
1:45
we need to think about electronegativity differences
1:48
and carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen.
1:51
So, we assign both of those electrons to carbon.
1:55
Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon
1:58
so oxygen takes all four of those electrons.
2:00
And when we get to carbon versus carbon
2:02
we can assume that those carbons have
2:04
the same electronegativies
2:06
and therefore for two electrons
2:08
we're gonna split those two electrons up.
2:10
We're gonna give one electron to one carbon
2:12
and the other electron to the other carbon.
2:14
So, this carbon is surrounded by three electrons
2:17
and we know carbon should have,
2:19
we know carbon is supposed to have
2:21
a number of four valence electrons around it.
2:24
So, carbon's supposed to have four.
2:25
In our dot structure here Carbon only has three.
2:28
Let me highlight them. One, two, and three.
2:32
So, four minus three gives us plus one
2:35
which is the oxidation state for this carbon.
2:38
So, this carbon right here has an oxidation state
2:40
of plus one on the left.
2:42
What about on the right?
2:44
Let's go ahead and put in our bonding electrons, right.
2:46
So, we know that each bond consists of two electrons.
2:51
Let me put those in here.
2:53
And again, we think about electronegativity.
2:55
This time on the right, this carbon
2:58
is bonded to an oxygen now so carbon loses
3:01
those two electrons to oxygen.
3:03
Right, oxygen's more electronegative.
3:06
Oxygen takes, this top oxygen takes those four electrons
3:09
and again, we split these two electrons.
3:12
So, this time carbon is only surrounded by one.
3:15
So, define carbon's oxidation state
3:17
we know that carbon's supposed
3:18
to have four valence electrons
3:20
and from that we subtract the number
3:22
of valence electrons around carbon
3:24
once we've accounted for electronegativity.
3:26
And that's only one electron now.
3:28
So, four minus one gives us
3:31
an oxidation state of plus three.
3:34
So, on the right this same carbon
3:36
now has an oxidation state of plus three.
3:40
So, what happened in this reaction?
3:42
Carbon went from an oxidation state of plus one
3:44
to an oxidation state of plus three.
3:47
An increase in the oxidation state is oxidation.
3:52
So, our starting compound was oxidized here.
3:55
So, our starting compound was oxidized.
3:58
In order for this to be oxidized
4:00
we would need some sort of oxidizing agent.
4:03
So, I'll write that down here really quickly.
4:06
We would need an oxidizing agent
4:07
to accomplish this reaction.
4:09
And it's the oxidizing agent that itself
4:12
is being reduced because remember,
4:14
whenever something is being oxidized
4:15
something else has to be reduced.
4:18
Let's think about the other definitions for,
4:20
the other definition I should say for oxidation.
4:23
We know that oxidation involves the loss of electrons.
4:28
So, let's look at that here.
4:29
On the left, right, carbon had three electrons around it,
4:33
and when we added a bond to oxygen,
4:36
right, carbon lost these two electrons over here.
4:40
It had those two electrons.
4:41
On the left it had those two electrons.
4:43
On the right it lost those two electrons
4:45
and now it's only surrounded by one.
4:47
And we see an increase in the oxidation state.
4:50
So, it's like carbon lost electrons.
4:53
Also there's a shortcut that you can use.
4:56
For this reaction, let's think about
4:58
what that shortcut would be.
5:00
Let me use, I'll use red still.
5:02
On the left, this carbon with an oxidation state of plus one
5:05
has two bonds to oxygen.
5:07
Let me go ahead and highlight them here.
5:08
So, here's one bond and here's the other bond.
5:10
On the right, that same carbon now
5:13
has three bonds to oxygen.
5:15
So, here's one bond, here's two bonds,
5:17
and then this bond over here.
5:19
So, we've increased in the number of bonds to oxygen
5:22
and that can tell us we have an oxidation really quickly
5:25
without going through and doing all these oxidation states.
5:29
Notice we lost a bond to hydrogen.
5:31
All right, so over here we lost this bond to hydrogen
5:34
and we replaced it with a bond to oxygen.
5:39
So, an increase in the number of bonds to oxygen
5:42
or a decrease in number of bonds to hydrogen
5:45
can tell you that your carbon is oxidized too.
5:49
Let's do another one.
5:50
So, our goal is to figure out
5:51
whether this starting compound has
5:53
been oxidized, reduced, or neither.
5:56
So, again, these three carbons on the left, right,
5:58
are the same as these three carbons on the right.
6:01
And there's no change in those carbons.
6:02
So, therefore we would expect no change
6:04
in the oxidation state.
6:05
The same with this carbon.
6:07
So, we're gonna focus in on this carbon.
6:10
So, on the left that carbon has a double bond
6:12
to oxygen so we draw that in there
6:14
an then it's bonded to a carbon on the left
6:16
and a carbon on the right.
6:19
And our product, that same carbon,
6:21
is now bonded to only one oxygen.
6:24
Let me go ahead and do that.
6:25
Only one bond I should say to oxygen
6:27
and it's still bonded to a carbon on the left
6:30
and still bonded to a carbon on the right,
6:31
and it must have a bond to hydrogen in here, right?
6:34
It's not drawn in but it's assumed that you know that.
6:37
So, let's put in that bond to hydrogen.
6:39
And let's find our oxidation states.
6:41
So, we start on the left,
6:43
and we draw in our bonding electrons,
6:46
and next we think about electronegativity differences.
6:50
So, we know that oxygen's more electronegative than carbon
6:54
so oxygen takes those four electrons.
6:56
Over here, right, we assume that the electronegativities
6:59
for these carbons are the same,
7:01
and so we split up those two electrons.
7:03
We give on electron to one carbon
7:05
and one electron to the other carbon.
7:07
And same over here.
7:08
So, the oxidation state for carbon
7:10
would be four valence electrons
7:12
minus this, in this case we have
7:14
two around carbon, so here's two.
7:16
Four minus two gives us an oxidation state of plus two.
7:20
So, on the left this carbon has
7:22
an oxidation state of plus two.
7:24
What about on the right?
7:26
Let's put in our bonding electrons
7:28
and again, once we've done that we think about
7:30
electronegativity and we can assign
7:33
an oxidation state to that carbon.
7:36
So, we know that oxygen's more elecrtonegative
7:39
so oxygen takes those two electrons.
7:41
Right, again, there's, we assume
7:43
that these carbons have the same electronegativity
7:46
so we split up those electrons.
7:48
We split up these electrons.
7:49
But now carbon is bonded to hydrogen.
7:52
So, carbon is a little more electronegative
7:54
than hydrogen so we just give both
7:56
of those electrons to carbon.
7:58
And now let's find our oxidation state.
8:01
We know carbon is supposed to have
8:02
four valence electrons around it
8:04
and in our drawing here, once we've
8:06
accounted for electronegativity
8:08
carbon is surrounded by one, two, three, and four.
8:12
So, four minus four is equal to zero.
8:16
And so this carbon, this carbon now
8:19
has an oxidation state of zero.
8:21
So, that carbon went from an oxidation state
8:23
of plus two to an oxidation state of zero.
8:27
That's a decrease in the oxidation state.
8:30
So, carbon was reduced.
8:32
So, in this reaction our starting compound was reduced.
8:36
All right, so this was, our starting compound was reduced
8:39
which means we would need some sort of reducing agent
8:42
to accomplish this reaction.
8:45
And it's the reducing agent that would be oxidized
8:48
because if something is reduced
8:49
something else has to be oxidized.
8:51
We can also think about our other definition for reduction.
8:56
Gain of electrons is reduction
8:59
and let's look at what happened here.
9:01
So, the electrons that were gained right,
9:03
were these two electrons right here
9:05
because on the left we had this carbon
9:07
with a double bond to this oxygen.
9:09
On the right, we have only now one bond to oxygen.
9:11
Right, so we gained these two electrons
9:14
because we increased the number of bonds to hydrogen.
9:17
So, our other shortcut is to look
9:19
at the number of bonds to oxygen.
9:21
Like we talked about in the last example.
9:23
On the left, carbon has a double bond to oxygen.
9:26
So, two bonds to oxygen.
9:28
On the right we have only one bond to oxygen.
9:31
So, we decreased in the number of bonds to oxygen
9:34
so that's a reduction.
9:35
Again, a fast way of figuring it out.
9:37
Or we increased an number of bonds to hydrogen.
9:44
Let's do one more of these problems.
9:45
So, our goal is to figure out
9:46
if our starting compound on the left
9:48
has been oxidized, reduced, or neither.
9:51
And this time these are the two carbons
9:53
that we are going to analyze.
9:55
Those are the two carbons
9:56
that have changed in this reaction.
9:58
So, on the left let's draw what we have.
10:00
We have a carbon with a double bond to another carbon
10:03
and both of those carbons are bonded to,
10:06
directly bonded to two more carbons.
10:09
On the right, those carbons now
10:11
only have a single bond between them
10:13
and this carbon on the left
10:15
is bonded to a hydrogen.
10:16
This carbon on the right is directly bonded to an oxygen
10:19
and let's put in those other carbons, right?
10:21
We have another carbon, carbon bonds.
10:23
I mean, let's put in those carbon, carbon bonds like that.
10:26
Let's assign our oxidation states.
10:28
So, we draw in our bonding electrons
10:31
and we think about electronegativity differences
10:35
but we're going assume once again
10:37
that our carbons have the same electronegativity on the left
10:41
and so when we're assigning electrons
10:43
let's just pick one of those carbons.
10:45
So, let's pick the carbon on the left, right?
10:48
We divide up those two electrons in that bond.
10:51
Give one electron to one carbon.
10:52
One electron to the other.
10:54
We do the same thing here.
10:55
And for the double bond with four electrons
10:57
we divide up those four electrons.
10:58
We give two electrons to each carbon.
11:01
And so carbon is supposed to have four valence electrons
11:04
and around it, this carbon has one, two, three, and four.
11:09
So, four minus four is an oxidation state of zero.
11:13
So, this carbon has an oxidation state of zero.
11:16
Same thing for the carbon on the
11:18
right side of the double bond, right?
11:20
So, the same situation.
11:22
So, it also has an oxidation state of zero.
11:25
What about for our product, right?
11:28
Let's examine those two carbons.
11:29
Let's put in our bonding electrons.
11:31
So, we draw in our bonding electrons here.
11:34
So, we put those in.
11:36
A lot more bonding electrons to draw.
11:38
And we think about electronegativity differences, right?
11:41
Things have changed.
11:42
So, now, now let's focus in on the carbon on the left.
11:47
So, the carbon on the left is now bonded to a hydrogen
11:50
and carbon is a little bit more electronegative.
11:52
So, we give both of those electrons to carbon
11:55
and then we have carbon bonded to carbon,
11:57
carbon bonded to carbon, and carbon bonded to carbon.
12:00
So, what's the oxidation state
12:01
of that carbon on the left now?
12:03
Carbon is supposed to have four valence electrons
12:06
and how many do have around it?
12:07
Let's see, one, two, three, four, five.
12:11
So, four minus five gives us
12:13
an oxidation state of minus one.
12:16
So, this carbon on the left now has
12:18
an oxidation state of minus one.
12:20
What about the carbon on the right?
12:23
Well, we have a tie here, right?
12:25
So, we divide up those electrons, a tie here,
12:27
but oxygen is more electronegative than carbon.
12:29
So, oxygen gets both of those electrons.
12:32
So, the carbon on the right should have
12:33
an oxidation state of for minus three.
12:37
Here are the three electrons around carbon
12:39
once we've accounted for electronegativity.
12:42
So, that's an oxidation state of plus one.
12:46
So, this carbon has an oxidation state of plus one.
12:47
So, overall, what happened here?
12:49
Well, let me use red.
12:51
So, the carbon on the left went from
12:53
an oxidation state of zero
12:55
to an oxidation state of minus one.
12:58
That is a decrease in the oxidation state.
13:01
So, that carbon was reduced.
13:04
What about the carbon on the right side
13:06
of the double bond that we started off with?
13:08
It started off with an oxidation state of zero
13:10
and it went to an oxidation state of plus one.
13:13
That's an increase in the oxidation state.
13:16
So, that carbon was oxidized.
13:18
What can we say about starting compounds overall?
13:21
Well, the starting compound overall
13:23
there's no net change in the oxidation states, right?
13:26
So, on the left for those two carbons
13:28
we get a total of zero.
13:29
On the right we had negative one and positive one
13:32
for a total of zero.
13:33
There's no net change.
13:35
So, this would be neither.
13:36
The starting compound was, overall,
13:38
it wasn't oxidized or reduced. It's neither.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,bJMUKNbAsTY,
khan_video_920PtNX-WCE_2,At 12:16 how does the permeability of the cell change?,MCQ,"•
0:02
So I've got four empty cells here.
0:04
Let's imagine these are four cells in someone's body.
0:07
And the inside of the cells are the same,
0:09
and the outside of the cells are the same.
0:12
So they're really completely the same except for one thing.
0:15
And that one thing is that, let's say
0:17
that these cells, each of them, is only permeable to one ion.
0:21
And I'm going to write the ion that they're
0:23
permeable to underneath them.
0:25
So each of them can only let in or let out one ion.
0:30
So in the first cell, you know that there's
0:32
a lot of potassium that wants to get out,
0:34
so it's going to have potassium leaving.
0:37
In the second cell, you know that we generally
0:39
have more sodium on the outside that wants to get in.
0:44
And the same is true for chloride that wants to get in.
0:47
And the same is true for calcium that wants to get in.
0:49
So this is how the four cells are
0:52
going to have a movement of ions,
0:53
and these are the concentration gradients.
0:56
And so then, of course, if you want
0:58
to figure out what the membrane potentials are,
1:00
you have to think, OK, well, if it's a positive ion leaving,
1:04
then it's going to make the membrane potential negative.
1:08
In fact, we even calculated it to be negative 92 millivolts.
1:12
And for sodium, it turns out to be positive 67 millivolts.
1:17
And these are estimates based on rough concentrations.
1:21
Of course, concentrations aren't exact everywhere.
1:23
Different cell types have different concentrations.
1:26
But these are kind of rough approximations.
1:28
And chloride would be somewhere around,
1:31
let's say, negative 86 millivolts.
1:36
And you know it's negative because a negative ion is
1:38
entering.
1:40
And finally, calcium is going to be positive 123 millivolts.
1:44
And just to remind us, the reason
1:47
that calcium isn't simply sodium times two--
1:50
because you might think that because calcium
1:52
has two positive charges.
1:53
The reason it's not just sodium's number times two
1:57
is that these numbers are actually
1:58
based on concentration gradients,
2:00
and the concentration gradient for calcium
2:02
might be very different.
2:03
In fact, it is very different than it is for sodium.
2:05
So that's how these numbers are made, using that Nernst
2:09
equation that we went over previously.
2:13
So now we know that these are the resting potentials
2:16
for each individual ion.
2:18
But what is the potential for a cell, a real cell?
2:21
And you know we're not actually using a real cell
2:24
as an example, because real cells are
2:26
permeable to multiple ions.
2:28
And so let me actually give you an example
2:30
of what a real cell might look like.
2:33
Of course, it looks slightly different than that
2:38
because you actually have potassium leaving.
2:40
And at the same time, you might have sodium entering,
2:45
you might have chloride entering,
2:47
and you might have calcium entering.
2:50
So this is what a real cell would look like.
2:52
And let's figure out, maybe using an example,
2:55
how to actually work through calculating
2:58
the membrane potential for a real cell like that.
3:01
So I'm going to write out the four ions
3:02
and make it really clear so that we
3:05
don't get confused about the four.
3:08
We're talking about, again, potassium, sodium, chloride,
3:13
and calcium.
3:13
And the reason I chose these four--
3:15
I could have chosen others as well--
3:17
but that these four probably contribute the majority
3:21
to the resting potential.
3:24
In particular, I would say potassium,
3:28
but you'll see that all of them have
3:29
a tiny little role in contributing to it.
3:32
So let's first get to the idea of permeability.
3:35
So until now, we've been assuming
3:38
that each cell is, in the first example,
3:41
only permeable to one ion.
3:43
And now the whole difference is that now we
3:44
have cells that have permeability to multiple ions.
3:48
So here's how you think about it.
3:49
Think about the fact that all ions crossing back and forth
3:54
along the membrane make up permeability.
3:57
So permeability is all ions crossing back and forth.
4:01
Permeability is all ions crossing--
4:08
and I'll just write crossing, and you
4:10
get the idea-- crossing back and forth along the border.
4:14
So what percentage is going to be from potassium?
4:19
What percentage from sodium, chloride, and calcium?
4:23
And of course, the total permeability
4:25
has to be 100% right?
4:27
We have to add up to 100%.
4:28
And let's assume right now that we only
4:30
have four ions going back and forth.
4:33
So I'm just going to make up some quick numbers.
4:35
So let's say that of the 100%, potassium is 95%,
4:42
meaning that 95% of all border crossings--
4:46
if we think about our cell border or cell membrane,
4:48
95% of the crossings are with the ion potassium.
4:53
And that means that only 5% of the crossings
4:56
are with the other three ions.
4:58
So let's say that it's 1% from sodium, and 2% from chloride,
5:04
and 2% from calcium.
5:06
So really, in terms of dominating the permeability,
5:10
in this case, I've set it up so that potassium
5:12
is dominating the permeability, right?
5:14
And actually, in most cells that's about right.
5:18
Potassium is the dominant ion in most cells.
5:22
In fact, sometimes even more than 95%.
5:24
So how do you actually calculate the membrane potential
5:28
based on this?
5:29
So we've started with good information.
5:31
We've got the permeability.
5:34
And now we need to multiply it by potassium's ideal membrane
5:39
potential.
5:40
What would potassium like it to be?
5:41
It would like it to be negative 92 millivolts, right?
5:46
And sodium would like it to be positive 67 millivolts.
5:51
And chloride would like the membrane potential
5:54
to be negative 86 millivolts.
5:58
And calcium would like it to be positive 123.
6:02
I mean, that's ideally where those ions would like to be.
6:05
But again, 95% of the voting, in a sense, for what the cell is
6:11
going to agree upon comes from one ion.
6:14
It comes from potassium.
6:16
And so we just have to add all of this up and get a total.
6:19
So this part right here, 95% of the ions being permeable,
6:25
multiplied by the membrane potential for potassium.
6:29
95% times negative 92-- I'm just going to quickly do
6:32
the math on a calculator-- works out
6:35
to negative 87.4 millivolts.
6:41
And this bit right here, 1% of the 67, well, that's easy.
6:44
That's 0.7 millivolts.
6:47
That's just 1%.
6:49
And then this bit, 2% times negative 86 millivolts, that
6:55
works out to about negative 1.7 millivolts.
6:59
And finally, this part right here for the calcium
7:03
ends up being positive 2.5 millivolts.
7:08
So if you add up all the stuff, what do you get?
7:11
You get a total of negative 85.9 millivolts.
7:20
So this would be the membrane potential
7:24
for a cell that ended up having 95% permeability to potassium,
7:30
and only 1% and 2% to the other three ions.
7:35
So if it's going to be dominated by potassium,
7:38
you can see that this final number
7:40
is going to be really close to what potassium would like
7:43
it to be, that negative 92, because 95% of it
7:47
came from there.
7:49
Now that would be one way of doing it.
7:51
Let me do it one more time, and you'll
7:53
see how it can actually change.
7:56
So just as before, let's say that in the second case-- so
8:00
again, this is case one.
8:04
And let's say case two, now I make
8:08
potassium not very permeable at all.
8:10
Let's say I drop it all the way down to 16%.
8:19
And I raise sodium all the way up to 80%.
8:24
So now, all of a sudden, our same cell
8:27
as before is very permeable to sodium.
8:30
And you might think, well, how would that be the case?
8:33
Let's imagine that sodium channels get put into the cell
8:38
membrane so that sodium can just go right
8:40
through those channels, so something like that.
8:42
But let's say that the other two ions stay about the same.
8:45
2% and 2%.
8:47
So you've got a similar setup as before,
8:50
and this time you've got-- let me do the math.
8:55
So we've got negative 92 millivolts.
8:58
And again, the permeability-- this is actually
9:00
an important point-- adds up to 100% again, right?
9:02
Because you've got 16 plus 80 plus 2 plus 2.
9:05
So overall, we're still talking about 100%
9:07
permeability, but in this case, most of that
9:10
permeability is going to sodium.
9:13
So negative 92 millivolts for the potassium,
9:18
you've got positive 67 for the sodium, negative 86 over here,
9:24
and you've got positive 123 over here.
9:28
So I'm going to do the last two first,
9:30
because those are going to be the same as before, right?
9:32
And then we add them all together.
9:34
So here, of course, as before, I have negative 1.7.
9:38
That doesn't change.
9:39
And as before, I have positive 2.5.
9:42
That doesn't change.
9:44
So some of it's going to be the same.
9:46
But some of it's going to be different.
9:48
So these two numbers-- let me just
9:49
check out what my math works out to be-- this is negative
9:54
14.7 millivolts, so a lot less than the negative 87.
10:00
And now this is going to be a huge number compared
10:03
to that measly 0.7 that we had before.
10:06
Now we have 53.6 coming from sodium.
10:11
So now sodium is playing a much bigger role
10:13
than it was last time.
10:14
And if I was to add these four numbers,
10:17
my overall permeability was 100%,
10:21
and my overall membrane potential as a result of that
10:25
is going to be 39.7.
10:27
So let me just-- and that's positive 39.7.
10:31
So we went from negative 85.9 to positive 39.7.
10:39
And here, the dominant thing was this.
10:45
So you can see how it's starting to approach positive 67, simply
10:49
because we just had so much of the permeability coming
10:53
from sodium.
10:54
So in a way, the permeability becomes almost like a vote.
10:58
Like the more permeable one of the ions
11:01
is relative to the other ones, the more votes
11:03
it gets in terms of what the final membrane
11:05
potential is going to be.
11:06
And in this case, the more an ion votes,
11:11
the more it's going to be close-- the final membrane
11:13
potential will be close-- to what it wants,
11:16
which is its resting potential.
11:19
So we have these two membrane potentials.
11:21
And finally, I'm just going to show you
11:23
on a little graph what this might look like.
11:26
So let's say you've got a little graph here.
11:30
And I'm going to draw a positive and negative.
11:32
So this is positive, this is negative,
11:35
and this is millivolts.
11:37
And what I'm drawing for you is the cell's membrane potential
11:48
in millivolts.
11:50
So at time point 1-- let's say time point one was right here,
11:55
and time point 2 is right here.
11:57
At time point 1, we had a very negative-- I forget the number.
12:02
I think it was like negative 80 something.
12:04
I'll just say it was negative 86 or something down here.
12:08
And then at time point 2, we had a number up here.
12:13
This is our 39.7.
12:17
And actually let me just double check the number,
12:19
I don't want to get it wrong here.
12:20
Yup, negative 86.
12:23
This is negative 86, or 85.9.
12:28
So really, what you had is, in just a matter
12:31
of switching the permeabilities, you
12:34
can actually change the membrane potential from something
12:37
very low to something very high.
12:39
So let's stop there and we'll pick up.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,920PtNX-WCE,

0:00
Let's just talk about the humoral response right now,
0:04
that deals with B lymphocytes.
0:08
So B lymphocytes or B cells-- let me do them in blue.
0:15
So let's say that that is a B lymphocyte.
0:18
It's a subset of white blood cells called lymphocytes.
0:21
It comes from the bone marrow and that's where the-- well,
0:25
the B comes from bursa of Fabricius, but we don't want
0:27
to go into detail there.
0:28
But they have all of these proteins on their surface.
0:30
Actually, close to 10,000 of them.
0:34
I get very excited about B cells and I'll tell
0:35
you why in a second.
0:36
It has all of these proteins on them that look
0:39
something like this.
0:41
I'll just draw a couple of them.
0:46
These are actually protein complexes, you can
0:48
kind of view them.
0:49
They actually have four separate proteins on them and
0:52
we can call these proteins membrane bound antibodies.
1:10
And I'll talk a lot more about antibodies.
1:13
You've probably heard the word.
1:14
You have antibodies for such and such flu, or such and such
1:17
virus, and we're going to talk more about that in the future,
1:20
but antibodies are just proteins.
1:25
They're often referred to as immunoglobulins.
1:36
These are essentially equivalent words.
1:39
Antibodies or immunoglobulins-- and they're
1:44
really just proteins.
1:45
Now, B cells have these on the surface of their membranes.
1:50
These are membrane bound.
1:52
Usually when people talk about antibodies, they're talking
1:54
about free antibodies that are going to just be floating
2:00
around like that.
2:01
And I'm going to go into more detail on
2:03
how those are produced.
2:04
Now what's really, really, really, really, really
2:08
interesting about these membrane bound antibodies and
2:11
these B cells in particular is that a B cell has one type of
2:17
membrane bound antibody on it .
2:27
It's going to also have antibodies, but those
2:29
antibodies are going to be different.
2:32
So we'll focus on where they're different.
2:34
Let me just draw them the same color first and then we'll
2:37
focus on where they're different.
2:45
These are both B cells.
2:46
They both have these antibodies on them.
2:49
The interesting thing is that from one B cell to another B
2:54
cell, they have a variable part on this antibody that
3:00
could take on a bunch of different forms. So this one
3:02
might look like that and that.
3:06
So these long-- I'll go into more detail on that.
3:17
The fixed portion, you can imagine is green for any kind
3:19
of antibody, and then there's a variable portion.
3:22
So maybe this guy's variable portion is--
3:24
I'll do it in pink.
3:25
And every one of the antibodies bound to his
3:28
membrane are going to have that same variable portion.
3:32
This different B cell is going to have
3:34
different variable portions.
3:36
So I'll do that in a different color.
3:38
Maybe I'll do it in magenta.
3:40
So his variable portions are going to be different.
3:47
Now he has 10,000 of these on a surface and every one of
3:50
these have the same variable portions, but they're all
3:53
different from the variable portions on this B cell.
3:57
There's actually 10 billion different combinations of
4:00
variable portions.
4:14
So the first question-- and I haven't even told you what the
4:16
variable portions are good for-- is, how do that many
4:19
different combinations arise?
4:21
Obviously these proteins-- or maybe not so obviously-- all
4:23
these proteins that are part of most cells are produced by
4:27
the genes of that cell.
4:29
So if I draw-- this is the nucleus.
4:32
It's got DNA inside the nucleus.
4:34
This guy has a nucleus.
4:35
It's got DNA inside the nucleus.
4:37
If these guys are both B cells and they're both coming from
4:41
the same germ line, they're coming from the same, I guess,
4:46
ancestry of cells, shouldn't they have the same DNA?
4:57
If they do have the same DNA, why are the proteins that
5:01
they're constructing different?
5:03
How do they change?
5:04
And this is why I find B cells-- and you'll see this is
5:08
also true of T cells-- to be fascinating is, in their
5:11
development, in their hematopoiesis-- that's just
5:17
the development of these lymphocytes.
5:20
At one stage in their development, there's just a
5:22
lot of shuffling of the portion of their DNA that
5:25
codes for here, for these parts of the protein.
5:30
There's just a lot of shuffling that occurs.
5:33
Most of when we talk about DNA, we really want to
5:36
preserve the information, not have a lot of shuffling.
5:38
But when these lymphocytes, when these B cells are
5:42
maturing, at one stage of their maturation or their
5:46
development, there's intentional reshuffling of the
5:50
DNA that codes for this part and this part.
5:52
And that's what leads to all of the diversity in the
5:56
variable portions on these membrane bound
5:58
immunoglobulins.
5:59
And we're about to find out why there's that diversity.
6:02
So there's tons of stuff that can infect your body.
6:07
Viruses are are mutating and evolving and so are bacteria.
6:12
You don't know what's going to enter your body.
6:14
So what the immune system has done through B cells-- and
6:18
we'll also see it through T cells-- it says, hey, let me
6:22
just make a bunch of combinations of these things
6:24
that can essentially bind to whatever I get to.
6:28
So let's say that there's just some new virus
6:33
that shows up, right?
6:34
The world has never seen this virus before this B cell,
6:40
it'll bump into this virus and this virus won't attach.
6:42
Another B cell will bump into this virus
6:44
and it won't attach.
6:45
And maybe several thousands of B cells will bump into this
6:49
virus and it won't attach, but since I have so many B cells
6:52
having so many different combinations of these variable
6:55
portions on these receptors, eventually one of these B
6:59
cells is going to bond.
7:00
Maybe it's this one.
7:06
He's going to bond to part of the surface of this virus.
7:09
It could also be to part of a surface of a new bacteria, or
7:13
part of a surface for some foreign protein.
7:16
And part of the surface that it binds on the bacteria-- so
7:21
maybe it binds on that part of the bacteria-- this is called
7:24
an epitope.
7:28
So once this guy binds to some foreign pathogen-- and
7:33
remember, the other B cells won't-- only the particular
7:35
one that had the particular combination, one of
7:37
the 10 to the 10th.
7:38
And actually, there aren't 10 to the 10th combinations.
7:41
During their development, they weed out all of the
7:43
combinations that would bind to things that are essentially
7:48
you, that there shouldn't be an immune response to.
7:52
So we could say self-responding combinations
8:00
weeded out.
8:02
So there actually aren't 10 to the 10th, 10 billion
8:04
combinations of these-- something smaller than that.
8:06
You have to take out all the combinations that would have
8:08
bound to your own cells, but there's still a super huge
8:12
number of combinations that are very likely to bond, at
8:15
least to some part of some pathogen of some
8:17
virus or some bacteria.
8:19
And as soon as one of these B cells binds, it says, hey
8:22
guys, I'm the lucky guy who happens to fit exactly this
8:26
brand new pathogen.
8:28
He becomes activated after binding to the new pathogen.
8:36
And I'm going to go into more detail in the future.
8:39
In order to really become activated, you normally need
8:43
help from helper T cells, but I don't want to
8:46
confuse you in the video.
8:47
So in this case, I'm going to assume that activation can
8:50
only occur-- or that it just needs to respond, it just
8:54
needs to essentially be triggered by
8:57
binding with the pathogen.
8:59
In most cases, you actually need the
9:00
helper T cells as well.
9:01
And we'll discuss why that's important.
9:03
It's kind of a fail safe mechanism
9:05
for your immune system.
9:07
But once this guy gets activated, he's going to start
9:11
cloning himself.
9:13
He's going to say, look, I'm the guy that can match this
9:17
virus here-- and so he's going to start cloning himself.
9:20
He's going to start dividing and repeating himself.
9:24
So there's just going to be multiple versions of this guy.
9:41
So they all start to replicate and they also differentiate--
9:45
differentiate means they start taking particular roles.
9:48
So there's two forms of differentiation.
9:51
So many, many, many hundreds or thousands of these are
9:54
going to be produced.
9:55
And then some are going to become memory cells, which are
10:01
essentially just B cells that stick around a long time with
10:05
the perfect receptor on them, with the perfect variable
10:09
portion of their receptor on them.
10:21
So some will be memory cells and they're going to be in
10:23
higher quantities than they were originally.
10:25
So if if this guy invades our bodies 10 years in the future,
10:28
they're going to have more of these guys around that are
10:31
more likely to bump into them and start and get activated
10:34
and then some of them are going to turn
10:35
into effector cells.
10:36
And effector cells are generally cells that actually
10:38
do something.
10:44
What the effector cells do is, they turn into antibody-- they
10:50
turn into these effector B cells-- or sometimes they're
10:53
called plasma cells.
10:55
They're going to turn into antibody factories.
11:03
And the antibodies they're going to produce are exactly
11:06
this combination, the date that they originally had being
11:10
membrane bound.
11:12
So they're just going to start producing these antibodies
11:15
that we talk about with the exact-- they're going to start
11:19
spitting out these antibodies.
11:22
They're going to start spitting out tons and tons of
11:24
these proteins that are uniquely able to bind to the
11:28
new pathogen, this new thing in question.
11:35
So an activated effector cell will actually produce 2,000
11:40
antibodies a second.
11:41
So you can imagine, if you have a lot of these, you're
11:43
going to have all of a sudden a lot of antibodies floating
11:46
around in your body and going into the body tissues.
11:49
And the value of that and why this is the humoral system is,
11:52
all of a sudden, you have all of these viruses that are
11:54
infecting your system, but now you're producing all of these
12:01
antibodies.
12:01
The effector cells are these factories and so these
12:05
specific antibodies will start bonding.
12:08
So let me draw it like this.
12:16
The specific antibodies will start bonding to these viruses
12:22
and that has a couple of values to it.
12:28
One is, it essentially tags them for pick up.
12:31
Now phagocytosis-- this is called opsonization.
12:40
When you tag molecules for pickup and you make them
12:42
easier for phagocytes to eat them up, this is what--
12:51
antibodies are attaching and say, hey phagocytes, this is
12:53
going to make it easier.
12:54
You should pick up these guys in particular.
12:56
It also might make these viruses hard to function.
12:59
I have this big thing hanging off the side of it.
13:01
It might be harder for them to infiltrate cells and the other
13:04
thing is, on each of these antibodies you have two
13:09
identical heavy chains and then two
13:13
identical light chains.
13:17
And then they have a very specific variable portion on
13:20
each one and each of these branches can bond to the
13:25
epitope on a virus.
13:29
So you can imagine, what happens if this guy bonds to
13:31
one epitope and this guy bonds to another virus?
13:34
Then all of a sudden, these viruses are kind of glued
13:37
together and that's even more efficient.
13:38
They're not going to be able to do what they normally do.
13:40
They're not going to be able to enter cell membranes and
13:43
they're perfectly tagged.
13:45
They've been opsonized so that phagocytes can come
13:48
and eat them up.
13:49
So we'll talk more about B cells in the future, but I
13:51
just find it fascinating that there are that many
13:53
combinations and they have enough combinations to really
13:56
recognize almost anything that can exist in the fluids of our
14:00
body, but we haven't solved all of the problems yet.
14:02
We haven't solved the problem of what happens when things
14:04
actually infiltrate cells or we have cancer cells?

It's pretty neat, huh?
0:25
Well, it turns out that how we make and use energy is a lot like sports
0:28
or other kinds of exercise.
0:30
It can be hard work and a little bit complicated,
0:32
but if you do it right, it comes with some tremendous payoffs.
0:35
But unlike hitting a ball with a stick, it's so marvelously complicated
0:38
and awesome that we're still unraveling the mysteries of how it all works,
0:41
and it all starts with a marvelous molecule
0:43
that is one of your best friends,
0:45
ATP.
0:46
(energetic music)
0:56
Today, I'm talking about the energy and the process our cells
1:00
and other animals' cells go through to provide themselves with power.
1:03
Cellular respiration is how we derive energy from the food
1:06
that we eat, specifically from glucose
1:08
since most of what we eat ends up as glucose.
1:11
Here's the chemical formula for one molecule of glucose.
1:14
In order to turn this glucose into energy,
1:16
we're going to need to add some oxygen.
1:18
Six molecules of it, to be exact.
1:20
Through cellular respiration, we're going to turn
1:22
that glucose and oxygen into six molecules of CO2,
1:25
six molecules of water, and some energy that we can use
1:29
for doing all of our push-ups.
1:31
So that's all well and good, but here's the thing,
1:33
we can't just use that energy to run a marathon or something.
1:36
First, our bodies have to turn that energy
1:38
into a really specific form of stored energy called ATP
1:43
or adenosine triphosphate.
1:45
You've heard me talk about this before.
1:47
People often refer to ATP as the currency of biological energy.
1:51
Think of it as an American dollar.
1:52
It's what you need to do business in the U.S.
1:55
You can't just walk into a Best Buy with a handful of Chinese yuan
1:59
or Indian rupees and expect to be able to buy anything with them
2:02
even though they technically are money.
2:04
Same goes with energy, in order to be able to use it,
2:06
our cells need energy to be transferred into adenosine triphosphate
2:10
to be able to grow, move, create electrical impulses
2:14
in our nerves and brains, everything.
2:16
A while back, for instance, we talked about how cells use ATP
2:19
to transport some kinds of materials in and out of its membranes.
2:23
To jog your memory about that, you can watch that episode right here.
2:25
Now before we see how ATP is actually put together,
2:28
let's look at how cells can cash in on the energy
2:31
that's stashed in there.
2:32
Well, adenosine triphosphate is made up of a nitrogenous base
2:35
called adenine with a sugar called ribose
2:38
and three phosphate groups attached to it.
2:40
Now one thing you need to know about these three phosphate groups,
2:43
is that they are super uncomfortable sitting together in a row like that,
2:48
like three kids on a bus who hate each other all sharing the same seat.
2:52
So because the phosphate groups are such terrible company for each other,
2:55
ATP is able to do this nifty trick where it shoots one
2:58
of the phosphate groups off the end of the seat,
3:00
creating ADP, or adenosine diphosphate, because now,
3:03
there are just two kids sitting on the bus seat.
3:05
And this reaction when the third jerk kid is kicked off the seat,
3:08
energy is released.
3:10
And since there are a lot of water molecules just floating around nearby,
3:13
an OH pairing, that's called a hydroxide,
3:15
from one of the H2Os comes over and takes the place
3:18
of that third phosphate group, and everybody is much happier.
3:21
By the way, when you use water to break down a compound like this,
3:23
it's called hydrolysis, ""hydro"" from water and ""lysis""
3:26
from the Greek word ""for separate"".
3:28
So now that you know how ATP is spent,
3:30
let's see how it is minted, nice and new, by cellular respiration.
3:35
Like I said, it all starts with oxygen and glucose.
3:37
In fact, textbooks make a point of saying that through cellular respiration,
3:42
one molecule of glucose can yield a bit of heat
3:46
and 38 molecules of ATP.
3:48
Now, it's worth noting that this number is kind of a best-case scenario.
3:51
Usually it's more like 29 or 30 ATPs, but whatever.
3:54
People are still studying this stuff,
3:56
so let's stick with that number, 38.
3:58
Now, cellular respiration isn't something
3:59
that just happens all at once.
4:00
Glucose is transformed into ATPs over three separate stages.
4:04
Glycolysis,
4:05
the Krebs Cycle,
4:06
and the electron transport chain.
4:08
Traditionally, these stages are described as coming one after the other
4:11
but really everything in the cell,
4:13
is kind of happening all at the same time.
4:15
But let's start with the first step, glycolysis,
4:18
or the breaking down of the glucose.
4:21
Glucose, of course, is a sugar, you know this
4:23
because it's got an ""ose"" at the end of it.
4:25
And glycolysis is just the breaking up of glucose's six-carbon ring
4:28
into two three-carbon molecules called pyruvic acids
4:32
or pyruvate molecules.
4:34
Now in order to explain how exactly glycolysis works,
4:36
I'd need about an hour of your time, and a giant cast of finger puppets
4:40
each playing a different enzyme, and though it would pain me to do it,
4:44
I would have to use words like phosphoglucoisomerase,
4:47
but a simple way of explaining it,
4:49
is like this,
4:50
if you wanna make some money,
4:52
you gotta spend some money.
4:53
Glycolysis needs the investment of two ATPs in order to work
4:57
and in the end, it generates four ATPs,
5:00
for a net profit if you will of two ATPs.
5:03
In addition to those four ATPs, glycolysis results in two pyruvates
5:07
and two super energy-rich morsels called NADH,
5:11
which are sort of the love children of a B vitamin called NAD+ pairing
5:15
with energized electrons and a hydrogen to create storehouses of energy
5:20
that will later be tapped to make ATP.
5:22
To help us keep track of all the awesome stuff we're making here,
5:25
let's keep score.
5:27
So far we've created two molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADH,
5:32
which will be used to power more ATP production later.
5:35
Now, a word about oxygen.
5:36
Like I mentioned, oxygen is necessary
5:39
for the overall process of cellular respiration.
5:41
but not every stage of it.
5:43
Glycolysis, for example, can take place without oxygen,
5:46
which makes it an anaerobic process.
5:48
In the absence of oxygen, the pyruvates formed
5:50
through glycolysis gets rerouted into a process called fermentation.
5:55
If there's no oxygen in the cell, it needs more of that NAD+
5:58
to keep the glycolysis going.
6:00
So fermentation frees up some NAD+,
6:02
which happens to create some interesting byproducts.
6:05
For instance, in some organisms, like yeasts,
6:07
the product of fermentation is ethyl alcohol,
6:10
which is the same thing as all of this lovely stuff.
6:14
But luckily for our day-to-day productivity,
6:17
our muscles don't make alcohol when they don't get enough oxygen.
6:21
If that were the case, working out would make us drunk,
6:23
which actually would be pretty awesome but instead of ethyl alcohol,
6:27
they make lactic acid.
6:28
Which is what makes you feel sore after that workout
6:32
that kicked your butt.
6:33
So, your muscles used up all the oxygen they had
6:35
and they had to kick into anaerobic respiration in order
6:37
to get the energy that they needed.
6:39
And so you have all this lactic acid building up
6:42
in your muscle tissues.
6:44
Ha!
6:45
Ah!
6:46
Ah!
6:47
Back to the score.
6:48
Now we've made two molecules of ATP through glycolysis,
6:52
but your cells really need the oxygen in order
6:55
to make the other 30-some molecules that they need.
6:58
That's because the next two stages of cellular respiration,
7:01
the Krebs Cycle and the electron transport chain,
7:03
are both aerobic processes, which means that they require oxygen.
7:09
And so we find ourselves at the next step in cellular respiration.
7:12
After glycolysis, comes the Krebs Cycle.
7:15
So, while glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm or the fluid medium
7:18
within the cell that all the organelles hang out in,
7:20
the Krebs Cycle happens across the inner membrane of the mitochondria,
7:25
which are generally considered the power centers of the cell.
7:28
The Krebs Cycle takes the products of glycolysis.
7:30
Those carbon-rich pyruvates and reworks them
7:33
to create another two ATPs per glucose molecule, plus some energy
7:38
and a couple of other forms, which I'll talk about in a minute.
7:41
Here's how.
7:41
First, one of the pyruvates is oxidized,
7:43
which basically means that it's combined with oxygen.
7:45
One of the carbons off the three-carbon chain bonds
7:48
with an oxygen molecule and leaves the cell as CO2.
7:50
What's left is a two-carbon compound called acetyl coenzyme A
7:54
or acetyl coA.
7:56
Then, another NAD+ comes along, picks up a hydrogen
7:59
and becomes NADH.
8:00
So our two pyruvates create another two molecules
8:03
of NADH to be used later.
8:05
As in glycolysis, and really all life, enzymes are essential here.
8:09
They are the proteins that bring together the stuff
8:12
that needs to react with each other,
8:15
and they bring them together in just the right way.
8:17
These enzymes, for example, bring together a phosphate with an ADP,
8:21
to create another ATP molecule for each pyruvate.
8:24
Enzymes also help join the acetyl coA
8:26
and a four-carbon molecule called oxaloacetic acid.
8:30
I think that's how you pronounce it.
8:32
Together they form a six-carbon molecule called citric acid
8:35
and I'm certain that that's how you pronounce that one
8:38
because yeah, it's the stuff that's in orange juice.
8:40
(lively piano music)
8:46
Fun fact,
8:47
the Krebs Cycle is also known as the Citric Acid Cycle
8:50
because of this very byproduct.
8:52
However, it is usually referred to by the name of the man
8:56
who figured it all out.
8:57
Hans Krebs, an ear, nose, and throat surgeon who fled Nazi Germany
9:02
to teach biochemistry at Cambridge,
9:04
where he discovered this incredibly complex cycle in 1937.
9:08
For being such a total freaking genius,
9:10
he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1953.
9:13
Anyway, the citric acid is then oxidized over a bunch of intricate steps,
9:18
cutting carbons off left and right, to eventually get back to oxaloacetic acid,
9:23
which is what makes the Krebs Cycle
9:26
a cycle.
9:27
And as the carbons get cleaved off the citric acid,
9:29
there are leftovers in the form of CO2 or carbon dioxide,
9:32
which are exhaled by the cell, and eventually by you.
9:37
You and I, as we continue our existence as people,
9:41
are exhaling the products of the Krebs Cycle right now.
9:45
Good Work.
9:46
(breathes out loudly)
9:47
This video, by the way, I'm using a lot of ATP making it.
9:51
Now, each time a carbon comes off of the citric acid,
9:53
some energy is made, but it's not ATP.
9:57
It's stored in a whole different kind of molecular package.
10:00
This is where we go back to NAD+ and its sort of colleague FAD.
10:06
NAD+ and FAD are chummy little enzymes
10:09
that are related to B vitamins.
10:11
Derivatives of Niacin and Riboflavin,
10:12
which you might have seen in the vitamin aisle.
10:14
These B vitamins are good at holding onto high energy electrons
10:18
and keeping that energy until it can get released later
10:21
in the electron transport chain.
10:22
In fact, they're so good at it, that they show up
10:24
in a lot of those high-energy vitamin powders
10:27
that the kids are taking these days.
10:28
NAD+s and FADs are like batteries,
10:31
big awkward batteries that pick up hydrogen and energized electrons
10:35
from each pyruvate, which in effect charges them up.
10:38
The addition of hydrogen turns them into NADH and FADH2, respectively.
10:43
Each pyruvate yields three NADHs and one FADH2 per cycle,
10:49
and since each glucose has been broken down into two pyruvates
10:52
that means each glucose molecule can produce six NADHs and two FADH2s.
10:58
The main purpose of the Krebs Cycle is to make these powerhouses
11:02
for the next and final step, the electron transport chain.
11:06
And now comes the time when your saying, ""Sweet pyruvate sandwiches, Hank,
11:09
""aren't we supposed to be making ATP here?
11:12
""Let's make it happen, Capt'n! What's the holdup?""
11:14
Well friends, your patience is finally paying off
11:16
because when it comes to ATPs,
11:18
the electron transport chain is the real moneymaker.
11:21
In a very efficient cell, it can net a whopping 34 ATPs.
11:26
So, remember all those NADHs and FADH2s we made in the Krebs Cycle?
11:30
Well, their electrons are going to provide the energy
11:33
that will work as a pump along a chain of channel proteins
11:36
across the inner membrane of the mitochondria
11:39
where the Krebs Cycle occurred.
11:40
These proteins will swap these electrons to send hydrogen protons
11:44
from inside the very center of the mitochondria,
11:46
across its inner membrane to the outer compartment of the mitochondria.
11:50
But once they're out, the protons want to get back
11:52
to the other side of the inner membrane,
11:54
because there's a lot of other protons out there
11:57
and as we've learned, nature always tends to seek a nice, peaceful balance
12:02
on either side of a membrane.
12:04
So all of these anxious protons are allowed back in
12:06
through a special protein called ATP synthase.
12:08
And the energy of this proton flow drives this crazy spinning mechanism
12:12
that squeezes some ADP and some phosphates together to form ATP.
12:17
So, the electrons from the 10 NADHs that come out of the Krebs Cycle,
12:20
have just enough energy to produce roughly three ATPs each.
12:25
And we can't forget our friends the FADH2s.
12:27
We have two of them and they make two ATPs each.
12:30
And voila!
12:31
That is how animal cells, the world over,
12:34
make ATP through cellular respiration.
12:36
Now just to check, let's reset our ATP counter
12:39
and do the math for a single glucose molecule once again.
12:41
We made two ATPs for each pyruvate during glycolysis.
12:45
We made two during the Krebs Cycle,
12:47
and then during the electron transport chain we made about 34.
12:51
And that is just for one molecule of glucose.

Let's say I've got a rope.
0:03
That's my rope.
0:04
And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to take the left end
0:07
of the rope, and I'm going to jerk it up,
0:08
and then back down.
0:10
And we're going to talk about what happens or what possibly
0:13
gets formed.
0:14
So if I take it up over here, it's going to, obviously, take
0:19
the string to the right of it up with it.
0:21
And the string is going to look something like this.
0:24
It's going to look something like that.
0:26
Now I'm going to immediately jerk it back down.
0:29
And as it passes, let's see what the rope will look like
0:31
when the left-hand point is at its original position again.
0:35
So the left-hand point-- I've pulled it back down.
0:37
But in the last time period, this part of the rope had some
0:41
type of an upward velocity.
0:43
You could imagine that way.
0:44
And even after that point, even though this left-hand
0:48
point starts getting pulled down, this point right here
0:53
still has some upward momentum.
0:55
So it's still going to keep moving up, maybe at a slower
0:57
pace because it's starting to be tugged down by
0:59
the rope on its left.
1:00
So it's going to look something like that.
1:02
And it's going to bring the rope to its right with it.
1:05
So the rope will look something like this.
1:08
The rope might look something like that.
1:10
And then I'm going to take this guy-- this was just an
1:13
intermediate position on the way to being pulled all the
1:16
way down here.
1:24
So what's the rope going to look like now?
1:26
Well.
1:27
This guy, he had some momentum that got him there.
1:30
But then all of that velocity will essentially go to zero
1:33
because he's being tugged by the rope to the left.
1:35
And now, he's going to switch directions.
1:37
And he will have gotten here, at that point.
1:40
The point on the line that was here-- on the purple period of
1:45
time-- it had some upward momentum.
1:47
So it's just going to keep going, on maybe a slower pace.
1:50
It'll be there and it will bring the rest of the rope to
1:52
the right of it with it.
1:53
So now my rope is going to look something like this.
1:58
And then finally, where I'm going to jerk the rope back to
2:01
its original position-- so this left-hand point is going
2:03
to be there.
2:06
This guy, in the previous time period,
2:09
was moving down rapidly.
2:11
So he might get there ready to switch directions again.
2:13
This guy will start moving down.
2:15
This guy, right here, he had some upward momentum.
2:19
So he's going to be up in this position now.
2:21
And he's going to be ready to switch directions.
2:23
So finally, when I've done this whole cycle, when I've
2:25
moved up, down and back there again, my rope might look
2:29
exactly like this.
2:32
And I could let go of the rope.
2:33
I could just leave this little left point right there.
2:38
And this the lump is going to propagate along the rope.
2:41
Because in the next moment of time, what's it
2:42
going to look like?
2:44
This guy is going to be pulled up by this left-hand point.
2:47
So he'll go back to his resting position.
2:50
This guy's being pulled down right here by the part of the
2:53
rope to the left of him, so he's going to be pulled down.
2:56
This guy's being pulled down.
2:58
But this guy had some upward momentum in the time period
3:01
before, so he will have moved up.
3:03
And so, the very next time period, my rope is going to
3:06
look something like this.
3:13
And this disturbance in the rope, if I do nothing else,
3:16
and if I don't lose energy to heat and friction and all
3:19
that, it'll just continue moving down the rope.
3:22
If I look at the rope at some future period in time, maybe
3:25
not that far down, the rope will look something like this.
3:29
And if I were to keep watching it, I'll see this disturbance.
3:32
I keep using the word disturbance, because there's
3:34
really no better word to use for it.
3:37
I'll see this disturbance or perturbation, or whatever you
3:40
want to call it, moving along the rope.
3:43
When we think about what a wave is, we essentially-- I
3:47
kind of jumped the gun-- I keep calling this is a
3:49
disturbance, because I didn't want to use the word, wave. I
3:51
want to say, well what really is a wave?
3:53
And a wave really is just this disturbance that's propagating
3:57
down the rope.
3:59
So this is a good time to actually define a wave. A
4:02
wave. Because once I define it, I can start calling this a
4:05
wave, as opposed to a disturbance
4:07
propagating down the rope.
4:09
So a wave is a disturbance propagating through space.
4:24
And you might see other definitions of a wave. One of
4:27
the most typical ones is energy or a disturbance
4:32
propagating energy through a medium.
4:35
And when they say medium, it's what is
4:36
the wave going through?
4:37
So in this example, the rope would be our medium.
4:42
But the reason why I don't want to use that definition of
4:46
a wave is because in future videos, we'll learn about
4:49
electromagnetic waves and those don't propagate through
4:52
any medium.
4:53
They propagate through a vacuum.
4:55
So to keep things as general as possible, we'll just call
4:58
it a disturbance that propagates through space.
5:01
And it usually transfers energy.
5:17
What do I mean by transferring energy?
5:19
On this left hand part of the rope, I gave a
5:21
little energy the rope.
5:22
I moved it up, down, and then back again.
5:25
And then after I did that, that up, down, back again is
5:28
happening successively to every point to the
5:30
right on the rope.
5:31
So if I waited long enough, at this point on the rope right
5:34
here, it's going to move up, down, and then back again.
5:38
Exactly what I did over here is going to happen to this
5:41
point on the rope.
5:41
And then later on, it's going to happen to some other future
5:43
point on the rope.
5:44
So that energy that I originally put on the
5:46
left-hand side of the rope is being
5:48
transferred down the rope.
5:49
If I had some type of object here sitting on the rope,
5:54
maybe when the wave-- when the disturbance- passes by it,
5:59
this thing could get flipped into the air; it might get
6:01
pushed into the air, and go into a
6:03
higher potential energy.
6:05
So this disturbance is transferring
6:08
energy in this case.
6:10
Now, what I've drawn here isn't the only type of wave
6:13
you can have. I mean my definition is fairly general.
6:16
But the definition is more general than just what I've
6:19
drawn here.
6:20
For example, you could have a sound wave. If you just look
6:28
at all of the molecules of the air, they have some density
6:33
that looks something like that.
6:35
And now let's say I had some type of a membrane-- maybe
6:38
it's a speaker-- that jolts this
6:41
left-hand side of the air.
6:42
So it just pushes-- so let me see if I can draw this.
6:46
Let's say I had some type of surface here that just really
6:52
quickly jolts-- that just moves it in that direction,
6:55
and then just comes back.
6:56
So similar to what I did here, I go up and down.
6:58
But instead of doing that, it just pushes the air and then
7:01
pushes back.
7:02
So what's going to happen?
7:03
Right after it pushes it, the air molecules that it pushes
7:06
up against are going to jam together.
7:08
They're going to get compressed.
7:11
Right here, all these air molecules that were right on
7:13
the surface, they're going to get pushed next to all these
7:15
air molecules that are right there.
7:17
And then when it pushes back, or when the membrane goes
7:20
back, you're going to have fewer air molecules here,
7:23
because you're going to have a low density here.
7:25
And then these guys, that are all scrunched up together,
7:28
they're going to want to get away from each other.
7:29
They might even run into each other.
7:31
And so these guys are going to run into those guys, who are
7:34
going to run into the next guys.
7:35
And so on and so forth.
7:37
And after these guys bump into those guys, those guys are
7:39
going to go back to where they were.
7:41
So essentially, you're going to have this disturbance
7:43
that's going to be a set of molecules compressing, or
7:48
bumping into, its neighboring molecules.
7:50
So if you look at this at some future period in time, all of
7:54
a sudden, this area might look normal.
7:57
Let me clear it and draw it just the way it I started.
8:01
So this area might look normal.
8:06
But that compression of the particles might have reached
8:09
right over here.
8:15
And not only that, we saw that right after the compression,
8:17
you usually have this area of low pressure.
8:20
So if I were to really draw this wave, and actually, if
8:24
this membrane were to keep doing it over, and over, and
8:27
over again-- so it kept going forward and back, forward and
8:30
back, or right and left, right and left-- what you would have
8:32
is a series of compressions.
8:34
The air would just have a series of compressions.
8:36
So that's one compression.
8:38
You'd have another compression right there.
8:41
Another compression right there.
8:44
And then, in between the compressions
8:45
the air is less dense.
8:47
The air is less dense like this.
8:50
And what we've essentially just generated is a sound wave
8:53
travelling through air.
8:55
So this right here is a sound wave. And this type of wave,
9:02
where the direction of the disturbance is the same, or
9:06
along the same axis as the direction in which the wave is
9:09
travelling-- the wave is travelling in that direction--
9:12
this is call a longitudinal wave. So sound waves sound
9:16
through air, they're longitudinal waves.
9:23
Sometimes called a compression wave. Same thing.
9:28
Compression wave. Because it's caused by compression.
9:31
Our example of the string, this is called a transverse
9:35
wave. Because the disturbance, the movement of the medium, is
9:44
going in a direction transverse to-- or at an axis
9:48
that's transverse to-- the direction of our movement.
9:50
We're moving in that direction, to the right.
9:53
Actually, our wave is moving to the right, but the actual
9:56
medium is moving up and down.
9:58
Our medium is moving up and down.
10:00
That's why this is called transverse.
10:02
While here the medium is moving left and right while
10:05
the wave moves to the right.
10:06
So it's along the same axis.
10:08
So we're dealing with the compressional or longitudinal.
10:11
Now in this first example, I just did one cycle.
10:14
I just jerked up, down, and back again.
10:18
And I created this one disturbance.
10:20
And we can call this, when you just do it once, you can view
10:23
this as a wave pulse.
10:26
If I kept doing that-- if I just went up, down, back
10:29
again, up, down, back again, and I kept doing it
10:31
periodically, over and over again, then I would generate a
10:34
periodic wave. And my string would look
10:37
something like this.
10:43
Well actually, it would look something that right there,
10:50
where that's the disturbance generated from our first time
10:54
that we moved this left-hand part of our string.
10:59
So this right here is a periodic wave.
11:03
In the next video, we're going to talk about a lot of the
11:05
properties of a periodic wave. How the wavelength, and its
11:09
frequency, and its period relate to its velocity, and
11:12
all of that.
11:13
But I'll leave that alone in this video.
11:14
But I just wanted you to appreciate what I think is a
11:17
concept that we use in everyday life.
11:20
So it's a wave, it's a sound wave, and all that.
11:22
But it's a fairly abstract notion where we talk about a
11:24
wave, we're really just pointing to a disturbance
11:27
that's moving, usually along a medium, at least when we
11:30
visualize it, but not always.
11:32
But we're just pointing to this disturbance.
11:34
And this disturbance could take many forms. It could be a
11:37
transverse disturbance if we're dealing with a string.
11:39
It could be a disturbance in terms of the density of air
11:44
molecules in terms of a sound wave. And there is a relation.
11:47
So if you wanted to just plot the density here by position--
11:53
if I were to mathematically represent this compression
11:55
wave right here-- let's say that this line represents just
11:59
resting before the sound wave hits, that's
12:02
just your normal density.
12:03
If we were to plot the density it might look
12:05
something like this.
12:07
Over here, we have very high density.
12:08
Over here, we have very low density.
12:10
Over here, we have very high density.
12:11
And if you were to plot it, it would look a lot like that
12:15
transverse wave that I did with the rope at the beginning
12:21
of this video.
12:21
And that's why they're even grouped together.
12:23
Because mathematically, even though a compression wave
12:26
looks very different, or you might visualize or
12:29
conceptualize it very different than a transverse
12:31
wave, mathematically, they're essentially the same thing.
12:34
You have this quantity.
12:35
In this case, it's the density of the air varying over time.
12:39
In this case, it's the height, or the position, or how much
12:43
your displacement from your resting position-- that's the
12:45
quantity varying through time, that disruption is travelling
12:50
over the course of the medium.
12:51
That's why we call both of these things waves.
12:54
Anyway, I'll let you go here.
12:56
And in the next video, we'll talk a little bit more of the
12:58
properties of periodic waves.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,c38H6UKt3_I,

- [Instructor] In this video, we're going to look
0:01
at how to determine if a reaction proceeds
0:04
via an S N 1 or an S N 2 mechanism
0:07
and also how to draw the product or products
0:10
for those reactions.
0:11
To help us, we're gonna look
0:12
at this S N 1 versus S N 2 summary
0:15
and the first thing that we're going to look at
0:17
is the structure of our substrate.
0:20
For example, for this reaction down here,
0:23
we have a primary alkyl halides, a primary substrate,
0:27
so we need to think about an S N 2 reaction
0:30
which requires decreased steric hindrance
0:32
and that's what we have with a primary alkyl halide.
0:36
From an earlier video, we know that an S N 2 mechanism
0:39
has our nucleophile attack at the same time
0:41
that we get loss of a leaving group.
0:43
And for this reaction,
0:45
our nucleophile must be our solvent here, which is ethanol.
0:48
So, our nucleophile is going to attack
0:51
and the oxygen is gonna form a bond with this carbon
0:54
which I'll go ahead and highlight in red.
0:58
So our nucleophile attacks,
0:59
at the same time, we get loss of leaving group.
1:01
These electrons come off to form the iodide anion
1:04
which is an excellent leaving group.
1:07
Let's draw what we would form.
1:09
Let's sketch in our carbon chain here
1:12
and we know that a bond forms
1:14
between the oxygen and the carbon in red,
1:17
so the carbon in red is this carbon
1:20
and let's make these electrons magenta.
1:23
So those electrons form a bond
1:25
between the oxygen and the carbon in red.
1:28
The oxygen is still attached to this ethyl group here,
1:31
so let's draw in those two carbons.
1:34
And the oxygen is still bonded to this hydrogen.
1:37
So let's put in this hydrogen.
1:39
We still have a lone pair of electrons left on this oxygen,
1:42
so I'll put in that lone pair right here.
1:44
And that gives us a plus one formal charge on the oxygen.
1:49
Next, we need to make a neutral molecule for our product,
1:53
so we need to have another molecule of ethanol come along,
1:57
so let's draw that in here.
1:58
So, ethanol is our solvent.
2:01
And this time, the ethanol molecule
2:02
is going to function as a base.
2:05
We need to take this proton here
2:08
and these electrons are left behind on the oxygen.
2:12
Let's draw our final product.
2:14
We sketch in our carbon chain.
2:17
We have our oxygen.
2:19
We have these two carbons.
2:21
And now we have two lone pairs of electrons on this oxygen.
2:25
Let's make these electrons blue.
2:28
So, our second step is an acid-base reaction
2:31
where we take a proton
2:32
and these are, these electrons in blue here,
2:35
to form our final product which is an ether.
2:39
Notice we don't have to worry about any stereochemistry
2:42
for our final product.
2:43
We don't have any chiral centers to worry about.
2:47
Let's look at another reaction.
2:49
For this reaction,
2:50
we're starting with a secondary alkyl halides.
2:53
If I look at my summary over here
2:55
with a secondary substrate,
2:57
we could have either an S N 2 mechanism
2:59
or an S N 1 mechanism,
3:01
so we need to look at a few more things.
3:04
First, let's look at the nucleophile.
3:06
This is N a plus and SH minus,
3:09
so let me draw in the SH minus here
3:11
which that is going to be our nucleophile
3:14
and that's a strong nucleophile.
3:16
A negative charge on a sulfur
3:18
would make a strong nucleophile.
3:20
And for our solvent, we saw in an earlier video,
3:23
DMSO is a polar A product solvent
3:26
which favors an S N 2 reaction.
3:29
So with a strong nucleophile and a polar A product solvent,
3:34
we need to think about in S N 2 mechanism.
3:38
So we know our nucleophile attacks
3:40
at the same time that we get loss of our leaving group,
3:43
so our nucleophile is going to attack this carbon.
3:46
So again, I'll make this carbon red.
3:48
At the same time that we get loss of leaving groups,
3:51
so these electrons are gonna come off onto the bromine
3:53
to form the bromide anion.
3:55
For this reaction, we need to think about
3:57
the stereochemistry of our S N 2 reaction.
4:00
Our nucleophile has to attack from the opposite side
4:03
of our leaving group,
4:05
so we get inversion of configuration.
4:08
So if we have a chiral center, we have to worry
4:10
about our stereochemistry for this reaction.
4:13
So we have the bromine on a wedge,
4:14
so drawing the final product here,
4:16
we need to have the SH going away from us in space,
4:19
so we put that on a dash.
4:22
Again, we saw details about this in an earlier video.
4:25
So we get inversion of configuration
4:28
for this S N 2 reaction.
4:32
First, let's look at our alkyl halides.
4:34
The carbon that's bonded to our bromine
4:36
is bonded to two other carbon.
4:38
So, this is a secondary alkyl halide.
4:41
And so we know we could have either S N 1 or S N 2.
4:44
We need to look at the nucleophile and the solvent next
4:47
to decide which mechanism it is.
4:50
Our nucleophile will be formic acid
4:52
which is a weak nucleophile
4:54
and water is a polar product solvent.
4:57
So we know that these two things
4:59
favor an S N 1 type mechanism.
5:02
The polar product solvent water
5:04
can stabilize the carbocation that would result.
5:08
So the first step should be loss of our leaving group
5:11
to form our carbocations.
5:13
These electrons come off onto our bromine
5:15
to form the bromide ion
5:17
and we're taking a bond away from this carbon in red.
5:20
So the carbon in red
5:21
is gonna have a plus one formal charge.
5:24
Let's draw our carbocations.
5:27
Let me put in this ring here with our pi electrons.
5:30
And then let me highlight our carbon in red.
5:34
The carbon in red is this one.
5:36
So that should get a plus one formal charge.
5:39
And let me highlight the other carbon over here.
5:42
So this carbon in magenta, I moved it up to here
5:45
to make it easier to see the mechanism.
5:48
So this is our secondary carbocation,
5:51
but this is actually a benzylic carbocation
5:53
which makes it even more stable
5:55
than we would normally expect.
5:57
The pi electrons in the ring
5:59
can actually provide us with other resonant structures
6:01
to stabilize this positive charge.
6:03
So I don't have the time or the space to show that here,
6:07
but we have our secondary benzylic carbocation
6:09
which will be our electrophile
6:12
and our next step is to have our nucleophile
6:14
attack our electrophile
6:16
and our nucleophile is formic acid here.
6:20
We have two oxygens in formic acid
6:22
and one of them is more nucleophilic than the other,
6:25
so it turns out that this carbonyl oxygen
6:28
is more nucleophilic than this oxygen down here
6:32
and we'll go into more detail in a couple of minutes,
6:35
but for right now, let's show our nucleophile
6:37
attacking our electrophile.
6:39
So, a lone pair of electrons on our oxygen
6:41
are gonna form a bond with this carbon in red.
6:44
So let's draw the result of our nucleophilic attack.
6:48
We have our benzene ring,
6:50
so I'll draw that in here
6:52
and our carbon in red is this one.
6:57
And let's highlight the electrons on our oxygen.
7:00
So, this lone pair of electrons in blue
7:03
forms a bonds with our carbon in red.
7:06
So now, let's draw in our oxygen.
7:09
Our oxygen still has a lone pair of electrons on it
7:12
and our oxygen is double bonded to a carbon
7:14
which is bonded to a hydrogen.
7:16
And on the right, we have our oxygen and a hydrogen.
7:20
Now we have a plus one formal charge on our oxygen.
7:24
So this oxygen has a plus one formal charge.
7:27
And this product is resonance stabilized,
7:31
so we can move in a lone pair of electrons here
7:33
and push these electrons off onto our oxygen.
7:36
And let's go ahead and show the results of that.
7:39
So we'll put in our resonance brackets here
7:41
and our resonance arrow.
7:43
So we have our benzene ring,
7:46
so let's draw that in.
7:48
And we have our carbons.
7:50
We have a bond to this oxygen
7:53
and I'll drawn on that lone pair of electrons
7:55
on the top oxygen here.
7:57
Should only be one bond now to this carbon.
7:59
I'll put in my hydrogen,
8:01
and now actually, we have a double bond over here.
8:04
Let me draw everything in.
8:06
And let me show the movement of electrons.
8:10
So first, let's start with these electrons
8:12
which I will make magenta.
8:14
Those electrons moved into here to form a double bond.
8:18
And then let's highlight these electrons here in red.
8:22
So these electrons came off onto our oxygen right here.
8:26
And now, we have a plus one formal charge on this oxygen.
8:30
So the product of nucleophilic attack
8:33
by the carbonyl oxygen is resonance stabilized.
8:37
And then to go to our product,
8:39
just think about a base coming along, something like water,
8:42
and we could take this proton
8:45
and then these electrons would be left behind.
8:49
These electrons would be left behind on that oxygen.
8:51
So let's draw in our product.
8:53
We would have a benzene ring.
8:55
So here's our benzene ring.
8:57
We would have an oxygen here.
9:01
And then we would have our carbonyl
9:05
and then our hydrogen.
9:07
So this oxygen has two lone pairs of electrons
9:10
and so does this one.
9:13
So we could highlight some of those electrons.
9:15
Let me make them green.
9:16
So these electrons in green here came off onto this oxygen
9:21
and that gives us our product.
9:24
Notice that in our products,
9:25
we have a chiral center.
9:27
So this carbon right here is a chiral center.
9:30
We have four different groups attached to it.
9:32
So we would expect to get a racemic mixture.
9:35
We should get both in the enatiomers here
9:37
because remember, going back to our carbocation,
9:40
this carbocation is planer
9:42
and our nucleophile can attack from either sides.
9:46
If you're wondering why this oxygen
9:48
is not as nucleophilic as the carbonyl oxygen,
9:51
let's show the result of what would happen
9:53
if this oxygen attacked our positively charged carbon.
9:57
Let me draw in our benzene ring.
10:00
Let's sketch that in.
10:02
And we would form a bond between the oxygen and,
10:06
let me highlight our carbon which I made red below,
10:08
so this is our carbon in red.
10:10
And I'm gonna show this lone pair of electrons
10:13
forming a bond with that carbon.
10:16
So, that's bonded to this oxygen
10:18
and the oxygen is bonded to our carbonyl
10:22
which is bonded to our hydrogen.
10:24
And our oxygen still has a hydrogen on it
10:26
and a lone pair of electrons.
10:28
So there's still a hydrogen on it
10:30
and there's still a lone pair of electrons
10:32
which gives this oxygen a plus one formal charge.
10:36
Notice this positively charged oxygen
10:39
is right next to this carbonyl carbon
10:42
and we know that this carbonyl carbon is partially positive
10:46
because this carbonyl oxygen
10:47
withdraws electron density from it.
10:50
So you have a positively charged oxygen
10:53
next to a partially positively charged carbon
10:56
and we know that like charges repel.
10:58
So having these two positive charges next to each other
11:02
would destabilized this structure.
11:05
And so that's the reason why
11:06
this oxygen is not the nucleophile.
11:10
The carbonyl oxygen is.
11:14
Let's look at one final example.
11:16
So for this alkyl halide,
11:17
this is a tertiary alkyl halide
11:20
and a tertiary substrate means,
11:22
think about an S N 1 mechanism.
11:25
So our first step here would be loss of a leaving group.
11:28
These electrons come off to form the iodide anion
11:30
and we're taking a bond away from this carbon in red
11:33
to form a carbocation.
11:36
Let's get some more room.
11:36
Let's go down here
11:38
and let's draw our carbocation.
11:40
So we have a six-membered ring,
11:43
so let me draw in our six-membered ring here.
11:46
And our carbon in red is this carbon,
11:50
so that carbon gets a plus one formal charge.
11:54
We have a tertiary carbocation
11:56
which is relatively stable for a carbocation.
11:59
And in our next step,
11:59
our nucleophile attacks our electrophile
12:02
and our nucleophile is our solvent, which is methanol.
12:06
So our nucleophile is going to attack our electrophile.
12:09
Our oxygen is gonna form a bond with this carbon in red.
12:13
So let's draw the results of our nucleophilic attack.
12:17
I'll put in this ring here,
12:19
move the methyl group over to make room for the oxygen.
12:22
So here's that oxygen.
12:24
Let's highlight the carbon in red.
12:26
And let's also highlight some electrons.
12:29
So, these electrons in magenta form the bond
12:32
between the oxygen and the carbon in red.
12:34
The oxygen is still bonded to a hydrogen and a methyl group,
12:38
so let's put those in.
12:39
So here is our hydrogen
12:41
and here is our methyl group.
12:44
We still have a lone pair of electrons on the oxygen,
12:47
so let's put in that lone pair of electrons
12:49
and that gives the oxygen a plus one formal charge.
12:54
To get to our product,
12:55
we need a neutral product,
12:57
so another another molecule of methanol comes along
13:01
but this time, instead of acting like a nucleophile,
13:03
it's gonna act as a base and take off that proton.
13:07
So here is our molecule of methanol
13:10
and we're gonna take this proton
13:12
and leave these electrons behind on the oxygen.
13:16
So let's draw in our final product up here.
13:19
So, here is our ring
13:21
and let's move up a little bit.
13:23
So, let's move up.
13:24
In our ring, we have this methyl group here
13:27
and we have our oxygen
13:29
and another methyl group,
13:30
two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen.
13:33
Let's show those electrons.
13:35
These electrons in here in blue
13:38
come off onto the oxygen to form our final product.
13:42
Notice that for our final product,
13:44
we don't have any chiral centers to worry about,
13:47
so we don't need to worry
13:48
about specifying any stereochemistry.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,wCspf85eQQo,

0:01
This is Sal here and I'm at Stanford Medical School with Dr. Andy Connelly.
0:05
Hi there Sal, I'm here to discuss with you histology today.
0:10
Histology! And, and forgive me, for what is probably a simple question, but what is histology?
0:14
So it will be the -ology, the study of, in this case the histo-, means tissues.
0:20
We're going to be looking up the cellular components of organs.
0:28
Cool... yeah.
0:29
So what we're going to be looking at today is the histology of the colon.
0:32
And so for the colon we often have colon specimens coming in from pathology.
0:39
And so the colon, like you were saying before, is the large intestine.
0:45
So if you have this piece of large intestine, and its removed from the patient because there is an area
0:53
of cancer.
0:54
It might be cancer, they're actually pretty good now about doing colonoscopy.
1:01
Looking from the inside--
1:03
They'll often have looked inside think it looks like cancer
1:09
take a little piece and send it to us before hand, and then they remove it.
1:12
And the reason why they want to send it to you is
1:15
even if they know its cancer how severe is this cancer?
1:18
How severe is the cancer? They also want to get a really good tissue diagnosis
1:22
to make sure if they're going to go remove a piece of your colon, that they really know that its cancer
1:28
rather than it just looks like cancer.
1:30
So its the definitive proof before they remove it.
1:32
So then if this is the cancer that's removed they clearly want to be able to check the margins
1:38
to make sure its removed in its entirety.
1:41
But often inside of there, they'll find other pieces of tissues, like here's a polyp
1:46
And when we say check the margins, this is literally, just making sure
1:50
you've covered enough material so that you've gotten all the cancer in it
1:53
that you're not kind of cutting through the cancer and that you've missed something.
1:56
That's right, because this is actually one of the traditional
1:58
surgical cures of cut it out to cure.
2:01
Colon cancer, that tends to still be the case.
2:04
Because you cut it out to make sure you cure it.
2:07
There are many other kinds of cancers that which spread so widely early on
2:09
that you don't usually cut out.
2:12
So then the polyp can be found in a piece of colon removed
2:17
a polyp is something that just sticks up.
2:20
Any tissue that sticks up. It's not necessarily cancer.
2:23
No, so for instance another common place you hear about is
2:28
some people in the sinuses might have sinus trouble
2:30
and they'll have a sinus polyp
2:32
those are almost always just inflamed.
2:34
And then we'll find areas in which it's just the lining
2:40
that's been roughened, and we'll take sections of those.
2:43
And that can happen from just someone being allergic to food
2:46
Yeah, irritations of such.
2:48
Yes, irritations of certain sites.
2:51
So we're going to have the areas where its kind of irritated
2:54
some in which there's a polyp sticking out
2:56
and we'll look at it under a microscope
2:59
and then that's the thing that we're mainly worried about
3:02
So that's what we're going to cover in the slides
3:06
that we look at today.
3:08
So this first one we're looking at is an example of
3:11
a normal margin
3:12
And so it's from a little piece
3:14
from the edge
3:16
So they actually call the tissue margin?
3:18
Yeah, tissue margin
3:20
Normal tissue.
3:21
So this is the edge of the specimen, and [the surgeons will] say, ""Is the margin clear?""
3:25
Dr: In this case this is an example where the margin IS clear.
3:29
This is normal-looking colon.
3:30
S: This is a cross-section, crossing the boundary of the colon,
3:34
this area at the top right here, would be the inside of the colon, where the poop is...
3:43
Dr: Doctors say stool. That's the stool in the middle, and the supportive tissue is underneath.
3:51
S: Part of the structural tissue of the tube?
3:53
Dr: Right. Now let's drive around the slide.
3:59
This is a virtual slide where we took the typical glass microscope slide, and put it in a special
4:04
machine which took lots and lots of photographs at high power, then stitched them all together
4:09
as one massive image. So that allows you to zoom in and look around.
4:13
S: To let me get my own bearings, this polyp...
4:16
Dr: No, this is just regular tissue--a little bit of a fold, not a polyp.
4:20
S: So how large is this, about a centimeter?
4:25
Dr: About like that. If I had to guess, about 5-6mm.
4:31
So, now to drive around, these are the controls for zooming in and out.
4:43
So I can look at something more closely, and this is the mucosa.
4:55
S: Mucosa. Sounds very similar to mucus.
4:57
Dr: Right. The mucosa is the lining that makes the mucus, it's the slimy part.
5:03
S: This white stuff up here?
5:07
Dr: This suff is the slimy mucus. So, it keeps the insides from drying out--
5:16
because it's a very hydrated gel. It also means that things can glide along without
5:21
abrading the surface. When you look at it, it has architecture in which
5:25
these glands, they're like test-tubes sticking down, and the purpose is to increase the surface area.
5:36
S: And the term gland, is any structure containing fluid and releases the fluid?
5:42
Dr: A gland is an epithelial structure, so it's made of cells that are packed tightly,
5:49
and the cells have a top and a bottom, and they're formed into some sort of enfolding
5:54
or structure, so that there is a middle and an outside.
5:57
S: When we say something is epithelial, it's the stuff facing the outside world?
6:04
Dr: Yes. The epithelium is a special class of cells in which they are facing the outside world,
6:09
again, tightly packed, and there's a top and a bottom.
6:13
S: And even though to a layperson this area right here does not seem like the outside world,
6:19
it seems like it's inside of you, we're kind of like big donuts.
6:21
Dr: That's right. And the colonoscopist proves that it's connected to the outside world.
6:27
S: MUAHAHA!! I guess they do prove that! XD
6:29
Dr: So that's still the outside world. This is the architecture where you have enfoldings to increase
6:40
the surface area. And it's creating this mucus.
6:42
Let me look at the highest power. Look at these cells! When we look at these cells,
6:50
there are two main types of cells. There's this one here, which is the goblet cell.
6:56
S: Goblet cell. It's not just this white part, it goes all the way down there?
7:05
Dr: Yeah...let me have that pen! It has a top like that, and you see this wine glass?
7:13
S: It's literally shaped like a goblet! I was circling the wrong handle.
7:20
Dr: That nucleus belonged to some other cell.
7:23
What's next to it is these thin cells here, which do not have all the mucus inside of them.
7:32
These guys are the tall ones.
7:35
S: Where you see only the nucleus? The white part is just the mucus inside the cell.
7:39
Dr: Yes. Mucus is the term for either the overall structure or the material that is elaborated up here,
7:52
chemically it is called mucin, and mucin is almost like that goo runners eat,
7:59
it is just a lot of sugar holding a lot of water.
8:02
S: I see. I guess it would be bad branding to call it Mucus-In-A-Bag. MUAHAHA!! >:-}
8:08
Dr: Exactly! So they stick with ""goo"". But this one has a lot of sugar, takes in lots of water,
8:13
that is released and it forms this surface here.
8:16
S: To let stuff flow by.
8:19
Dr: What the other cell does is the other main thing in addition to letting things flow through,
8:23
is to absorb water. So the idea is you do not want to release the 2L of fluid you have
8:29
around every one of your meals. You want to get a lot of that back.
8:32
S: That's one of the main functions of the large intestine?
8:35
Dr: It is. It is a consolidation process to the stool. So you're going to absorb a lot of water
8:38
and doing it through these cells.
8:44
S: The mucin comes out here, and the water absorbed by parts without mucin, so right there.
8:54
Dr: Yupperz. That's right. The two main functions of the colon are right there with those two cells.
9:02
S: To get a perspective of where we are, the whole thing is about .5cm, what's our scale here?
9:13
Dr: Our favorite scale-bar here is to look for blood vessels, for red blood cells,
9:26
One right there, is 7micro- m in diameter.
9:30
S: 7micro-m. A micrometer is a millionth of a meter, or 1/1000th of 1mm.
9:36
Dr: That's right. Let's round off to 1/100th of 1mm.
9:41
S: You put 100 of these next to each other you get 1mm. So 1mm would be bigger than our entire screen.
9:47
Dr: Right. You see with these glands, 1mm would be this span, which we're saying is about like that,
9:54
That's why from here to here it might be about 7mm.
9:57
Dr: RBCs are found in just about every microscopic field, and they're always 7micro-m.
10:03
When looking here, this is very well formed. You can see these tubular glands,
10:16
just a hint over here, because they are like test-tubes, sometimes they're not going straight up and
10:20
down, sometimes they look a little on an angle...
10:22
S: They actually are reaching the surface, we just don't see it based on the way it's cut?
10:28
So this one right here, it was cut at an angle, so it looks embedded there in 2D,
10:34
but in 3D we would see a full tube.
10:37
Dr: Just to go back to the microscopy, we're seeing this because it's only 4microns thick,
10:43
and we're sending light through this tissue.
10:48
So that's why you can get a cross-section that doesn't show you 3D. Very much 2D.
10:53
S: Cool! So this is what a healthy margin tissue would look like?
11:03
Dr: Yes, this is a healthy colon, so you would thankfully say on the proximal margin,
11:08
which is up more towards the mouth, that's clear. You take another section like this from the distal
11:13
margin, more towards the end, and you say that's clear, so that means they removed the cancer.
11:17
S: When you say proximal margin is close to the mouth,
11:20
you're saying the mouth of that cut of the tube, not mouth of the person.
11:27
Dr: That's right. So the proximal and distal margins are clear, if they look like this.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,fif5ghe8JM0,

Let's imagine we have a huge cloud
0:02
of hydrogen atoms floating in space.
0:05
Huge, and when I say huge cloud, huge both in distance
0:08
and in mass.
0:09
If you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,
0:11
it would just be this really, really massive thing.
0:15
So you have this huge cloud.
0:16
Well, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually
0:20
attracted to each other.
0:21
It's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.
0:25
But it would slowly affect these atoms.
0:27
And they would slowly draw close to each other.
0:30
It would slowly condense.
0:31
They'd slowly move towards the center
0:34
of mass of all of the atoms.
0:37
They'd slowly move in.
0:39
So if we fast forward, this cloud's
0:42
going to get denser and denser.
0:46
And the hydrogen atoms are going to start
0:48
bumping into each other and rubbing up against each other
0:51
and interacting with each other.
0:53
And so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.
0:56
Now remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.
0:58
So the temperature is going up.
1:03
And it'll-- they'll keep condensing.
1:05
They'll just keep condensing and condensing
1:07
until something really interesting happens.
1:09
So let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here
1:12
in the center.
1:16
And there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.
1:19
It's really dense.
1:20
I could never draw the actual number of atoms here.
1:22
This is really to give you an idea.
1:24
There's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,
1:28
from everything that wants to get
1:29
to that center of mass of our entire cloud.
1:32
The temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.
1:38
And at that point, something neat happens.
1:40
And to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,
1:43
let's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.
1:46
A hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just
1:48
going to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.
1:49
So the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.
1:50
If you want to think about a hydrogen atom,
1:52
it also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.
1:57
And let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.
1:59
And obviously this distance isn't to scale.
2:02
This distance is also not to scale.
2:04
Atoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms
2:05
are actually much, much, much, much smaller
2:07
than the actual radius of an atom.
2:10
And so is the electron.
2:11
But anyway, this just gives you an idea.
2:13
So we know from the Coulomb forces,
2:14
from electromagnetic forces, that these two positively
2:17
charged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere
2:20
near each other.
2:22
But we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four
2:25
forces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,
2:28
that if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures
2:31
and huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close
2:35
enough to each other, then all of a sudden,
2:37
the strong force will overtake.
2:39
It's much stronger than the Coulomb force.
2:41
And then these two hydrogens will actually--
2:43
these nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?
2:48
Well, anyway, they would actually fuse together.
2:50
And so that is what actually happens
2:53
once this gets hot and dense enough.
2:57
You now have enough pressure and enough temperature
2:59
to overcome the Coulomb force and bring
3:02
these protons close enough to each other for fusion
3:05
to occur, for fusion ignition.
3:12
And the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.
3:14
It's not ignition.
3:15
It's not combustion in the traditional sense.
3:16
It's not like you're burning a carbon molecule
3:20
in the presence of oxygen.
3:22
It's not combustion.
3:23
It's ignition.
3:24
And the reason why it's called ignition
3:25
is because when two of these protons,
3:27
or two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus
3:32
has a slightly smaller mass.
3:35
And so in the first stage of this,
3:36
you actually have two protons under enough pressure--
3:42
obviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--
3:44
with enough pressure they get close enough.
3:46
And then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.
3:51
One of these guys degrades into a neutron.
3:56
And the resulting mass of the combined protons
3:59
is lower than the mass of each of the original.
4:01
By a little bit, but that little bit of mass
4:04
results in a lot of energy-- plus energy.
4:11
And this energy is why we call it ignition.
4:13
And so what this energy does is it provides
4:16
a little bit of outward pressure,
4:17
so that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.
4:21
So once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.
4:24
And then that energy provides outward pressure
4:26
to balance what is now a star.
4:30
So now we are at where we actually
4:32
have the ignition at the center.
4:35
We have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying
4:39
to get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.
4:43
Now, what is the hydrogen being fused into?
4:46
Well, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just
4:50
kind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens
4:54
in stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.
5:00
I have trouble spelling.
5:01
Which is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.
5:03
This is still hydrogen because it
5:04
has one proton and one neutron now.
5:07
It is not helium yet.
5:08
This does not have two-- it does not have two protons.
5:12
But then the deuterium keeps fusing.
5:14
And then we eventually end up with helium.
5:19
And we can even see that on the periodic table.
5:21
Oh, I lost my periodic table.
5:22
Well, I'll show you the next video.
5:23
But we know hydrogen in its atomic state
5:30
has an atomic number of 1.
5:32
And it also has a mass of 1.
5:34
It only has one nucleon in its nucleus.
5:38
But it's being fused.
5:39
It goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,
5:42
which is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.
5:46
And then that eventually gets fused--
5:48
and I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--
5:50
into helium.
5:51
And by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.
5:56
So it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,
5:58
in particular, that isotope of helium--
6:00
it has an atomic mass of 4.
6:03
And this process releases a ton of energy.
6:06
Because the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced
6:09
is slightly lower than four times the atomic mass
6:15
of each of the constituent hydrogens.
6:17
So all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it
6:21
needs super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--
6:24
keeps the star from collapsing.
6:28
And once a star is in this stage,
6:31
once it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen
6:35
in its core, where the pressure and the temperature
6:37
is the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.
6:41
This is now a main sequence star.
6:48
And that's actually where the sun is right now.
6:50
Now there's questions of, well, what if there just
6:53
wasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?
6:56
And there actually are things that
6:57
never get to quite that threshold
6:59
to fuse all the way into helium.
7:00
There are a few things that don't quite
7:02
make the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.
7:05
So they are generating some of their heat.
7:06
Or there are even smaller objects
7:08
that just get to the point there's
7:10
a huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually
7:13
occurring inside of the core.
7:15
And something like Jupiter would be an example.
7:17
And you could go several masses above Jupiter
7:20
where you get something like that.
7:21
So you have to reach a certain threshold
7:23
where the mass, where the pressure and the temperature
7:25
due to the heavy mass, get so large that you
7:27
start this fusion.
7:28
And-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,
7:31
the slower the fusion will occur.
7:33
But if you're super massive, the fusion
7:35
will occur really, really fast.
7:37
So that's the general idea of just how stars get formed
7:40
and why they don't collapse on themselves
7:43
and why they are these kind of balls
7:45
of fusion reactions existing in the universe.
7:48

7:50

0:00
Male 1: In the last few videos we looked at the final version,
0:04
the Declaration of Independence as it was approved of.
0:07
Here it seems like we have a very not final
0:10
version of the Declaration.
0:12
Male 2: What's really amazing is they go through
0:14
five drafts at least of the Declaration.
0:16
It's wonderful to watch how each of the drafts
0:19
changes. You have this committee of real people.
0:23
Jefferson and Adams and Franklin are all
0:25
part of that committee. Jefferson is using
0:28
a lap desk, one of those little things he invented,
0:31
so he could stand up or sit down
0:33
and write this in a little room on Market Street.
0:36
Then he shows it to Adams and he shows it to Franklin,
0:38
very deferential, he said, ""With your broadened
0:41
view of the world, Dr. Franklin, perhaps
0:42
you can make some suggestions.""
0:44
Male 1: Franklin and Adams could be his father.
0:46
Male 2: Right, right. Jefferson's only 33.
0:48
Really, really young. You have Franklin and
0:52
Adams, Franklin's hitting 70s then, and very
0:56
much of a father figure. But you see real
0:59
people working together in these rooms on
1:02
Market Street in Philadelphia,
1:03
trying to craft this document.
1:06
Male 1: Yeah, yeah, and you see it here.
1:07
This looks like someone editing a paper.
1:09
Male 2: Which shows you how important it is to edit,
1:11
in a way. Those of us who are writers and editors,
1:15
we like the fact that you should really quibble
1:19
over each word. These are words that matter.
1:24
For example, you can see they put in a little
1:26
phrase right here, ""separate and equal station.""
1:29
In other words, America's going to become a
1:31
separate nation and an equal nation.
1:33
That word ""separate and equal"" actually goes
1:36
down in American history with some resonance
1:38
because it's used for a while to defend segregation.
1:41
Even when they get the words almost perfect,
1:46
they have a resonance that they have to be careful about.
1:49
Male 1: Do you think they realized when
1:51
they were writing it how important this
1:53
document was going to be?
1:54
Male 2: One of the amusing things is this was
1:56
not considered the most important committee
1:58
to be on in June and July of 1776.
2:02
In fact, John Adams thinks he's already written
2:04
the great document of American Revolution,
2:07
which is a document written in May asking the
2:10
various colonies to get rid of their Royal
2:13
governors because we were going to break away.
2:16
So Adams is quite willing to let Jefferson write
2:18
this draft because he thinks that this is not
2:22
the most important of all the documents.
2:24
Male 1: And on some level, to defend Adams a little bit,
2:27
that does seem like a big deal. This was in
2:29
May of 1776 he writes once you're getting rid of your
2:32
Royal governors you really are separating yourself.
2:34
Male 2: And they've already had a vote to be independent.
2:39
So this is just a document,
2:41
""let Facts be submitted to a candid world,""
2:43
""the opinions of mankind ... they should declare the causes.""
2:47
This is really just their public relations document.
2:50
But, the reason it turns out to be so important
2:54
is it's so beautifully written, it becomes
2:57
the American creed. When they get together in
3:01
these rooms and edit it, suddenly they say,
3:04
""All men are created equal."" This becomes not just
3:08
a propaganda document, but a mission statement
3:11
for who we are as a people.
3:12
Male 1: And to some degree the power of poetry.
3:16
They could have said these exact same things
3:18
in very terse and ...
3:20
Male 2: This is why it was so good Jefferson
3:22
wrote it because Franklin is a very good writer,
3:24
but he's a very simple, plain writer.
3:27
He writes Poor Richard's Almanac,
3:28
""A penny saved is a penny earned.""
3:30
He's one of the first Americans not to write
3:33
in a very flowery way. John Adams' letters
3:36
are very beautiful, but they're kind of pompous
3:38
and orotund and self important.
3:41
You have a beautiful poet in Jefferson,
3:44
but as we're looking at this document on the screen,
3:47
even he benefits from some good edits.
3:51
Male 1: This is literally Jefferson's
3:52
handwriting we see here.
3:54
Male 2: This is Jefferson's handwriting on the
3:55
first draft. It's in the Library of Congress
3:57
if you want to go see it. The final document
4:00
is in the National Archives, about eight blocks away.
4:03
It's really wonderful to look at all of these
4:05
documents, especially, I mean what do you see
4:08
here where they edit the great second paragraph?
4:11
Male 1: ""We hold these truths to be self evident.""
4:15
You mentioned earlier that before it was
4:17
written, what, ""sacred and ...
4:19
Male 2: Undeniable. Yeah. They're using the word
4:22
""sacred"" for the truths when Jefferson writes the
4:26
first draft. To me, if you look at the backslashes,
4:31
the dark backslashes there, those are
4:33
Benjamin Franklin's backslashes I'm pretty sure
4:37
because he used a printer's pen and he was a
4:39
publisher, so he used that sort of backslashes to
4:43
cross things out. He writes the words ""self evident.""
4:47
One of the things is we historians never fully
4:50
know. Carl Becker, who was a great historian
4:53
of the Declaration, he's the one who said that
4:55
that was probably Franklin's edit. For me, I've spent
4:58
a lot of time in Ben Franklin's papers, which
5:01
were at Yale University Library. To me, it really
5:04
feels like his handwriting. So we assume that it's
5:07
Ben Franklin who takes out ""sacred"" because he
5:10
doesn't want ""these truths"" to be based on religion.
5:15
He wants ""these truths"" to be based on
5:17
rationality and reason.
5:19
Male 1: So once again it's not only the style
5:22
of the crossing out, this is in line with
5:24
Franklin's personality and beliefs.
5:26
Male 2: Franklin was somebody who had read
5:28
the great thinkers of the British and Scottish
5:31
Enlightenment. That means John Locke, David Hume.
5:35
David Hume was a person who came up with the
5:38
concept of ""self evident truths."" A self evident
5:40
truth would be that all bachelors aren't married,
5:44
as opposed to a more contingent truth like
5:49
Philadelphia is smaller than London.
5:51
Male 1: Kind of in math an axiom.
5:52
Male 2: An axiom, exactly. The fact that two
5:55
plus three is five, that's not something that
6:00
has to be further proved. These are somewhat
6:02
""self evident."" That's what Hume does and
6:06
Franklin loves that. Franklin loves Isaac Newton, too,
6:10
because Franklin is a scientist. He believes that
6:13
there are laws of nature, of nature's God,
6:16
and that there are certain self evident truths,
6:19
so he doesn't want the word ""sacred"" in there
6:21
because that kind of seems like divine right
6:24
of kings. God's the one who made these truths.
6:26
He's saying, ""no."" As we've discussed that whole
6:30
paragraph, it's about rationality and reason
6:33
getting us to those truths.
6:35
Male 1: Right, but they also do talk about,
6:36
as we talked about previously,
6:38
there's a balance here because
6:39
they do talk about ""created equal.""
6:40
Male 2: Well, let's look. Tell us, what do you
6:42
see there? This edit, it says that they were
6:47
had certain inherent and inalienable rights. You see
6:52
John Adams, and we're pretty sure that's
6:54
John Adams' writing, not just because of his
6:57
writing, but because of the concept.
6:59
He was a little bit more religious than the
7:00
others on the committee. He says,
7:03
""They're endowed by their Creator."" He puts in that phrase
7:07
""by their Creator"" with certain inalienable rights.
7:12
It's a balance. It's a balance between
7:14
rationality and reason, which is self evident,
7:17
and divine providence, this notion that we're all
7:22
children of the same Creator and therefore we're all

Male 1: Yeah, this is really amazing. Just to

realize that they were human beings
7:33
kind of forging through this.
7:34
Male 2: Yeah, they're real human beings who were probably
7:36
arguing just like you. Jefferson gets really upset
7:39
at someone; not at Franklin and Adams, but other
7:41
people start editing it. Franklin tells them
7:43
this wonderful story about when he was a young
7:45
tradesman in Philadelphia and somebody had a sign
7:47
about selling hats and everybody tried to edit
7:50
the sign for them. Franklin said, ""That's why I've
7:52
never been on a committee that's going to have
7:56
a lot of people editing what I write.""
7:59
But, those of us who are editors, we kind of think
8:02
those edits actually improve the document.
8:04
Male 1: Yeah, it seemed like it turned out

a pretty good result.

- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.
0:01
I wanted to talk today about a different kind
0:03
of irregular plural.
0:04
So we've been talking about regular plurals
0:06
where you take a word and you add an S.
0:08
So for example, the word dog becomes dogs.
0:12
You add an S.
0:13
And this is the regular plural here.
0:18
But I've been talking about the irregular plural,
0:20
the plural, the multiple form of a verb
0:23
that is not regular, irregular.
0:26
But today I figured we'd talk about something called
0:28
the base plural.
0:34
Which I will illustrate for you using our friend the sheep.
0:37
Now, sheep is a very strange word in that
0:40
it doesn't matter whether not there's more than one of them.
0:43
The form of the word always looks the same
0:46
whether it's one sheep or two sheep.
0:48
It's an irregular plural you don't add an S to.
0:51
This is called a base plural 'cause the base sheep,
0:55
the thing that you would normally add this particle S to
0:59
doesn't change whether it's singular sheep or plural sheep.
1:03
So that's you know.
1:13
There was one sheep...
1:20
on the hill.
1:26
There's a sentence.
1:29
What if we put another little baby sheep on that hill?
1:32
A little lamb.
1:34
Well now the sentence looks like this.
1:40
Two sheep...
1:45
on the hill.
1:48
Now the only difference between these two sentences
1:50
is that there's one sheep and two sheep
1:53
and therefore that means that the verb
1:55
changes to a plural conjugation.
1:58
So there was one sheep.
2:00
There were two sheep on the hill.
2:02
But everything else stays exactly the same.
2:04
One sheep, two sheep.
2:07
This is very strange, it's a base plural.
2:09
So in standard English, the form is two sheep...
2:16
and not two sheeps.
2:23
You see.
2:23
Now, there are more words that do behave this way.
2:26
So let's go investigate.
2:30
So there are a small number of words
2:33
that also behave this way, the way sheep does,
2:35
these weird sheep plurals, these base plurals.
2:39
One of them is fish.
2:40
So you could say the fish are plentiful this season,
2:42
but you could also say, you know, the fish...
2:47
is delicious.
2:53
You could say the bison migrate west
2:57
or you could also say the bison migrates west
3:00
indicating a single bison, you see.
3:03
Bison can be singular or plural.
3:05
Fish can be singular or plural.
3:09
As is so frequently the case, there is a special exception
3:13
regarding the word fishes,
3:16
which you may have heard before,
3:17
and fishes is a word that we would use
3:18
when we're talking about individual species
3:23
of fish.
3:27
And fish is the word that we would use
3:28
to refer to individual fish.
3:33
So let's say your uncle Marty is a prodigious fisherman
3:36
and he catches,
3:38
he goes fly fishing one weekend,
3:39
he comes back, he has 30 fish.
3:41
Marty caught...
3:48
30 fish.
3:51
But let's say on the other hand
3:53
your aunt Marta is a prodigious marine biologist
3:58
and she studies 30 different types of fish.
4:01
You would say Marta studies...
4:08
30 fishes.
4:14
And that doesn't mean that she studies 30 individual fish.
4:16
That means she studies 30 types of fish.
4:19
That's the difference.
4:20
Fishes is referring to species.
4:23
Fish refers to individuals.
4:26
That's how you'd use them in the plural.
4:28
So to review,
4:30
there's this entire class of words called base plurals
4:36
where the word itself, the base, doesn't take an S
4:39
for the plural, it's just the same.
4:40
The singular is the same as the plural.
4:42
So that gives us words like sheep,
4:45
fish,
4:47
and bison.
4:50
There aren't a ton of English words that behave this way
4:52
where the plural is the same as the singular.
4:54
I just wanted to make you aware
4:55
of some of the most common ones.
4:57
There are also more examples in the exercises.
5:00
So I just wanted you to be aware of them.
5:03
You can learn anything.

0:00
In most topics you have to get pretty advanced before you
0:03
start addressing the philosophically interesting
0:05
things, but in chemistry it just starts right from the
0:08
get-go with what's arguably the most philosophically
0:11
interesting part of the whole topic, and that's the atom.
0:15
And the idea of the atom, as philosophers long ago, and you
0:18
could look it up on the different philosophers who
0:21
first philosophized about it, they said, hey, you know, if I
0:23
started off with, I don't know, if I started off with an
0:28
apple, and I just kept cutting the apple -- let me draw a
0:32
nice looking apple just so it doesn't look just
0:34
like a heart .
0:36
There you go.
0:36
You have a nice looking apple, And you just kept cutting it,
0:38
smaller and smaller pieces.
0:40
So eventually, you get a piece so small, so tiny, that you
0:44
can't cut it anymore.
0:46
And I'm sure some of these philosophers went out there
0:48
with a knife and tried to do it and they just felt that,
0:50
oh, if I could just get my knife a little bit sharper, I
0:52
could cut it again and again.
0:53
So it's a completely philosophical construct, which
0:56
frankly, in a lot of ways, isn't too different to how the
0:59
atom is today.
1:00
It's really just a mental abstraction that allows us to
1:04
describe a lot of observations we see in the universe.
1:07
But anyway, these philosophers said, well, at some point we
1:10
think that there's going to be some little part of an apple
1:15
that they won't be able to divide anymore.
1:16
And they called that an atom.
1:18
And it doesn't just have to just be for an apple they said
1:19
this is true for any substance or any element to that you
1:23
encounter in the universe.
1:25
And so the word atom is really Greek for uncuttable.
1:29
Uncuttable or indivisible.
1:34
Now we know that it actually is cuttable and even though it
1:37
is not a trivial thing, it's not the smallest form of
1:42
matter we know.
1:43
We now know that an atom is made up of other more
1:47
fundamental particles.
1:48
And let me write that.
1:50
So the we have the neutron.
1:55
And I'll draw in a second how they all fit together and the
1:59
structure of an atom.
2:00
We have a neutron.
2:02
We have a proton.
2:05
And we have electrons.
2:09
Electrons.
2:11
And you might already be familiar with this if you look
2:13
at old videos about atomic projects, you'll see a drawing
2:18
that looks something like this.
2:20
Let me see if I can draw one.
2:21
So you'll have something like that.
2:24
And you'll have these things spinning around
2:27
that look like this.
2:28
They have orbits that look like that.
2:30
And maybe something that looks like that.
2:33
And the general notion behind these kind of nuclear drawings
2:36
-- and I'm sure that they still show up at some
2:39
government defense labs or something like that -- is that
2:41
you have a nucleus at the center of an atom.
2:46
You have a nucleus at the center of an atom.
2:48
And we know that a nucleus has neutrons and protons.
2:52
Neutrons and protons.
2:53
And we'll talk a little bit more about which elements have
2:56
how many neutrons and how many protons.
2:59
And then orbiting, and I'm going to use the word orbit
3:02
right now, although we'll learn in about two minutes
3:05
that the word orbit is actually the incorrect or even
3:08
the mentally incorrect way of visualizing what
3:10
an electron is doing.
3:11
But the old idea was that you have these electrons that are
3:14
orbiting around the nucleus very similar to the way the
3:17
Earth orbits around the Sun or the moon
3:19
orbits around the Earth.
3:21
And it's been shown that that's actually
3:23
a very wrong way.
3:26
And when we cover quantum mechanics we'll learn why this
3:30
doesn't work, what are the contradictions that emerge
3:34
when you try to model an electron like a planet going
3:38
around the Sun.
3:40
But this was kind of the original idea, and frankly I
3:41
think this is kind of the idea that is the most mainstream
3:45
way of viewing an atom.
3:50
Now, I said an atom is philosophically interesting.
3:52
Why is it philosophically interesting?
3:53
Because what we now view as the accepted way of viewing an
3:58
atom really starts to blur the line between our physical
4:04
reality and everything in the world is just information, and
4:09
there really isn't any such thing as true matter or true
4:12
particles as the way we define them in our everyday life.
4:15
You know, for me a particle, oh, it looks
4:16
like a grain of sand.
4:17
I can pick it up, touch it.
4:19
While a wave, that could be like a soundwave. It could be
4:21
just this change in energy over time.
4:23
But we'll learn, especially when we do quantum mechanics,
4:25
that it all gets jumbled up as we start approaching the
4:29
scales or the size of an atom.
4:31
Anyway, I said this was an incorrect way of doing it.
4:34
What's the correct way?
4:37
So it turns out-- this is a picture, not a picture really,
4:40
this is also a depiction.
4:42
So it's an interesting question, what I just said.
4:44
How can you have a picture of an atom?
4:47
Because is actually turns out that most wavelengths of
4:49
light, especially the visible wavelengths of light, are much
4:52
larger than the size of an atom.
4:56
Everything else we quote-unquote, observe in
4:58
life, it's by reflected light.
5:00
But all of a sudden when you're dealing with an atom,
5:02
reflected light you could almost view it as too big, or
5:06
too blunt of an instrument with which to observe an atom.
5:09
Anyway, this is a depiction of a helium atom.
5:14
A helium atom has two protons and two neutrons.
5:18
Or at least this helium atom has two
5:19
protons and two neutrons.
5:21
And the way they depict it here in the nucleus, right
5:24
there, maybe these are the two-- I'm assuming they're
5:26
using red for proton and purple for neutron.
5:32
Purple seems like more of a neutral color.
5:34
And they're sitting at the center of this atom.
5:39
And then this whole haze around there, those are the
5:42
two electrons that helium has, or that at least
5:45
this helium atom has.
5:47
Maybe you could gain or lose an electron.
5:49
But these are the two electrons.
5:50
And you say, hey, Sal, how can two electrons be this blur
5:55
that's kind of smeared around this atom.
5:58
And that's where it gets philosophically interesting.
6:01
So you cannot describe an electron's path around a
6:09
nucleus with the traditional orbit idea that we've
6:12
encountered when we look at planets or if we just imagine
6:16
things at kind of a larger scale.
6:18
It turns out that an electron, you cannot know exactly its
6:24
momentum and location at any given point in time.
6:28
All you can know is a probability distribution of
6:31
where it is likely to be.
6:33
And the way they depicted this, black is a higher
6:36
probability, so you're much more likely to find the
6:39
electron here than you are here.
6:42
But the electron really could be anywhere.
6:43
It could even to be here, even though it's completely white
6:46
there, with some very, very, very, very, very low
6:49
probability.
6:50
And so this function of where an electron is, this is called
6:55
an orbital.
6:56
Orbital.
6:57
Not to be confused with orbit.
7:00
Orbital.
7:02
Remember, an orbit was something like this.
7:05
It's like Venus going around the Sun.
7:08
So it's very physically easy for us to imagine.
7:12
While an orbital is actually a mathematical probability
7:16
function that tells us where we're
7:17
likely to find an electron.
7:18
We'll deal a lot more with that when we cover quantum
7:21
mechanics, but that's not going to be in the scope of
7:23
this kind of introductory set of chemistry lectures.
7:26
But it's interesting, right?
7:28
An electron's behavior is so bizarre at that scale that you
7:32
can't-- I mean, to call it a particle is almost misleading.
7:35
It is called a particle, but it's not a particle in the
7:38
sense that we're used to in our everyday life.
7:40
It's this thing that you can't even say exactly where it is.
7:45
It can be anywhere in this haze.
7:47
And we'll learn later that there are different shapes of
7:49
the hazes is as we add more and more electrons to an atom.
7:53
But to me, it starts to address philosophical issues
7:57
of what matter even is, or do the things we look at, how
8:01
real are they?
8:02
Or how real are they, at least as we've defined reality?
8:04
Anyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.
8:07
But the whole notion of electrons, protons, they're
8:12
all kind of predicated on this notion of charge.
8:15
And we've talked about it before when we learned about
8:17
Coulomb's law.
8:18
You could review Coulomb's laws videos in the physics
8:22
playlist. But the idea is that an electron
8:27
has a negative charge.
8:29
A proton, sometimes written like that,
8:31
has a positive charge.
8:33
And a neutron has no charge.
8:37
And so that's what was tempting about the original
8:39
model of an electron.
8:42
If they say, OK, if this thing has positive charges, right?
8:45
So let's say this is two neutrons and two protons.
8:47
Let's say it's a helium atom.
8:48
Then we'll have some positive charges here.
8:51
We have some negative charges out here.
8:54
Opposite charges attract.
8:56
And so if these things had some velocity, enough
9:03
velocity, they would orbit around this, just the way a
9:08
planet will orbit around the Sun.
9:10
But now we learn, even though this is partially true, that
9:15
the further away an electron is from the nucleus, it does
9:23
have more, it's true, potential energy.
9:27
In that it will want to move towards the nucleus, but
9:31
because of all the mechanics at the quantum level, it won't
9:34
just do something simple like move in a path like that, like
9:37
a comet would do around the Sun, it actually has this kind
9:41
of wave-like behavior, where it just has this probability
9:43
function that describes it.
9:45
But the further away an orbital, it
9:48
does have more potential.
9:50
We're going to go a lot more into that in future videos.
9:53
But anyway, how do you recognize what an element is?
9:56
I've talked a lot about the philosophy and all of that,
9:58
but how do I know that this is helium?
10:00
Is it by the number of neutrons it has?
10:03
Is it by the number of protons it has?
10:05
Is it by the number of electrons?
10:07
Well the answer is, it's by the number of protons.
10:09
So if you know the number of protons in an element, you
10:13
know what that element is.
10:14
And the number of protons, this is defined
10:21
as the atomic number.
10:26
Now, so let's say I said something has four protons.
10:33
How do we know what it is?
10:34
Well if we haven't memorized it, we could look it up on the
10:37
periodic table of elements, which we'll be dealing with a
10:39
lot in this playlist. And you'd say, oh, four protons,
10:43
that is beryllium.
10:45
Right there.
10:46
And the atomic number is the number that you see up there.
10:50
And that' s literally the number of protons.
10:52
And that is what differentiates
10:55
one atom from another.
10:56
If you have fifteen protons, you're dealing with
10:59
phosphorus.
11:00
And all of a sudden, if you have seven protons, you're
11:06
dealing with nitrogen.
11:07
If you have eight, you're dealing with oxygen.
11:09
That is what defines the element.
11:11
Now, we'll talk in the future about what happens with charge
11:15
and all of that.
11:17
Or what happens when you gain or lose electrons.
11:19
But that does not change what element you're dealing with.
11:21
And likewise, when you change the number of neutrons, that
11:26
also does not change the element you're dealing with.
11:30
But that leads to an obvious question of, well, how many
11:32
neutrons and electrons do you have?
11:35
Well, if an atom is charge-neutral, that means it
11:43
has the same number of electrons.
11:46
So let's say that I have carbon.
11:52
Its atomic number is six.
11:53
And let's say its mass number is twelve.
12:00
Now what does this mean?
12:01
And let me say further that this is a neutral particle.
12:05
This is a neutral atom.
12:07
So the atomic number for carbon is six.
12:10
That tells us exactly how many protons it has.
12:13
So if I were to draw a little model here, and this is in no
12:16
way an accurate model.
12:17
I'll draw six-- two, three, four, five, six
12:21
protons in the center.
12:23
And the weight of these protons, each proton is one
12:26
atomic mass unit, and we'll talk more about how that
12:28
relates to kilograms. It's a very small
12:31
fraction of a kilogram.
12:32
Roughly I think it's 1.6 times 10 to the
12:36
minus 27th of a kilogram.
12:38
So let's say each of these are one atomic mass unit, and
12:45
that's approximately equal to, I think, 1.67 times 10 to the
12:48
minus 27 kilograms. This is a very small number.
12:53
It's actually almost impossible to visualize.
12:57
At least it is for me.
12:58
This tells me the mass of the entire carbon atom, of this
13:03
particular carbon atom.
13:04
And this can actually change from carbon
13:05
atom to carbon atom.
13:07
And this is essentially the mass of all of the protons
13:10
plus all of the neutrons.
13:12
And each proton has an atomic mass of one, in atomic mass
13:17
units, and each neutron has an atomic mass of
13:20
one atomic mass unit.
13:22
So this is really the number of protons plus
13:28
the number of neutrons.
13:33
So in this case we have six protons, so we must also have
13:37
six neutrons.
13:39
Six neutrons plus six protons.
13:42
Now, where are the electrons?
13:44
Well, I said it's neutral, so the proton has an equal
13:49
positive charge as the electron's negative charge.
13:51
So this is a neutral atom, and it has six protons, so it also
13:55
has six electrons.
13:56
Let me draw that.
13:57
So we said it has six neutrons in here.
13:59
One, two, three, four, five, six.
14:01
So that's the nucleus right there.
14:04
And then if we were to draw the electons-- well, I could
14:09
draw it as a smear, but if we want to kind of visualize it a
14:12
little better, we could say, OK, there's going to be six
14:13
electrons orbiting.
14:15
One, two, three, four, five, six.
14:18
And they're going to be moving around in this unpredictable
14:21
way that we would have to describe with
14:22
a probability function.
14:24
And so the interesting thing about it is, most of the mass
14:30
of an atom is sitting right in here.
14:32
I mean, you might notice that when people care about the
14:34
mass, when they care about the atomic mass number of an atom,
14:40
they ignore the electrons.
14:41
And that's because the mass of a proton, one proton
14:47
mass-wise, is equal to 1,836 electons.
14:52
So for thinking about the mass of an atom, for all basic
14:58
purposes, you can ignore the mass of an electron.
15:01
It's really the mass of the nucleus that counts as the
15:08
mass of the atom.
15:10
Now, you might see this periodic table here, and you
15:12
say, OK, they gave us the atomic number up there.
15:15
The atomic number of oxygen is eight.
15:18
It means it has eight protons.
15:20
The atomic number of silicon is 14.
15:22
It has 14 protons.
15:24
Now what is this right here?
15:27
Let's see, in carbon.
15:28
In carbon they have this 12.0107.
15:34
That is the atomic weight of carbon.
15:36
Let me write this.
15:41
Atomic weight of carbon.
15:47
The atomic weight of carbon is 12.0107.
15:56
Now, what does that mean?
15:57
Does that mean that carbon has six protons and then the
16:03
remainder, the remaining 6.0107 neutrons, it has kind
16:09
of this fraction of a neutron?
16:11
No.
16:12
It means if you were to average all the different
16:16
versions of carbon you find on the planet and you were to
16:19
average the number of neutrons based on the quantity of the
16:25
different types of carbon, this is the
16:27
average you would get.
16:28
So it turns out that carbon, the two major forms, the main
16:32
one you'll find is carbon-12.
16:35
So that's like this.
16:36
So that has six protons and six neutrons.
16:39
And then another isotope of carbon.
16:42
Now an isotope is the same element with a different
16:45
number of neutrons.
16:46
Another isotope of carbon is carbon-14, which is much more
16:50
scarce on the planet.
16:52
We don't know how much in the universe, but on the planet.
16:55
Now, if you were to average these, not just a straight-up
16:58
average, then you would get carbon-13 and then the atomic
17:01
weight would be 13, but you weight this one much higher
17:04
because this exists in much larger quantities on Earth.
17:07
I mean, this is pretty much all of the
17:08
carbon that you see.
17:09
But there's a little bit of this.
17:10
So if you weight them appropriately, the average
17:13
becomes this.
17:14
So most of the carbon you'll find-- if you just found
17:17
carbon someplace, on average its weight in atomic mass
17:22
units is going to be 12.0107.
17:27
But that idea of an isotope is an interesting one.
17:29
Remember, when you change the neutrons, you're not changing
17:32
the actual, fundamental element.
17:33
You're just getting a different isotope, a different
17:36
version, of the element.
17:37
So these two versions of carbon are both isotopes.
17:41
Now, I want to leave this video with what I think is
17:43
kind of the neatest idea behind atoms. And it's the
17:46
most philosophically interesting things about them.
17:49
It's that the relative size-- so, we have these electrons,
17:54
which represent very little of the mass of an atom.
17:58
It's 1/2000 of the mass of an atom are the electrons.
18:01
And even those, it's hard to even describe them as
18:04
particles, because you can't even tell me exactly where and
18:08
how fast one of these particles is moving.
18:11
They just have a probability function.
18:12
So most of the atom is sitting inside the nucleus.
18:16
And this is the interesting thing.
18:17
If you look at an atom on average, if you
18:21
say this is my atom.
18:23
Let's say I had two atoms that are bonded to each other.
18:26
And I were to say, how much of this is actual stuff?
18:29
And when I say stuff, that's a very abstract concept, because
18:32
we're talking about the nucleus, right?
18:33
Because the nucleus is where all the
18:34
mass is, all the stuff.
18:36
It turns out that it's actually an infinitesimally
18:39
small fraction of the volume of the atom where-- the volume
18:44
of the atom is hard to define, because the electron can
18:45
pretty much be anywhere, but if you view the volume as
18:48
where you're most likely to find the electron, or with 90%
18:52
probability you're likely to find the electron, then the
18:55
nucleus is, in a lot of cases and the way I think about it,
18:59
it's about 1/10,000 of the volume.
19:01
So if you think about it, when you look at something, if you
19:03
look at your hand or if you look at the wall or if you
19:06
look at your computer, 99.999% of it is free space.
19:14
It's nothing.
19:15
It's vacuum.
19:18
If you had ultra-small-- I guess we could call them
19:20
particles or something-- most of them would pass straight
19:23
through whatever you look at.
19:24
So it already starts to kind of
19:26
question our hold on reality.
19:28
What is there when, if-- and this is fact, this isn't
19:32
theory right here-- that if you take anything down to the
19:35
building blocks, down to the atomic level, most of the
19:39
space of that kind of, quote-unquote object, is free
19:43
vacuum space.
19:44
You could go straight through it if you could get down to
19:46
that scale.
19:47
This image of a helium atom, they say right here this is
19:50
one femtometer.
19:52
Right?
19:52
One femtometer.
19:57
This is the scale of the nucleus of a
20:00
helium atom, right?
20:01
One femtometer.
20:03
This is one angstrom, right?
20:04
And they say that equals 100,000 femtometers.
20:06
And just to get a sense of scale, one angstrom is 1 times
20:10
10 to the negative 10 meters, right?
20:13
So the atom is roughly on the scale of an angstrom.
20:15
In the case of helium, the nucleus is
20:17
even a smaller fraction.
20:18
It's 1/100,000.
20:20
So if you had-- let's say you had liquid helium, which you'd
20:23
have to get very cold to get.
20:25
If you're looking at that, most of it is free space.
20:27
If you're looking at an iron bar, the great, great, great,
20:30
great, great, great majority of it is free space.
20:33
And we're not even talking about, maybe there's some free
20:35
space inside the nucleus that we could talk
20:37
about in the future.
20:38
But to me, that just blows my mind that most things we look
20:41
at are not really solid.
20:44
They're really just empty space, but they look solid
20:47
because of the way light reflects on them or the forces
20:50
that repel us.
20:51
But there really isn't something to touch there.
20:55
That most of this right here is all free space.
20:57
I think I've said the word free space now, and I think

I'll leave further

- [Voiceover] You often hear the phrase
0:01
like dissolves like when you're talking
0:03
about solubility and even though
0:05
this idea isn't perfect, it does allow
0:07
you to predict the solubility of compounds.
0:11
For example, a polar solvent will dissolve
0:14
a polar compound in general, so like dissolves like.
0:18
I also have here a polar solvent will dissolve
0:21
in ionic solute because you don't usually
0:24
describe ionic compounds as being polar.
0:28
Next, a nonpolar solvent will dissolve
0:31
a nonpolar compound, so like dissolves like,
0:35
but a polar solvent will not dissolve
0:39
a nonpolar compound, so this would
0:43
be like and unlike here.
0:46
An example of a polar solvent is water.
0:49
An example of a nonpolar compound
0:51
could be something like oil.
0:53
We know that water will not dissolve oil.
0:56
Let's go back to this first idea
0:58
of a polar solvent being able to
1:00
dissolve a polar compound or a
1:02
polar solvent dissolving an ionic compound
1:05
like sodium chloride.
1:07
We know from experience that sodium chloride,
1:09
or salt, is soluble in water.
1:12
Over here on the left we have part of a salt crystal.
1:17
We know that crystals are held together
1:20
by attractive forces, the positively charged
1:23
sodium cation is attracted to the
1:25
negatively charged chloride anion.
1:28
Opposite charges attract and our
1:31
crystal is held together by these attracted forces.
1:36
If we get some water molecules to come along,
1:38
we know that water is a polar solvent,
1:41
water is a polar molecule.
1:44
The oxygen is more electronegative
1:46
than this hydrogen, so the oxygen
1:48
pulls some of the electron density
1:49
in this bond closer to it giving it
1:51
a partial negative charge.
1:53
If we are withdrawing electron density
1:55
from this hydrogen, this hydrogen
1:57
gets a partial positive charge.
1:59
Since opposite charges attract, the partially positive
2:02
hydrogen in water is attracted to the
2:05
negatively charged chloride anion,
2:07
so there's an interaction here.
2:10
If we get a bunch of water molecules,
2:12
here's another one right here,
2:13
so partially negative oxygen, partially
2:15
positive hydrogen, so there's another attractive force.
2:18
We can pull off these chloride anions
2:20
from the solid and bring the anion into solution.
2:23
On the right here we have our chloride anion
2:26
in solution surrounded by a bunch of water molecules
2:30
and we have all these partially positive
2:33
hydrogens interacting with our
2:35
negatively charged chloride anion.
2:38
For the sodium cations let's go back
2:40
to our solid on the left.
2:42
Since the sodium cation is positively charged,
2:45
that's going to interact with the
2:46
partially negatively charged oxygen
2:49
in the water molecule, so opposite charges
2:51
attract and if you get enough water molecules
2:54
you can pull off these sodium cations
2:56
and bring the sodium cations into a solution.
2:59
We have the partially negative oxygens
3:02
on water interacting with our
3:04
positively charged sodium cations in our solution.
3:09
Our polar solvent, water, needs to be able to
3:13
interact with our solutes and in this case
3:17
the polar solvent attacks the solid
3:20
over here on the left and it replaces
3:22
these ion interactions of our crystal
3:26
with ion-dipole interactions in our solution.
3:30
By ion-dipole, I mean we have a cation right here,
3:33
so that's our ion and then our di-pole
3:35
would be water, water's a polar molecule,
3:38
it has di-pole moment, so we have all
3:40
of these ion di-pole interactions.
3:43
Ionic solutes that are able to participate
3:46
in these interactions will dissolve in water.
3:50
If you have a polar compound, right, a similar idea,
3:54
you have attractive forces that allow
3:56
the polar compounds to be dissolved
3:57
in a polar solvent like water.
4:00
Let's move on to a nonpolar compound,
4:03
so a nonpolar compound, something
4:05
like this molecule on the left here
4:08
and this molecule's called naphthalene.
4:10
Naphthalene is a solid with a
4:12
very distinctive smell to it.
4:14
The first time I smelled naphthalene in the lab
4:17
it reminded me of my grandparents' house
4:19
because my grandparents, when I was a kid,
4:20
had mothballs that were made of naphthalene,
4:23
so it's a very distinctive smell.
4:25
Now naphthalene is nonpolar because
4:27
it's composed of only carbons and hydrogens,
4:30
it's a hydrocarbon, so naphthalene is nonpolar
4:34
and you would need a nonpolar solvent
4:36
to get it to dissolve.
4:38
Toluene is a nonpolar solvent, again,
4:41
this is a hydrocarbon, so if you
4:43
take solid naphthalene and liquid toluene,
4:47
naphthalene will dissolve in toluene,
4:50
so like dissolves like, our nonpolar
4:53
solvent will dissolve our nonpolar compound.
4:57
Finally, let's look at this last idea here,
4:59
so a polar solvent, something like water,
5:02
should not dissolve a nonpolar compound,
5:05
something like naphthalene, and that's true,
5:08
naphthalene will not dissolve in water,
5:11
so water doesn't interact well enough
5:13
with the naphthalene molecules to
5:16
get them to dissolve and form a solution.
5:19
This concept of like dissolves like is important
5:22
because it allows you to predict whether
5:25
or not a compound will be soluble in water.
5:30
Let's look at several organic compounds
5:32
and determine whether or not those
5:33
compounds are soluble in water.
5:35
We'll start with ethanol.
5:37
Ethanol has a polar oxygen-hydrogen bond,
5:40
the oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen,
5:43
so the oxygen withdraws some electron density
5:45
making the oxygen partially negative
5:48
and leaving the hydrogen partially positive.
5:50
If water comes along, I'll draw in
5:52
a water molecule here, and we know that
5:56
water is a polar solvent, water is a polar molecule,
6:00
the oxygen has a partial negative and the
6:02
hydrogens have partial positive charges.
6:05
We can see that there's an opportunity
6:07
for an attractive force, opposite charges
6:09
attract, so the partially positive
6:12
hydrogen on ethanol is attracted
6:14
to the partially negatively charged oxygen on water.
6:17
This is an example of hydrogen bond density,
6:20
remember hydrogen bonding from earlier videos.
6:24
Here is a good example of that.
6:26
We can even have some more hydrogen bonding,
6:28
I could draw in another water molecule down here,
6:31
so let me go ahead and do that,
6:32
we know that the oxygen is partially negative,
6:35
hydrogens are partially positive,
6:37
so here's another opportunity for hydrogen bonding
6:40
between partially negative oxygen on ethanol
6:43
and the partially positive hydrogen on water.
6:46
This portion of the ethanol molecule is polar
6:49
and loves water, so this is the polar region
6:53
and this portion loves water, we call this
6:56
hydrophilic, so let me write that down here
6:59
so this portion of the molecule is hydrophilic,
7:02
or water loving.
7:04
Let's look at the other portion of the ethanol molecule,
7:06
so this portion on the left.
7:08
We have a CH2 here and a CH3 here,
7:11
so carbons and hydrogens which
7:13
we know are nonpolar, so this region
7:16
is nonpolar, this region doesn't like water,
7:20
it's scared of water, we call this hydrophobic,
7:24
or water fearing.
7:26
We know that ethanol is soluble in water
7:28
just by experience, so that must mean
7:31
this hydrophobic region doesn't
7:33
overcome the hydrophilic region,
7:36
so the hydrophilic region is polar region
7:38
of the ethanol molecule, it's enough
7:40
to make ethanol soluble in water.
7:42
If you think about that same concept
7:44
and look at a different molecule,
7:46
so on the right here's 1-octanol.
7:48
1-octanol has an opportunity for hydrogen bonding
7:51
we have this OH here, so it's the
7:53
same situation as the ethanol on the left,
7:56
so we have a polar or hydrophilic region of the molecule.
8:00
However, the difference is this time
8:02
we have extremely large nonpolar
8:05
hydrophobic portion of the molecule.
8:08
This nonpolar region overcomes
8:10
the slightly polar region making the
8:13
1-octanol molecule nonpolar overall,
8:17
so 1-octanol will not dissolve in water.
8:21
This one is a no and this one over here
8:24
was a yes, ethanol is a yes.
8:27
Next, let's look at cinnamaldehyde,
8:29
so down here on the left is cinnamaldehyde,
8:32
let's focus in on, let's focus in on
8:33
this carbon oxygen double bond first.
8:36
We know that oxygen is more
8:38
electronegative than this carbon here,
8:40
so the oxygen withdraws from the electron density
8:43
making it partially negative and this
8:45
carbon would be there for partially positive.
8:48
This very small portion of the molecule
8:50
is polar, this small portion could interact with water.
8:54
However, we have an extremely large,
8:56
nonpolar region of the molecule, all of these
8:59
carbons and hydrogens over here on the left.
9:03
This very hydrophobic region, or nonpolar region,
9:06
overcomes the small polar region
9:08
making cinnamaldehyde overall nonpolar.
9:12
Since it's overall nonpolar, cinnamaldehyde
9:14
will not dissolve in water.
9:17
If it's nonpolar, you would need a more nonpolar solvent
9:20
to get cinnamaldehyde to dissolve
9:22
and there are several examples of
9:23
nonpolar organic solvents that will do that.
9:27
Next let's look at sucrose, so over here
9:30
on the right is sucrose or one way
9:32
to draw or represent the sucrose compound.
9:36
Now we see lots of carbons and hydrogens,
9:39
so all of these right here, let me just
9:41
go ahead and highlight all these carbons in this ring
9:43
and so all these carbons in these rings,
9:45
all these hydrogens, so at first you might think
9:49
okay, there's lots of carbons and hydrogens,
9:51
this might be nonpolar, but of course we have
9:54
lots of these OH groups, so I'm gonna
9:57
go ahead and circle a few of them,
9:58
right, we have all of these OH groups
10:00
in the sucrose molecules, so lots of them.
10:03
That means opportunities for hydrogen bonding.
10:07
Because of all these opportunities
10:09
for hydrogen bonding, sucrose is soluble in water
10:13
which we know from experience.
10:14
Of course sucrose, or sugar, sugar will
10:16
dissolve in water, so the opportunity
10:19
for hydrogen bonding is the reason for that.
10:23
Benzoic acid is a solid at room temperature.
10:26
If you take some benzoic acid crystals
10:28
and you put them in some room temperature water,
10:30
the crystals won't dissolve.
10:32
We can explain that by looking
10:34
at the structure for benzoic acid.
10:36
While we do have this portion of the compound
10:39
which we know is polar and hydrophilic
10:41
due to the presence of the electronegative oxygens,
10:44
we also have this portion of the compound
10:47
on the left which is nonpolar and hydrophobic
10:50
due to the presence of all the carbons and hydrogens.
10:53
Since the benzoic acid crystals don't
10:55
dissolve at room temperature water,
10:57
the hydrophobic portion of the compound
10:59
must overcome the hydrophilic portion of the compound.
11:03
You actually can get benzoic acid
11:05
crystals to dissolve in water if you heat up the water,
11:08
if you increase the solubility of the compound
11:11
by increasing the temperature of the solvent.
11:14
Let's think about benzoic acid crystals
11:16
in room temperature water and let's add a base,
11:19
let's add sodium hydroxide.
11:22
The sodium hydroxide's going to react
11:24
with the most acidic proton on benzoic acid,
11:27
so benzoic acid is acidic, it will
11:29
donate this proton right here.
11:32
That means the electrons in red in this bond
11:34
are left behind on the oxygen,
11:36
so I'll show those electrons in red over here.
11:39
That's gives this oxygen a negative charge
11:41
and we form sodium benzoate.
11:44
I won't get too much into acid base chemistry,
11:47
but we took the most acidic proton off of benzoic acid
11:50
to give us the conjugate base sodium benzoate.
11:53
Sodium benzoate is highly soluble
11:56
in room temperature water.
11:58
That must mean we increase this
12:01
hydrophilic portion because now we have
12:04
a negative charge, so the hydrophilic portion
12:07
now is able to overcome the hydrophobic portion.
12:11
Sodium benzoate is soluble,
12:14
this negative charge is better able
12:16
to interact with our solvent which is water.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,_mWHWJiMKXU,

0:09
Your personal ancestry story begins
0:14
with the shared story of our human ancestry.
0:22
You and your distant cousin, the chimpanzee,
0:25
have a common ancestor.
0:27
which lived about 6.5 million years ago.
0:31
We can learn about this common ancestor by
0:35
noting what makes us similar to chimps.
0:40
But many things also distinguish us from chimpanzees,
0:44
like our big brains, which enable abstract reasoning
0:48
and the development of complex languages.
0:51
And our anatomy, adapted to up-right walking,
0:57
these human traits developed gradually over millions of years.
1:04
The fossil record reveals a long and eventful
1:08
parade of human ancestors.
1:10
During some periods, several of our ancestors co-existed.
1:16
Gradually, they became more efficient up-right walkers.
1:21
And later, developed skulls with larger brain cases
1:25
devoted more to thinking and less to chewing.
1:31
Our knowledge of the exact relationships between
1:35
these ancestors is incomplete.
1:37
And often, is revised, because of new fossil finds.
1:43
Some of them were our direct ancestors,
1:46
some of them were distant cousins,
1:49
who became evolutionary dead ends.
1:54
But by 200,000 years ago,
1:56
we're on firmer ground.
1:59
We find the bones of people in Africa,
2:02
who looked something like us,
2:06
not exactly like us, but close.
2:12
They built fires and flaked stone into spear heads, knifes, and scrapers.
2:18
They were physically strong,
2:20
and still depended on their muscles, not their technology
2:24
for much of their survival.
2:27
Here, in addition to fossils,
2:30
we have genetics to help us find our prehistoric kin.
2:35
All of this, living today, inherited our DNA
2:38
from this small group of ancient people in Africa.
2:44
Over time, they began to look more and more like us.
2:49
And by 100,000 years ago, their skeletons weren't so different
2:55
from ours, but these early Homo sapiens shared the planet
3:01
with two of their distant cousins.
3:04
By this time, as a result of previous migrations,
3:08
Homo erectus was living across Asia, and had been for 2 million years.
3:15
Homo erectus had a big brain, some made hand axes,
3:19
some do fires, and some may even have worn clothing.
3:24
At the same time, Neanderthals lived across Europe, and western and
3:31
central Asia. They had even bigger brains.
3:36
They made spears and stone tools, similar to those
3:40
found in Africa, and we suspect they had strong social relationships.
3:47
They cared for the sick, and infirm, and buried their dead.
3:53
Not so very different, culturally, from early Homo sapiens, it seems
3:59
that our human anatomy developed before our complex human culture.
4:06
But things were about to change.
4:10
Today, we live in all climates, all over the world;
4:14
and are unique, in our dependence on our cultures for survival.
4:19
How we got from there, to here,

0:01
- [Instructor] Before we get into electron affinity,
0:04
let's really quickly review ionization energy.
0:07
And let's start with a neutral lithium atom,
0:10
with an electron configuration of one s two, two s one.
0:13
A lithium atom has three protons in the nucleus,
0:16
so a positive three charge.
0:18
Two electrons in the one s orbital,
0:21
so here are the two electrons in the one s orbital,
0:24
or our core electrons,
0:26
and one electron in a two s orbital.
0:28
This is our outermost electron, our valence electron.
0:32
The valence electron is shielded
0:35
from the full positive three charge of the nucleus
0:37
by the presence of the core electrons.
0:40
So like charges repel,
0:41
and these core electrons repel this outer electron,
0:45
and shield it from the full positive three charge.
0:48
But there still is an attractive force
0:50
between the positively charged nucleus
0:52
and this outermost electron.
0:54
So opposite charges attract, and our outermost electron
0:58
still feels a pull from the nucleus.
1:01
Therefore, since the outer electron is attracted
1:04
to the nucleus, it takes energy
1:06
to completely pull away this valence electron
1:08
from the neutral atom.
1:10
So if we pull away the outermost electron,
1:13
we lose our valence electron,
1:15
and we're left with a lithium ion, with a positive charge.
1:19
Positive one charge, because we still have three protons,
1:22
but only two electrons now,
1:24
so overall a plus one charge.
1:26
Since this ionization takes energy to rip away the electron,
1:30
the energy, the ionization energy, is positive,
1:34
and is measured in kiloJoules per mol.
1:36
Let's compare that with electron affinity.
1:39
So, in electron affinity, let's say we're starting
1:42
with our neutral lithium atom again,
1:44
but this time, instead of taking an electron away,
1:47
we are adding an electron.
1:50
So, we would add an electron to the two s orbital.
1:54
So we started off with three electrons
1:55
in the neutral lithium atom, and we're adding one more.
1:59
So the electron configuration for the lithium ion
2:02
would be one s two, two s two.
2:06
So still three positive charges in the nucleus,
2:09
two electrons in the one s orbital,
2:12
but now we've added an electron,
2:13
so we have four electrons total,
2:16
two in the two s orbital.
2:19
So let me highlight the electron that we added in magenta.
2:22
So this is the electron that we added
2:24
to a neutral lithium atom.
2:27
And this electron, we know, is shielded
2:30
from the full positive three charge of the nucleus
2:32
by our two core electrons in here, right?
2:35
So like charges repel.
2:37
It's also going to be repelled a little bit
2:39
by this electron, that's also in the two s orbital.
2:43
So this electron's going to repel this one as well.
2:47
But, there is an attractive force
2:49
between our positively charged nucleus
2:51
and our negative charge on the electron.
2:55
So this electron that we added
2:57
still feels an attractive force that's pulling on it
3:00
from the nucleus.
3:03
And so, if you add this fourth electron,
3:06
energy is given off.
3:08
And since energy is given off, this is going to have
3:11
a negative value for the electron affinity.
3:14
For adding an electron to a neutral lithium atom,
3:17
it turns out to be -60 kiloJoules per mol.
3:22
So energy is released when an electron is added,
3:26
and that is because the electron that we added
3:29
is still able to be attracted to the charged nucleus.
3:33
So if the nucleus has an attraction for the added electron,
3:36
you're going to get a negative value
3:38
for the electron affinity.
3:40
Or that's one way to measure electron affinity.
3:43
Note that the lithium anion is larger
3:46
than the neutral lithium atom.
3:48
It's just hard to represent it here with those diagrams.
3:51
So as long as the added electron
3:53
feels an attractive force from the nucleus,
3:55
energy is given off.
3:58
Let's look at one more comparison
4:00
between ionization energy and electron affinity.
4:03
In ionization energy, since the outer electron here
4:06
is attracted to the nucleus, we have to work hard
4:10
to pull that electron away.
4:12
It takes energy for us to rip away that electron.
4:15
And since it takes us energy, we have to do work,
4:18
and the energy is positive, in terms of ionization energy.
4:22
But for electron affinity, since the electron
4:25
that we're adding is attracted
4:26
to the positive charge of the nucleus,
4:28
we don't have to force this,
4:30
we don't have to do any work.
4:31
Energy is given off in this process, and that's why
4:34
it's a negative value for the electron affinity.
4:38
Electron affinities don't have to be negative.
4:41
For some atoms, there's actually no attraction
4:43
for an extra electron.
4:45
Let's take neon, for example.
4:47
Neon has an electron configuration
4:49
of one s two, two s two, and two p six.
4:54
So there's a total of two plus two plus six,
4:57
or 10 electrons, and a positive 10 charge in the nucleus
5:00
for a neutral neon atom.
5:03
So let's say this is our nucleus here,
5:05
with a positive 10 charge, 10 protons.
5:07
And then we have our 10 electrons here,
5:10
surrounding our nucleus.
5:13
So this is our neutral neon atom.
5:16
If we try to add an electron,
5:18
so here let's add an electron.
5:20
So we still have our 10 protons in the nucleus.
5:23
We still have our 10 electrons,
5:25
which would now be our core electrons.
5:27
To add a new electron, this would be the neon anion here,
5:32
so one s two, two s two, two p six.
5:36
We've filled the second energy level.
5:38
To add an electron, we must go to a new energy level.
5:42
So it would be the third energy level,
5:44
it would be an s orbital,
5:46
and there would be one electron in that orbital.
5:48
So, here is, let's say this is the electron
5:51
that we just added.
5:52
So we have to try to add an electron to our neon atom.
5:57
But if you think about the effective nuclear charge
6:01
that this electron in magenta feels,
6:04
alright, so the effective nuclear charge,
6:06
that's equal to the atomic number, or the number of protons,
6:09
and from that, you subtract
6:11
the number of shielding electrons.
6:13
Since we have 10 protons in the nucleus, this would be 10.
6:17
And our shielding electrons would be 10, as well.
6:20
So those 10 electrons shield this added electron
6:23
from the full positive 10 charge of the nucleus.
6:28
And for a quick calculation, this tells us
6:30
that the effective nuclear charge is zero.
6:34
And this is, you know, simplifying things
6:36
a little bit, but you can think
6:37
about this outer electron that we tried to add,
6:40
of not having any attraction for the nucleus.
6:43
These 10 electrons shield it completely
6:45
from the positive 10 charge.
6:47
And since there's no attraction for this electron,
6:50
energy is not given off in this process.
6:53
Actually, it would take energy
6:55
to force an electron onto neon.
6:58
So if you wrote something out here,
7:00
and if we said, alright, I'm trying to go from,
7:02
I'm trying to add an electron to neon,
7:04
to turn it into an anion.
7:06
Instead of giving off energy,
7:08
this process would take energy.
7:10
So we would have to force,
7:12
we would have to try to force this to occur.
7:15
So it takes energy to force an electron
7:17
on a neutral atom of neon.
7:19
And we say that neon has no affinity for an electron.
7:24
So it's unreactive, it's a noble gas, and this is one way
7:28
to explain why noble gases are unreactive.
7:31
This anion that we intended
7:33
isn't going to stay around for long.
7:35
So it takes energy to force this onto our neutral neon atom.
7:39
So you could say that the electron affinity
7:41
is positive here, it takes energy.
7:44
But usually, you don't see positive values
7:46
for electron affinity, for this sort of situation.
7:49
At least, most textbooks I've looked at would just say
7:51
the electron affinity of neon is zero,
7:54
since I believe it is hard to measure
7:57
the actual value of this.
7:59
Here we have the elements in the second period
8:01
on the periodic table, and let's look
8:02
at their electron affinities.
8:04
We've already seen that adding an electron
8:06
to a neutral atom of lithium
8:08
gives off 60 kiloJoules per mol.
8:12
Next, we have beryllium, with a zero value
8:14
for the electron affinity.
8:16
That means it actually takes energy.
8:18
So this number is actually positive,
8:20
and it takes energy to add an electron
8:23
to a neutral atom of beryllium.
8:25
So if you think about going from a neutral atom of beryllium
8:28
to form the beryllium anion,
8:30
when we look at electron configurations,
8:33
neutral atom of beryllium is one s two, two s two,
8:36
and so, to form the negatively charged beryllium anion,
8:39
it would be one s two, two s two,
8:42
and to add the extra electron, it must go
8:45
into a two p orbital, which is of higher energy.
8:50
And so, this is actually the same thing, or very similar,
8:53
to neon, which we just discussed.
8:56
For neon, the electron configuration was one s two,
8:59
two s two, two p six, and to add an extra electron,
9:04
we had to go to the third energy level.
9:06
We had to open up a new shell.
9:08
And the electron that we added was effectively screened
9:11
from the full nuclear charge by these other electrons.
9:15
And a similar thing happens here for the beryllium anion.
9:18
To add this extra electron, we have to open up
9:21
a higher energy p orbital.
9:23
This electron is, on average, further away from the nucleus,
9:26
and is effectively shielded from the full positive
9:29
charge of the nucleus, and therefore, there's no affinity
9:33
for this added electron.
9:35
So there's no affinity for this electron,
9:37
so it takes energy to form the beryllium anion.
9:41
And that's why we see this zero value here for beryllium.
9:44
Beryllium has no value for electron affinity,
9:47
or, it's actually a very positive value,
9:49
and we just say it has a zero value.
9:51
Next, let's look at boron here.
9:53
So this gives off -27 kiloJoules per mol.
9:56
And we can see a little bit of a trend here,
9:59
as we go from boron to carbon to oxygen to fluorine.
10:04
So as we go across the period on the periodic table,
10:10
more energy is given off, and therefore,
10:13
fluorine has the most affinity for an electron.
10:17
So as we go across a period, we get an increase
10:20
in the electron affinity.
10:22
So the negative sign just means that energy is given off,
10:25
so we're really just looking at the magnitude.
10:27
More energy is given off when you add
10:29
an electron to a neutral atom of fluorine,
10:32
than if you add an electron to a neutral atom of oxygen.
10:37
And we can explain this general trend
10:39
in terms of effective nuclear charge.
10:41
As we go across our period, we also have an increase
10:45
in the effective nuclear charge.
10:48
And if the added electron is feeling more of a pull
10:51
from the nucleus, which is what we mean here
10:54
by increased effective nuclear charge,
10:57
more energy will be given off when we add that electron.
11:01
So this idea explains the general trend
11:04
we see for electron affinity, as you go across a period,
11:08
we get an increase in the electron affinity.
11:11
We've already talked about beryllium as an exception,
11:14
neon as an exception, but what about nitrogen in here?
11:18
We can see that nitrogen doesn't really have
11:21
an affinity for an electron, and you'll see
11:24
many different values for this one,
11:25
depending on which textbook you're looking in.
11:28
But if we look at some electron configurations
11:30
really quickly, we can try to explain this.
11:33
So, for nitrogen, the electron configuration
11:37
is one s two, two s two, and then two p three.
11:42
So if we draw out our orbitals,
11:44
let's just say this is the two s orbital,
11:46
and then these are the three two p orbitals.
11:49
So we'll just do these electrons here.
11:51
Two electrons in the two s orbital,
11:53
and then we have three electrons in the p orbital.
11:56
So let's draw those in there.
11:58
If we try to add an electron to a neutral nitrogen atom,
12:02
we're adding an electron to one of these orbitals,
12:05
which already has an electron in it.
12:08
So adding an electron to one of these orbitals, right,
12:12
the added electron would be repelled
12:14
by the electron that was in there to start with.
12:16
And this is the reason that you usually see in textbooks
12:19
for the fact that this does not follow the trend.
12:22
Nitrogen doesn't have an affinity for one added electron.
12:27
So after going through all of that,
12:28
it's obvious that electron affinity
12:30
is a little more complicated than ionization energy.
12:34
In ionization energy, we had a pretty clear trend,
12:36
and it was a little easier to explain why.
12:39
For electron affinity, going across a period
12:42
on the periodic table, we see a little bit of a trend,
12:45
but there are many exceptions to this,
12:47
and perhaps our explanations are a little bit too simplistic
12:51
to explain actually what's going on.
12:54
But across a period, you do see a little bit of a trend.
12:57
Going down a group is much harder.
12:59
You see more inconsistencies, and it's not really even worth
13:02
going over a general trend for that.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,6WIBa32o63Q,

0:00
Let's imagine we have a huge cloud
0:02
of hydrogen atoms floating in space.
0:05
Huge, and when I say huge cloud, huge both in distance
0:08
and in mass.
0:09
If you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,
0:11
it would just be this really, really massive thing.
0:15
So you have this huge cloud.
0:16
Well, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually
0:20
attracted to each other.
0:21
It's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.
0:25
But it would slowly affect these atoms.
0:27
And they would slowly draw close to each other.
0:30
It would slowly condense.
0:31
They'd slowly move towards the center
0:34
of mass of all of the atoms.
0:37
They'd slowly move in.
0:39
So if we fast forward, this cloud's
0:42
going to get denser and denser.
0:46
And the hydrogen atoms are going to start
0:48
bumping into each other and rubbing up against each other
0:51
and interacting with each other.
0:53
And so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.
0:56
Now remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.
0:58
So the temperature is going up.
1:03
And it'll-- they'll keep condensing.
1:05
They'll just keep condensing and condensing
1:07
until something really interesting happens.
1:09
So let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here
1:12
in the center.
1:16
And there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.
1:19
It's really dense.
1:20
I could never draw the actual number of atoms here.
1:22
This is really to give you an idea.
1:24
There's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,
1:28
from everything that wants to get
1:29
to that center of mass of our entire cloud.
1:32
The temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.
1:38
And at that point, something neat happens.
1:40
And to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,
1:43
let's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.
1:46
A hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just
1:48
going to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.
1:49
So the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.
1:50
If you want to think about a hydrogen atom,
1:52
it also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.
1:57
And let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.
1:59
And obviously this distance isn't to scale.
2:02
This distance is also not to scale.
2:04
Atoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms
2:05
are actually much, much, much, much smaller
2:07
than the actual radius of an atom.
2:10
And so is the electron.
2:11
But anyway, this just gives you an idea.
2:13
So we know from the Coulomb forces,
2:14
from electromagnetic forces, that these two positively
2:17
charged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere
2:20
near each other.
2:22
But we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four
2:25
forces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,
2:28
that if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures
2:31
and huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close
2:35
enough to each other, then all of a sudden,
2:37
the strong force will overtake.
2:39
It's much stronger than the Coulomb force.
2:41
And then these two hydrogens will actually--
2:43
these nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?
2:48
Well, anyway, they would actually fuse together.
2:50
And so that is what actually happens
2:53
once this gets hot and dense enough.
2:57
You now have enough pressure and enough temperature
2:59
to overcome the Coulomb force and bring
3:02
these protons close enough to each other for fusion
3:05
to occur, for fusion ignition.
3:12
And the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.
3:14
It's not ignition.
3:15
It's not combustion in the traditional sense.
3:16
It's not like you're burning a carbon molecule
3:20
in the presence of oxygen.
3:22
It's not combustion.
3:23
It's ignition.
3:24
And the reason why it's called ignition
3:25
is because when two of these protons,
3:27
or two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus
3:32
has a slightly smaller mass.
3:35
And so in the first stage of this,
3:36
you actually have two protons under enough pressure--
3:42
obviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--
3:44
with enough pressure they get close enough.
3:46
And then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.
3:51
One of these guys degrades into a neutron.
3:56
And the resulting mass of the combined protons
3:59
is lower than the mass of each of the original.
4:01
By a little bit, but that little bit of mass
4:04
results in a lot of energy-- plus energy.
4:11
And this energy is why we call it ignition.
4:13
And so what this energy does is it provides
4:16
a little bit of outward pressure,
4:17
so that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.
4:21
So once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.
4:24
And then that energy provides outward pressure
4:26
to balance what is now a star.
4:30
So now we are at where we actually
4:32
have the ignition at the center.
4:35
We have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying
4:39
to get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.
4:43
Now, what is the hydrogen being fused into?
4:46
Well, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just
4:50
kind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens
4:54
in stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.
5:00
I have trouble spelling.
5:01
Which is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.
5:03
This is still hydrogen because it
5:04
has one proton and one neutron now.
5:07
It is not helium yet.
5:08
This does not have two-- it does not have two protons.
5:12
But then the deuterium keeps fusing.
5:14
And then we eventually end up with helium.
5:19
And we can even see that on the periodic table.
5:21
Oh, I lost my periodic table.
5:22
Well, I'll show you the next video.
5:23
But we know hydrogen in its atomic state
5:30
has an atomic number of 1.
5:32
And it also has a mass of 1.
5:34
It only has one nucleon in its nucleus.
5:38
But it's being fused.
5:39
It goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,
5:42
which is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.
5:46
And then that eventually gets fused--
5:48
and I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--
5:50
into helium.
5:51
And by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.
5:56
So it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,
5:58
in particular, that isotope of helium--
6:00
it has an atomic mass of 4.
6:03
And this process releases a ton of energy.
6:06
Because the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced
6:09
is slightly lower than four times the atomic mass
6:15
of each of the constituent hydrogens.
6:17
So all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it
6:21
needs super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--
6:24
keeps the star from collapsing.
6:28
And once a star is in this stage,
6:31
once it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen
6:35
in its core, where the pressure and the temperature
6:37
is the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.
6:41
This is now a main sequence star.
6:48
And that's actually where the sun is right now.
6:50
Now there's questions of, well, what if there just
6:53
wasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?
6:56
And there actually are things that
6:57
never get to quite that threshold
6:59
to fuse all the way into helium.
7:00
There are a few things that don't quite
7:02
make the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.
7:05
So they are generating some of their heat.
7:06
Or there are even smaller objects
7:08
that just get to the point there's
7:10
a huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually
7:13
occurring inside of the core.
7:15
And something like Jupiter would be an example.
7:17
And you could go several masses above Jupiter
7:20
where you get something like that.
7:21
So you have to reach a certain threshold
7:23
where the mass, where the pressure and the temperature
7:25
due to the heavy mass, get so large that you
7:27
start this fusion.
7:28
And-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,
7:31
the slower the fusion will occur.
7:33
But if you're super massive, the fusion
7:35
will occur really, really fast.
7:37
So that's the general idea of just how stars get formed
7:40
and why they don't collapse on themselves
7:43
and why they are these kind of balls
7:45
of fusion reactions existing in the universe.
7:48
In the next few videos, we'll talk
7:50
about what happens once that hydrogen fuel in the core
7:54
starts to run out.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,i-NNWI8Ccas,
khan_video_4LmIyMyAuN0_6,How far can we see into space with the naked eye?,MCQ,"•
0:00
What I want to do in this video is talk a little bit
0:02
about quasars.
0:06
And that's a short form for quasi-stellar radio sources.
0:16
And this name is just a byproduct
0:18
of the first observations of quasars.
0:20
Because all they looked like were
0:22
these kind of point-like sources of electromagnetic radiation,
0:26
mainly in the radio part of the spectrum.
0:29
So that's why we called them quasi-stellar radio sources.
0:32
Now, it turns out that they are neither stars, or even
0:36
quasi-stellar.
0:37
And actually, their main energy isn't even
0:39
being released in the radio band of
0:43
the electromagnetic spectrum.
0:44
They're far more energetic than that.
0:47
What they really are are the active nucleuses of galaxies.
0:52
So let's think about that a little bit.
0:54
So if we have a supermassive black hole
0:56
at the center of a galaxy-- so let
0:58
me draw that right over here.
1:00
So that's our supermassive black hole.
1:02
And maybe that's the surface of the event horizon
1:04
of the supermassive black hole.
1:06
The actual mass of the black hole
1:08
is in the center of that event horizon.
1:11
If there is material that's passing by this black hole,
1:14
it's going to get attracted to it.
1:15
And it's going to form an accretion disk around it.
1:19
This material is going to start rotating
1:21
around this black hole.
1:22
And some of it, if it doesn't have enough velocity,
1:25
is going to actually fall into the black hole.
1:27
So you have all of this material going around the black hole.
1:32
And some of it, if it doesn't have enough angular velocity
1:35
and not enough to orbit around the black hole,
1:38
it's actually going to fall in.
1:41
Let me label this.
1:42
This is the accretion disk.
1:47
So as things are getting faster and faster as they fall closer
1:51
and closer to this black hole, and bumping
1:53
into each other more and more, that gravitational potential
1:56
energy from things falling into it
1:58
is being turned into actual energy, actual temperature.
2:02
And so what you have is things start
2:05
to get really, unbelievably hot near the surface.
2:12
They get hotter and hotter as they fall closer and closer
2:15
to that event horizon.
2:17
And so near the event horizon itself,
2:19
things are so intense that they're actually
2:23
releasing high-frequency electromagnetic radiation,
2:27
mainly in the X-ray part of the spectrum.
2:30
Now, I want to been very clear.
2:32
So there's two things here.
2:33
One is when you learn about quasars,
2:36
or when I first was exposed to quasars in like a Nova special,
2:42
they make you think that the quasar, that the radiation is
2:44
somehow being released by the black hole itself.
2:48
And I would scratch my head because I was just
2:50
told that nothing can escape the event horizon of a black hole,
2:53
including electromagnetic radiation.
2:56
So how could that be being emitted by the black hole?
2:59
And the answer is, it's not being
3:00
emitted by the black hole.
3:02
It's being emitted by the matter in the accretion disk that
3:05
hasn't quite gotten to the event horizon yet.
3:08
Once it's inside of the event horizon,
3:11
any electromagnetic radiation that it might emit
3:14
will not be able to escape the black hole anymore,
3:17
will not be able to escape the actual event horizon.
3:20
So all of this is from the accretion disc
3:22
around the supermassive black hole.
3:27
And the other question that used to pop in my mind
3:29
is why does it come out at these kind of perpendicular,
3:34
orthogonal to the plane of the actual accretion disk?
3:40
And at least my logic tells me, well, things
3:42
aren't going to pop out-- they're not
3:44
going to pop out along the direction of the accretion disk
3:46
because then they're going to be absorbed by other things.
3:48
In fact, that's what's going to cause other things to get
3:50
heated up closer to the actual event horizon.
3:55
So any energy that's going out in that direction
3:57
is just going to be absorbed and make other things hotter.
4:01
And only when you go roughly perpendicular to the plane
4:04
of the accretion disk is that energy
4:06
allowed to kind of go and transmit freely into space.
4:10
Now, I want to be very clear.
4:11
Quasars, these are the most luminous things
4:15
that we know of in the universe.
4:26
The brightest-- or actually, many quasars
4:29
are on the order of a trillion suns in luminosity.
4:32
So they can be brighter than an entire galaxy.
4:35
And that's just coming from material
4:37
around a fairly small region of space,
4:41
much, much, much smaller than an actual galaxy.
4:43
It's the very center.
4:44
It's kind of just the galactic core.
4:46
Now another interesting thing about quasars,
4:49
and this kind of gives credence to this notion
4:51
of a constantly changing universe,
4:53
and even to some degree the Big Bang itself,
4:56
is you have these supermassive black holes that
4:59
may be formed shortly after the Big Bang.
5:01
Now you can imagine, at an early stage in the universe's
5:04
development there would have been a lot of mass that
5:08
would have been near these black holes, that didn't have quite
5:10
the velocities to be able to escape them or be
5:12
able to orbit around them.
5:14
And so these would actually start
5:15
falling into the black hole.
5:17
And then over time, all of the mass that
5:19
had to fall into the black hole, into the supermassive black
5:22
hole, will have fallen into the supermassive black hole.
5:25
And if you imagine at some future period of time,
5:27
you should still have the supermassive black hole.
5:30
But all you should see is mostly things orbiting around it.
5:34
Anything that had to fall into it,
5:35
would have already fallen into it.
5:37
So you're just going to see things orbiting around it.
5:40
And this is actually what we see if we look around us.
5:43
If we look at our Milky Way Galaxy,
5:44
we don't observe a lot of things falling in.
5:47
For example, the Milky Way Galaxy
5:51
does not have an active nucleus, an active core.
5:55
It is not currently a quasar, the center of the Milky Way
5:58
Galaxy.
5:59
The supermassive black hole there is not,
6:02
I guess we could say, digesting, is not digesting or consuming
6:06
material.
6:06
But you could imagine at some point in the Milky Way's past,
6:09
there might have been a lot of material
6:11
that didn't have quite the velocity to be able to orbit.
6:15
And so that was consumed.
6:16
And as it was consumed, it would emit all of this X-ray
6:21
radiation and could be observed as a quasar.
6:24
And that's actually what we observe.
6:25
The closest quasars-- and we've observed
6:27
more than 200,000 quasars-- the closest quasars are
6:32
on the order of 780 million light years away.
6:39
So what does that mean?
6:39
We don't observe quasars closer than 700 million light years.
6:43
So what that tells us is, at least
6:46
in our region of the universe, the most recent quasars
6:49
were 780 million years in the past.
6:53
When we look at closer parts of the universe-- let me draw,
6:57
let's say this is the observable universe.
7:00
This is us.
7:01
So we only start to observe quasars
7:03
at a certain distance away from us.
7:05
And that distance is actually also
7:06
a certain time in the past.
7:08
Because it took the light 780 million years to get to us.
7:10
And actually, most of the quasars
7:12
are more than 3 billion light years away.
7:15
Which tells us that they only existed more than 3
7:18
billion years in the past, at a younger
7:22
stage of the actual universe, when there
7:25
was actual material for these supermassive black holes
7:28
to consume at the center of galaxies.
7:30
You move closer in time to us, and most of that material
7:34
has actually been consumed.
7:36
And we just have material orbiting
7:38
around these supermassive black holes, which we call galaxies.
7:42
And so we don't observe quasars anymore.
7:45
And just to give an idea.
7:46
I mean these are, as everything we learn in cosmology,
7:49
kind of these mind-bending concepts,
7:50
unbelievable distances, unbelievable masses,
7:54
unbelievable brightnesses, I guess you could think about it.
7:57
But just to give a sense, the brightest quasars,
7:59
the brightest known quasars, devour
8:02
on the order of 1,000 solar masses per year.
8:11
So that's on the order of 10 Earths, 10 Earths per second,
8:16
if I did my math right.
8:19
10 Earths per second are being devoured
8:23
by the brightest quasars.
8:25
And it's that energy of that mass that's acreting around it
8:30
that's generating all of that energy.
8:32
And actually, I should say-- I shouldn't even
8:34
talk about it in the present tense.
8:36
This happened in the past.
8:38
We're just observing it now.
8:40
For all we know, the rest of the universe
8:42
looks fairly similar to the way our universe does.
8:44
And so there really aren't that many quasars around.
8:47
Although the other side of the coin might be,
8:49
even though most of the material has already
8:51
been consumed, maybe even by our own supermassive black hole
8:54
in the center of the Milky Way, at some point in the future,
8:58
maybe it will be able to consume on some more stellar material,
9:01
some more-- well, any type of material in the future.
9:06
And that might happen about 4 or 5 billion years
9:08
in the future when we actually collide with the Andromeda
9:10
Galaxy.

0:00
- Let's now jump into understanding meiosis in some depth.
0:04
So let's start with the germ cell.
0:07
As we mentioned already, a germ cell is a cell that
0:10
it can either go to mitosis to produce other germ cells
0:14
or it can undergo meiosis in order to produce gametes.
0:18
So this is a germ cell right over here.
0:21
Let me draw the nuclear membrane.
0:25
Let me draw the nucleus larger because that's where
0:28
we care a lot about the chromosomes in it.
0:31
And let me draw a centrosome
0:33
which will play a role later on.
0:35
I wanna do that in ...
0:37
Let's see, I'll do that in this blue color.
0:39
Each centromosome has two centrioles in it.
0:43
I just wanna clarify some of the terminology.
0:45
And in the mitosis videos, I focused on
0:49
cells of an organism, I just kind of made it up,
0:52
that had two chromosomes, that had a diploid number of two
0:56
that had one homologous pair, that had one chromosome
0:59
from each of its parents.
1:01
For this video, I'm gonna focus on a species,
1:04
not human beings, that would have
1:06
23 pairs or 46 chromosomes.
1:08
I'm gonna focus on a species that has,
1:10
that's diploid number is four.
1:13
And so, let's say it has two chromosomes from the father.
1:17
And let me do that.
1:18
I'll do that in this orange color.
1:20
Now, I'll do that in the chromatin,
1:21
I'll kind of depict the chromatin sate,
1:23
it's kind of unwound.
1:24
So maybe it has a long one from the father
1:25
and it has a short one from the father.
1:28
And then it has homologous chromosomes from the mother.
1:31
So it would have the long one from the mother
1:33
and it would have the short one
1:37
from the mother just like that.
1:39
And obviously this is a huge simplification
1:42
but hopefully this discuss the point across.
1:44
So here, it has a diploid number of chromosomes.
1:47
So this is, let me write this down.
1:50
This is diploid
1:55
number is equal to,
1:57
we have four chromosomes.
2:00
And then this thing, this germ cell.
2:02
Let me write this down.
2:02
This is a germ cell right over here.
2:05
It will go through interphase.
2:08
So let me draw that.
2:09
So it will go through interface in which
2:13
it grows and it can replicate its DNA and its centrosome.
2:18
And so, let me draw that.
2:19
So after it goes through interface,
2:22
I wanna use my space carefully because I have a lot
2:24
of steps to go through.
2:26
After it goes through interface, I am going to have
2:31
in my nucleus here,
2:36
my DNA will have replicated.
2:38
So this long chromosome from my father,
2:42
now all the DNA will have replicated so
2:46
it may look something like that.
2:49
And it's attached
2:54
at a centromere,
2:56
All these centro words,
2:58
at a centromere right here.
2:59
But I'm still trying to draw it in kind of
3:01
the chromatin state.
3:02
It's actually all spread out.
3:03
It's not bunched up so that you can see it very clearly
3:06
as these X's in a simple microscope.
3:10
So it's just replicated.
3:11
And after replicating, it is still one chromosome.
3:14
It has twice the genetic material
3:16
but it is still one chromosome.
3:19
That one chromosome is now made up of
3:21
two sister chromatids.
3:24
we talked a lot about that in the mitosis video,
3:27
but it doesn't hurt to reinforce
3:28
because it can get a little bit confusing.
3:30
And then you have that shorter chromosome from the father
3:34
and then that also replicates into two sister chromatids
3:40
attached at a centromere.
3:43
So these are still two chromosomes from the father.
3:45
It has twice the amount of DNA but it's containing
3:48
the same information,
3:49
just duplicate versions of that same information.
3:52
And the same thing's gonna happen from the mother.
3:54
You had that long chromosome from the mother,
3:57
homologous to this right over here.
3:59
It's going to replicate.
4:01
So it's now going to be two sister chromatids.
4:06
And then you have a short strand from the mother
4:08
that was homologous to this one from your father.
4:11
And that's also gonna replicate.
4:13
And so, it's like that.
4:14
And at the end of interface,
4:15
it would actually all be spread out.
4:18
Once again, it won't be bunched up into these
4:20
clearly discernible X's.
4:22
I drew them a little bit that way, otherwise,
4:23
because you would have trouble seeing how that replicated.
4:26
And we also have replicated our centrosome
4:30
as we've gone through interface.
4:33
Now, we are ready.
4:34
In fact, now we are ready for either mitosis or meiosis.
4:38
But as I said, the focus of this video
4:40
is going to be meiosis so let's do some meiosis.
4:45
So the first phase,
4:46
so the first several phases we call meiosis I.
4:49
And the beginning of meiosis I is prophase I.
4:52
So let's see what happens in prophase I.
4:55
So prophase I.
4:57
And so, let me draw the cell right over here.
5:02
So prophase I.
5:04
A couple of things happen.
5:06
The nuclear membrane begins to dissolve.
5:09
This is very similar to prophase
5:12
when we're looking at mitosis.
5:15
So the nuclear envelope begins to dissolve.
5:19
These things start to maybe migrate a little bit.
5:22
So these characters are trying to go at different ends.
5:27
And the DNA starts to bunch up into kind of
5:31
its condensed form.
5:32
So now I can draw it.
5:34
So now I can start to draw it as proper.
5:37
So this is the one from the father
5:42
right over here.
5:43
And this is the one from the mother.
5:46
And I'm drawing, I'm overlapping on purpose
5:48
because something very interesting happens
5:50
especially in meiosis.
5:52
So it's the mother right over here.
5:57
Let me see.
5:58
Let's now do the centromere in blue now.
5:59
That's the centromere.
6:02
Now this is the shorter ones from the father.
6:07
These are the shorter ones from the mother.
6:10
And actually, let me just do draw them on opposite sides
6:12
just to show that they don't have to,
6:14
the ones from the father aren't always
6:15
on the left hand side.
6:16
So this is the shorter one from the father.
6:20
They couldn't be all on the left hand side
6:21
but doesn't this all they have to be.
6:23
And this is the shorter one from the mother.
6:24
And I will draw this overlapping although they could have.
6:27
Shorter one from the mother.
6:29
And once again, each of these, this is a homologous pair,
6:31
that's a homologous pair over there.
6:33
Now, the DNA has been replicated so
6:37
in each of the chromosomes in a homologous pair,
6:40
you have two sister chromatids.
6:42
And so, in this entire homologous pair,
6:44
you have four chromatids.
6:47
And so, this is sometimes called a tetrad.
6:49
So let me just give ourselves some terminology.
6:53
So this right over here is called a tetrad
6:56
or often called a tetrad.
6:59
Now, the reason why I drew this overlapping
7:01
is when we are in prophase I in meiosis I.
7:04
Let me label this.
7:05
This is prophase I.
7:09
You can get some genetic recombination,
7:11
some homologous recombination.
7:13
Once again, this is homologous pair.
7:16
One chromosome from the father
7:18
that I've gotten from the father.
7:19
The species or the cell got it from its father's cell
7:22
and one from the mother.
7:24
And they're homologous.
7:26
They might contain different base pairs,
7:28
different actual DNA, but they code for the same genes.
7:34
Over simplification, but in a similar place on each of these
7:38
it might code for eye color or I don't know,
7:41
personality.
7:42
Nothing is that simple in how tall you get
7:45
and it's not that simple in DNA but just to give you
7:48
an idea of how it is.
7:49
And the reason why I overlapped them like this
7:51
is to show how the recombination can occur.
7:54
So actually, let me zoom in.
7:56
So this is the one from the father.
7:59
Once again, it's on the condensed form.
8:00
This is one chromosome made up of two sister chromatids
8:05
right over here.
8:06
And I drew the centromere,
8:08
not to be confused with centrosomes.
8:10
That's where they are, those sister chromatids are attached.
8:13
And then, I will draw the homologous
8:17
chromosome from the mother.
8:19
So the homologous chromosome from the mother
8:23
just like that.
8:28
Homologous chromosome from the mother.
8:30
And the recombination can occur at a point
8:33
right over here.
8:35
So after you're done with the recombination,
8:38
this side might look something more like this.
8:41
So let me draw it like this.
8:46
So, they essentially break up
8:48
and they swap those little sections.
8:50
There's one way to think about it.
8:52
So this one, we'll now have a little piece from the mother.
8:56
It might code for similar genes.
8:58
But now it contains the mother's genetic information.
9:00
And then this one over here
9:06
will now have the piece.
9:10
And you could say even homologous piece from the father.
9:16
Let me do these two centromeres.
9:18
And this is really interesting.
9:21
All the time, there couldn't be recombination
9:23
and often times it can lead to kind of none optimal things,
9:26
nonsense code and DNA.
9:28
It might lead to a nonfunctional organism.
9:31
But this happens fairly common in the meiosis
9:36
and it's a way, once again, to get more variation.
9:38
We've talked about sexual reproduction before.
9:40
And sexual reproduction introduces variation
9:43
into a population.
9:44
And this, obviously, when different sperms
9:46
find different eggs that introduces variation.
9:48
But then, even amongst homologous pairs
9:50
you can actually have exchange between this chromosome.
9:54
And that's interesting because as we mentioned,
9:57
each of these chromosomes,
9:58
they code for a bunch of different genes.
10:00
And a gene is kinda looking code for a specific
10:03
or a set of proteins.
10:05
So this right over here,
10:09
and this is what I'm about to say is gonna be huge
10:11
over simplification.
10:12
Maybe right over here you coded for eye color
10:15
or it was related to, or it helps code for eye color.
10:18
And then you got that from your dad.
10:19
And here, it helped code for eye color.
10:21
And you got that from your mom.
10:22
Your mom might have trended you towards a lighter eye color
10:26
and your dad might have trended you
10:27
towards a darker eye color.
10:28
But now, the one from your mom is on this chromosome,
10:32
this gene, and then the one
10:34
or they've both the same gene.
10:35
They're just different allele.
10:36
They're coding for different variance of that gene.
10:38
And then the allele from your dad is over here.
10:41
And once again, some people get confused with genes
10:44
and chromosomes and all of these.
10:45
Each of these chromosomes contain a bunch of genes.
10:48
These are very long DNA molecules.
10:50
This code for a bunch of different genes.
10:53
So gene will be a little section of here that could code for
10:57
a particular protein.
10:59
So that's what happens in prophase I.
11:01
In prophase I, you have this condensation
11:05
of your chromosomes, of your homologous pairs.
11:09
You can have this recombination.
11:12
And it's really interesting, this recombination
11:14
doesn't tend to happen at just random points
11:16
that would kind of break the genetic information.
11:20
It tends to happen at fairly clean points.
11:22
And the places where this breakup is happening,
11:25
these are called the plural,
11:27
if you just talk about one point, it's a chiasma,
11:30
or if you're talking about the plural, it's chiasmata.
11:32
Sounds like it could be a horror movie.
11:34
So, chiasma.
11:36
Chiasma.
11:37
And the fact that they happen,
11:38
they tend to happen fairly clearly, this is once again,
11:41
kind of the beauty of the universe or at least
11:43
of biology is that through
11:46
billions of years of evolution, these things have kind of
11:50
optimized for more variation and to happen
11:54
in fairly clean ways.
11:56
So I'm gonna leave this video right there.
11:58
I know I just got to prophase I.
11:59
But this was a really, really important idea of
12:01
this homologous recombination or this chromosomal crossover
12:06
that we see right over here.
12:07
And then from there, we can continue
12:09
through the rest of meiosis I and then meiosis II.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,04gQ0bQu6xk,
khan_video_xaz5ftvZCyI_108,Is the Helper T Cell covered in T Cell Receptor Sites?,MCQ,"•
0:00
Now that we've touched on all of the major players in the
0:02
specific immune system, what I thought I would do in this
0:05
video is do a summary so it all fits
0:08
together a little bit.
0:09
So the first person or character we got exposed to
0:12
was the B cell, which I always do in blue.
0:18
And what made that interesting is that every B cell has its
0:22
own specific-- or they have membrane bound antibodies, but
0:28
for each B cell, the membrane bound antibodies on each
0:33
specific B cell had its own variable portion.
0:36
So this B cell-- it'll be variable right like that.
0:41
And if I were to draw another B cell right here, I would
0:45
draw the variable portion a little bit different.
0:47
This is why different actual B cells will respond to
0:51
different antigens or different pathogens that have
0:54
entered our system.
0:55
And a B cell gets activated-- let's talk about what happens
1:05
when it gets activated or what needs to happen.
1:10
It needs binding of the pathogen onto one of these
1:15
membrane bound antibodies.
1:28
But that's not all.
1:29
I mean, sometimes that's all you need, but usually you also
1:33
need to be stimulated by a T cell.
1:41
And you might say, where's the helper T cell
1:44
stimulate this guy?
1:46
Well, B cells were also antigen presenting cells so
1:49
he'll suck this guy in, break him out, and present him on an
1:53
MHC II complex.
2:00
Let's say this is an MHC II complex.
2:03
This guy gets cut up, part of him gets presented right here,
2:06
and then an activated helper T cell whose variable portion of
2:12
their T cell receptor is specific to this could come
2:15
along and activate this character.
2:20
I'm not drawing that receptor well, but that right there is
2:24
a helper T cell and that is the B cell.
2:28
Now, once it's activated, it starts differentiating-- and
2:33
it starts cloning itself and it can either turn into
2:35
effector cells-- and this true of B cells or T cells.
2:41
Once they get activated, they keep cloning or they either
2:43
turn into effector cells or memory cells.
2:46
Memory cells stick around a lot longer so that in the
2:49
future you're going to have many more of this
2:51
version of B cells.
2:52
So if you get the same antigen or pathogen in the future, the
2:56
likelihood of it bumping into this type of B cell is going
2:59
to be higher so the response will occur faster.
3:02
The effector B cells produce-- they essentially turn into
3:10
antibody making machines.
3:12
So they'll say, gee, this antibody bonds to this antigen
3:16
that we have in the system now.
3:18
Let me just produce a ton of them.
3:20
So it starts building up all of the cellular machinery and
3:23
it starts producing antibodies like crazy.
3:26
I want to point out one thing that my wife pointed out to me
3:29
when I was-- she overheard me making the last video and
3:32
she's a fellow in hematology and a lot of hematology is
3:35
immunology.
3:36
So I definitely have to defer to her.
3:38
She is the expert on this.
3:41
In the last video, I kind of very hand-wavingly said, B
3:45
cells, once they get activated, if they're the
3:47
effector B cells, they produce antibodies.
3:49
I want to be very clear.
3:50
It is only the effector B cells that produce the
3:52
antibodies and the common term for them-- if someone were to
3:57
walk up to you and say, what cells in the body are
4:01
producing antibodies?
4:02
You wouldn't be wrong if you said effector B cells, but the
4:05
common term that people expect to hear are plasma cells.
4:12
Plasma cells and effector B cells are the same thing, but
4:16
normally when they say, what happens to a B cell when it
4:18
starts producing antibodies?
4:20
They then call it a plasma cell.
4:21
They don't call it a B cell anymore and I want to make
4:23
that very clear because my wife's like, well, I have
4:24
attendings that if they asked me, what cell in the body
4:28
produces antibodies?
4:29
And if you said, B cell, they would say, no, wrong.
4:32
It's a plasma cell-- or if you said effector B cell, they
4:34
wouldn't be happy.
4:35
They wanted to hear plasma cell.
4:36
This is the common term used in immunology and apparently
4:44
rheumatology circles.
4:45
Did I just say my wife is a hematologist?
4:47
No, no.
4:47
She's studying rheumatology.
4:48
I get confused with all the tologies sometimes.
4:51
Anyway, that's what the B cells do.
4:52
And these antibodies can then go attach things and mess up
4:55
viruses and antigen-- well, viruses or instances of
4:58
antigens and bacteria-- and tag them for pick up by
5:02
macrophages or other types of phagocytes.
5:04
Those were the B cells.
5:06
Then you have your T cells.
5:09
And here I'm going to talk about T cells a little bit
5:11
differently than I had in the last few videos.
5:14
Just to give a little bit more of a nuance-- so there's two
5:18
types of T cells.
5:19
You'll say, hey, they are helper T cells and cytotoxic T
5:21
cells-- and you're not wrong, but what I'm going to do is do
5:24
a slightly different differentiation just so that
5:28
you are familiar with these terms. So there's
5:30
two types of T cells.
5:33
All T cells have T cell receptors.
5:44
But they also have these other proteins on them and some of
5:50
them have these proteins called-- CD4 proteins and some
5:58
of them have what's called CD8.
6:09
So this one right here would be called a
6:11
CD8 positive T cell.
6:15
It has the CD8 proteins on it.
6:18
And this would be called a CD4 positive T cell.
6:23
I've never used these words before.
6:25
You're like, gee, where are these coming from?
6:27
Now, the CD4 receptor is the thing that wants to bind--
6:32
this is the thing that helps to go to the MHC II complexes.
6:38
So most CD4 T cells are helper T cells.
6:45
Most of the time-- and I want to make it very clear--
6:47
immunology is a very-- I mean, this field, people are
6:49
discovering things on a regular basis.
6:51
So people are still understanding these things and
6:53
there's all sorts of special cases, but usually when people
6:57
talk about CD4 positive T cells, they're talking about
7:00
helper T cells.
7:02
So this is normally going to be a helper T cell-- or you
7:07
could call it T helper, just like that.
7:10
Likewise, the CD8 proteins, these are attracted
7:13
to the MHC I complex.
7:21
This is what brings them to the cells that have the
7:24
cancer, that have expressed antigens
7:26
on their MHC I complex.
7:28
So most of the time CD8
7:30
positive T cells are cytotoxic.
7:39
And oftentimes, before a cell gets activated, they just
7:42
describe it as a CD4 T cell or a CD8 cell and after it
7:45
becomes activated and starts wanting to kill things, then
7:53
maybe you call it cytotoxic.
7:54
But this is all wordplay.
7:56
I think you get the general idea.
7:58
But just to remember what they do, this guy-- we just said he
8:04
wants to bond to the MHC complex, so you have MHC
8:08
complex plus presenting some antigen.
8:13
This is MHC I right here.
8:15
We learned in the last video, every nucleated cell in the
8:19
body expresses an MHC I complex.
8:22
So this is the case where something wacky is happening
8:25
inside this cell.
8:26
Maybe a virus has infected it.
8:28
Maybe it's cancerous.
8:30
It needs to die, otherwise it's going to keep producing
8:34
viruses if it's infected by a virus, or otherwise it's going
8:37
to keep dividing if it's a cancer and infect
8:39
the rest of the body.
8:40
So the CD8 kills infected cells.
8:45
I'll just say bad cells because I don't if you can--
8:48
cancer really isn't an infection.
8:50
Kills bad cells-- cells that are-- if you don't kill them,
8:53
they're going to keep producing viruses or keep
8:54
splitting and spreading the cancer, while T cells--
9:00
they're attracted to professional antigen
9:03
presenting cells.
9:04
And I always do a dendritic cell right here because those
9:06
are the best antigen presenting cells.
9:09
And they have MHC II complexes and it's digested some antigen
9:16
and it presents it right there and then that activates the
9:21
helper T cell.
9:22
And then when the helper T cell-- all of these guys, once
9:26
they're activated, they all go into effector-- they all start
9:31
differentiating into effector and memory cells.
9:35
An effector helper T cell does a couple of things.
9:40
So if we're talking about a helper T cell, it can activate
9:46
B cells and it also releases cytokines.
9:51
Let's say this guy gets activated.
9:53
He'll also start releasing these chemicals, which are
9:56
really those alarm bells that tell other people to really
10:00
get in gear-- maybe B cells and cytotoxic T cells start
10:03
proliferating more rigorously.
10:05
Actually, part of the cytotoxic T cell activation
10:10
can be assisted or kind of given a boost by these
10:14
cytokines-- of so by these alarm bells.
10:17
So this guy's the alarm ringer, while the CD8 cells or
10:24
the cytotoxic T cells-- in their effector
10:27
mode, they kill cells.
10:31
And of course in the memory mode, there's just a bunch of
10:33
copies of these originals around that are ready and more
10:36
than they were originally were, so that in the future if
10:39
something like this or something like this occurs,
10:41
they're going to be activated faster because they're going
10:43
to be bumped into faster.
10:45
So hopefully that clears up a little bit and I introduced a
10:47
little bit more tough terminology, but I really want
10:48
to stress my wife's point because she said, hey, you
10:50
don't want people out there saying B cells produce
10:53
antibodies even though it is effector B cells-- activated B
10:57
cells that have differentiated into effector B cells.
10:59
Those are what are producing antibodies-- because when they
11:01
go to medical school, people are going to want to hear

khan_video_JMsqu236bZo_11,What is incorrect about naming the molecule in that manner?,MCQ,"•
0:01
Voiceover: Let's look at how to name aldehydes and ketones
0:03
And let's start with an aldehyde and just to refresh
0:05
your memory about how to recognize an aldehyde
0:07
right there's a carbonyl present right.
0:09
A carbon double bonded to an oxygen
0:11
and there's an alkyl group on one side
0:13
and a hydrogen on the other side.
0:16
And so if we wanted to name this extremely
0:17
simple molecule over here on the left,
0:19
right we know there are total of four carbons
0:21
and it's an alkane, so we call this ""butane.""
0:24
So if we look at a four-carbon aldehyde
0:28
right over here on the right so when you number
0:31
an aldehyde you want to make
0:32
your carbonyl carbon number one.
0:33
So, one, two, three and four.
0:36
So we have a four-carbon aldehyde.
0:38
And what we're going to do is drop the E
0:40
and add ""-AL"" for aldehyde.
0:42
So this would be ""Butanal,"" right.
0:45
So a four-carbon aldehyde is ""butanal""
0:49
with an ""-AL""ending like that.
0:50
Let's go ahead and look at some more examples.
0:52
So once again we're going to number to give our
0:55
carbonyl carbon the lowest number possible.
0:58
And the aldehyde is going to take priority
1:01
over things like double-bonds and alkyl groups
1:05
and halogens and so let's go ahead
1:07
and look at this one on the top left here.
1:09
And so we want to number to give our carbonyl carbon
1:13
the lowest number possible so one, two,
1:15
three, four and five.
1:18
And so we have a five-carbon aldehyde right.
1:21
Well a five-carbon alkane would be ""pentane.""
1:24
So if our five-carbon aldehyde would be ""pentanal"".
1:27
So let's go ahead and write ""pentanal"" here.
1:29
So ""pentanal.""
1:31
And then we also have a substituent right
1:34
at carbon four, we have a bromine
1:36
so we have to go ahead and put that in.
1:38
So a ""four-bromopentanal"" would be
1:42
the iupac name for this molecule.
1:44
Let's do this one over here on the right.
1:46
And so once again we're going to number
1:48
giving our carbonyl carbon the lowest number
1:51
possible so one, two, and three.
1:54
So we have three-carbon aldehyde but this one has
1:57
a double bond in it so a three-carbon aldehyde
2:00
would be called a ""propanal"" but since we have
2:02
a double bond present we're going to call it ""propenal.""
2:05
Alright, so we have ""propenal"" here.
2:07
So let's go ahead and write that.
2:09
So, ""propenal.""
2:11
And then the double bond starts at carbon two
2:13
right here so we can write ""two-propenal.""
2:16
We also have a phenyl group coming off of carbon three.
2:20
So we can write ""three-phenyl,"" so ""three-phenyl"" in here.
2:25
And if you wanted to specify the stereochemistry
2:27
of the double bonds, right you think about hydrogen
2:30
being here and hydrogen being here.
2:33
And so when you think about this double bond here,
2:35
the hydrogens are on opposite sides
2:37
so you can say that's their [trans] or you could use
2:41
the easy system and your highest priority groups
2:43
are on opposite sides here, so this would be E.
2:46
So go ahead and write E.
2:48
So ""E three-phenyl two-propenal"" is one way
2:51
to name this molecule.
2:53
It's kind of the old way of doing it.
2:54
If you want to do it the newer way, you would write
2:57
E, and then you still have a phenyl group here
3:00
so ""three-phenyl"" and for the new way you would write
3:06
""Prop"" and put the two in here so ""Prop-two-en""
3:11
and then ""-al"".
3:12
So once again the two specifies where the double-bond is
3:14
and you still have your ""-al"" ending.
3:16
And since this is the more modern way of doing it.
3:19
So these are both iupac names for cinnamaldehyde.
3:23
So this molecule here is actually cinnamaldehyde
3:27
which is the molecule that gives cinnamon it's smell.
3:31
So this a fantastic smell, and you can steam distill
3:34
cinnamon bark and isolate this molecule
3:37
which is a great undergraduate organic chemistry
3:39
lab to do and so that's cinnamaldehyde.
3:43
Alright so another great smelling aldehyde over here
3:46
on the left, is ""benzaldehyde.""
3:49
So here we have ""benzaldehyde.""
3:51
Which is such a common name that it's been
3:53
incorporated into iupac nomenclature
3:56
and benzaldehyde smells like almonds.
3:59
This is another fantastic smell so labs
4:02
of benzaldehyde are a lot of fun too.
4:05
So if you see benzaldehyde,
4:07
you can use that in your iupac name.
4:09
And so if we look at it over here on the right
4:11
you can see that benzaldehyde can form the base
4:13
for the name for this molecule.
4:14
So let's go ahead and write that over here.
4:16
So we have ""benzaldehyde."".
4:20
And then we're going to number to give
4:23
this carbon on our ring, number one.
4:26
Right so we have two choices we can go around
4:28
the ring clockwise or counterclockwise.
4:31
And we know we want to give the lowest number
4:32
possible to our substituents and so that would be
4:35
by going around clockwise.
4:37
So let's do that, so two, three and then four.
4:40
So we have two substituents, right.
4:43
We have a methoxy substituent here at carbon three.
4:47
We have a hydroxy substituent here at carbon four.
4:50
And so we need to put those into alphabetical order
4:53
so H comes before M and so we're going to start
4:56
with the hydroxies, so let's,
4:58
hopefully we'll have enough room here.
4:59
So ""four-hydroxy"" and then we have a ""three-methoxy
5:08
""Benzaldehyde"" is the iupac name for vanillin.
5:13
So vanillin of course is where
5:16
we get our vanilla flavor from.
5:18
So a fantastic vanilla smell so these are white crystals
5:22
which have an amazing vanilla scent to them.
5:26
So also a lot of fun to do labs with.
5:28
Alright so a lot of aldehydes have nice smells to them.
5:32
Let's look at two more aldehydes.
5:36
Alright so let's look at the one on the left here right.
5:38
So it's not benzaldehyde, we don't have benzene ring
5:41
here anymore, we have a cyclohexene,
5:43
so this one is going to be called
5:45
""cyclohexane carbaldehyde.""
5:49
So, ""cyclohexane carbaldehyde""
5:52
is the iupac name for this.
5:55
So, ""carbaldehyde.""
5:57
Alright, let's look at this molecule over here
5:59
on the right so this is two aldehydes
6:02
in the same molecule.
6:04
Alright so let's look at this, so it'll be
6:06
one, two, three, four and five total carbons.
6:11
And so it's two aldehydes, so it's going to be
6:13
""dial"" and it's five carbons total so it's going
6:16
to be ""pentane"", so we could write ""pentane.""
6:20
We could write ""pentanedial"" here.
6:23
And if you wanted to put where the numbers are,
6:26
so it'll be one, five, so you can put that in there.
6:29
So ""one-five-pentanedial"" for two aldehydes.
6:33
Alright, let's look at ketone nomenclature next
6:36
and so just to remind you
6:38
of the general structure of ketones.
6:40
So once again you have a carbonyl, a carbon
6:43
double bonded to an oxygen.
6:44
This time you have two alkyler groups right,
6:46
so you have two alkyler groups here and they can
6:50
be the same or they can be different right.
6:51
So I can write ""R prime"" here
6:53
and either one would still be a ketone.
6:57
So once again we looked at butane earlier,
7:00
so our four-carbon alkane, ""butane.""
7:04
And what about if we had a four-carbon ketone?
7:06
So this right here is a four-carbon ketone
7:10
so it wouldn't be butane it's an O N E ending.
7:13
It's an ""-one"", so it would be ""butanone.""
7:15
So we're going to drop the E here and add O N E.
7:19
So ""butanone.""
7:22
That gives us the iupac name for this molecule.
7:25
So there's an old way of naming ketones which is
7:29
to think about the two alkyl groups, right.
7:32
So let's go ahead and look at that.
7:33
There's a methyl group on this side,
7:35
so let's go ahead and write ""methyl"" right here.
7:38
and then on this side there is an ethyl group.
7:41
right, two carbons so ""methylethyl"".
7:44
and then ""ketone"" gives you the structure
7:47
for this molecule too, so ""methylethylketone""
7:50
is kind of the old way of doing it.
7:51
And normally you would put the E before the M
7:54
just thinking about the alphabet but for this one
7:57
it doesn't really matter, everyone knows
7:59
what ""methylethylketone"" is, also abbreviated ""MEK.""
8:04
So naming the alkyl groups is an old way
8:07
of naming ketones which you will sometimes still see.
8:11
Alright so let's do another one here.
8:13
Let's look at a longer ketone so we want to number
8:17
to give the ketone, the carbonyl carbon lowest
8:20
number possible and so we start from the left.
8:22
Alright so one, two three, four, five and six.
8:28
So we have a six-carbon ketone.
8:32
So it's going to be ""hexanone.""
8:34
So let's go ahead and write that.
8:35
So this would be ""hexanone"".
8:37
And we need to identify where the ketone is this time.
8:40
So, it's on carbon three here, so for longer molecules
8:46
it's important to specify where it is.
8:48
So it would be three-hexanone
8:50
is one the ways to name this molecule.
8:52
Again this is kind of the old way of doing it.
8:54
So the newer way would be to write for this one,
8:58
""hexan-three-one"".
9:02
And if you wanted to use the alkyl way of naming
9:04
this molecule, you could say this is an ethyl.
9:08
So you're gonna write ""ethyl"" here, so ""ethyl.""
9:11
and on this side a three-carbonyl alkyl group is ""propyl.""
9:14
So ""ethylpropylketone"" is just another way to name it.
9:22
So several names for the same molecule.
9:25
Alright ketones take priority over things like double
9:28
bonds and alkyl groups and halogens once again.
9:30
So if you look at this molecule you want to number
9:32
to give your ketone the lowest number possible
9:34
and not your double bond so we're going to start
9:36
from the left again so one, two, three, four, five and six.
9:44
So we have a six-carbon ketone.
9:47
So that would be ""hexanone"" but we have a double
9:49
bond present so it's going to be ""hexenone""
9:53
So we have ""hexenone"" as thinking
9:55
about our base name here.
9:56
And once again two ways to think about naming it
9:59
right, so I can do ""hexenone"", so ""hexene""
10:04
and then we have our ketone, carbon-two.
10:07
So ""hexene-two-one"" so the two goes with the ""-one"",
10:10
to tell you where the ketone is.
10:12
And then the double bond
10:13
starts at carbon-four right here so,
10:15
""four hexene-two-one.""
10:18
If you want to specify the stereochemistry
10:21
of the double bonds, so once again
10:22
you have the hydrogens on opposite sides
10:24
so that would be trans or E, right.
10:27
So you could just write ""E"" here.
10:28
So ""E-four-hexene-two-one"" is one way to name this.
10:32
Again, kind of the old way of doing it.
10:34
If you wanted to name it another way,
10:37
You could write ""E"" and then you can write ""hex,""
10:42
and then ""four-ene"", so once again the four
10:44
is going with the ""-ene"" part telling you where the double
10:47
bond is and then you have the ""two-one"" as well.
10:50
So whichever way you prefer.
10:53
Alright, so let's look at two more examples here,
10:57
for nomenclature of ketones.
11:00
So what if you have a ketone in a cyclic molecule here?
11:03
So if I just, if I think about what I have,
11:08
it would be ""cyclohexane"", but I have a ketone
11:10
in my ring so it would be ""cyclohexanone.""
11:14
So let's go ahead and write that.
11:15
So, ""cyclohexanone"" indicating we have
11:21
a ketone present and so we know the ketones
11:24
take priority over alkyl groups so we're going
11:26
to give this carbon a number one on our ring.
11:29
And we're going to choose to around clockwise
11:30
because that gives the lowest number to our alkyl group.
11:33
So we go two and three.
11:35
And so we have a methyl group at carbon three.
11:37
So it'd be ""three-methylcyclohexanone""
11:42
as the iupac name.
11:44
Alright, and then finally what happens if you
11:46
have two ketones in the same molecule here?
11:49
So we want to give the lowest number possible
11:52
so we start numbering from the left side
11:54
so one, two, three, four, five and six.
11:59
So we have two ketones, so that's going
12:01
to be a ""dione.""
12:02
So one way to name it would be to say
12:05
well it will be, ""hexane"" and then we have
12:06
two ketones, right, so ""dione"".
12:09
So ""hexanedione,"" the ketones are at two and four
12:12
the carbonyl carbons are at two and four.
12:14
So ""two-four-hexanedione"" is one way to do it.
12:19
And of course you can also do it the more modern way,
12:22
you can just write ""hexane"" right,
12:24
and then after hexane, so hexane [as I've] told you
12:27
six carbons, so you could write
12:28
""two-four-dione""
12:32
Alright so that's it for nomenclature
12:34
of aldehydes and ketones.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,JMsqu236bZo,

0:02
I want to figure out how blood gets from my heart, which
0:05
I'm going to draw here, all the way to my toe.
0:08
And I'm going to draw my foot over here and show you
0:11
which toe I'm talking about.
0:13
Let's say this toe right here.
0:16
Now, to start the journey, it's going
0:19
to have to go out of the left ventricle
0:20
and into the largest artery of the body.
0:24
This is going to be the aorta.
0:25
And the aorta is very, very wide across.
0:29
And that's why I say it's a large artery.
0:31
And from the aorta-- I'm actually
0:34
not drawing all the branches of the aorta.
0:35
But from the aorta, it's going to go down into my belly.
0:39
And it's going to branch towards my left leg and my right leg.
0:45
So let's say we follow just the left leg.
0:48
So this artery over here on the top,
0:50
it's going to get a little bit smaller.
0:52
And maybe I'd call this a medium-sized artery
0:55
by this point.
0:56
This is actually now getting down towards my ankle.
1:00
Let's say we've gone quite a distance down in my ankle.
1:04
And then there are, of course, little branches.
1:06
And let's just follow the branch that
1:08
goes towards my foot, which is this top one.
1:10
Let's say this one goes towards my foot,
1:12
and this is going to be now an even smaller artery.
1:15
Let's call it small artery.
1:20
From there, we're actually going to get
1:23
into what we call arterioles, so it's going to get even tinier.
1:27
It's going to branch.
1:28
Now, these are very, very tiny branches
1:31
coming off my small artery.
1:33
And let's follow this one right here,
1:34
and this one is my arteriole.
1:38
So these are all the different branches I have to go through.
1:42
And finally, I'm going to get into tiny little branches.
1:46
I'm going to have to draw them very, very skinny
1:48
just to convince you that we're getting smaller and smaller.
1:51
Let me draw three of them.
1:53
No.
1:53
Let's draw four just for fun.
1:57
And this is actually going to now get
1:59
towards my little toe cells.
2:01
So let me draw some toes cells in here
2:03
to convince you that I actually have gotten there.
2:05
Let's say one, two over here, and maybe one over here.
2:09
These are my toes cells.
2:12
And after the toe cells have kind of
2:14
taken out whatever they need-- maybe they need glucose
2:17
or maybe they need some oxygen.
2:19
Whatever they've taken out, they're
2:22
also going to put in their waste.
2:24
So they have, of course, some carbon dioxide
2:25
waste that we need to drag back.
2:29
This is now going to dump into what we call a venule.
2:34
And this venule is going to basically then feed
2:37
into many, many other venules.
2:38
Maybe there's a venule down here coming in,
2:41
and maybe a venule up here coming in maybe
2:43
from the second toe.
2:45
And it's going to basically all kind of gather
2:47
together, and again, to a giant, giant set of veins.
2:50
Maybe veins are dumping in here now, maybe another vein
2:53
dumping in here.
2:55
And these veins are all going to dump into an enormous vein
2:58
that we call the inferior vena cava.
3:01
I'll write that right here, inferior vena cava.
3:06
And this is the large vein that brings back all the blood
3:10
from the bottom half of the body.
3:12
There's also another one over here called the superior vena
3:15
cava, and this is bringing back blood from the arms and head.
3:20
So these two veins, the superior vena cava and the inferior vena
3:23
cava, are dragging the blood back to the heart.
3:26
And generally speaking, these are all
3:28
considered, of course, veins.
3:30
Let's back up now and start with the large and medium arteries.
3:33
These guys together are sometimes
3:36
referred to as elastic arteries.
3:40
And the reason they're called elastic arteries, one
3:43
of the good reasons why they're called
3:45
that is that they have a protein in the walls of the blood
3:48
vessel called elastin.
3:49
They have a lot of this elastin protein.
3:53
And if you think about the word elastin or elastic-- obviously
3:57
very similar words-- you might think of something
4:00
like a rubber band or a balloon.
4:02
And that's probably the easiest way to think about it.
4:04
If you have a blood vessel, one of these large arteries,
4:07
for example, and let's say blood is under a lot of pressure
4:12
because the heart is squeezing out a lot of high pressure
4:16
blood, this artery is literally going to balloon out.
4:19
And if you actually looked at it from the outside,
4:22
it would look like a little sausage, something
4:24
like this where it's puffed out.
4:26
So what's happened there between the first and second picture
4:31
is that the pressure energy-- so the heart
4:34
is squeezing out a lot of pressurized blood.
4:36
And, of course, there's energy in that blood.
4:39
That pressure energy has been converted over
4:42
into elastic energy.
4:44
It's actually converting energy.
4:46
We don't really always think about it that way,
4:47
but that's exactly what's happening.
4:49
And when you convert from pressure energy
4:51
to elastic energy, what you're really then doing
4:54
is you're balancing out those high pressures.
4:57
So you're balancing out high pressures.
5:02
And this is actually very important,
5:03
because the blood that's coming into our arteries
5:07
is under, let's not forget, high pressure.
5:10
So the arterial system we know is a high-pressure system.
5:14
So this makes perfect sense that the first few arteries,
5:17
those large arteries and even those medium-sized arteries,
5:21
are going to be able to deal with the pressure really well.
5:23
Now, let me draw a little line here just to keep it straight.
5:26
The small artery and the arteriole,
5:29
these two are actually sometimes called the muscular arteries.
5:35
And the reason, again, if you just
5:37
want to look at the wall of the artery, you'll get the answer.
5:42
The wall of the artery is actually very muscular.
5:45
In fact, specifically, it's smooth muscle.
5:48
So not the kind of muscle you have in your heart
5:50
or in your biceps, but this is smooth muscle
5:54
that's in the wall of the artery.
5:56
And there's lots of it.
5:57
So again, if you have a little blood vessel like this,
6:00
if you imagine tons and tons of smooth muscle on the outside--
6:03
so let's draw it like this, little bands of smooth muscle.
6:07
If those bands decide that they want to contract down,
6:10
that they want to squeeze down, you're
6:11
going to get something that looks like a little straw,
6:14
because those muscles are now tight.
6:16
They're tightly wound, so you're going
6:19
to create like a little straw.
6:20
And this process is called vasoconstriction.
6:24
Vaso just means blood vessel.
6:25
And constriction is kind of tightening down.
6:29
So vasoconstriction, tightening down of the blood vessel.
6:32
And what that does is it increases resistance.
6:36
Just like if you're trying to blow
6:37
through a tiny, tiny little straw,
6:40
there's a lot of resistance.
6:41
Well, it's the same idea here.
6:43
And actually, a lot of that resistance and change
6:46
in the vasoconstriction is happening
6:49
at the arteriole level.
6:51
So that's why they're very special
6:52
and I want you to remember them.
6:54
From there, blood is going to go through the capillaries.
6:56
I didn't actually label them the first time,
6:57
but let me just write that here.
6:59
Some, as they call them, capillary beds.
7:02
I'll write that out.
7:03
And then it's going to go and get collected in the venules
7:06
and eventually into the veins.
7:07
And the important thing about the veins--
7:09
I'm going to stop right here and just
7:11
talk about it very briefly-- is that they
7:13
have these little valves.
7:14
And these valves make sure that the blood continues
7:16
to flow in one direction.
7:19
So one important thing here is the valves.
7:22
And remember, the other important thing
7:24
is that they are able to deal with large volumes.
7:27
So unlike the arterial side where
7:29
it was all about large pressure, down here with the vein side,
7:33
we have to think about large volumes.
7:34
Remember about 2/3 of your blood at any point in time
7:38
is sitting in some vein or venule somewhere.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,iqRTd1NY-pU,

0:01
- [Voiceover] Ok, so let's say you have some kind of letter
0:04
that you wanna, that you wanna deliver, right?
0:05
So you have a letter that's in your mailbox,
0:07
and let's say that this is the sender of the letter, right?
0:11
And so the sender of that letter is gonna deliver that mail
0:14
all the way over here to the recipient, right?
0:16
And the way that they're gonna do that is you're gonna have
0:18
this mailman in this truck deliver it from the sender
0:23
to the recipient, and they're gonna drive along this road.
0:26
But then let's say something happens.
0:28
Let's say, for some reason, an earthquake happens, right?
0:31
And the earthquake actually destroys the road over here.
0:34
And so now, the mailman can't really get to
0:35
where they need to go anymore, right?
0:37
Because the road has been damaged.
0:39
So why am I giving this extremely hypothetical scenario?
0:42
Well I think that it serves as a pretty good analogy
0:44
towards understanding a disease called Multiple Sclerosis.
0:49
So Multiple Sclerosis is a disease of the brain.
0:51
And more specifically, it affects the communication
0:54
within the brain.
0:55
So what do I mean by communication in the brain?
0:57
Well in the brain, you have all these neurons, right?
1:00
You have all these neurons that are constantly talking
1:02
to each other, kinda like these two neurons over here.
1:04
And so this neuron is going to send an electrical signal
1:07
down the length of a diaxon.
1:09
And that electrical signal is in the form
1:11
of an action potential.
1:12
And so to improve the efficiency of the communication,
1:14
you have this stuff that kind of insulates the axon,
1:16
so, this stuff that I've drawn here in red
1:18
is called myelin.
1:20
And it really just makes the action potential
1:22
move down the axon much more quickly.
1:24
So we can actually kind of compare this
1:27
two-way communication system, right, with our mailman.
1:30
So, you know we have kind of the sender of the message,
1:32
that would be the first neuron,
1:35
we have the message, that would be
1:37
kind of like the action potential,
1:38
we have the road, which would be, you know,
1:40
the myelin and the axon together,
1:43
and we have the recipient.
1:45
Now, in our analogy, we had an earthquake
1:47
that actually destroyed the road somehow.
1:49
So, in Multiple Sclerosis, what happens is, well,
1:52
you get destruction of the road, and more specifically,
1:54
you get a degradation of the myelin.
1:58
And so because there's degradation of the myelin,
2:00
we can call Multiple Sclerosis a Demyelinating Disease.
2:04
So this is really where that disruption
2:05
in the communication goes on, right?
2:07
And when the myelin is degraded, the action potential
2:10
won't really travel down the axon as quickly anymore,
2:14
and sometimes it may not even travel down to begin with.
2:16
So what's causing that degradation?
2:18
Well as it turns out, in Multiple Sclerosis,
2:20
the immune system actually sneaks its way into the brain,
2:25
and when the immune system sneaks its way into the brain,
2:27
for some reason it mistakenly recognizes that myelin,
2:31
right, this myelin over here, as foreign.
2:34
And when it mistakenly recognizes it as foreign,
2:36
it starts to attack the myelin, hence this degradation.
2:40
And because the immune system is attacking the body itself,
2:43
we call Multiple Sclerosis an Autoimmune Disease as well.
2:47
So that's kind of a cellular perspective
2:48
on Multiple Sclerosis, but now I kind of want to give you
2:51
a more macroscopic perspective
2:53
on what the disease does to the brain, right?
2:56
So let me clear up some space over here.
2:59
And let me actually show you now two different brains.
3:02
So this is just really a brain scan,
3:04
or two different brain scans of, well,
3:06
two different brains.
3:07
So on the left, we have a perfectly healthy brain.
3:09
And on the right, we have the brain of someone
3:12
who's suffering from Multiple Sclerosis.
3:15
Immediately on the right brain you can tell
3:16
that you have these bright spots over here, right,
3:19
called Plaques.
3:20
So Plaque is also really referred to as a Lesion.
3:23
And a Lesion is really just a piece of tissue
3:25
that's been damaged.
3:26
So let's say, for example, you know,
3:27
you have a hand over here,
3:29
you know, maybe you get a cut on your hand somehow.
3:32
Right, you can call that cut kind of a Lesion of the skin.
3:36
In Multiple Sclerosis you have a Lesion in the brain, right?
3:39
And those Lesions are really coming from the damaged myelin
3:42
from the immune system.
3:44
So what happens is, you have all these immune cells
3:47
that kind of come together, right, they kind of
3:50
cluster around certain parts of the brain,
3:52
and they attack it.
3:54
And when you have a whole bunch of immune cells
3:55
coming together to attack a certain part of the body,
3:58
we call this Inflammation, and because it's happening
4:00
in the brain, we call it Neuroinflammation.
4:03
Now, the condition in which you have these Lesions,
4:06
in the brain, is called Sclerosis.
4:08
In the case of Multiple Sclerosis, you have multiple Lesions
4:12
hence why we call it Multiple Sclerosis.
4:15
Now notice how you're getting these Lesions
4:16
in different parts of the brain, ok.
4:18
Different parts of the brain are gonna be responsible
4:20
for different functions.
4:22
Some may be responsible for Vision,
4:24
others may be responsible for Cognition,
4:27
for moving around, for Movement, for Touch,
4:32
and so on and so forth.
4:34
And depending on where these Lesions form in the brain,
4:36
you can get a variety of different symptoms
4:37
that can affect all of these functions.
4:40
Now, why do these Lesions form?
4:41
Why does the immune system attack the brain?
4:44
The problem is that we don't actually know.
4:46
We're not really sure with 100% certainty
4:48
what causes Multiple Sclerosis.
4:51
All we know is that some people may have
4:53
a kind of Genetic Predisposition
4:55
towards developing the disease,
4:58
and that there are also probably some
4:59
Environmental Factors that may be involved as well.
5:02
And the fact of the matter is that your genetics
5:06
can really interact with the environment,
5:08
and that can kinda stimulate the progression of the disease.
5:11
Now the exact types of genes that are involved,
5:13
and the exact types of Environmental Factors
5:15
that may be involved will be a talk that I'll cover
5:17
in a later video, but for now this is really
5:19
all that we know about the causes of Multiple Sclerosis.
5:23
Now even though we don't really know perfectly
5:26
what causes Multiple Sclerosis, we do know
5:28
who is more likely to develop the disease.
5:30
So I'm gonna actually clear up some more space here again.
5:33
And so now I'm gonna show you a picture of the earth.
5:35
And the reason is because I wanna give you
5:36
a global perspective on, you know, the prevalence,
5:39
and the incidence of Multiple Sclerosis.
5:41
So the disease affects about 2.5 million people worldwide.
5:46
Now, is everyone on the planet equally likely
5:48
to develop the disease?
5:50
Well, no.
5:50
As it turns out, if you move north from the equator, right,
5:54
so if you move north from here,
5:55
you'll notice that the incidence of MS actually increases.
5:59
And the incidence is actually pretty high, you know,
6:01
in these northern areas, right, so here in Canada,
6:04
and in the northern United States, and here
6:07
in a lot of Europe and Russia as well.
6:10
So it often affects Caucasians more than other races.
6:14
And more specifically among the Caucasians,
6:16
it affects people of Northern European Descent more often.
6:20
The disease is also more common in women than it is in men.
6:25
Right, and it's thought that of the 2.5 million people
6:27
worldwide about two thirds of them are women.
6:31
So 66% of them are women.
6:33
So what age do people start to develop MS?
6:35
It's usually in the age range of 20 to 50 years old.
6:40
And it's usually on the earlier end of that spectrum.
6:42
And lastly, one thing that I really want to emphasize
6:45
is that the disease itself is NOT FATAL.
6:49
So the disease itself won't actually kill you, right,
6:51
but the Life expectancy is a bit lower.
6:54
And it's thought to be lowered by about, you know,
6:56
a few months to a few years.
6:57
Now even though it's not fatal, the disease itself
7:00
is quite debilitating, and it can really affect
7:02
the person's lifestyle through a number of different
7:04
signs and symptoms, and that'll be a topic
7:06
that I'll cover in the next video.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,P_HHvi7Kwzk,

In the videos on massive stars and on black holes,
0:04
we learned that if the remnant of a star, of a massive star,
0:08
is massive enough, the gravitational contraction,
0:12
the gravitational force, will be stronger
0:15
than even the electron degeneracy pressure,
0:18
even stronger than the neutron degeneracy pressure,
0:20
even stronger than the quark degeneracy pressure.
0:23
And everything would collapse into a point.
0:27
And we called these points black holes.
0:32
And we learned there's an event horizon
0:34
around these black holes.
0:36
And if anything gets closer or goes
0:37
within the boundary of that event horizon,
0:40
there's no way that it can never escape from the black hole.
0:43
All it can do is get closer and closer to the black hole.
0:46
And that includes light.
0:47
And that's why it's called a black hole.
0:49
So even though all of the mass is
0:50
at the central point, this entire area,
0:53
or the entire surface of the event horizon,
0:57
this entire surface of the event horizon--
0:59
I'll do it in purple because it's
1:01
supposed to be black-- this entire thing will appear black.
1:06
It will emit no light.
1:08
Now these type of black holes that we described,
1:11
we call those stellar black holes.
1:16
And that's because they're formed
1:17
from collapsing massive stars.
1:20
And the largest stellar black holes that we have observed
1:24
are on the order of 33 solar masses, give or take.
1:30
So very massive to begin with, let's just be clear.
1:33
And this is what the remnant of the star has to be.
1:35
So a lot more of the original star's mass
1:37
might have been pushed off in supernovae.
1:41
That's plural of supernova.
1:42
Now there's another class of black holes here
1:45
and these are somewhat mysterious.
1:47
And they're called supermassive black holes.
1:56
And to some degree, the word ""super""
1:58
isn't big enough, supermassive black holes,
2:01
because they're not just a little bit more massive
2:04
than stellar black holes.
2:05
They're are a lot more massive.
2:07
They're on the order of hundreds of thousands
2:12
to billions of solar masses, hundred thousands to billions
2:21
times the mass of our Sun, solar masses.
2:24
And what's interesting about these, other than the fact
2:26
that there are super huge, is that there
2:28
doesn't seem to be black holes in between or at least
2:31
we haven't observed black holes in between.
2:33
The largest stellar black hole is 33 solar masses.
2:36
And then there are these supermassive black holes
2:39
that we think exist.
2:40
And we think they mainly exist in the centers of galaxies.
2:44
And we think most, if not all, centers of galaxies
2:47
actually have one of these supermassive black holes.
2:50
But it's kind of an interesting question,
2:52
if all black holes were formed from collapsing stars,
2:55
wouldn't we see things in between?
2:57
So one theory of how these really massive black holes form
3:02
is that you have a regular stellar black hole
3:04
in an area that has a lot of matter
3:06
that it can accrete around it.
3:09
So I'll draw the-- this is the event horizon around it.
3:12
The actual black hole is going to be in the center of it,
3:14
or rather the mass of the black hole
3:16
will be in the center of it.
3:17
And then over time, you have just more and more mass just
3:21
falling into this black hole.
3:23
Just more and more stuff just keeps
3:24
falling into this black hole.
3:26
And then it just keeps growing.
3:30
And so this could be a plausible reason, or at least the mass
3:34
in the center keeps growing and so the event horizon will also
3:37
keep growing in radius.
3:39
Now this is a plausible explanation
3:40
based on our current understanding.
3:42
But the reason why this one doesn't
3:43
gel that well is if this was the explanation
3:47
for supermassive black holes, you
3:49
expect to see more black holes in between,
3:52
maybe black holes with 100 solar masses,
3:54
or a 1,000 solar masses, or 10,000 solar masses.
3:57
But we're not seeing those right now.
3:59
We just see the stellar black holes,
4:01
and we see the supermassive black holes.
4:03
So another possible explanation--
4:07
my inclinations lean towards this one
4:09
because it kind of explains the gap--
4:11
is that these supermassive black holes actually formed shortly
4:15
after the Big Bang, that these are primordial black holes.
4:19
These started near the beginning of our universe,
4:24
primordial black holes.
4:26
Now remember, what do you need to have a black hole?
4:29
You need to have an amazingly dense amount of matter
4:33
or a dense amount of mass.
4:35
If you have a lot of mass in a very small volume,
4:38
then their gravitational pull will
4:40
pull them closer, and closer, and closer together.
4:42
And they'll be able to overcome all
4:44
of the electron degeneracy pressures,
4:48
and the neutron degeneracy pressures,
4:49
and the quark degeneracy pressures,
4:51
to really collapse into what we think is a single point.
4:55
I want to be clear here, too.
4:56
We don't know it's a single point.
4:57
We've never gone into the center of a black hole.
5:00
Just the mathematics of the black holes, or at least
5:02
as we understand it right now, have everything colliding
5:05
into a single point where the math starts to break down.
5:08
So we're really not sure what happens
5:10
at that very small center point.
5:13
But needless to say, it will be an unbelievably, maybe
5:16
infinite, maybe almost infinitely,
5:18
dense point in space, or dense amount of matter.
5:23
And the reason why I kind of favor
5:24
this primordial black hole and why this would make sense
5:27
is right after the formation of the universe, all
5:30
of the matter in the universe was in a much denser space
5:35
because the universe was smaller.
5:36
So let's say that this is right after the Big
5:38
Bang, some period of time after the Big Bang.
5:41
Now what we've talked about before when
5:43
we talked about cosmic background is that
5:45
at that point, the universe was relatively uniform.
5:49
It was super, super dense but it was relatively uniform.
5:53
So a universe like this, there's no reason
5:55
why anything would collapse into black holes.
5:57
Because if you look at a point here,
5:59
sure, there's a ton of mass very close to it.
6:02
But it's very close to it in every direction.
6:04
So the gravitational force would be the same in every direction
6:09
if it was completely uniform.
6:11
But if you go shortly after the Big Bang, maybe because
6:13
of slight quantum fluctuation effects,
6:15
it becomes slightly nonuniform.
6:18
So let's say it becomes slightly nonuniform,
6:21
but it still is unbelievably dense.
6:24
So let's say it looks something like this, where you have areas
6:27
that are denser, but it's slightly nonuniform,
6:31
but extremely dense.
6:35
So here, all of a sudden, you have the type
6:36
of densities necessary for a black hole.
6:39
And where you have higher densities,
6:42
where it's less uniform, here, all of a sudden,
6:44
you will have inward force.
6:46
The gravitational pull from things outside of this area
6:49
are going to be less than the gravitational pull
6:51
towards those areas.
6:54
And the more things get pulled towards it, the less uniform
6:58
it's going to get.
6:59
So you could imagine in that primordial universe,
7:01
that very shortly after the Big Bang
7:04
when things were very dense and closely packed together,
7:09
we may have had the conditions where
7:11
these supermassive black holes could have formed.
7:13
Where we had so much mass in such a small volume,
7:16
and it was just not uniform enough,
7:18
so that you could kind of have this snowballing effect,
7:21
so that more and more mass would collect
7:24
into these supermassive black holes that
7:29
are hundreds of thousands to billions of times the mass
7:32
of the Sun.
7:33
And, this is maybe even the more interesting part,
7:35
those black holes would become the centers of future galaxies.
7:41
So you have these black holes forming,
7:42
these supermassive black holes forming.
7:45
And not everything would go into a black hole.
7:48
Only if it didn't have a lot of angular velocity,
7:53
then it might go into the black hole.
7:55
But if it's going pass it fast enough,
7:56
it'll just start going in orbit around the black hole.
7:58
And so you could imagine that this
8:00
is how the early galaxies or even our galaxy formed.
8:03
And so you might be wondering, well,
8:06
what about the black hole at the center of the Milky Way?
8:08
And we think there is one.
8:10
We think there is one because we've
8:11
observed stars orbiting very quickly around something
8:17
at the center of the universe-- sorry,
8:19
at the center of our Milky Way.
8:21
I want to be very clear, not at the center of the universe.
8:23
And the only plausible explanation
8:25
for it orbiting so quickly around something
8:29
is that it has to have a density of either a black hole
8:33
or something that will eventually
8:34
turn into a black hole.
8:35
And when you do the math for the middle
8:37
of our galaxy, the center of the Milky Way,
8:40
our supermassive black hole is on the order of 4 million times
8:44
the mass of the Sun.
8:49
So hopefully that gives you a little bit of food for thought.
8:52
There aren't just only stellar collapsed black holes.
8:54
Or maybe there are and somehow they
8:56
grow into supermassive black holes
8:57
and that everything in between we just can't observe.
8:59
Or that they really are a different class of black holes.
9:02
They're actually formed different ways.
9:04
Maybe they formed near the beginning
9:06
of the actual universe.
9:08
When the density of things was a little uniform,
9:11
things condensed into each other.
9:12
And what we're going to talk about in the next video
9:15
is how these supermassive black holes can help generate
9:19
unbelievable sources of radiation,
9:21
even though the black holes themselves
9:23
aren't emitting them.
9:24
And those are going to be quasars.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,DxkkAHnqlpY,

0:00
In the last video we defined internal energy as literally
0:04
all the energy that's in a system.
0:06
That's kind of the most inclusive version,
0:08
at least in my head.
0:09
So that's my system, it's some type of container.
0:11
And I have a bunch of particles in here.
0:15
It's literally the sum of the kinetic energies
0:17
of all these particles.
0:18
If they had potential energies, we'd
0:20
throw that in there.
0:21
If they have electrical potential, we'd
0:23
throw that in there.
0:24
If they have bonds with each other, the energies in that
0:27
bond, we would throw it in there.
0:28
It's everything.
0:29
It's all inclusive.
0:31
And, I told you in the last video it's unintuitive that U
0:34
stands for internal energy.
0:35
But I kind of think that, you know, U, it contains the
0:37
universe of energy.
0:39
You know, that's just for me to memorize it.
0:40
Don't think too deeply into what I just said.
0:43
But this is internal energy.
0:46
If you show me a system, it has some internal energy.
0:52
It's a function of its state.
0:53
I don't care how it got to that state, but if you told me
0:57
a system at a certain state, maybe with a certain pressure,
0:59
or a certain volume, or at a certain temperature-- although
1:02
if you give me pressure and volume that should be enough--
1:04
I can tell you what its internal energy is.
1:06
Especially if you tell me the type of molecule I have, and
1:08
things like that.
1:09
Now we also said in the last video that because internal
1:12
energy is all the energy in the system, it can't be
1:16
randomly created or destroyed.
1:18
It can just be transformed from one form to another.
1:23
So if I have a change in internal energy, it can only
1:28
be due to-- well, it can be due to more than what I'm
1:31
describing.
1:31
But in our simple world where all of the energy in a
1:34
system-- and maybe we're dealing with gases, because
1:36
that's normally what you deal with in a first-year chemistry
1:39
course-- it's going to be the heat that could be added to
1:42
the system, plus the work done on the system.
1:48
And like I said in the last video, sometimes they'll say,
1:50
instead of plus the work done on the system, sometimes
1:53
they'll say, minus the work that the system does.
1:57
Either way.
1:57
And here I just want to make another side discussion here,
2:02
because I decided to write it without the
2:04
little deltas here.
2:05
And the reason why I did that is if you were to write this
2:08
equation, which you will see, you'll see it in textbooks,
2:10
teachers will do it-- nothing inherently criminal about
2:13
that-- but I just do that because it clears in my mind
2:17
what heat and what work are relative to internal energy.
2:20
If I were to write delta U is equal to heat delta Q plus
2:31
delta W to me this implies that at some point I had some
2:38
amount of heat in my system, and then I have a different
2:41
amount of heat in my system, and I took the difference
2:43
between the two and I got a change in heat.
2:46
So this implies that heat is somehow an inherent macrostate
2:51
of the system, and that's not the case.
2:57
I can tell you what the internal energy
2:59
of this system is.
3:00
I can tell you its pressure.
3:02
I can tell you its volume.
3:03
I can tell you its temperature.
3:05
These are all macrostates of the system.
3:07
I don't know how it got to this situation, but I can tell
3:10
you about it.
3:10
I cannot tell you what the heat is of this system.
3:14
And that might be a little unintuitive, because if I ask
3:19
you, hey I have a cup of coffee, what's the heat of it?
3:21
You might say, oh, it's, you know, you might give me the
3:22
temperature.
3:23
Because in our everyday language we use things like
3:25
heat and temperature interchangeably.
3:27
But in thermodynamics, heat is a transfer of energy.
3:30
A way to think about it is, if internal energy
3:34
is your bank account.
3:36
So you could say change in bank account.
3:45
And it really is like the energy bank
3:48
account of a system.
3:50
If you have a change in a bank account, you had some deposits
3:54
or withdrawals.
3:55
And heat and work are really just deposits or withdrawals
3:59
into our energy bank account.
4:01
Heat is one kind.
4:02
Maybe heat is like a wire transfer.
4:04
So you could say it's wire transfers to your account.
4:10
Transfers to your account plus check deposits.
4:20
Now it makes a lot of sense to say, you could say, what is my
4:24
value of my bank account?
4:26
Or you could say what is my change in my bank account?
4:28
You take two snapshots of your bank account at
4:30
two different times.
4:32
But would it make sense to say-- you know, I could say I
4:35
wire transferred $10, right?
4:37
So I could say, this statement would be plus $10.
4:42
And I could say that I wrote $20 in checks,
4:46
minus $20 in checks.
4:47
In which case, my change in my bank account
4:50
would be minus $10.
4:53
Now would it make sense for me to say
4:55
change in wire transfer?
4:56
That implies that when I started off maybe my bank
4:59
account had $100 in it and now it has $90.
5:04
When my bank account had $100 in it, did it have any wire
5:08
transfer amount?
5:10
No, wire transfer was how money was deposited or taken
5:14
away from my account.
5:14
Likewise, it didn't have a checking deposit account, so I
5:17
can't really-- it just seems weird to me to say change in
5:21
wire transfer is $10, or change in check deposits is
5:25
$20 or minus $20.
5:27
Would you say, I made a $10 wire transfer and
5:30
I paid $20 in checks.
5:32
So I had a net change in my bank account of $10.
5:36
Likewise, I say how much work was done to me or I did, which
5:40
is essentially a deposit or withdrawal of energy.
5:43
Or I could say much heat was given to me or how much heat
5:45
was released, which is another way of depositing or
5:48
withdrawing energy from my energy bank account.
5:51
So that's why I like to stick to this.
5:53
And I like to stay away from this.
5:56
And just like I said, you can't say how much heat is in
5:58
the system.
5:59
So someone will say, oh, how much heat is in this?
6:02
You cannot say that.
6:03
There's no heat state variable for that system.
6:06
You have internal energy.
6:08
The closest thing to heat, we'll talk about it in a
6:10
future video, is enthalpy.
6:11
Enthalpy is essentially a way of measuring how much heat is
6:15
in a system, but we won't talk about that just now.
6:18
And you can't say how much work is in a system.
6:20
You can't say, oh I have x amount of work in a system.
6:24
The system can do work or have work done to it, but there's
6:27
not a certain amount of work, because that energy in the
6:29
system could be all used for work, it could all be used for
6:32
heat, it could all be used for a ton of different things.
6:34
So you can't say those things.
6:35
And that's why I don't like treating them like state
6:38
variables, or state functions.
6:39
So with that said, this is our definition.
6:42
Let's do a couple of simple problems,
6:44
just to give you intuition.
6:45
And I really want to make you comfortable.
6:49
My real goal is to make you comfortable with, when to know
6:52
to use plus or minus on the work.
6:54
And the best way to do it is not to memorize a formula, but
6:57
just to kind of think about what's happening.
6:59
So let's say that I have some system here and, I don't know,
7:02
it's a balloon.
7:03
And let's say that I have no change in internal energy.
7:09
Internal energy is 0.
7:10
And for our purposes we can kind of view it as the kinetic
7:13
energy of the particles haven't changed.
7:15
And let's say by expanding a bit, by my balloon expanding a
7:20
bit-- I did some work.
7:21
I'll do this in more detail in the next video.
7:25
So the system does 10 joules of work.
7:35
My question is, how much heat was added or taken away from
7:39
the system?
7:45
So the way I can think about it-- you don't even have to
7:46
write the formula down, or you can write it-- you could say,
7:49
look, the internal energy, the amount of energy in the system
7:52
hasn't changed.
7:53
The system did 10 joules of work.
7:56
So that's energy going out of the system.
7:58
It did 10 joules.
8:00
So 10 joules went out in the form of work.
8:03
If the internal energy did not change, then essentially 10
8:08
joules of energy had to go into the system.
8:11
10 joules had to go into the system.
8:13
If it didn't, the internal energy would have gone down by
8:16
the amount of work we had.
8:20
And the only way, if is this is the net work, the only way
8:22
that we're talking about, that we can add energy outside of
8:24
work, is through heat.
8:26
So 10 joules of heat must have been added.
8:28
So we can write 10 joules of heat added to system.
8:36
Now let's look at that from the point of view of the
8:38
actual formula.
8:40
If we have delta U is equal to heat added, plus work done to
8:49
the system, then we would say, OK, this was 0.
8:53
It's equal to the heat added to the system.
8:59
Remember, in this way we're saying this is the heat done,
9:02
or the work done, to the system.
9:04
W is work done.
9:06
Now, the system did work to something else.
9:09
It didn't have work done to it.
9:12
So if this is work done to the system, and it did work, then
9:17
this is going to be a minus 10.
9:20
Minus 10 joules.
9:21
And then you solve both sides of this.
9:24
You add 10 to both sides and you get 10 is equal to Q,
9:31
which is exactly what we got up here.
9:33
But this can get confusing sometimes, because you're
9:35
like, oh, is this heat that the system did?
9:38
Is this heat that was added to the system or taken away?
9:43
The convention tends to be that this is heat added.
9:48
But then sometimes it's confusing.
9:49
Is this the work done to the system or work done by?
9:52
And that's why I like just doing it this way.
9:53
If the system does work it loses energy.
9:55
If the system has work done to it, it gains energy.
9:59
So let's do another problem.
10:01
I mean, I could have done this exact same thing using the
10:03
other formula that you'll sometimes see.
10:05
Delta U is equal to Q minus the work that the system does
10:14
by the system-- Work done by the system.
10:18
And in this case, once again, change in
10:21
internal energy was 0.
10:23
That is equal to heat added to the system,
10:27
minus the work done.
10:30
So minus-- I told you at the beginning of the problem that
10:33
the system did 10 joules of work-- so minus the work done.
10:38
Minus 10 joules.
10:39
We get the same situation up here from
10:42
two different formulas.
10:43
And we got 10 is equal to Q.
10:46
Either way, the heat added to the system is 10 joules.
10:49
Let's do one more.
10:51
Let's say that, I don't know, 5 joules of heat taken away
11:02
from system.
11:09
And let's say that 1 joule of work done on system.
11:16
So maybe we're compressing the balloon on the system.
11:20
What is our change in internal energy?
11:25
Let's just figure out our change.
11:27
So the way I think of it is 5 joules of heat taken away from
11:30
the system, that's going to reduce our internal
11:31
energy by minus 5.
11:33
And if 1 joule work is done onto the system, we're putting
11:37
energy into it so that'll be plus 1.
11:40
So minus 5, plus 1, is going to be minus 4.
11:44
Or enter our change in internal
11:46
energy is minus 4 joules.
11:48
Now we could have done that a little bit more formally with
11:50
the formula, change in internal energy is equal to
11:55
heat added to the system, plus work done on the system.
12:03
So it's equal to heat added to the system.
12:06
We had 5 joules heat taken away, so this is minus 5, plus
12:11
work done on the system.
12:13
We have 1 joule of work done on the system, and there we
12:17
get, once again, minus 4.
12:19
Now, I could have written that same formula the other way.
12:22
I could have said change in internal energy is equal to
12:27
heat added to the system minus the work that the system does.
12:31
I want to do this both ways, because I don't want you to
12:33
get confused, either way you see it on problems or in
12:37
school, or maybe you take one class that does it one way and
12:39
one class that does it the other.
12:40
If you use it this way, what was the heat
12:43
added to the system?
12:44
We had heat taken away, so it's minus 5.
12:47
So minus the work that the system does, how much work
12:51
does the system do?
12:54
Well, the system had 1 joule of work done to it.
12:58
So it did itself minus 1 joules of work.
13:03
So it's minus minus 1.
13:06
I want to be clear, when I use this formula, this is work
13:10
done by system, done by.
13:13
This is work done to.
13:16
The system had work done to it.
13:19
So it had minus 1 joules of work done by the system, so
13:22
these become pluses, and you get back to a minus 4.
13:25
Do whatever's intuitive for you.
13:27
For me, this tends to be the most intuitive, where you
13:29
don't even use a formula.
13:30
We just think, if I'm doing work, I'm using up energy.
13:33
If I get work done to me, I'm being handed over energy.
13:37
If I have heat taken away from me, I'm giving away energy.
13:40
If I have heat added to me, I'm getting energy.
13:43
See you in the next video.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,aOSlXuDO4UU,
khan_video_TDoGrbpJJ14_31,Do antibiotics kill the good bacteria also?,MCQ,"•
0:00
I think we've all heard of the word bacteria.
0:07
And we normally associate it with negative things.
0:11
You say bacteria,those are germs.
0:13
So we normally associate those with germs,and they indeed are germs,
0:17
and they cause a whole set of negative things.
0:20
Or at least from the standard point of view,
0:23
people believe that they cause a whole bunch of negative things.
0:26
So let's just list them all just to make sure we know about them,
0:30
we're all on the same page.So the bad things they do,
0:33
they cause a lot of diseases:tuberculosis,Lyme disease.
0:44
I mean,I could go on and on.
0:45
You know,pretty much any time--well,I'll be careful here.
0:48
Whenever people talk about an infection,
0:50
it's often caused by a bacteria.It can also be caused by a virus.
0:54
An infection is,in general,anything entering you
0:56
and taking advantage of your body to kind of replicate itself,
1:00
and in the process,making you sick.
1:02
But bacterial infections,let me write that down.
1:10
And this whole perception of bacteria being a bad thing
1:13
is probably a good reason
1:15
why almost any soap you see now will say antibacterial on it.
1:24
Because the makers of the soap know that in conventional thinking,
1:28
bacteria are viewed as a negative thing.
1:32
And you're like,OK,Sal,I know where you're going with this.
1:34
Bacteria isn't all bad.There are some good traits of bacteria.
1:41
For example,I could stick some yogurt in some--
1:44
or I could stick some bacteria in some milk
1:47
and it'll help produce some yogurt,sometimes spelled yoghurt.
1:57
And that's obviously a good thing.It's a delicious thing to eat.
2:01
You say,well,I know I have bacteria in my gut.It helps me digest food.
2:09
And these are all true,but you're like,look,you know,
2:11
on balance,I still think bacteria is a bad thing.
2:16
I'm not going to take sides on that debate,
2:18
as I tend to avoid taking sides on debates in these science videos.
2:22
Maybe I'll do a whole playlist where I do nothing
2:24
but take sides on debates,but here I won't take any sides on that.
2:28
But I'll just point out that
2:29
you are to a large degree made up of bacteria.It's not just your gut.
2:35
It's not just the gut or the yogurt you might eat
2:38
or the plaque on your teeth,which is caused by bacteria.
2:43
It's this kind of film that's created by bacteria
2:45
Bacteria actually represents a majority of the cells on your body.
2:48
And it's not just the pimples on your face.
2:54
Bacteria actually represents a majority of the cells on your body.
3:00
So for every--and this is kind of an astounding fact.
3:04
For every one cell on the human body,every one human cell--
3:09
so these are all cells that all have your DNA in them
3:14
and they'll have nucleuses,and I'll talk about that in a second--
3:18
you have 20 bacteria.Now,your response there is to say,
3:25
OK,that's fair enough,
3:27
but these bacteria must be much smaller than the human cell,
3:30
so it must be a very small fraction of my mass.And you're right.
3:35
It's not like we're mostly bacteria by mass,
3:37
although we are mostly bacteria by actual cells.
3:41
But even if you were to take out all of the water in your body,
3:44
then by mass,bacteria is going to be roughly 10% of your mass.
3:53
So I weigh about 150 pounds,
3:55
I've got 15 pounds of bacteria walking around with me.
3:59
So we always kind of think of ourselves
4:01
as like the bacteria is riding on us,
4:03
but to a large degree,we're kind of in symbiosis.
4:06
We're kind of two creatures,or not just two creatures,
4:09
two types of creatures living together,
4:11
because I don't have just one type of bacteria on me.
4:14
I have thousands of types of bacteria on me.
4:16
There's a huge amount of diversity,
4:18
and we're just scratching the surface in terms of
4:21
the number and types and diversity of bacteria that exist.
4:25
So I've talked a lot about bacteria,and hopefully,
4:27
this fact right here will make you realize that
4:30
they're super important to just our everyday existence.
4:33
Just to make sure we understand the magnitude of this,
4:35
in a previous video,and I looked this up again,
4:38
we have on the order of 10 to a 100 trillion cells,human cells.
4:47
So for every one of these we have 20 bacteria,
4:50
we're talking about having on the order of
4:56
200 to 2,000 trillion bacteria on us at any time.
5:04
And I'm a hygienic person.I take showers daily,and that's even me.
5:09
It's not like you can somehow eliminate them.
5:10
And even more,it's not like you even want to eliminate them.
5:13
But that's fair enough.You're probably asking,OK,Sal,
5:15
I'm convinced that bacteria are important.
5:17
What do they actually look like?
5:18
And they're these small unicellular organisms.
5:22
That's my bacteria right there.
5:25
And they're different from the cells that make up us.
5:29
When I say us,I'll throw in all plants,animals and funguses,fungi.
5:35
And the big difference,or the one that people noticed first,
5:39
is that all of the Eukarya,which includes plants,animals and fungi,
5:47
all of their DNA is inside of a nucleus,a cellular nucleus.
5:54
So that's the nucleus right there.
5:59
And all of our DNA,it's normally in its chromatin form.
6:02
It's all just spread around something like that.
6:07
In bacteria,which are what people originally just
6:11
classify it on whether or not you have a nucleus,
6:15
in bacteria,there is no membrane surrounding the DNA.
6:20
So what they have is just a big bundle of DNA.
6:25
They just have this big bundle of DNA.
6:29
It's sometimes in a loop all in one circle called a nucleoid.
6:40
Now,whenever we look at something,and we say,oh,
6:43
we have this thing;it doesn't;there's this assumption that
6:46
somehow we're superior or we're more advanced beings.
6:51
But the reality is that bacteria have infiltrated far more ecosystems
6:55
in every part of the planet than Eukarya have,
6:58
and there's far more diversity in bacteria than there is in Eukarya.
7:05
So when you really think about it,
7:07
these are the more successful organisms.
7:11
If a comet were to hit the Earth--God forbid--
7:17
the organisms more likely to survive are going to be the bacteria
7:20
than the Eukarya,than the ones with the larger--not always larger,
7:26
but the organisms that do have this nucleus
7:28
and have membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria and all that.
7:31
We'll talk more about it in the future.
7:33
Bacteria,for the most part,are just big bags of cytoplasm.
7:36
They have their DNA there.
7:37
They do have ribosomes because they have to code for proteins
7:41
just like the rest of us do.
7:42
Some of those proteins,they'll make some from--
7:45
bacteria,they'll make these flagella,
7:46
which are tails that allow them to move around.
7:51
They also have these things called pili.
7:54
Pili is plural for pilus or pee-lus,so these pili.
8:00
And we'll see in a second that the pili are kind of
8:02
how the bacteria are able to do one form of
8:06
introducing genetic variation into their populations.
8:13
Actually,I'll take a little side note here.
8:15
I'm pointing out bacteria as not having a cell wall.
8:17
There's actually another class that used to be categorized
8:19
as type of a bacteria,and they're called Archaea.
8:23
I should give them a little bit of justice.
8:25
They're always kind of the stepchild.
8:30
They used to be called Archaea bacteria,
8:32
but now people realize,they've actually looked at the DNA,
8:34
because when they originally looked at these,they said,OK,
8:36
these guys also have no nucleus and a bunch of DNA running around.
8:41
These must be a form of bacteria.
8:43
But now that we've actually been able to look into the DNA
8:46
of the things,we've seen that they're actually quite different.
8:48
But all of these,both bacteria and Archaea,are considered prokaryotes.
8:58
And this just means no nucleus.
9:01
No nucleus,and more generally,this is what most people refer to,
9:04
but more generally,they don't have these membrane-bound organelles
9:08
that our cells have.
9:11
Now,the next question you might say is,well,
9:14
how do these bacteria reproduce?And for the most part,
9:17
they do something not completely different from mitosis,
9:20
although I want to call it mitosis.
9:22
We call it binary fission.
9:31
I'm not going to go into the deep mechanism here,
9:33
but the idea is fairly simple.I have a bacteria right here.
9:37
It replicates its DNA,so it'll have two of these nucleoids here,
9:43
and then the cytoplasm essentially splits,
9:46
or it's kind of a form of cleavage right there.
9:49
It splits and then you have two of them.You have two of them then.
9:55
And then each of them,they can code for the proteins necessary
9:59
to produce all of their extra appendages,the flagellum,
10:02
which is this long tail-like thing that can help it move.
10:06
And it's actually fascinating
10:07
because it's operating at such a small scale,
10:08
but you can still kind of get this motor movement going on.
10:12
Even at this very,very small scale,using very primitive--
10:16
I won't say primitive,because that's making a value judgment
10:18
on these things,but using--you know,
10:20
these flagellum are on the order of several nanometers,
10:22
on the order of tens of nanometers wide.
10:25
So you don't have a lot of atoms to deal with,
10:27
but you're still able to get this kind of wave-like motion
10:31
that can move the bacteria around.
10:33
Now,you're saying,hey,Sal,in that first video on evolution,
10:36
you told me that we see evolution every day
10:39
and bacteria is one example.
10:42
When we use antibiotics,we think it'll help eliminate bacteria,
10:45
but that one bacteria that has some type of resistance,
10:47
it'll survive,so it is more fit.
10:50
How did these guys get variation?
10:53
Well,the one way,and this is the way everything can get variation,
10:55
is they can get mutations.
10:58
And bacteria replicate so quickly,they reproduce so quickly that
11:02
even if you have a mutation that's one in every thousand times,
11:06
by the time you have a million bacteria,
11:07
you'll have a thousand mutations.
11:09
So they have mutations,but they also have this form.
11:12
I don't want to call it sexual reproduction,
11:14
because it's not sexual reproduction.
11:15
They don't form gametes and the gametes
11:17
don't fertilize each other and then produces a zygote.
11:20
But two bacteria can get near each other
11:27
and then one of their piluses--I'll do that right here.
11:35
So the piluses are these little structures on the side of the bacteria
11:39
They're these little tubes,really.
11:42
One of the piluses can connect from one bacteria to another,
11:46
and then essentially you have a mixing of
11:48
what's inside one bacteria with another.
11:50
So let me draw their nucleoids.
11:55
And then they have these other pieces of just DNA
11:58
that hangs out called plasmids.
12:01
These are just circular pieces of DNA.
12:04
Maybe this guy has got this extra neat plasmid.
12:07
He got it from someplace,
12:08
and it's making him able to do things that this guy couldn't do.
12:11
Maybe this is the R plasmid,which is known for
12:16
making a bacteria resistant to a lot of antibiotics.
12:19
And what happens is,that bacteria--and actually,
12:21
there's mechanisms where the bacteria know that,hey,
12:23
this guy doesn't have the R plasmid.
12:24
And we're just beginning to understand how it actually works,
12:26
but this will actually replicate itself
12:29
and give this guy a version of the R plasmid.
12:33
You could also have these things,transposons,
12:34
and I should make a whole video on this
12:36
because we have transposons,too.
12:38
But there's parts of DNA that can jump from
12:40
one part of a fragment of DNA to another,
12:42
and these can also end up in the other one.
12:44
So what you have is kind of--it's not formal sexual reproduction,
12:47
but what you essentially have is a connection,
12:48
and these bacteria are just constantly swapping DNA with each other
12:52
and DNA is jumping back and forth,so you can imagine
12:55
all sorts of combinations of DNA happen even within
12:58
what you used to call one bacterial species
13:02
and very quickly can turn to multiple species
13:04
and become resistant to different things.
13:06
If this makes it resistant to an antibiotic,
13:08
then it can kind of spread the information to produce
13:11
those resistant proteins or whatever to the other bacteria.
13:15
So this is kind of a form of introducing variation.
13:19
And so when you transfer stuff via this pilus,or the plural is pili,
13:23
this is called conjugation,bacterial conjugation.
13:32
Now,the last thing I want to talk about,
13:33
because it's something that you've heard a lot about,are antibiotics.
13:38
A lot of people,they get sick.
13:39
The first thing they want to get is an antibiotic.
13:44
And an antibiotic is just a whole class of chemicals and compounds,
13:47
some of them naturally derived,some of them not,that kill bacteria.
13:54
So now if someone is undergoing a surgery and they get a cut,
13:58
instead of them having to worry about getting an infection,
14:01
they'll take some antibiotics
14:03
to prevent the bacteria from growing on them.
14:06
But the question is how was this discovered
14:09
or where does it come from?
14:12
It actually came from Alexander Fleming.Let me write him down.
14:17
Very important,because the discovery of antibiotics is,
14:20
in my opinion,the most important discovery in medicine so far.
14:23
So,Alexander Fleming.He was studying--I think it was Staphylococcus.
14:33
I forget which bacteria it was,but it was in a Petri dish.
14:36
He was using a Petri dish.Let me draw a Petri dish.
14:38
There's a little circle.
14:40
There's some nutrients that the bacteria can grow on.
14:42
So let's say the bacteria,you know,
14:44
it's growing on this Petri dish.
14:47
And he went out,and he came back into the room,
14:48
and he saw that some mold,some fungus had grown on this,
14:55
kind of a bluish-greenish fungus
14:59
had grown on the center of his Petri dish.
15:04
And the bacteria,there was kind of this space around it,
15:06
and the bacteria couldn't get close to it.
15:08
And this mold,this fungus was called Penicillium,
15:13
the Penicillium fungus.He was able to figure that out.
15:16
He took a sample of this and then he cultured it,
15:18
which means letting it grow and then seeing what it is.
15:21
This was Penicillium.And he figured out that,gee,
15:24
this fungus must have something,some chemical that it's emitting
15:28
that's essentially killing the bacteria around it,
15:30
that's not allowing the bacteria to get near it.
15:33
And so that led to the discovery of penicillin.
15:47
This was in the late 20s,1920s.
15:51
By the time World War II came around,
15:52
now people had gunshot wounds and they had to get things amputated,
15:55
whatnot,but for the first time,
15:57
they could actually give people antibiotics and not worry about--
16:00
or they probably still worried about it,
16:03
but didn't have to worry about this thing as much as they did before.
16:07
And now,you know,if you have bacteria,
16:08
if you have tuberculosis or Lyme disease or anything,
16:12
the treatment all involves taking antibiotics.
16:16
And there are many,many more types of antibiotics
16:18
now coming from many, many more different sources,
16:20
but the general idea is the same.You want to kill bacteria.
16:24
Although you don't want to kill all bacteria,
16:25
because some of it's good.
16:26
In fact,we are made up a whole lot of bacteria.
16:30
I don't know if I even mentioned this earlier in the video.
16:31
There's bacteria in our skin that helps take up oil
16:33
and moisturizes and make our skin nice and supple.
16:37
So,you know,the way you think about it,
16:38
you could view them as negative or you could view them as positive
16:40
or you could view them as something in between,
16:42
but the really amazing thing,at least in my mind,
16:44
is that we're living in symbiosis with them.
16:46
I remember I saw a Star Trek episode once where you had these people.
16:52
You had these people,and they were some alien race.
16:56
Jean Luc Picard had--they ran into them.
16:59
They looked very humanoid like that.
17:02
But it turns out--let me draw this human--
17:04
that they had these little bugs in their brain stem.
17:07
So they had these big insects in their brain stem
17:09
and these insects started infecting the crew of the Enterprise,
17:13
and they were controlling their brains and making them act weird
17:17
and whatever not,and this seemed like a very bizarre alien concept
17:20
of some creepy-crawlie living in us
17:24
and affecting our brains and affecting us in some ways.
17:26
But if you really think about it,we are doing this,
17:28
and it's not just with one little bug,
17:30
it's on the order of trillions.
17:32
Hundreds of trillions of bugs are with us every day
17:35
and they make us us.
17:37
I mean,I'm here recording videos along with--
17:39
or maybe I should even say the bacteria is recording videos
17:43
or it's maybe partially responsible for controlling bacteria.
17:46
And it's known that the bacteria can even affect our mental state.
17:49
There's a whole bunch of research now that
17:51
certain types of bacteria can cause schizophrenia.
17:54
Actually,syphilis does.Bacteria can cause depression.
17:58
Lyme disease,it's known that
18:01
when you go into later phases of Lyme disease,
18:04
it can affect the mental condition of the person who has the infection
18:09
so it affects every part of who we are.
18:11
I mean,it would be hard to even talk of being a human being

0:00
Rewrite the expression 4 times, and then in parentheses
0:03
we have 8 plus 3, using the distributive law of
0:07
multiplication over addition.
0:09
Then simplify the expression.
0:11
So let's just try to solve this or evaluate this
0:16
expression, then we'll talk a little bit about the
0:18
distributive law of multiplication over addition,
0:20
usually just called the distributive law.
0:23
So we have 4 times 8 plus 8 plus 3.
0:34
Now there's two ways to do it.
0:36
Normally, when you have parentheses, your inclination
0:38
is, well, let me just evaluate what's in the parentheses
0:41
first and then worry about what's outside of the
0:43
parentheses, and we can do that fairly easily here.
0:46
We can evaluate what 8 plus 3 is.
0:48
8 plus 3 is 11.
0:49
So if we do that-- let me do that in this direction.
0:52
So if we do that, we get 4 times, and in parentheses we
0:58
have an 11.
1:00
8 plus 3 is 11, and then this is going to be equal to--
1:04
well, 4 times 11 is just 44, so you can
1:08
evaluate it that way.
1:09
But they want us to use the distributive law of
1:11
multiplication.
1:12
We did not use the distributive law just now.
1:14
We just evaluated the expression.
1:17
We used the parentheses first, then multiplied by 4.
1:20
In the distributive law, we multiply by 4 first. And it's
1:24
called the distributive law because you distribute the 4,
1:27
and we're going to think about what that means.
1:29
So in the distributive law, what this will become, it'll
1:33
become 4 times 8 plus 4 times 3, and we're going to think
1:37
about why that is in a second.
1:38
So this is going to be equal to 4 times 8 plus 4 times 3.
1:52
A lot of people's first instinct is just to multiply
1:54
the 4 times the 8, but no!
1:56
You have to distribute the 4.
1:58
You have to multiply it times the 8 and times the 3.
2:03
This is right here.
2:04
This is the distributive property in action right here.
2:07
Distributive property in action.
2:10
And then when you evaluate it-- and I'm going to show you
2:11
in kind of a visual way why this works.
2:14
But then when you evaluate it, 4 times 8-- I'll do this in a
2:17
different color-- 4 times 8 is 32, and then so we have 32
2:23
plus 4 times 3.
2:25
4 times 3 is 12 and 32 plus 12 is equal to 44.
2:32
That is also equal to 44, so you can get it either way.
2:36
But when they want us to use the distributive law, you'd
2:38
distribute the 4 first. Now let's think
2:41
about why that happens.
2:42
Let's visualize just what 8 plus 3 is.
2:45
Let me draw eight of something.
2:47
So one, two, three, four, five, six,
2:53
seven, eight, right?
2:58
And then we're going to add to that three of something, of
3:04
maybe the same thing.
3:05
One, two, three.
3:07
So you can imagine this is what we have inside of the
3:10
parentheses.
3:11
We have 8 circles plus 3 circles.
3:14
Now, when we're multiplying this whole thing, this whole
3:16
thing times 4, what does that mean?
3:20
Well, that means we're just going to add this to itself
3:22
four times.
3:23
Let me do that with a copy and paste.
3:26
Copy and paste.
3:28
Let me copy and then let me paste.
3:31
There you go.
3:32
That's two.
3:33
That's one, two, three, and then we have four, and we're
3:39
going to add them all together.
3:41
So this is literally what?
3:42
Four times, right?
3:45
Let me go back to the drawing tool.
3:47
We have it one, two, three, four times this expression,
3:50
which is 8 plus 3.
3:52
Now, what is this thing over here?
4:00
If you were to count all of this stuff, you would get 44.
4:03
But what is this thing over here?
4:05
Well, that's 8 added to itself four times.
4:09
You could imagine you're adding all of these.
4:11
So what's 8 added to itself four times?
4:14
That is 4 times 8.
4:16
So this is 4 times 8, and what is this
4:22
over here in the orange?
4:24
We have one, two, three, four times.
4:27
Well, each time we have three.
4:28
So it's 4 times this right here.
4:32
This right here is 4 times 3.
4:37
So you see why the distributive property works.
4:39
If you do 4 times 8 plus 3, you have to multiply-- when
4:44
you, I guess you could imagine, duplicate the thing
4:46
four times, both the 8 and the 3 is getting duplicated four
4:50
times or it's being added to itself four times, and that's
4:53
why we distribute the 4.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,gl_-E6iVAg4,

0:00
Let's say that f of x is equal to x times e to the negative
0:08
two x squared, and we want to find any critical numbers for f.
0:14
I encourage you to pause this video and think about,
0:17
can you find any critical numbers of f.
0:21
I'm assuming you've given a go at it.
0:23
Let's just remind ourselves what a critical number is.
0:26
We would say c is a critical
0:30
number of f, if and only if.
0:39
I'll write if with two f's, short for if and only if,
0:44
f prime of c is equal to zero or f prime of c is undefined.
0:55
If we look for the critical numbers for f we want to figure
0:59
out all the places where the derivative of this with
1:01
respect to x is either equal to zero or it is undefined.
1:06
Let's think about how we can find the derivative of this.
1:10
f prime of x is going to be, well let's see.
1:16
We're going to have to apply some combination
1:17
of the product rule and the chain rule.
1:19
It's going to be the derivative with respect to x of x,
1:28
so it's going to be that,
1:29
times e to the negative two x squared plus the derivative
1:38
with respect to x of e to the negative two x squared
1:50
times x. This is just the product rule right over here.
1:57
Derivative of the x times e to the
2:00
negative of two x squared plus the derivative of e to the
2:02
negative two x squared times x, right over here.
2:05
What is this going to be?
2:07
Well all of this stuff in magenta,
2:09
the derivative of x with respect to x,
2:12
that's just going to be equal to one.
2:14
This first part is going to be equal
2:16
to e to the negative two x squared.
2:20
Now the derivative of e to the
2:23
negative two x squared over here.
2:25
I'll do this in this pink color.
2:26
This part right over here, that is going to be equal to-
2:30
We'll just apply the chain rule.
2:32
Derivative of e to the negative two x squared with
2:34
respect to negative two x squared, well that's
2:37
just going to be e to the negative two x squared.
2:41
We're going to multiply that times the
2:42
derivative of negative two x squared with respect to x.
2:47
That's going to be what, negative four x.
2:52
Times negative four x, and of
2:56
course we have this x over here.
2:58
We have that x over there and let's see,
3:02
can we simplify it at all?
3:06
Well obviously both of these terms have
3:08
an e to the negative two x squared.
3:10
I'm going to try to figure out where this is
3:11
either undefined or where this is equal to zero.
3:16
Let's think about this a little bit.
3:20
If we factor out e to the negative two x squared,
3:23
I'll do that in green.
3:24
We're going to have,
3:26
this is equal to e to the negative two x squared times,
3:31
we have here, one minus four x squared.
3:38
One minus four x squared.
3:45
This is the derivative of f.
3:48
Where would this be undefined or equal to zero?
3:55
e to the negative two x squared,
3:57
this is going to be defined for any value of x,
4:02
this part is going to be defined,
4:04
and this part is also going to be defined for any value of x.
4:08
There's no point where this is undefined.
4:10
Let's think about when this is going to be equal to zero.
4:13
The product of these two expressions equalling zero,
4:16
e to the negative two x squared,
4:17
that will never be equal to zero.
4:20
If you get this exponent to be a really,
4:21
I guess you could say very negative number,
4:23
you will approach zero but you will never get it to be zero.
4:29
This part here can't be zero.
4:31
If the product of two things are zero at least
4:33
one of them has to be zero, so the only way
4:35
we can get f prime of x to be equal to zero is
4:39
when one minus four x squared is equal to zero.
4:44
One minus four x squared is equal
4:46
to zero, let me rewrite that.
4:48
One minus four x squared is equal
4:50
to zero, when does that happen?
4:53
This one we can just solve.
4:55
Add four x squared to both sides,
4:57
you get one is equal to four x squared.
4:59
Divide both sides by four, you get
5:01
one fourth is equal to x squared.
5:03
Then what x values is this true at?
5:06
We just take the plus or minus square root of both sides
5:09
and you get x is equal to plus or minus one half.
5:15
Negative one half squared is one fourth,
5:16
positive one half squared is one fourth.
5:20
If x equals plus or minus one half f prime,
5:24
or the derivative, is equal to zero.
5:26
Let me write it this way.
5:27
f prime of one half is equal to zero,
5:31
and you can verify that right over here.
5:33
And f prime of negative one half is equal to zero.

0:00
So we've got the function, f of x is equal to x squared.
0:05
And what I'm concerned with, is finding the area under the curve,
0:09
y is equal to f of x, so that's my y axis.
0:13
This is my, my, x axis.
0:18
Then let me draw my function.
0:20
My function looks like this.
0:22
At least in the, in the first quadrant.
0:24
That's where I'll graph it for now.
0:26
I could also graph it, obviously in the second quadrant.
0:29
But, what I care about is the area under this curve and above the positive x axis,
0:34
between, between x equals 1 and x equals 4, x equals 4.
0:41
And I'm tired of approximating areas.
0:44
I wanna find the exact area under this curve above the x axis.
0:50
And the way we denote the exact area under the
0:52
curve, this little brown shaded area, is using the definite integral.
0:56
The definite integral from 1 to 4 of f of x, dx.
1:02
And the way that, or the way I conceptualize
1:04
where this notation comes from, is we imagine a
1:07
bunch of infinite, an infinite number of infinitely thin
1:10
rectangles that we sum up to find this area.
1:13
Let me draw one of those infinitely thin rectangles, maybe not so infinitely thin.
1:18
So, let me draw it like this.
1:20
So, that would be one of the rectangles, that would be another rectangle.
1:23
This should be reminiscent of a Riemann sum.
1:25
In fact, that's where the Riemann integral comes from.
1:27
Think of a Riemann sum where you have an infinite number
1:30
of these rectangles, where the width of each of the rectangles.
1:33
This is how I conceptualize it, is dx, and the height of this rectangle is the
1:38
function evaluated at an x that's within this interval right over here.
1:43
And so, this part right over here is the area of
1:46
one of those rectangles, and we were summing them all up.
1:49
And this kind of an elongated s, reminiscent of a sigma for summing.
1:54
We're summing up the infinite number, of those infinitely thin rectangles,
1:58
or the areas of those infinitely thin rectangles between 1 and 4.
2:02
So that's where the notation of the definite integral comes from.
2:05
But we still haven't done anything.
2:06
We've just written some notation that says the exact area of the un-
2:10
Between 1 and 4, under the curve f of x, and above the x axis.
2:15
In order to actually do anything really productive with this, we have to turn to
2:19
the second fundamental theorem of calculus, sometimes called
2:22
part two of the fundamental theorem of calculus.
2:24
>> Which tells us, that if f has an antiderivative, so if we
2:29
have the antiderivative of f, so f of x is derivative,
2:35
derivative of some function capital F of x, or another way of saying it is,
2:40
f, capital F of x is the antiderivative,
2:45
antiderivative of lower case f of x.
2:51
Then I can evaluate this thing, and we do
2:52
a whole video on conceptually understanding why this makes sense.
2:56
We could evaluate this, by evaluating the antiderivative
3:00
of f, or an antiderivative of f, at 4.
3:04
And from that, subtract the antiderivative evaluated at 1.
3:09
So, let's do it for this particular case right over here.
3:14
So we are taking, I'll just rewrite this statement.
3:17
Instead of writing f of x, I'll write x squared.
3:19
So, the definite integral from 1 to 4 of x squared dx.
3:24
Well, we're just gonna have to figure out what the antiderivative is.
3:27
So if f of x is equal to x squared, what is capital F of x equal to?
3:33
What is the antiderivative?
3:36
Well, you might remember from your power rule, that if you
3:39
take the derivative with respect to x of x to the
3:43
third, you are going to get 3x squared, which is pretty
3:47
darn close to x squared except for this factor of 3.
3:50
So, let's divide both sides by 3.
3:52
Let's divide both sides by 3, and you get the derivative
3:56
of x to the third divided by 3 is indeed x squared.
4:00
Or, you can say this is the same thing as the
4:02
derivative with respect to x of, x to the third over 3.
4:07
Take the derivative of this.
4:08
It'll be 3 times one third.
4:11
And then you'll decrement the power, it'll just be x squared.
4:13
So, this right over here, once again, is x squared.
4:15
It's just equal to, just equal to x squared.
4:20
So, in this case, our capital F of x, our antiderivative,
4:24
is x to the third, x to the third over 3.
4:28
And so we just have to evaluate that at 4 and at 1, and sometimes the way we would,
4:34
the, the notation we would use is, we'll say that the antiderivative is x
4:40
to the third over 3, and we're going to evaluate it, the one I, I always
4:44
just like to write the numbers up here,
4:46
at 4 and from that subtracted, evaluated at 1.
4:49
Sometimes you'll see people write a little line here too,
4:51
we'll say we're evaluate it at 4 and then at 1.
4:54
But I'll just do it without the line.
4:56
If we're gonna evaluate this thing at 4 and from
4:59
that subtract it, subtract it evaluated at 1, so this
5:02
going to be equal to 4 to the third power is 64, so it's going to be 64 over 3.
5:07
Let me color code it, this is, this right over here, is this, right
5:13
over there and then from that, we're
5:15
going to subtract this business evaluated at one.
5:18
Well, when you evaluate it at 1, you get 1 to the third is one over 3.
5:23
You get one third.
5:24
So just to be clear, this is this right over there.
5:31
And then we are ready to just subtract these fractions.
5:33
64 over 3, minus one third, is equal to 63 over 3.
5:41
And 3 goes into 63 exactly, exactly 21 times.

In triangle ABC, AB is equal to 13, BC is equal to 14, and AC is equal to 15.
0:08
Let me just draw that. It looks like a pretty involved problem
0:17
So it looks something like that
0:31
Let's say this is triangle ABC
0:34
They tell us AB is equal to 13, BC is equal to 14 and AC is equal to 15
0:42
and then they tell us point G is the intersection of the medians.
0:48
If you've watched the video on medians and centroids you might recognize
0:51
that the intersection of the medians is just the centroid.
0:54
Let me just show that here.
0:59
The line from B to the midpoint of AC is a median.
1:05
Let me draw that a little cleaner.
1:08
So that is a median.
1:10
Now the line from A to the midpoint of BC is also a median.
1:22
And finally the line from C to the midpoint of AB is a median.
1:33
We learned -- if you've watched the video on medians and centroids --
1:38
that these three medians always intersect at a point called the centroid.
1:42
They even imply that in the question. So that right there is point G.
1:50
Point A', B', and C' are the iamges of A, B, and C after a 180 degree rotation about G.
1:59
What is the area of the nion of the two regions enclosed by the triangles ABC and A'B'C'?
2:06
Let's draw the second triangle.
2:11
What we want to do is rotate each of these about G 180 degrees.
2:16
So if A is here and we rotate it 180 degrees about G,
2:23
it's going to end up just as far from G on that side.
2:28
So A' is going to be right over there.
2:36
B is this far right now, if you rotate it 180 degrees,
2:44
B' will then be about that far.
2:49
Same for C. If you rotate it 180 degrees,
2:52
it's going to go about here. So you have C'.
3:02
So if we wanted to draw A'B'C', it's going to look like this.
3:07
Here's my best attempt at it.
3:20
This line should be parallel to that line
3:24
since it's been rotated by 180 degrees.
3:27
And this line [C'B'] should be parallel to this line [BC],
3:33
and this line [C'A'] should be parallel to that line [AC].

I'm not doing this in real time; it took me a while before I did this problem
4:05
before it jumped out at me.
4:06
Kind of knowing that most of these problems don't require
4:09
really hard mathematics.
4:10
A lot of the time you just kind of have to see something
4:12
or rearrange things and the answer jumps out.
4:16
It's also the case with this one here.
4:20
And the thing that jumps out (and the motivation for making this video)
4:23
I showed you in the last video that if you have the median of a triangle
4:33
and the centroid of the trianlge is over here,
4:35
this distance [GA] is twice the distance from the centroid to the midpoint [of BC]
4:43
and the same on all 3 sides.
4:49
But this distance [AG] is also the same as this whole entire distance [A'G]
5:01
This distance has been rotated 180 and degrees
5:05
and if this distance [G-midpoint of BC] is half of that one [AG]
5:10
this is exactly halfway between this point [G] and that point [A']
5:19
Another way to think about it:
5:23
we know that this length over here is equal to this length over here,
5:27
which is equal to this length over here, which is equal to this length over here
5:31
And so you start seeing, maybe, some triangles will jump out.
5:37
Let's see if I can draw these triangles.
5:42
I have this triangle up here.
5:49
This is actually going to be a median of this triangle over here
5:53
It's going to be the same as the median or equivalent line of this triangle over here
6:05
It's actually going to be an altitude -- we're kind of drawing a rhombus
6:10
and the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.
6:15
So this altitude right here is going to be the same as this altitude over here.
6:22
This side is the exact same thing as this side.
6:31
Let me be careful here.
6:33
We already know that this side is going to be the same thing as this side
6:37
We know these two sides are the same because this is acting as a median of this triangle
6:41
We already know that this yellow side I'll draw two marks is the same thing
6:48
as that yellow side down there.
6:51
If this is the same as this, and this is the same in both triangles,
6:56
we know that this side must be the same thing as this side,
7:06
which also must be the same thing as this side and this side over here.
7:16
Another way to think about it, this triangle is going to have the exact same area
7:20
as this triangle.
7:22
This triangle is going to have the same exact area as this triangle.
7:24
Or, you could view it another way.
7:26
This purple triangle right over here is going to be a congruent triangle to this triangle over here.
7:35
All of its sides are exactly the same. They share one of them.
7:39
We could use the same argument to say that this triangle right over here
7:43
is completely congruent to this triangle right over there.
7:54
They have all of the same sides.
7:55
In fact, we even know that they are congruent to these two up here.
7:59
So these are all congruent.
8:04
Let's think about this triangle right over here.
8:19
We know that this distance, the distance when started talking about medians,
8:27
from the centroid to the base, that's the exact same distance
8:32
over here , if you were to draw a parallel line.
8:39
It's just that this line up here and this line over here are parallel
8:44
If this is parallel to this, and they're intersecting at the same point
8:50
I won't go into the depth of proving they're parallel -- it's not too hard to prove.
8:54
You can show that this distance is the same as this distance.
9:01
We share this magenta side right over here,
9:08
so we know that this side is going to
9:13
be the same as that side
9:17
Or we know that this triangle is going to be
9:19
the same thing as that triangle.
9:21
And then we can take the mirror image.
9:26
Using essentially the same argument,
9:28
that's going to be the same thing as this triangle over here.
9:31
And it's a similar argument to show that that's going
9:33
to be the same thing as that triangle over there.
9:35
And then do it on the other side.
9:42
I think you see where this is going!
9:44
All of these triangles are congruent.
9:58
There's actually multiple ways you can make that argument.
10:04
The same argument we made to show that these magenta triangles are congruent,
10:07
we could make to say that this distance is exactly half of this entire distance.
10:13
Same argument to tell you that this triangle's congruent
10:16
to that that triangle.
10:17
And that one to that one.
10:21
So that entire shape --
10:23
and actually I was a little handwavy about it --
10:29
I think you can see it actually wouldn't be hard to do a rigorous proof.
10:33
But this shape, this slanted star of david
10:37
is made up of [counts to 12] congruent triangles.
10:48
12 congruent triangles.
10:53
Now, how many of these congruent triangles originally made up our triangle ABC?
10:58
[counts to 9]
11:12
So we have 12 congruent triangles in the star
11:17
we had 9 congruent triangles in ABC,
11:30
so the area of the star is just going to be 12/9 the area of ABC.
11:37
So if we can figure out the area of ABC,
11:41
we know that each triangle will have 1/9 that area.
11:44
Multiplying by 12 we'll get the area of the actual star.
11:49
So let's figure out the area of triangle ABC.
11:53
Let me redraw the triangle.
12:02
There are formulas for figuring out the areas of triangles if you know the sides.
12:07
I always forget them, but I do remember the law of cosines.
12:10
It helps me derive those formulas.
12:15
Area of a triangle is 1/2 base * height,
12:22
so if we could figure out this height,
12:27
we could multiply 1/2 and 14, or multiply it by 7 and
12:31
then we would be able to figure out the area of this entire triangle.
12:34
How can we do that?
12:36
Let's just break out a little trigonometry.
12:44
Let's take this to be theta over here.
12:48
The law of cosines tells us that
12:50
the opposite side of the angle squared, so 15 squared
12:55
is equal to the sum of the other sides squared
12:59
(13 squared + 14 squared)
13:02
minus 2 times the product of these two sides
13:07
so times 13 times 14
13:10
times the cosine of theta
13:15
Now, what is the cosine of theta?
13:18
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse,
13:22
so that's this side over our hypotenuse.
13:26
So let's just call this length over here x.
13:36
So cosine of theta is x over 13.
13:41
So if you could solve for x you could then solve for h using the Pythogorean Theorem
13:45
These two characters cancel out, and we are left with
13:52
15 squared is 225, 13 squared is 169
13:56
14 squared -- we have 140 + 40 + 16 = 196
14:07
minus 28 x
14:16
So let's solve for x.
14:22
We'll do a couple of things. We'll subtract 225 from both sides
14:28
and I'm going to add 28x to both sides
14:36
On the left hand side we are left with 28 x is equal to
14:43
and we have to do a little bit of math
14:44
[does arithmetic aloud] 365. Did I do that right?
15:00
And from that we want to subtract 225
15:07
It is going to be 140
15:10
so x is going to be 140 divided by 28
15:19
Let's think about it. It goes 5 times. 5 times 20 is 100,
15:25
5 times 8 is 40, so 5 times 28 is 140
15:28
So x in this situation is equal to 5.
15:33
So we can use that information to figure out this height.
15:37
We know from the pythagorean theorem that
15:38
5 squared plus h squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared.
15:41
It's equal to 169
15:47
or h squared = 169 -25 = 144.
15:53
h is equal to 12
15:58
Now we can figure out the area of the triangle.
16:00
The area sometimes denoted by brackets [ABC] is equal to
16:06
1/2 times 14 times 12
16:13
which is the same as 7 times 12, which is equal to 84
16:19
That's just the area of these 9 congruent triangles.
16:26
We know that the area of the whole thing will be 12/9 of that
16:34
So the area of the star is going to be equal to 12/9 times 84
16:50
12/9, dividing numerator and denominator by 3 is the same as 4/3
17:02
3 does go into 84. How many times? Is it 28?
17:06
Let me make sure. 2*3 = 6, so yup, 28 times.
17:15
So this is equal to 4 times 28
17:19
Which is going to be 80 plus 32
17:23
which is equal to 112.
17:28
Let me make sure I did that right
17:32
4 times 20 is 80 plus 32 is 112.

Here some picture of what most people associate when they think of chemistry.
0:05
They think of scientists working on a bench
0:08
with the different vials of different chemicals.
0:11
They might think of a mad scientist.
0:14
Some of them boiling and changing colors.
0:16
They might associate chemistry with chemical equations.
0:19
Thinking about how different things will react together
0:22
to form other things.
0:24
They might think about models of the different molecules
0:28
that can be depicted different ways.
0:30
They might associate it with the periodic table of elements.
0:33
And all of these things are a big part of chemistry.
0:38
But I want you to do in this video
0:39
is appreciate what at its essence chemistry is all about.
0:45
And chemistry is one of the sciences
0:47
that really just helps us understand
0:50
and make models and make predictions about our reality.
0:55
And even something like the periodic table of elements,
0:57
which you'll see at the front of any chemistry classroom,
1:00
you take it for granted.
1:02
But this is the product of, frankly,
1:05
thousands of years of human beings
1:08
trying to get to an understanding
1:10
of all of the different complexity in the world.
1:13
If you look at the world around us,
1:15
and it doesn't even have to be our planet,
1:17
it could be the universe around us,
1:19
you see all these different substances
1:21
that seem to be different in certain ways.
1:24
You see things like fire and rock and water.
1:28
Even in the planets,
1:29
you see meteorological patterns.
1:32
In life, you see all of this complexity
1:35
and all of these different things
1:36
and it looks like there's just like a infinite spectrum
1:39
of differentness out of there.
1:40
Of different substances.
1:42
Even in things like our human brain.
1:43
The complexity and the electrochemical interactions.
1:47
And you could imagine as a species,
1:50
this is kind of overwhelming.
1:51
How do you make the sense of all of this?
1:53
And it was not an easy path,
1:57
but over thousands of years,
1:59
we did start to make sense of it.
2:01
And why it's very lucky for all of us
2:03
to be born when we are now
2:05
or to be around when we are now.
2:07
To be able to learn chemistry where we are now
2:09
is that we get the answer.
2:10
And it's a partial answer, which is also exciting,
2:13
cause we don't want the full answer.
2:15
But it's a partial answer that takes us a long way.
2:17
We realize that the periodic table of elements,
2:19
that all of this complexity that we're seeing before,
2:23
that at the end of the day,
2:24
things are made of basic building blocks.
2:27
Kind of you could imagine the legos
2:29
that really make up everything.
2:31
And there aren't an infinite number of legos.
2:33
There's actually a finite number of them.
2:34
We're discovering more all of the time,
2:36
well not all of the time,
2:37
now new elements are not discovered that frequently,
2:39
but there's a few of these elements
2:41
that are disproportionately showing up
2:44
in a lot of what we see here.
2:45
These things that seem so different.
2:48
Well a lot of this is different compositions of elements
2:51
like carbon and oxygen and hydrogen.
2:54
And even the elements themselves are made of things
2:56
like protons and electrons and neutrons
3:00
that are just rearranged in different ways
3:02
to give us these elements
3:04
that have all of these different properties.
3:08
So when you think about chemistry,
3:10
yes, it might visually look something like this.
3:15
These are obviously much older pictures.
3:17
But at its essence, it's how do we create models
3:20
and understand the models that describe
3:23
a lot of the complexity in the universe around us?
3:27
And just to put chemistry in,
3:29
I guess you could say, in context
3:31
with some of the other sciences,
3:34
many people would say at the purest level,
3:37
you would have mathematics.
3:40
That math, you're studying ideas,
3:43
which could even be independent,
3:46
you're seeing logical ideas that could be even independent
3:48
of anything that you've ever observed or experienced.
3:51
And a lot of folks that say if we ever communicate
3:54
with another intelligent species
3:56
that could be completely different than us,
3:58
math might be that common language.
4:00
Because even if we perceive the world differently
4:03
and think differently in certain ways,
4:05
math might be that common language.
4:07
But on top of math, we start to say,
4:10
well how is our reality actually structured?
4:13
At the most basic level,
4:15
what are the constituents of matter
4:17
and what are the mathematical properties
4:19
that describe how they react together?
4:22
And then, or interact with each other?
4:24
Then you go one level above that,
4:26
you get to the topic of this video, which is chemistry.
4:30
Which is very closely related to physics.
4:34
When we talk about these chemical equations
4:36
and we create these molecular structures,
4:38
the interactions between these atoms,
4:41
these are quantum mechanical interactions
4:45
which we do not fully understand at the deepest level yet.
4:49
But with chemistry, we can start to make use
4:52
of the math and they physics to start to think about
4:55
how all of these different building blocks
4:56
can interact to explain all sorts of different phenomena.
5:00
This chemical equation you see right here,
5:02
this is combustion.
5:03
This is hydrogen combusting with oxygen
5:05
to produce a lot of energy.
5:07
To produce energy.
5:10
When we imagine combustion, we think of fire.
5:12
But what even is fire at its most fundamental level?
5:16
How do we get,
5:17
why do we perceive this thing here?
5:19
And chemistry is super important
5:21
because on top of that, we build biology.
5:25
We build biology.
5:27
And as you'll see as you study all of these things,
5:29
there's points where these things start to bleed together.
5:32
But the biology in, say, a human being,
5:34
or really in any species,
5:36
it's based on molecular interactions.
5:39
Interactions between molecules, between atoms,
5:42
which, at the end of the day, is all about chemistry.
5:45
As I speak, the only reason why I'm able to speak
5:47
is because of really,
5:50
hard to imagine the number of chemical interactions
5:53
happening in me right now
5:56
to create this soundness.
5:58
To create this thing that thinks it exists
6:00
that wants to make a video about how awesome
6:03
and amazing chemistry is.
6:05
And then from biology,
6:06
you can build out on all of everything else.
6:08
So sciences like psychology and economics, which of course,
6:11
these things also leverage math and other things.
6:14
But this gives you kind of a sense
6:17
of how we build up and how we explain the reality around us.
6:22
And not one of these is more important than the other.
6:25
These are all studying incredibly fascinating things
6:27
that as humans beings first became thoughtful
6:31
about their environment,
6:33
said, ""Gee, why are we here?
6:35
""What is this place?
6:36
""Why do we exist?
6:37
""How do we exist?""
6:39
And chemistry builds models
6:42
for us to understand interactions at a scale and a speed
6:45
that we can't directly observe,
6:47
but nonetheless, we can to start to make predictions.
6:50
So that's what's really cool about this.
6:52
When you study chemistry,
6:53
you should not view this as some type of a chore
6:56
that the school system is forcing you through.
7:00
There are people who would've done anything 100 years ago
7:04
to get the answers that are in your chemistry book today
7:07
or that you can learn from your chemistry teacher
7:09
or that you can learn from a Khan Academy video.
7:11
There are people in the world in the past and today
7:14
who'd do anything to be able to understand deeply
7:16
what this is.
7:17
That they consider it a privilege
7:19
to be able to learn at this level.
7:23
And then to think about where this could go
7:25
because none of these fields are complete.
7:27
We have very partial knowledge of all of these fields.
7:30
Arguably, there's an infinite more that we could learn
7:33
relative to what we know.
7:35
But what's exciting is that we have such a strong start.
7:37
We're starting to make sense of it.

0:00
In this video, we're going to hopefully understand
0:06
why the exponential form of a complex number
0:08
is actually useful.
0:13
So let's say we want to solve the equation x
0:15
to the third power is equal to 1.
0:18
So we want to find all of the real and/or complex roots
0:22
of this equation right over here.
0:24
This is the same thing as x to the third minus 1
0:27
is equal to 0.
0:27
So we're looking for all the real and complex roots of this.
0:31
And there are ways to do this without exponential form
0:34
of a complex number.
0:35
But the technique we're going to see in this video
0:38
could be applied if this was x to the fifth minus 1,
0:40
or x to the 13th minus 1.
0:42
And it's also going to show us the patterns that
0:46
emerge when you start looking at things on an Argand diagram.
0:49
So to do this, let's think about the exponential representation
0:54
of 1.
0:55
So let's just say z is equal to 1.
0:57
1 is a complex number.
0:59
It's a real number.
1:00
All real numbers are also complex numbers.
1:02
They're a subset.
1:04
They're in the complex plane.
1:07
They just don't have an imaginary part.
1:10
So let's draw this on an Argand diagram.
1:13
So that's my real axis.
1:15
This is my imaginary axis.
1:22
And so this is the real.
1:24
This is the imaginary.
1:26
And if I wanted to represent z equals 1,
1:29
it only has a real part.
1:31
So let me just draw 1 all around.
1:33
Negative 1.
1:35
Negative 1.
1:36
z looks like this.
1:42
z would look like that, a position
1:44
vector that just goes to 1, 0.
1:47
One way to view it-- this is the same thing as equal to 1
1:51
plus 0i.
1:54
Now, let's put this in exponential form.
1:57
Well, its magnitude is pretty straightforward.
2:00
The magnitude of z is just the length of this vector,
2:03
or it's the absolute value of 1.
2:06
That's just going to be 1.
2:09
Now, what's the argument of z?
2:14
What's the angle that this vector
2:15
makes with the positive real axis?
2:19
Well, it's on the positive real axis.
2:20
It's a real number.
2:22
So it has no angle.
2:23
So the arg of z is 0.
2:26
So that might not be too interesting so far.
2:30
We just figured out that 1 is equal to 1 times e to the 0i.
2:40
And this is kind of obvious.
2:41
e to the 0-- this is just going to be 0.
2:44
0 times i is 0.
2:45
e to the 0 is going to be 1, times 1 is equal to 1.
2:47
Not a big deal there.
2:49
But what is neat is that this argument-- you could view it
2:52
as 0 radians, or you could go all the way around
2:55
and add 2 pi to it and get to the same point.
3:02
So the argument of our complex number-- or of the number 1,
3:07
really-- could also be an angle of 2 pi, or an angle of 4 pi,
3:12
or an angle of 6 pi, or an angle of 8 pi.
3:15
So we can write 1 as 1 times e-- I
3:20
won't write the 1 anymore-- 1 times
3:22
e to the 2 pi i, or 1 times e to the 4 pi i.
3:31
And the reason why this is interesting
3:32
is then this equation right here can
3:35
be written in multiple ways.
3:36
It can be written as x to the third is equal to 1.
3:42
It could be written as x to the third
3:44
is equal to e to the 2 pi i.
3:49
Or it could be written as x to the third
3:52
is equal to e to the 4 pi i.
3:57
And this is interesting, and we're
3:59
going to see this in a second.
4:00
Let's take both sides of all these equations
4:02
to the one-third power to solve for x.
4:04
So to the one-third.
4:06
We're going to take that to the one-third.
4:08
We're going to do that same thing over here.
4:10
We're just taking everything to the one-third power
4:12
to solve for the x's in each of these equations.
4:16
To the one-third power.
4:18
So this first equation over here becomes x is equal to 1
4:21
to the one-third power, which is just equal to 1.
4:25
Now, what's the second equation become?
4:27
This second equation-- x is equal to e to the-- well,
4:31
this is going to be the 2 pi over 3, i power.
4:41
And then this equation over here is
4:43
going to be-- so x is going to be equal to-- obviously,
4:46
the 3 to the one-third, that just becomes x to the 1.
4:50
Let me do that same blue.
4:52
x over here is going to be equal to e to the 4 pi over 3, i.
5:03
So let's think about this for a little bit.
5:06
What is this?
5:08
So immediately, what's the argument here?
5:11
So these are three different roots.
5:14
Let me call this x1, x2, and x3.
5:18
So these are three different numbers.
5:20
One of the roots is 1.
5:22
That's pretty clear over here.
5:23
1 is one of the cube roots of itself.
5:26
But these are other numbers.
5:28
And these are going to be complex numbers.
5:30
So let's visualize these numbers a little bit.
5:33
So what is the argument?
5:39
The magnitude of x2 is still clearly 1.
5:41
It's the coefficient out in front of the e.
5:44
It's clearly 1.
5:46
Let me do that same color.
5:48
The magnitude of x3 is also clearly going to be 1.
5:52
But what is the argument of x2?
5:55
What is phi?
5:57
What is the argument?
5:59
Well, it's 2 pi over 3.
6:02
So how would we draw x2?
6:06
So the angle is 2 pi over 3.
6:09
It's easier for me to visualize in degrees.
6:11
So 2 pi is 360 degrees.
6:14
360 degrees divided by 3 is 120 degrees.
6:18
So this is going to be-- 120 degrees
6:20
is 60 short of-- so it's going to look like this.
6:29
So this angle right here, its argument
6:31
is going to be 120 degrees, which
6:34
is the same thing as 2 pi over 3.
6:38
And it's going to have the exact same length.
6:40
So let me do it in the same color.
6:41
So this is x1.
6:43
So that is this green color right over here.
6:46
x2 is this magenta one right over here.
6:50
And they all have the same magnitude.
6:51
So we really just rotate it.
6:53
We rotate it 120 degrees.
6:54
And what about x3?
6:55
What's its argument?
6:57
What's x3's argument?
7:00
Its argument is 4 pi over 3.
7:04
That's the same thing as 720 degrees over 3,
7:09
if we were to put it into degrees.
7:11
And so 3 goes into 720-- what is it?
7:16
240?
7:18
720.
7:19
240.
7:22
Right.
7:22
I should have known that.
7:24
So 240 degrees-- we're going to go 180 degrees,
7:27
and then go another 60 degrees.
7:29
So it's going to be right over here.
7:35
So let me draw it like this.
7:36
It's going to be right over here.
7:41
That angle right over there is 4 pi
7:44
over 3 radians, which is equal to 240 degrees.
7:52
And once again, it has the same magnitude.
7:55
So what we just saw is when I take the cube
7:57
roots of this real number, I'm essentially
8:00
taking the entire-- I guess we could
8:02
call it the entire circle or the entire 360
8:05
degrees or the entire 2 pi radians--
8:07
and I'm dividing it into three, essentially.
8:12
This is one third.
8:13
Then we have another 120 degrees.
8:15
And then we have another 120 degrees.
8:17
And so you see the pattern of where all of the roots are.
8:20
And in case you're still not satisfied,
8:21
you're just like, well, you said you would find complex roots.
8:24
Yeah, I'm not used to this or this
8:27
as actually being complex numbers.
8:30
I actually want it to be in the form a plus bi-- we can easily
8:34
figure it out from this right over here.
8:36
So x2-- it's going to be equal to the cosine of 2 pi over 3
8:47
plus i times the sine of 2 pi over 3.
8:55
And if you look at this over here,
8:57
we can figure out what those things are going to be.
8:59
This is the angle right over here.
9:01
If this angle right over here is 60 degrees-- which
9:04
it is, because this up here is 30
9:05
degrees-- the hypotenuse, or the length, is 1, then
9:09
this over here is square root of 3 over 2.
9:12
And then this distance right over here is negative 1/2.
9:16
So x2 is going to be equal to-- cosine of 2 pi over 3
9:23
is-- negative 1/2.
9:26
Did I do that right?
9:27
Yep, negative 1/2, plus i times sine of 2 pi over 3.
9:32
That's this height over here, which
9:33
is square root of 3 over 2, i.
9:37
So that's x2.
9:38
And we could do the exact same thing with x3.
9:42
x3 is going to be equal to its x value.
9:45
Or I should say its real value is
9:47
going to be the exact same thing.
9:48
It's going to be negative 1/2.
9:51
And then, its imaginary value, so this angle right
9:56
over here-- this just from the negative real axis down
10:00
to the vector-- is going to be negative 60 degrees.
10:03
So this height right over here is
10:05
going to be negative square root of 3 over 2.
10:08
So it's negative 1/2 minus the square root of 3 over 2, i.
10:13
So using this technique, we were able to find
10:17
the three complex roots of 1.
10:20
This is one of them.
10:22
This is another one.
10:24
And of course, 1 is one of them as well.
10:27
Where did we do that?
10:27
1 is one of them as well.
10:29
And you could use this exact same technique
10:31
if we were finding the fourth roots.
10:32
We would take the 2 pi radians, or the 360 degrees,
10:36
and divide it into 4.
10:37
And so it would actually be this.
10:38
It would be i.
10:40
It would be negative 1.
10:41
And it would be negative i.
10:42
And we know if you take i to the fourth, you get 1.
10:44
If you take negative i to the fourth, you get 1.
10:48
And if you take negative 1 to the fourth, you get 1.
10:50
And if you take 1 to the fourth, you get 1.
10:52
And so you can find the eighth roots of 1
10:54
using this technique.
10:56
Now, the other question that might be popping in your brain
10:59
is, why did I stop at e to the 4 pi i?
11:03
Why didn't I go on and say, well,
11:05
this is equal to e to the 6 pi i and look for another root?
11:08
And so if I did that, if I said x to the third-- let's say
11:11
I wanted to find a fourth root here, maybe.
11:13
x to the third is equal to e to the 6 pi i.
11:18
And I take both sides of this equation
11:20
to the one-third power.
11:22
Taking this to the one third, I would get e to the 2 pi i.
11:28
Well, what's e to the 2 pi i? e to the 2 pi
11:30
i would just get us back to 1.
11:32
So when I added 2 pi again, it just gets us back to this root
11:35
again.
11:36
If I took e to the 6 pi, if I took e to the 8 pi,
11:39
I would get this root again.
11:40
So you're going to get only three roots if you're
11:46
finding the third roots of something.
11:49

0:00
Let's draw ourselves a triangle.
0:03
Let's say this side has length 6.
0:06
Let's say this side right over here has length 10.
0:11
And let's say that this side right over here has length x.
0:15
And what I'm going to think about is how large
0:18
or how small that value x can be.
0:21
How large or small can this side be?
0:24
So the first question is how small can it get?
0:29
Well, if we want to make this small,
0:30
we would just literally have to look
0:32
at this angle right over here.
0:34
So let me take a look at this angle and make it smaller.
0:37
So let's try to make that angle as small as possible.
0:40
So we have our 10 side.
0:43
Actually let me do it down here.
0:46
So you have your 10 side, the side of length 10,
0:51
and I'm going to make this angle really, really, really small,
0:53
approaching 0.
0:55
If that angle becomes 0, we end up with a degenerate triangle.
0:59
It essentially becomes one dimension.
1:01
We lose our two-dimensionality there.
1:03
But as we approach 0, this side starts
1:06
to coincide or get closer and closer to the 10 side.
1:09
And you could imagine the case where it actually
1:11
coincides with it and you actually get the degenerate.
1:14
So if want this point right over here
1:16
to get as close as possible to that point over there,
1:19
essentially minimizing your distance x,
1:21
the closest way is if you make the angle the way
1:23
equal to 0, all the way.
1:26
So let's actually-- let me draw a progression.
1:28
So now the angle is getting smaller.
1:32
This is length 6.
1:34
x is getting smaller.
1:37
Then we keep making that angle smaller and smaller and smaller
1:39
all the way until we get a degenerate triangle.
1:42
So let me draw that pink side.
1:45
So you have the side of length 10.
1:48
Now the angle is essentially 0, this angle that we care about.
1:51
So this side is length 6.
1:56
And so what is the distance between this point
1:58
and this point?
1:59
And that distance is length x.
2:01
So in the degenerate case, this length right over here is x.
2:06
We know that 6 plus x is going to be equal to 10.
2:09
So in this degenerate case, x is going to be equal to 4.
2:14
So if you want this to be a real triangle, at x equals 4
2:18
you've got these points as close as possible.
2:20
It's degenerated into a line, into a line segment.
2:22
If you want this to be a triangle,
2:24
x has to be greater than 4.
2:28
Now let's think about it the other way.
2:30
How large can x be?
2:32
Well to think about larger and larger x's, we
2:34
need to make this angle bigger.
2:37
So let's try to do that.
2:39
So let's draw my 10 side again.
2:42
So this is my 10 side.
2:46
I'm going to make that angle bigger and bigger.
2:48
So now let me take my 6 side and put it like that.
2:52
And so now our angle is getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
2:55
It's approaching 180 degrees.
2:58
At 180 degrees, our triangle once again
3:01
will be turned into a line segment.
3:03
It'll become a degenerate triangle.
3:04
So let me draw the side of length x,
3:06
try to draw it straight.
3:08
So we're trying to maximize the distance
3:09
between that point and that point.
3:11
So this is side of length x and let's
3:13
go all the way to the degenerate case.
3:15
In the degenerate case, at 180 degrees, the side of length 6
3:20
forms a straight line with the side of length 10.
3:24
And this is how you can get this point and that point
3:26
as far apart as possible.
3:29
Well, in this situation, what is the distance
3:30
between that point and that point, which
3:32
is the distance which is going to be our x?
3:36
Well in this situation, x is going to be 6 plus 10 is 16.
3:40
If x is 16, we have a degenerate triangle.
3:42
If we don't want a degenerate triangle,
3:44
if we want to have two dimensions to the triangle,
3:46
then x is going to have to be less than 16.
3:51
Now the whole principle that we're working on right over
3:54
here is called the triangle inequality theorem
3:58
and it's a pretty basic idea.
4:00
That any one side of a triangle has to be less,
4:02
if you don't want a degenerate triangle,
4:04
than the sum of the other two sides.
4:07
So length of a side has to be less
4:14
than the sum of the lengths of other two sides.
4:23
If you're willing to deal with degenerate triangles--
4:26
where you essentially form a line segment,
4:27
you lose all your dimensionality,
4:29
you turn to a one-dimensional figure--
4:30
then you could say less than or equal,
4:33
but we're just going to stick to non-degenerate triangles.
4:36
So the length of a side has to be less
4:38
than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.
4:40
And just using this principle, we
4:42
could have come up with the same exact conclusion.
4:45
You could say, well look, x is one of the sides.
4:48
It has to be less than the sum of the lengths of the other two
4:51
sides.
4:51
So it has to be less than 6 plus 10,
4:58
or x has to be less than 16-- the exact same result
5:04
we got by visualizing it like this.
5:07
You want to say how large can x be?
5:09
Well you could say, well, 10 has to be less than-- Or
5:16
how small can x be?
5:18
You have to say 10 has to be less than 6
5:23
plus x, the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.
5:26
If you subtract 6 from both sides right over here,
5:29
you get 4 is less than x, or x is greater than 4.
5:37
So this is a, in some level, it's a kind of a basic idea,
5:40
but it's something that you'll see definitely in geometry.
5:43
And then you'll go far into other types of mathematics
5:46
and you'll see other versions of what's essentially

You can ride your bike 1/5 of a mile per minute.

If it takes you 3 and 1/3 minutes
0:07
to get to your friend's house, how many miles
0:09
away does your friend live?
0:12
And this here is pictures of these guys on bicycles.
0:14
It's pretty clear they're not riding to work,
0:16
or some of these guys aren't even riding a bicycle.
0:18
But let's focus on the question.
0:20
So you can ride your bike 1/5 of a mile per minute.
0:24
And you're going to do this for 3 and 1/3
0:26
minutes-- times 3 and 1/3.
0:29
So we really have to figure out, how
0:31
do we multiply 1/5 times 3 and 1/3?
0:36
So there's a couple of ways to think about it.
0:38
You could literally view a 3 and 1/3 as this is the same thing
0:42
as 1/5 times 3 plus 1/3.
0:49
That's exactly what 3 and 1/3 is.
0:52
And then we can just apply the distributive property.
0:55
This would be 1/5 times 3-- I'm going
1:00
to keep the colors the same-- plus 1/5 times 1/3.
1:11
And this is going to be equal to-- well,
1:13
we could rewrite 1/5 times 3 as 1/5 times 3/1.
1:20
That's what 3 really is if we wrote it as a fraction.
1:23
And then, of course, we're going to have plus 1/5 times 1/3.
1:31
And let's just think about what each of these evaluate to.
1:34
Here you multiplied the numerators,
1:35
and you multiplied the denominators.
1:37
So this is going to be equal to 1 times 3 over 5 times 1.
1:42
And this business right over here
1:44
is going to be-- and remember, order of operations.
1:46
We want to do our multiplication first.
1:49
So this is going to be 1 times 1 over 5 times 3.
1:56
And so that's going to be equal to 3/5 plus 1/15.
2:05
And now we have different denominators here.
2:07
But lucky for us, 3/5, if we multiplied
2:09
the numerator and the denominator by 3,
2:12
we're going to get a denominator of 15.
2:14
And so that's equal to 9/15 plus 1/15, which equals 10/15.
2:22
And if you divide the numerator and the denominator both by 5,
2:25
you're going to get 2/3.
2:27
So your friend lives 2/3 miles away from your house.
2:30
Well, that's kind of interesting.
2:32
And this was kind of a long way to do it.
2:34
Let's think about if there's a simpler way to do it.
2:37
So this is the same thing as 1/5 times--
2:40
and I'm just going to write 3 and 1/3 as a mixed number.
2:44
So it's 1/5 times 3 and 1/3 can be rewritten as 9/3-- sorry,
2:50
I'm going to rewrite 3 and 1/3 as an improper fraction.
2:53
So this is the same thing as 9/3--
2:55
that's 3-- plus 1/3, which is the same thing as 1/5-- well, I
3:01
switched colors arbitrarily-- which
3:03
is the same thing-- I'm still on the same color-- as 1/5
3:09
times 9/3 plus 1/3 is 10/3.
3:16
And now we can just multiply the numerator
3:17
and multiply the denominator-- or multiply the numerators.
3:21
So this is 1 times 10-- I'm trying
3:26
to stay good with the color coding-- over 5 times
3:30
3, which is exactly equal to what we just got.
3:37
1 times 10 is equal to 10.
3:40
5 times 3 is 15.

through 9 and I ran out of time, and actually, it was a
0:06
good thing because 1 through 9 are kind of the core
0:09
multiplication tables.
0:11
And you'll see that if you know all your multiplication tables
0:13
from 1 to 9, so you know any number between 1 and 9 times
0:16
any other number between 1 and 9, you can actually do
0:19
any multiplication problem out there.
0:21
But what I want to do now is I want to complete the
0:23
multiplication tables for 10, 11, and 12.
0:29
So what is 10 times-- let's just start with 0.
0:33
10 times 0.
0:35
Anything times 0 is 0.
0:39
Ten 0's are 0.
0:40
0 plus 0 plus 0 ten times is still 0.
0:43
What's 10 times 1?
0:48
Well that's just 10 one time.
0:49
Or 1 plus itself ten times.
0:52
That's 10.
0:53
I think this is second nature to you at this point.
0:56
What's 10 times 2?
0:59
I meant to switch colors, but I didn't.
1:02
10 times 2?
1:04
That's 10 plus 10, which is 20.
1:08
Fair enough.
1:09
And notice, we went up by 10 the first time.
1:12
We went up by 10 again to get to 20.
1:15
What's 10 times 3?
1:17
Well, that's 10 plus 10 plus 10, or we could view it as 10
1:21
times 2 plus another 10, which is equal to 30.
1:26
What's 10 times 4?
1:27
I think you start to see a pattern.
1:28
10 times 4 is equal to 40.
1:32
Notice, 10 times 4 is equal to 40.
1:37
If I were to tell you what is 10 times-- let me
1:42
do another color-- 5?
1:44
Well that's equal to 50.
1:50
10 times anything is that anything with a 0 behind it.

So the 10 times tables you almost don't
1:58
have to remember it.

This is almost ridiculous.
2:14
10 times 8 is 80.
2:16
10 times 9?
2:19
90.
2:20
10 times 10?
2:21
Now this is interesting.
2:25
So it'll be a 10-- let's see me write this.
2:28
Let me do it in this orange color.
2:32
10 times 10.
2:33
So it'll be ten 10's or a 10 with a 0 behind it.
2:38
There you go.
2:39
Notice everything-- whatever times 10 I just add a 0 and
2:41
then I get the next number.
2:42
So it's 100.
2:43
And I think you understand why that is.
2:45
I added 10 to itself ten times.
2:47
That each 10-- you go from 10, 20, 30.
2:51
30 is just three 10's or 10 times 3.
2:54
90 is just nine 10's or 9 times 10.
2:58
Let's keep going.
3:00
So 10 times 11 is equal to 11 with a 0 behind it.
3:05
110.
3:06
Finally, 10 times 12 is equal to 120.
3:13
Now, just for fun, these are kind of your 10 times tables.
3:17
But now that t know the pattern you can do anything.
3:20
If I asked you what 5,732 times 10 is, what's it going to be?
3:29
It's going to be this number with just one more 0.
3:32
So it's going to be-- I won't read it out yet.
3:34
5 7 3 2 with a 0 behind it.
3:39
And just so you know, this little comma that I wrote in
3:41
the number there, that's just to make it easier for
3:44
me to read that number.
3:45
And you put the comma-- you start over here and every third
3:48
number you put the comma.
3:49
So here I'm going to put the comma right here.
3:53
I'm going to put the comma right there.
3:54
So now I can read this.
3:56
The comma doesn't really add or take anything away from
3:59
the number, it just helps me read it.
4:01
Now 5,732 times 10 is 57,320.
4:07
i just had to add a 0 there, but that was a pretty
4:10
straightforward multiplication.
4:12
And notice, we had 5,000 times 10 and we got to 50 something
4:16
thousand when we multiplied them.
4:19
So that's similar to 5 times 10 is equal to 50.
4:21
But instead of 5 I had a 5,000, and so I got a 50,000 and
4:26
something and all this other stuff.
4:28
We're going to learn more about how to do problems
4:29
like this in the future.
4:30
But I thought I would introduce you to the idea that just from
4:33
this little pattern of adding a 0 you already know your
4:35
10's times tables.
4:37
Now let's do our 11's.
4:42
Well, they start off easy, and then they get a little more
4:44
difficult as we get into high numbers.
4:47
11 times 0.
4:49
This is easy, this is 0.
4:51
11 times 1.
4:52
This is also easy.
4:54
It's 11.
4:56
11 times 2.
4:57
We're going to start seeing a pattern here.
4:59
It's 11 plus 11 or we could've added 2 to itself eleven times,
5:03
but that is equal to 22.
5:06
If we do 11 times 3 it is equal to 33.
5:11
11 times 4 is equal to 44.
5:15
I think this is becoming obvious to you.
5:16
What's 11 times 5?
5:18
11 times 5 is 55.
5:20
Notice I put the 5 twice.
5:23
What's 11 times 6?
5:24
It's 66.
5:27
11 times 7 is 84-- no.
5:30
I'm kidding.
5:32
I didn't want to mess with you like that.
5:33
But no.
5:34
Of course, it's 77.
5:37
You just repeat the number twice.
5:41
Let me switch colors.
5:42
11 times 8 is equal to 88.
5:46
11 times 9 is equal to 99.
5:50
Now what's 11 times 12?
5:54
Oh sorry, I skipped 10.
5:56
11 times 10.
5:58
You might want to say it's 1,010.
6:00
No.
6:00
That's wrong.
6:01
It's not 1,010.
6:05
So that little pattern that we had where you just repeat the
6:07
number, that only worked for one-digit numbers.
6:10
So it only worked for 1 through 9.
6:11
11 times 10?
6:12
Well, we could think about it a couple of ways.
6:14
We can add 11 to 99.
6:16
So we can say it's 99 plus 11.
6:20
And what's that?
6:21
That's equal to 110.
6:23
And I'm going to show you how to do-- well, hopefully you've
6:25
already watched the video on how to add two-digit numbers
6:28
like this, but that's 110.
6:30
Or you could just use the property from the 10's times
6:32
tables that we learned where if you just take 11 times 10 you
6:36
add a 0 to the 11, you get 110.
6:37
That's the 11 right there.
6:39
Finally, let's do 11 times 12.
6:44
No easy way to remember this, you just kind of
6:46
should remember it.
6:47
Or you could say look, it's going to be 11 more
6:49
than 11 times-- sorry.
6:51
I keep skipping things.
6:53
We should do 11 times 11 first.
6:55
Let me make sure this is clear.
6:56
We're doing 11 times 11 before we go to 11 times 12.
7:00
So 11 times 11 is going to be 11 more than 11 times 10.
7:05
So we add 11 to this.
7:07
11 plus 110 is 121.
7:13
And actually, as you'll see, there actually is an order as
7:15
we get to higher multiples of 11, but I'll leave that
7:18
to a future video.
7:20
And then finally, we're at 11 times 12.
7:26
And we could add 11 to itself twelve times.
7:28
We could add 12 to itself eleven times.
7:30
Or we could just say, hey, is going to be 11 more
7:35
than 11 times 11.
7:37
So that is what?
7:38
You add 11 to this.
7:40
What do you get?
7:41
You get 132.
7:46
I just added 121 plus 11 and then got 132.
7:51
Now the other way you could have said it is, well,
7:52
what's 10 times 12?
7:54
We already knew that.
7:56
That was 120.
7:58
So 11 times 12 because we're multiplying 12 by one more
8:02
should be 12 more than that.
8:04
So that should be 132.
8:06
So two ways to get the exact same answer.
8:10
All right, now let's do our 12 times tables.
8:15
And once you know this you are ready to tackle any type
8:18
of multiplication problem.
8:19
But we'll do that in future videos.
8:21
So 12 times 0.
8:24
Super easy.
8:24
0.
8:25
12 times 1.
8:26
Also super easy.
8:27
Is 12.
8:28
Now it gets interesting.
8:29
We're going to increase by 12 every time.
8:33
12 times 2 is equal to 24.
8:37
12 plus 12 is 24.
8:39
12 times-- not 22.
8:43
Let me rewrite that.
8:44
12 times 3 is going to be 12 plus 12 plus 12.
8:50
Or we could write that as 12 times 2.
8:53
I see my brain is doing the wrong things.
8:56
We could rewrite that as 12 times 2 plus 12.
9:00
Or we could rewrite that as 24 plus 12.
9:03
Either way, all of these get us to 36.
9:07
And notice, that's just that plus 12.
9:10
12 times 4.
9:12
12 times 4 is equal to 48.
9:17
There's a lot of ways you could think about it.
9:18
You could say 11 times 4 is 44.
9:25
And you go up by one more 4, so you get to 12 times 4.
9:30
Or you could say 12 times 3 is 36 and you can add one
9:33
12 to it to get to 48.
9:36
Either way works and that's because you can multiply
9:39
in either direction.
9:40
Let's keep going.
9:42
12 times 5 is equal to 60.
9:47
10 times 5 is 50, 11 times 5 is 55, so 12 times 5 is 60.
9:55
12 times 6 is equal to what?
9:58
It's going to be 12 more than this.
10:00
It's going to equal 72.
10:02
12 times 7.
10:04
12 more than this again.
10:06
12 more than 72 is 84.
10:09
And I'm serious, I'm probably a lot older than you are and I
10:15
still, in my head to confirm, I go to some 12 times tables that
10:19
I remember as definitely right.
10:20
Like oh, 12 times 5-- and sometimes in my head I say,
10:23
oh, let me add another 12.
10:24
Oh yeah, definitely, my memory was correct.
10:26
12 times 6 is 72.
10:28
All right.
10:29
Then you go to 12 times 8.
10:31
Add 12 to the 12 times 7.
10:34
96.
10:35
12 times 9 .
10:38
Well you add 12 to this, so it's 108.
10:44
And then 12 times 10.
10:46
This is an easy one.
10:48
We just add a 0 to the 12 to get 120.
10:51
Or we could've added 12 to 108.
10:54
Either way.
10:55
12 times 11.
10:58
We just did this.
10:59
You add 12 to this you get to 132.
11:02
And then 12 times 12 is equal to 144.
11:09
And this actually shows up.
11:10
If I had a dozen of a dozen eggs-- a dozen is 12.
11:13
Or if I had, I think a gross is actually 12 dozens.
11:17
So that's 144 eggs.
11:18
You'll actually end up seeing this number a lot.
11:20
More than you would expect in life.
11:22
But anyway, we've now completed all of our
11:25
multiplication tables.
11:27
And I really encourage you to take the time now to
11:29
go and memorize them.
11:30
Make some flash cards.
11:33
Use the little software thing that I wrote on my website.
11:37
You could try that out.
11:38
As of September 2009 it's working.
11:41
I haven't touched it in a while, but I'm actually
11:43
probably going to rebuild it soon.
11:45
So if you're watching this video in the year 2200.
11:48
Well, I would probably not exist anymore.
11:50
But hopefully you'll get a better version of
11:52
the software app.
11:53
But you should practice it.
11:55
You should get your parents to quiz you.
11:56
You should get notes cards.
11:58
You should just be mumbling to yourself as you walk to
12:00
school-- what is 12 times 9?
12:02
What is 11 times 11?
12:03
And you should quiz each other because it'll pay huge rewards
12:07
to you later on in life.
12:08
See you in the next video.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,qihoczo1Ujk,
khan_video_twT-WZChfZ8_5,I was wondering what 3D graphing calculator would you recommend?,MCQ,"•
0:00
I think it's very important to have as many ways as possible
0:04
to view a certain type of problem, so I want to introduce
0:06
you to a different way.
0:07
Some people might have taught this first, but the way I
0:10
taught it in the first integral video is kind of the way that I
0:15
always think about when I do the problems.
0:17
But sometimes, it's more useful to think about it the way I'm
0:19
about to show you, and maybe you won't see the difference,
0:21
or maybe you'll say, oh, Sal, those are just the
0:22
exact same thing.
0:24
Someone actually emailed me and told me that I should make it
0:26
so I can scroll things, and I said, oh, that's not
0:28
too hard to do.
0:28
So I just did that, and I scrolled my drawing.
0:32
But anyway, let's say we have a surface in 3 dimensions.
0:34
It's a function of x and y.
0:36
You give me a coordinate down here, and I'll tell you
0:38
how high the surface is at that point.
0:40
And we want to figure out the volume under that surface.
0:43
So.
0:44
We can very easily figure out the volume of a very small
0:49
column underneath the surface.
0:52
So this whole volume is what we're trying to figure out,
0:55
right, between the dotted lines.
0:57
I think you can see it.
0:59
You have some experience visualizing this right now.
1:01
So let's say that I have a little area here.
1:05
We could call that da.
1:09
Let me see if I can draw this.
1:12
Let's say we have a little area down here, a little
1:15
square in the x-y plane.
1:17
And it's, depending on how you view it, this side of it is dx,
1:23
its length is dx, and the height, you could say,
1:27
on that side, is dy.
1:29
Right?
1:30
Because it's a little small change in y there, and it's a
1:33
little small change in x here.
1:36
And its area, the area of this little square, is
1:40
going to be dx times dy.
1:42
And if we wanted to figure out the volume of the solid between
1:47
this little area and the surface, we could just multiply
1:52
this area times the function.
1:54
Right?
1:55
Because the height at this point is going to be the
1:57
value of the function, roughly, at this point.
1:59
Right?
1:59
This is going to be an approximation, and then we're
2:00
going to take an infinite sum.
2:01
I think you know where this is going.
2:03
But let me do that.
2:04
Let me at least draw the little column that I want to show you.
2:10
So that's one end of it, that's another end of it, that's the
2:16
front end of it, that's the other end of it.
2:21
So we have a little figure that looks something like that.
2:25
A little column, right?
2:28
It intersects the top of the surface.
2:30
And the volume of this column, not too difficult.
2:33
It's going to be this little area down here, which is,
2:38
we could call that da.
2:41
Sometimes written like that. da.
2:43
It's a little area.
2:44
And we're going to multiply that area times the height of
2:47
this column, and that's the function at that point.
2:51
So it's f of x and y.
2:56
And of course, we could have also written it as, this
2:58
da is just dx times dy, or dy times dx.
3:02
I'm going to write it in every different way.
3:04
So we could also have written this as f of
3:08
xy times dx times dy.
3:12
And of course, since multiplication is associative,
3:14
I could have also written it as f of xy times dy dx.
3:21
These are all equivalent, and these all represent the volume
3:24
of this column, that's the between this little area
3:29
here and the surface.
3:31
So now, if we wanted to figure out the volume of the entire
3:35
surface, we have a couple of things we could do.
3:37
We could add up all of the volumes in the x-direction,
3:42
between the lower x-bound and the upper x-bound, and then
3:45
we'd have kind of a thin sheet, although it will already have
3:49
some depth, because we're not adding up just the x's.
3:51
There's also a dy back there.
3:53
So we would have a volume of a figure that would extend from
3:56
the lower x all the way to the upper x, go back dy,
4:03
and come back here.
4:04
If we wanted to sum up all the dx's.
4:07
And if we wanted to do that, which expression would we use?
4:11
Well, we would be summing with respect to x first, so we could
4:15
use this expression, right?
4:19
And actually, we could write it here, but it
4:21
just becomes confusing.
4:21
If we're summing with respect to x, but we have the
4:24
dy written here first.
4:26
It's really not incorrect, but it just becomes a little
4:28
ambiguous, are we summing with respect to x or y.
4:30
But here, we could say, OK.
4:32
If we want to sum up all the dx's first, let's do that.
4:36
We're taking the sum with respect to x, and let me, I'm
4:38
going to write down the actual, normally I just write numbers
4:41
here, but I'm going to say, well, the lower bound here is x
4:44
is equal to a, and the upper bound here is x is equal to b.
4:54
And that'll give us the volume of, you could imagine a
4:57
sheet with depth, right?
4:59
The sheet is going to be parallel to the x-axis, right?
5:03
And then once we have that sheet, in my video, I think
5:07
that's the newspaper people trying to sell me something.
5:10
Anyway.
5:11
So once we have the sheet, I'll try to draw it here, too, I
5:13
don't want to get this picture too muddied up, but once we
5:16
have that sheet, then we can integrate those, we can
5:20
add up the dy's, right?
5:21
Because this width right here is still dy.
5:23
We could add up of all the different dy's, and we
5:25
would have the volume of the whole figure.
5:27
So once we take this sum, then we could take this sum.
5:30
Where y is going from it's bottom, which we said with c,
5:35
from y is equal to c to y's upper bound, to y
5:39
is equal to d.
5:42
Fair enough.
5:42
And then, once we evaluate this whole thing, we have the
5:45
volume of this solid, or the volume under the surface.
5:49
Now we could have gone the other way.
5:51
I know this gets a little bit messy, but I think
5:53
you get what I'm saying.
5:54
Let's start with that little da we had originally.
6:00
Instead of going this way, instead of summing up the dx's
6:04
and getting this sheet, let's sum up the dy's first, right?
6:08
So we could take, we're summing in the y-direction first.
6:12
We would get a sheet that's parallel to the y-axis, now.
6:16
So the top of the sheet would look something like that.
6:21
So if we're coming the dy's first, we would take the sum,
6:25
we would take the integral with respect to y, and it would be,
6:28
the lower bound would be y is equal to c, and the upper
6:33
bound is y is equal to d.
6:36
And then we would have that sheet with a little depth, the
6:39
depth is dx, and then we could take the sum of all of those,
6:44
sorry, my throat is dry.
6:46
I just had a bunch of almonds to get power to be able
6:50
to record these videos.
6:52
But once I have one of these sheets, and if I want to sum up
6:54
all of the x's, then I could take the infinite sum of
6:58
infinitely small columns, or in this view, sheets, infinitely
7:02
small depths, and the lower bound is x is equal to a, and
7:08
the upper bound is x is equal to b.
7:10
And once again, I would have the volume of the figure.
7:12
And all I showed you here is that there's two ways of doing
7:15
the order of integration.
7:17
Now, another way of saying this, if this little original
7:21
square was da, and this is a shorthand that you'll see all
7:24
the time, especially in physics textbooks, is that we
7:27
are integrating along the domain, right?
7:33
Because the x-y plane here is our domain.
7:35
So we're going to do a double integral, a two-dimensional
7:37
integral, we're saying that the domain here is two-dimensional,
7:40
and we're going to take that over f of x and y times da.
7:48
And the reason why I want to show you this, is you see this
7:51
in physics books all the time.
7:53
I don't think it's a great thing to do.
7:55
Because it is a shorthand, and maybe it looks simpler, but for
7:58
me, whenever I see something that I don't know how to
8:00
compute or that's not obvious for me to know how to compute,
8:04
it actually is more confusing.
8:06
So I wanted to just show you that what you see in this
8:09
physics book, when someone writes this, it's the exact
8:12
same thing as this or this.
8:14
The da could either be dx times dy, or it could either be dy
8:18
times dx, and when they do this double integral over domain,
8:21
that's the same thing is just adding up all of these squares.
8:24
Where we do it here, we're very ordered about it, right?
8:26
We go in the x-direction, and then we add all of those up in
8:30
the y-direction, and we get the entire volume.
8:32
Or we could go the other way around.
8:34
When we say that we're just taking the double integral,
8:36
first of all, that tells us we're doing it in two
8:37
dimensions, over a domain, that leaves it a little bit
8:40
ambiguous in terms of how we're going to sum
8:43
up all of the da's.
8:45
And they do it intentionally in physics books, because you
8:47
don't have to do it using Cartesian coordinates,
8:50
using x's and y's.
8:51
You can do it in polar coordinates, you could do it
8:53
a ton of different ways.
8:55
But I just wanted to show you, this is another way to
8:58
having an intuition of the volume under a surface.
9:00
And these are the exact same things as this type of
9:04
notation that you might see in a physics book.
9:07
Sometimes they won't write a domain, sometimes they'd
9:09
write over a surface.
9:11
And we'll later do those integrals.
9:12
Here the surface is easy, it's a flat plane, but sometimes
9:15
it'll end up being a curve or something like that.
9:17

0:00
- [Voiceover] What I wanna do in this video is see
0:01
if we can find the measure of angle D,
0:05
if we could find the measure of angle D
0:07
and like always, pause this video,
0:09
and see if you can figure it out.
0:11
And I'll give you a little bit of a hint.
0:12
It'll involve thinking about how an inscribed angle relates
0:17
to the corresponding to the measure of the arc
0:20
that it intercepts.
0:22
So, think about it like that.
0:24
All right, so, let's work on this a little bit.
0:27
So, what do we know, what do we know?
0:31
Well, angle D, angle D intercepts an arc.
0:35
It intercepts this fairly large arc that I'm going
0:39
to highlight right now in this purple color.
0:42
So, it intercepts that arc.
0:44
We don't know the measure of that arc
0:46
or at least we don't know the measure of that arc yet.
0:48
If we did know the measure of this arc
0:50
that I'm highlighting, then we know that the measure
0:53
of angle D would just be half that because the measure
0:56
of an inscribed angle is half the measure
1:00
of the arc that it intercepts.
1:02
We've seen that multiple times.
1:03
So, if we knew the measure of this arc,
1:05
we would be able to figure out
1:07
what the measure of angle D is.
1:09
But we do know, we don't know the measure of that arc,
1:12
but we do know the measure of another arc.
1:15
We do know the measure of the arc that completes the circle.
1:19
So, we do know the measure of this arc.
1:22
You might be saying, hey wait, how do we know
1:24
that measure, it's not labeled.
1:25
Well, the reason why we know the measure of this arc
1:28
that I've just highlighted in this teal color is
1:31
because the inscribed angle that intercepts it,
1:34
they gave us the information,
1:35
they said this is a 45 degree angle.
1:38
So, this is a 45 degree angle.
1:40
Then this over here is a 90 degree, 90 degree arc.
1:44
The measure of this arc is 90 degrees.
1:48
The measure of arc, I guess you could say
1:50
this is the measure of arc, I'ma write it this way.
1:53
The measure of arc, WL.
1:58
WL is equal to 90 degrees,
2:03
it's twice that, the inscribed angle that intercepts it.
2:07
Now, why is that helpful?
2:09
Well, if you go all the way around the circle,
2:10
you're 360 degrees.
2:12
So, this purple arc that we cared about, that we said hey,
2:16
if we could figure out the measure of that,
2:17
we're gonna be able to figure out the measure of angle D.
2:19
That plus arc, WL,
2:23
they are going to add up to 360 degrees.
2:27
Let me write that down.
2:28
So, the measure of arc, let's see,
2:32
and this is going to be a major arc right over here.
2:36
This is so LIW,
2:39
the measure of arc LIW
2:43
plus the measure of arc WL
2:47
plus the measure
2:50
of arc WL plus this right over here.
2:54
That's going to be equal to 360 degrees.
2:58
This is going to be equal to 360 degrees.
3:02
Now, we already know that this is 90 degrees.
3:05
We already know WL is 90 degrees.
3:08
So, if you subtract 90 degrees from both sides,
3:10
you get that the measure of this large arc right over here,
3:15
measure of arc LIW is going
3:18
to be equal to 270 degrees.
3:21
I just took 300, I went all the way around the circle,
3:23
I subtracted out this 90 degrees
3:25
and I'm left with 270 degrees.
3:28
So, let me write that down.
3:29
This is the measure of this arc in purple is 270 degrees.
3:32
And now, we can figure out the measure of angle D.
3:34
It's an inscribed angle that intercepts that arc
3:37
so it's going to have half the measure,
3:40
the angle's going to have half the measure.
3:42
So, half of 270
3:45
is 135 degrees and we're done,
3:49
and you might notice something interesting,
3:51
that if you add 135 degrees plus 45 degrees,
3:56
that they add up to 180 degrees.
4:00
So, it looks like at least for this case that these angles,
4:03
these opposite angles of this inscribed quadrilateral,
4:07
it looks like they are supplementary.
4:12
So, an interesting question is
4:13
are they always going to be supplementary?
4:15
If you have a quadrilateral, an arbitrary quadrilateral
4:19
inscribed in a circle, so each of the vertices
4:21
of the quadrilateral sit on the circle.
4:24
If you have that, are opposite angles of that quadrilateral,
4:28
are they always supplementary?
4:30
Do they always add up to 180 degrees?
4:32
So, I encourage you to think about that and even prove it
4:35
if you get a chance, and the proof is very close
4:38
to what we just did here.
4:39
In order to prove it, you would just have to do it
4:41
with more general numbers like, you know,
4:42
instead of saying 45 degrees, you could call this X,
4:45
and then you would want to prove that this right over here
4:47
would have to be 180 minus X.
4:50
So, I encourage you to do that on your own
4:51
but I'm gonna do it in a video as well
4:53
so you can check if our reasoning is similar.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Y9cznjBl0Hk,

0:00
- [Voiceover] We've now seen a couple
0:01
of examples of balancing chemical equations.
0:03
And we've seen that, okay, if let's say,
0:05
we're trying to balance this equation right over here
0:08
and we started with the carbons.
0:09
I have two carbons on the reactant side.
0:12
They're both sitting in this ethylene molecule.
0:14
And so I would want two carbons on the product side.
0:17
And right now, I only have one carbon on the product side.
0:20
And so what we've done is let's just put a two
0:23
out front here and so now we have two
0:26
for every molecule of ethylene
0:28
and we're not done balancing this chemical equation yet.
0:30
We're now producing two molecules of carbon dioxide.
0:35
But one thing that you might have been thinking,
0:37
""Why put this big two out front
0:38
""of the entire carbon dioxide,
0:41
""I like the way these little subscript little twos look,
0:43
""so why not put a two right over there. ""
0:48
And the reason why you can't do that
0:50
is that's actually changing the molecule.
0:53
It's no longer carbon dioxide,
0:54
it's now this bizarre thing that
0:56
doesn't really exist in nature.
0:59
Which is a C2O2 thing.
1:02
You're actually changing the reaction
1:03
when you're doing that.
1:04
When you're balancing chemical reactions,
1:06
the reaction itself is,
1:08
even before it's balanced is describing
1:10
something that happens.
1:12
When it's unbalanced, it just doesn't
1:14
have the numbers right in terms
1:17
of number of molecules.
1:18
So the only thing that you can
1:19
change when you're changing these
1:21
is the number of molecules.
1:23
You can't change the number of
1:25
constituents within the molecule.
1:27
And that's why we do not change these subscripts.
1:31
And if you want to visualize it a little bit differently,
1:34
let's draw each of these molecules
1:37
So ethylene looks like this.
1:40
Double bond carbons.
1:42
Then each carbon is bonded to two hydrogens.
1:46
Notice you have two carbons and four hydrogens.
1:50
Molecular oxygen, O2.
1:53
Looks like this.
1:54
It's oxygen doubled bonded to oxygen.
1:56
And then you have carbon dioxide.
2:01
Carbon dioxide is a carbon, double bonded,
2:06
to two oxygens each.
2:09
And then finally, you have water.
2:11
Finally, water, actually I'm going to do
2:14
this in a slightly different color.
2:16
Your water right over here,
2:17
this is an oxygen bonded to two hydrogens.
2:21
So let me write the plus signs there.
2:23
So plus is right over there.
2:26
So if you were to somehow write a subscript
2:30
of two right over there, you would somehow
2:32
be changing the structure, you would be changing
2:35
what this molecule is.
2:38
As opposed to that, which we don't want to do,
2:39
we want to say, we're definitely producing carbon dioxide.
2:42
We're definitely producing carbon dioxide,
2:43
but how many carbon dioxides do we produce
2:45
for each molecule of ethylene?
2:49
And so that's where we say,
2:51
""Okay, we have two carbons here,
2:52
""we want two carbons here.""
2:53
We don't want to change the actual structure here,
2:55
so let's write the two out front.
2:57
So we're going to have two of these.
3:00
Or if you want to do it,
3:01
if you want to have it more visual,
3:03
you could write it,
3:04
okay, we're just going to have another molecule here.
3:06
We're just going to have another molecule.
3:09
So now we've balanced the carbons,
3:11
two carbons on the reactant side.
3:13
Two carbons on the product side.
3:16
And then you go to the hydrogens.
3:18
Say, ""okay, we have four hydrogens here,
3:19
""we only have two here.""
3:21
Well, what if we had two of these water molecules?
3:23
So, let's draw another water molecule here.
3:27
So O H, and actually let me write
3:30
this right over here, so now we have two of these.
3:31
And now we have two of these.
3:36
And now we want to balance the oxygens.
3:38
So let's see, on this side we only have two oxygens.
3:40
On this side we have one, two,
3:41
three, four, five, six oxygens.
3:46
In order to balance it, we're going to
3:46
have six oxygens on the reactant side.
3:49
We need three of these molecules.
3:52
So, another one and another one right over there.
3:57
And now we're all balanced.
3:58
We have two carbon atoms on both sides.
4:00
Carbons, carbons.
4:02
We have four hydrogen atoms on both sides.
4:05
Here they're in the ethylene, here they're in the waters.
4:08
And then we have six oxygen atoms on both sides.
4:12
And here some of the oxygens are in the carbon dioxides,
4:15
some of them are in the waters.
4:17
And here, they're all in the molecular oxygens.
4:20
But notice, we didn't change the
4:22
actual structure of the molecules.
4:25
We just changed the number of molecules we have and
4:27
that's what these coefficients in front of
4:31
these molecular formulas represent.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,HbIdp5DURJA,

0:00
Let's see if we can develop some intuition
0:03
as to why the equilibrium constant equation
0:06
looks the way it does.
0:07
Just as review, this is it: equilibrium constant.
0:11
It would be the concentration of
0:14
our molecule Y raised to its coefficient power or,
0:18
if we're thinking in moles,
0:20
raised to the number of moles.
0:21
If we think of these as kind of the mole ratios,
0:24
or the molar ratios
0:25
-- or we could just view them as the molecular ratios,
0:28
either way --times the concentration of our molecule Z.
0:32
Now, we're not doing some calculus here.
0:34
d is just the number of moles we need of Z
0:38
for every c moles of Y,
0:40
b moles of X,and a moles of V.
0:42
So it's Z to the d power divided by
0:46
the concentration of V to the a power
0:49
and X to the b power.
0:52
So it's a nice, little, clean equation,
0:55
but why does it look this way?
0:56
And I actually made a video earlier today
0:59
where I started exploring this with natural logs.
1:01
And I think I got someplace,
1:03
but that one started to break down.
1:05
And I think I've come up with a much simpler reason
1:07
why this looks this way.
1:08
So I've deleted that video,
1:09
and I think I've come up with a much more intuitive one
1:11
that explains more of why this works
1:14
and actually some of the other things
1:15
we're going to learn about
1:17
the equilibrium constants in future videos.
1:19
So what makes a reaction happen?
1:23
Or what does equilibrium mean?
1:25
It means the rate at which
1:27
the forward reaction is happening.
1:28
So that means that the rate of this happening,
1:34
of V plus X turning into Y plus Z
1:42
-- I can't forget the coefficients--
1:45
is going to be equal to the reverse reaction,
1:50
is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction.
1:53
So our c moles of Y plus d moles of Z
1:57
turning and going the other way,
1:59
into the V and the X with certain ratios.
2:03
It doesn't mean necessarily that
2:06
the concentrations are the same,
2:07
because we could have one
2:09
where we end up heavily favoring the forward reaction.
2:13
Where we end up with
2:14
much higher concentrations of Y and Z,
2:17
or we might heavily favor the backwards reactions
2:19
where we have more V and X.
2:20
But when we're in equilibrium,
2:22
we're saying that our concentrations
2:23
have reached a stability point,
2:25
which implies that the rate of going in this direction
2:27
is equal to the rate going into that direction.
2:29
So let's just think a little bit about
2:31
what drives these rates,
2:33
what drives these rates of reactions.
2:36
In order for this forward reaction to happen
2:39
that I drew in purple,
2:40
what needs to happen?
2:42
We have to have a molecules of V roughly.
2:45
And let's say in any volume of space,
2:47
we have to have some V molecules,
2:50
and preferably a V molecules,
2:54
being in the vicinity of b X molecules.
2:58
So there's got to be b of these X molecules,
3:03
and they have to be in the right configuration
3:05
and in the right place and kind of close enough
3:08
in order for the reaction to happen.
3:10
So the reaction is really going to be driven by,
3:13
if you think about it,
3:14
the probability of finding
3:15
a V molecules and b molecules
3:19
all within close enough confines
3:23
that they can actually react.
3:25
So you could say that the rate
3:27
is going to be driven by
3:31
-- maybe it's going to be proportional.
3:32
Let's say it's just equal to-- let's say some constant
3:34
that takes into account things like temperature
3:37
and how the molecules are actually configured.
3:40
Because it's not dependent just on them being there.
3:42
You have to have worry about their kinetic energies.
3:44
You have to worry about their shape,
3:46
because some shapes are going to be
3:47
more conducive to reaction than others.
3:48
So let's just let that be taken into account with a K.
3:52
And we're talking about the forward reaction, right?
3:55
So in order for the forward reaction to happen,
3:57
let's call that K plus for the forward reaction.
4:00
We have to have
4:02
a molecules of V there and b molecules of X.
4:06
So what's the probability of having a molecules of X?
4:10
Or what's a rough approximation of the probability?
4:12
Well, the concentration.
4:17
Let's think about this a second.
4:20
When we write the concentration of the molecule V,
4:23
which I think when I did this
4:25
was the blue one right here,
4:26
what is that given in?
4:28
That is given in moles per liter.
4:31
Moles is just a number,
4:34
so this tells us, look, in any given volume,
4:36
roughly how many of the molecules
4:38
do you expect to find?
4:39
That's what concentration is.
4:41
So if I wanted to figure out the probability
4:43
of finding a of these molecules,
4:46
because that's how many I need,
4:47
I need to multiply this by itself a times,
4:50
because I need a of them.
4:51
The probability of having just one molecule
4:53
in just some small fraction,
4:57
you would just use the concentration once.
4:59
But you're going to use it a times,
5:00
because you want a of those molecules there, right?
5:03
You could look at it like
5:05
what's the probability of having five heads?
5:07
Well you would multiply the probability of
5:08
one head five times.
5:10
So the forward reaction probability is going to be
5:12
the concentration of V to the a power,
5:15
and, of course,
5:17
that's not enough to have the reaction happen.
5:20
You also need to have b of the X molecules there.
5:26
So you have the concentration of X to the b power.
5:31
And I want to make sure you understand this.
5:33
My claim is that this is approximation
5:40
-- or actually it's a pretty good way
5:41
of calculating-- the probability.
5:44
So let me write it this way.
5:47
The rate is equal to some constant
5:50
that takes into account the temperature
5:52
and the molecular configurations
5:53
times the probability of having
5:55
a V molecules and b X molecules
6:07
in a sufficiently small area all at the same time.
6:11
And the best way to approximate
6:13
that is with their concentration.
6:15
Obviously, the higher the concentration,
6:16
the higher the moles per liter,
6:18
the more likely you're going
6:19
to find that many of molecules
6:21
in kind of that little small space that you care about,
6:25
and the temperature and the configuration
6:26
are going to matter more.
6:27
But if you use the concentration
6:30
as the probability of a
6:32
-- let me switch colors.
6:36
If the probability of
6:37
having a V molecule in some volume
6:45
-- if we assume that the solution is homogeneous,
6:52
that the V molecules are roughly evenly distributed,
6:54
it's going to be
6:56
-- this isn't even an approximation.
6:57
It's going to be the concentration of the V molecules
7:01
times the volume under which we care about.
7:06
If we want the probability of a,
7:11
where a is a number,
7:13
it could be five V molecules,
7:14
a V's in some volume,
7:22
it's the probability of finding this a times.
7:27
So it's going to be equal to
7:29
-- and this is just from the probability concepts
7:33
that we learned in the whole probability playlist.
7:36
So if you want to have five heads in a row,
7:38
it's 1/2 to the fifth power.
7:40
If you want to have V molecules there,
7:42
five of them at the same time in some volume,
7:46
or a of them,
7:48
it's going to be V to the a power
7:50
times the volume.
7:51
If you also care about the probability
7:57
so you want all of that,
7:58
so a V's and b X's in some volume,
8:04
then you're going to have to multiply all of them together.
8:08
So it's going to be equal to
8:10
the concentration of V to the a power
8:13
times the concentration of X to the b power
8:16
times the volume.
8:17
So the probability of
8:19
finding the right number of V particles
8:23
and X particles in the right place in some volume
8:26
is going to be proportional to exactly this.
8:28
And we're saying that the reaction rate,
8:32
the forward reaction rate,
8:33
is also proportional to this thing.
8:35
So that's where we get the forward reaction rate.
8:39
So the rate forward is equal to
8:43
the concentration of our V molecules to the a power
8:46
times the concentration
8:47
of our X molecules to the b power.
8:49
Now, if we want to find the reverse rate,
8:52
so this is the rate forward.
8:54
If we want to find the rate of the reverse reaction,
9:02
let's say that that's equal to some other constant
9:05
-- let's call that K-minus--
9:06
the same exact logic holds.
9:10
We're just going in this direction now.
9:12
If we look at our original one,
9:14
we're going in that direction.
9:15
So for this reaction, we do the same thing.
9:17
We literally just do different letters,
9:18
so the reverse reaction is just going to be
9:20
the concentration of the Y molecule to the c power,
9:27
because we need c of them there
9:29
roughly at the same time,
9:30
times the concentration of the Z molecule
9:33
to the d power.
9:35
Now, just at the beginning of the video,
9:38
we said that
9:39
equilibrium is when these rates equal each other.
9:42
I wrote it down right here.
9:43
So if the reverse rate
9:45
is equal to some constant times this,
9:47
and the forward rate
9:48
is equal to some constant times that,
9:50
then we reach equilibrium
9:51
when these two are equal to each other.
9:53
Let me clear up somespace here.
9:54
Let me clear this up, too.
9:59
So when are they going to be equal to each other?
10:02
When the forward rate
10:03
-- the forward rate is this.
10:05
That's our forward constant,
10:07
which took into account a whole bunch of
10:08
temperature and molecular structure and all of that--
10:12
times the concentration
10:13
of our V molecule to the a power.
10:16
You can kind of view that as
10:17
what's the probability of finding in a certain volume
10:19
-- and that certain volume
10:21
can be factored into that K factor as well--
10:23
but what's the probability of finding V things,
10:25
a V molecules in some volume.
10:30
And it's the concentration of V to the a power
10:32
times concentration of X to the b power
10:36
-- that's the forward reaction--
10:37
and that has to equal the reverse reactions.
10:39
So K-minus times the concentration of Y to the c power
10:45
times the concentration of Z to the d power.
10:49
Now, if we divide both sides by
10:52
-- let me erase more space.
10:54
Nope, not with that.
10:57
All right.
11:00
So let's divide both sides by K-minus
11:03
and both sides by this,
11:04
so you get K-plus over K-minus is equal to that,
11:14
is equal to Y to the c
11:17
times Z to the d.
11:20
All of that over that--
11:22
V to the a
11:26
times the concentration of X to the b.
11:30
Let me put this in magenta just so
11:31
you know that this was this K-minus right here.
11:34
And then, these are just two arbitrary constants,
11:37
so we could just replace them
11:39
and call them the equilibrium constant.
11:41
And we're there where we need to be.
11:43
We're at the formula for the equilibrium constant.
11:48
Now, I know this was really hand wavy,
11:49
but I want you to at least get the sense that
11:51
this doesn't come from out of the blue,
11:53
and there is -- at least I think there is--
11:55
there's an intuition here.
11:56
These are really calculating
11:57
the probabilities of finding
11:59
-- this is the forward reaction rate probabilities
12:04
proportional to this.
12:05
Because the more V concentration you have,
12:08
the more likely you're able to find it.
12:10
Although if you need more of those particles around,
12:14
you're going to have to multiply that
12:15
concentration by each other,
12:17
because the probability's going to get lower.
12:19
Because you need more of them together
12:20
in order for the reaction to happen.
12:22
Same thing for everything there.
12:23
But all this is derived from is
12:25
that the forward reaction should be equal to
12:28
some constant times the reverse reaction.
12:31
Or actually, their rates should be equal,
12:33
but then when you actually calculate the probability,
12:35
you'll have a constant in there.
12:36
Anyway, hopefully, I didn't confuse you,
12:38
but I just wanted to give you that
12:39
this isn't just some random equation.
12:41
It really does, I think,
12:43
come from the reality that
12:45
the higher the concentration you have,
12:47
the more the probability you have
12:48
of the actual molecules bumping into each other.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,ONBJo7dXJm8,

0:00
Which of the features are shared by f of x and g of x?
0:04
Select all that apply.
0:06
So they give us f of x as being defined
0:07
as x to the third minus x.
0:09
And they define g of x, essentially, with this graph.
0:12
So what are our options?
0:14
So the first one is that they are both odd.
0:17
So just by looking at g of x, you
0:19
can tell that it is not odd.
0:20
The biggest giveaway is that an odd function
0:23
would go through the origin.
0:26
G of zero would have to be equal to zero.
0:29
If you want to go straight to the definition
0:31
of an odd function, g of x would have
0:34
to be equal to the negative of g of negative x.
0:38
So for example, g of 3 looks like it is 4.
0:43
g of 3 is equal to 4.
0:49
In order for it to be odd, g of negative 3
0:52
would have to be equal to negative 4.
0:55
But we see that g of negative 3 is not equal to negative 4.
0:59
So this one is definitely not odd.
1:01
So this statement can't be true.
1:02
They both can't be odd.
1:03
So that's not right.
1:05
They share an x-intercept.
1:08
So g of x only has one x-intercept.
1:10
It intersects the x-axis right over here
1:12
at x equals negative 3.
1:14
Now let's think about the x-intercepts of f of x.
1:17
And to do that, we just need to factor this expression,
1:20
f of x is equal to x to the third minus x, which
1:23
is the same thing if we factor an x
1:25
out of x times x squared minus 1.
1:29
X squared minus 1 is the difference of squares.
1:31
So we could rewrite that as-- so we'll write our x first,
1:34
this x.
1:35
And then x squared minus 1 is x plus 1 times x minus 1.
1:40
So when does f of x equal 0?
1:42
Well, f of x is equal to 0 when x is equal to 0.
1:46
When x is equal to 0, that would make this entire expression 0.
1:50
When x is equal to negative 1, that
1:52
would make this term, and thus the entire expression, 0.
1:56
And when x is equal to positive 1,
1:59
that would make this last part zero,
2:01
which would make this entire product 0.
2:03
So here are the zeroes of f of x, and none
2:06
of these coincide with the zeroes of g of x.
2:08
So they don't share an x-intercept.
2:12
They have the same end behavior.
2:16
Now this is interesting.
2:17
This is saying what's happening as x gets really,
2:21
really, really, really large, or as x gets really, really,
2:25
really, really, really small.
2:27
So we could just think about it right over here.
2:29
As x gets really, really, really, really, really large,
2:32
this x to the third is going to grow much faster
2:36
than this x term right over here.
2:39
So as x grows really, really, really, really large, f of x
2:41
is going to grow really, really, really large.
2:43
So the graph-- and I don't know exactly,
2:46
to see if I could plot a couple of other points--
2:48
but the bottom line is f of x is going to approach infinity
2:51
as x approaches infinity, or f of x approaches
2:56
infinity as x approaches infinity,
3:00
or as x gets larger and larger and larger.
3:02
And then what happens as x gets smaller
3:04
and smaller and smaller?
3:05
If we have really small values of x--
3:08
so really negative values of x, I should say-- once again,
3:11
this, right over here, is going to dominate.
3:14
So f of x is going to become really negative.
3:16
So f of x is going to approach negative infinity,
3:20
as x approaches negative infinity.
3:23
And that is the same behavior of g of x.
3:26
As x approaches a really large value, g of x
3:30
approaches a really large value, maybe not as fast as f of x,
3:33
but it still approaches it.
3:34
And likewise, as x decreases, so does g of x decrease.
3:38
It doesn't decrease as fast as f of x might,
3:41
but it's still going to decrease.
3:42
So they do seem to have the same end behavior, at least based
3:46
on the way that we thought about it just now.
3:48
Now the last option is they have a relative maximum
3:52
at the same x value.
3:56
So we have to think about what the maximum points are.
3:59
Well, actually, we already know that this is not true,
4:02
because g of x has no relative maximum points.
4:04
In order to have a maximum point,
4:06
you would have to do something like this.
4:07
This, right over here, would be a relative maximum,
4:10
or, you could say, a local maximum point.
4:11
It's larger than all of the points around it,
4:13
but eventually the function does surpass it.
4:16
But this, right over here, has no local maxima,
4:20
or relative maxima, or little bumps in it.
4:22
g of x doesn't have any.
4:23
So they can't have relative maximum at the same value.

So this, also, is not an option.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,H1H0xmjZMPA,

0:00
- [Voiceover] So we have here f of x
0:01
being equal to the natural log of the square root of x.
0:06
And what we wanna do in this video
0:07
is find the derivative of f.
0:09
And the key here is to recognize that f can actually
0:14
be viewed as a composition of two functions.
0:17
And we can diagram that out, what's going on here?
0:20
Well if you input an x into our function f,
0:23
what's the first thing that you do?
0:24
Well, you take the square root of it.
0:26
So if we start off with some x, you input it,
0:32
the first thing that you do, you take the square root of it.
0:35
You are going to take the square root of the input
0:39
to produce the square root of x,
0:43
and then what do you do?
0:44
You take the square root and then
0:46
you take the natural log of that.
0:48
So then you take the natural log of that,
0:51
so you could view that as inputting it
0:53
into another function that takes the natural log
0:55
of whatever is inputted in.
0:57
I'm making these little squares to
0:58
show what you do with the input.
1:00
And then what do you produce?
1:02
Well you produce the natural log of the square root of x.
1:06
Natural log of the square root of x.
1:10
Which is equal to f of x.
1:12
So you could view f of x as this entire set,
1:18
or this entire, I guess you could say,
1:20
this combination of functions right over there.
1:23
That is f of x, which is essentially,
1:27
a composition of two functions.
1:29
You're inputting into one function
1:31
then taking that output and inputting it into another.
1:34
So you could have a function u here,
1:36
which takes the square root of whatever its input is,
1:38
so u of x is equal to the square root of x.
1:43
And then you take that output,
1:47
and input it into another function that we could call v,
1:49
and what does v do?
1:51
Well it take the natural log of whatever the input is.
1:53
In this case, in the case of f, or in the case of how
1:57
I just diagrammed it, v is taking the natural log,
2:00
the input happens to be square root of x,
2:02
so it outputs the natural log of the square root of x.
2:05
If we wanted to write v with x as an input,
2:08
we would just say well that's the natural log,
2:10
that is just the natural log of x.
2:14
And as you can see here, f of x,
2:16
and I color-coded ahead of time,
2:17
is equal to, f of x is equal to,
2:22
the natural log of the square root of x.
2:24
So that is v of the square root of x, or v of u of x.
2:31
So it is a composition which tells you that,
2:33
okay, if I'm trying to find the derivative here,
2:36
the chain rule is going to be very, very, very, very useful.
2:39
And the chain rule tells us that f prime of x
2:43
is going to be equal to the derivative of,
2:47
you can view it as the outside function,
2:49
with respect to this inside function,
2:51
so it's going to be v prime of u of x,
2:55
v prime of u of x,
2:58
times the derivative of this inside function
3:01
with respect to x.
3:02
So that's just u prime, u prime of x.
3:06
So how do we evaluate these things?
3:08
Well, we know how to take the derivative of u of x
3:11
and v of x, u prime of x here, is going to be equal to,
3:16
well remember, square root of x is just the same thing
3:19
as x to 1/2 power, so we can use the power rule,
3:22
bring the 1/2 out from so it becomes 1/2 x to the,
3:26
and then take off one out of that exponent,
3:29
so that's 1/2 minus one is negative 1/2 power.
3:32
And what is v of x, sorry, what is v prime of x?
3:38
Well the derivative of the natural log of x
3:40
is one over x, we show that in other videos.
3:45
And so we now know what u prime of x is,
3:48
we know what v prime of x is, but what is v prime of u of x?
3:52
Well v prime of u of x, wherever we see the x,
3:58
we replace it, let me write that a little bit neater,
4:00
we replace that with a u of x, so v prime of u of x
4:05
is going to be equal to,
4:07
is going to be equal to one over u of x,
4:10
one over u of x, which is equal to,
4:15
which is equal to one over,
4:17
u of x is just the square root of x.
4:20
One over the square root of x.
4:24
This thing right over here, we have figured out,
4:29
is one over the square root of x,
4:31
and this thing, u prime of x, we figured out,
4:36
is 1/2 times x to the negative 1/2,
4:39
and x to the negative 1/2, I could rewrite that as 1/2
4:41
times one over x to the 1/2, which is the same thing
4:46
as 1/2 times one over the square root of x,
4:51
or I could write that as one over 2 square roots of x.
4:55
So what is this thing going to be?
4:58
Well this is going to be equal to, in green,
5:02
v prime of u of x is one over the square root of x,
5:07
times, times, u prime of x is one over two times
5:13
the square root of x, now what is this going to be equal to?
5:16
Well, this is going to be equal to,
5:19
this is just algebra at this point,
5:21
one over, we have our two and square root of x
5:24
times square root of x is just x.
5:26
So it just simplifies to one over two x.
5:29
So hopefully this made sense,
5:31
and I intentionally diagrammed it out
5:32
so that you start to get that muscle in your brain going
5:35
of recognizing the composite functions,
5:37
and then making a little bit more sense of
5:39
some of these expressions of the chain rule
5:41
that you might see in your calculus class,
5:43
or in your calculus textbook.
5:44
But as you get more practice, you'll be able to do it,
5:47
essentially, without having to write out all of this.
5:49
You'll say okay, look, I have a composition.
5:51
This is the natural log of the square root of x,
5:55
this is v of u of x.
5:57
So what I wanna do is I wanna take the derivative
6:00
of this outside function with respect
6:02
to this inside function.
6:03
So the derivative of natural log of something,
6:07
with respect to that something, is one over that something.
6:11
So it is one over that something,
6:14
the derivative natural log of something
6:16
with respect to that something is one over that something,
6:19
so that's what we just did here.
6:21
One way to think about it, what would natural log of x be?
6:24
Well that'd be one over x, but it's not natural log of x.
6:27
It's one over square root of x,
6:28
so it's going to be one over the square root of x,
6:31
so you take the derivative of the outside function
6:33
with respect to the inside one,
6:35
and then you multiply that times just the derivative
6:37
of the inside function with respect to x.

0:00
When you get into higher mathematics,
0:02
you might see a professor write something
0:03
like this on a board, where it's just
0:05
this R with this extra backbone right over here.
0:08
And maybe they write R2.
0:10
Or if you're looking at it in a book,
0:12
it might just be a bolded capital
0:14
R with a 2 superscript like this.
0:17
And if you see this, they're referring
0:19
to the two-dimensional real coordinate
0:22
space, which sounds very fancy.
0:30
But one way to think about it, it's
0:31
really just the two-dimensional space
0:33
that you're used to dealing with in your coordinate plane.
0:37
To go a little bit more abstract,
0:39
this isn't necessarily this visual representation.
0:42
This visual representation is one way
0:45
to think about this real coordinate space.
0:47
If we were to think about it a little bit more abstractly,
0:50
the real R2, the two-dimensional real coordinate space--
0:54
let me write this down-- and the two-dimensional real coordinate
1:00
space.
1:01
And just to break down the notation,
1:03
the 2 tells us how many dimensions we're dealing with,
1:05
and then the R tells us this is a real coordinate space.
1:09
The two-dimensional real coordinate space
1:11
is all the possible real-valued 2-tuples.
1:15
Let me write that down.
1:17
This is all possible real-valued 2-tuples.
1:30
So what is a 2-tuple?
1:33
Well, a tuple is an ordered list of numbers.
1:37
And since we're talking about real values,
1:38
it's going to be ordered list of real numbers,
1:41
and a 2-tuple just says it's an ordered list of 2 numbers.
1:44
So this is an ordered list of 2 real-valued numbers.
1:47
Well, that's exactly what we did here
1:49
when we thought about a two-dimensional vector.
1:51
This right over here is a 2-tuple,
1:53
and this is a real-valued 2-tuple.
1:55
Neither of these have any imaginary parts.
1:58
So you have a 3 and a 4.
2:00
Order matters.
2:01
We view this as a different 2-tuple than, say, 4, 3.
2:08
And even if we were trying to represent them in our axes
2:12
right over here, this vector, 4, 3,
2:15
would be 4 along the horizontal axis,
2:18
and then 3 along the vertical axis.
2:22
And so it would look something like this.
2:24
And remember, we don't have to draw it just over there.
2:26
We just care about its magnitude and direction.
2:28
We could draw it right over here.
2:32
This would also be 4, 3, the column vector, 4 3.
2:38
So when we're talking about R2, we're
2:40
talking about all of the possible real-valued 2-tuples.
2:43
So all the possible vectors that you can have,
2:47
where each of its components-- and the components
2:50
are these numbers right over here--
2:52
where each of its components are a real number.
2:56
So you might have 3, 4.
2:57
You could have negative 3, negative 4.
2:59
So that would be 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4,
3:04
might look something like-- actually,
3:06
I should make the scale a little bit bigger,
3:08
so it looks the same-- 1, 2, 3, 4.
3:12
So it might look something like that.
3:16
So that would be the vector, negative 3--
3:18
let me write a little bit better than that-- negative 3,
3:22
and negative 4.
3:24
So if you were to take all of the possible 2-tuples,
3:27
including the vector 0, 0-- so it has no magnitude,
3:30
and you could debate what its direction is right over there--
3:34
you take all of those combined, and then
3:36
you have created your two-dimensional real coordinate
3:39
space.
3:40
And that is referred to as R2.
3:43
Now, as you can imagine, the fact
3:44
that we wrote this 2 here-- we had
3:46
to specify-- it's like, hey, well, could I put a 3 there?
3:48
And I would say, absolutely, you could put a 3 there.
3:51
So R3 would be the three-dimensional real
3:54
coordinate space.
3:56
So 3D real coordinate space.
4:02
And so you would view this as all
4:04
the possible real-valued 3-tuples.
4:13
So, for example, that would be a member of R3.
4:20
And let me actually label these vectors
4:22
just so we get in the habit of it.
4:23
So let's say we call this vector x.
4:26
Let's say we have a vector b, that looks like this.
4:31
Negative 1, 5, 3.
4:34
Both of these would be members of R3.
4:38
And if you want to see some fancy notation, a member
4:41
of a set-- so this is a member of R3--
4:47
it is a real-valued 3-tuple.
4:51
Now you say, well, what would not be a member of R3?
4:53
Well, this right over here isn't a 3-tuple.
4:55
This right over here is a member of R2.
4:57
Now, you might be able to extend it in some way,
4:59
add a zero or something, but formally,
5:01
this is not a 3-tuple.
5:03
Another thing that would not be a member of R3-- let's say
5:06
someone wanted to make some type of vector that
5:11
had some imaginary parts in it.
5:12
So let's say it had i, 0, 1.
5:15
This is no longer real-valued.
5:18
We have put an imaginary-- this number up here
5:22
has an imaginary part.
5:23
So this is no longer a real-valued 3-tuple.
5:28
And what's neat about linear algebra is,
5:30
we don't have to stop there.
5:31
R3 we can visualize, we can plot these things.
5:35
In your previous mathematical career,
5:37
especially if you have some type of a hologram or something,
5:39
it's not hard to visualize things in three dimensions.
5:42
But what's neat is that we can keep extending this.
5:44
We can go into 4, 5, 6, 7, 20, 100 dimensions.
5:48
And obviously there it becomes much harder, if not impossible,
5:51
to visualize it.
5:52
But then we can at least represent it mathematically
5:55
with an n-tuple of vectors.
5:57
And so if we were to talk about a real coordinate space
6:00
generally, you'll often see the notation Rn,
6:04
with n as a superscript.
6:06
So this right over here is an n-dimensional real coordinate

0:00
- [Voiceover] We know that we can find
0:01
the area of a rectangle by multiplying
0:03
the base times the height.
0:05
The area of a rectangle is equal to base times height.
0:08
In another video, we saw that,
0:09
if we're looking at the area of a parallelogram,
0:12
and we also know the length of a base,
0:14
and we know its height, then the area
0:16
is still going to be base times height.
0:18
Now, it's not as obvious when you look
0:19
at the parallelogram, but in that video,
0:21
we did a little manipulation of the area.
0:24
We said, ""Hey, let's take this
0:26
""little section right over here.""
0:28
So we took that little section right over there,
0:31
and then we move it over to the right-hand side,
0:35
and just like that, you see that,
0:37
as long as the base and the height is the same,
0:39
as this rectangle here, I'm able to construct
0:41
the same rectangle by moving that area over,
0:44
and that's why the area of this parallelogram
0:46
is base times height.
0:47
I didn't add or take away area, I just shifted area
0:50
from the left-hand side to the right-hand side
0:53
to show you that the area of that parallelogram
0:55
was the same as this area of the rectangle.
0:58
It's still going to be base times height.
1:01
So hopefully that convinces you
1:03
that the area of a parallelogram is base times height,
1:07
because we're now going to use that
1:09
to get the intuition for the area of a triangle.
1:13
So let's look at some triangles here.
1:16
So that is a triangle,
1:17
and we're given the base and the height,
1:20
and we're gonna try to think about
1:21
what's the area of this triangle going to be,
1:25
and you can imagine it's going to be
1:26
dependent on base and height.
1:28
Well, to think about that,
1:29
let me copy and paste this triangle.
1:33
So let me copy, and then let me paste it,
1:38
and what I'm gonna do is,
1:39
so now I have two of the triangles,
1:41
so this is now going to be twice the area,
1:43
and I'm gonna rotate it around,
1:45
I'm gonna rotate it around like that,
1:52
and then add it to the original area, and you see
1:55
something very interesting is happening.
1:57
I have now constructed a parallelogram.
2:01
I have now constructed a parallelogram
2:03
that has twice the area of our original triangle,
2:06
'cause I have two of our original triangles
2:08
right over here, you saw me do it,
2:09
I copied and pasted it, and then I flipped it over
2:12
and I constructed the parallelogram.
2:15
Now why is this interesting?
2:17
Well, the area of the entire parallelogram,
2:20
the area of the entire parallelogram
2:23
is going to be the length of this base times this height.
2:28
You also have height written
2:29
with the ""h"" upside down over here.
2:31
It's going to be base times height.
2:32
That's going to be for the parallelogram, for the entire--
2:35
let me draw a parallelogram right over here.
2:37
That's going to be the area of the entire parallelogram.
2:40
So what would be the area of our original triangle?
2:43
What would be the area of our original triangle?
2:48
Well, we already saw that this area of the parallelogram,
2:51
it's twice the area of our original triangle.
2:53
So our original triangle is just
2:54
going to have half the area.
2:56
So this area right over here is going to be
2:59
one half the area of the parallelogram.
3:02
One half base-- let me do those same colors.
3:06
One half base times height.
3:10
One half base times height.
3:13
And you might say, ""OK, maybe it worked for this triangle,
3:15
""but I wanna see it work for more triangles.""
3:18
And so, to help you there,
3:19
I've added another triangle right over here,
3:21
you could do this as an obtuse triangle,
3:23
this angle right over here is greater than 90 degrees,
3:26
but I'm gonna do the same trick.
3:27
We have the base, and then we have the height.
3:30
Here, you can think of,
3:30
if you start at this point right over here,
3:33
and if you drop a ball,
3:35
the length that the ball goes, if you had a string here,
3:39
to kind of get to the ground level,
3:40
you could view this as the ground level
3:41
right over there, that that's going to be the height,
3:44
it's not sitting in the triangle like we saw last time,
3:46
but it's still the height of the triangle.
3:49
If this was a building of some kind,
3:51
you'd say, ""Well, this is the height.""
3:52
How far off the ground is it?
3:53
Well, what's the area of this going to be?
3:55
Well, you can imagine,
3:56
it's going to be one half base times height.
3:58
How do we feel good about that?
4:00
Well, let's do the same magic here.
4:05
So let me copy and paste this,
4:09
so I'm gonna copy and then paste it.
4:12
Whoops, that didn't work.
4:14
Let me copy, and then paste it.
4:20
And so, I have two of these triangles now,
4:23
but I'm gonna flip this one over,
4:25
so that I can construct a parallelogram.
4:28
So I'm gonna flip it over, and move it over here,
4:31
I'm gonna have to rotate it a little bit more.
4:34
So, I think you get the general idea.
4:37
So now I have constructed a parallelogram
4:39
that has twice the area of our original triangle.
4:43
It has twice the area of our original triangle.
4:48
And so, if I talked about
4:49
the area of the entire parallelogram,
4:51
it would be base times the height of the parallelogram.
4:57
Base times the height of the parallelogram.
4:59
But if we're only talking about the area of --
5:02
If we're only talking about this area
5:06
right over here, which is our original triangle,
5:08
it's going to be half the area of the parallelogram,
5:11
so it's gonna be one half of that.
5:12
So our area of our original triangle
5:14
is one half base times height.
5:17
So hopefully that makes you feel pretty good
5:18
about this formula that you will see in geometry,
5:21
that area of a triangle is one half base times height,
5:23
while the area of a rectangle or a paralleogram
5:26
is going to be base times height.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,rRTXKQpblEc,
khan_video_iulx0z1lz8M_27,Can somebody please solve the equation: x^2 -20x-380=0 ?,MCQ,"•
0:00
Use the quadratic formula to solve the equation, 0 is equal
0:04
to negative 7q squared plus 2q plus 9.
0:10
Now, the quadratic formula, it applies to any quadratic
0:14
equation of the form-- we could put the 0 on
0:16
the left hand side.
0:17
0 is equal to ax squared plus bx plus c.
0:24
And we generally deal with x's, in this problem we're
0:27
dealing with q's.
0:28
But the quadratic formula says, look, if you have a
0:29
quadratic equation of this form, that the solutions of
0:34
this equation are going to be x is going to be equal to
0:37
negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus
0:44
4ac-- all of that over 2a.
0:49
And this is actually two solutions here, because
0:51
there's one solution where you take the positive square root
0:53
and there's another solution where you take
0:54
the negative root.
0:57
So it gives you both roots of this.
0:58
So if we look at the quadratic equation that we need to solve
1:02
here, we can just pattern match.
1:03
We're dealing with q's, not x's, but this is the same
1:05
general idea.
1:06
It could be x's if you like.
1:08
And if we look at it, negative 7 corresponds to a.
1:13
That is our a.
1:14
It's the coefficient on the second degree term.
1:18
2 corresponds to b.
1:21
It is the coefficient on the first degree term.
1:24
And then 9 corresponds to c.
1:26
It's the constant.
1:29
So, let's just apply the quadratic formula.
1:31
The quadratic formula will tell us that the solutions--
1:34
the q's that satisfy this equation-- q will be equal to
1:38
negative b.
1:40
b is 2.
1:42
Plus or minus the square root of b squared, of 2 squared,
1:53
minus 4 times a times negative 7 times c, which is 9.
2:08
And all of that over 2a.
2:10
All of that over 2 times a, which is once
2:16
again negative 7.
2:20
And then we just have to evaluate this.
2:22
So this is going to be equal to negative 2 plus or minus
2:29
the square root of-- let's see, 2 squared is 4-- and then
2:35
if we just take this part right here, if we just take
2:37
the negative 4 times negative 7 times 9, this negative and
2:42
that negative is going to cancel out.
2:43
So it's just going to become a positive number.
2:45
And 4 times 7 times 9.
2:49
4 times 9 is 36.
2:52
36 times 7.
2:54
Let's do it up here.
2:55
36 times 7.
2:58
7 times 6 is 42.
3:00
7 times 3, or 3 times 7 is 21.
3:03
Plus 4 is 25.
3:05
252.
3:06
So this becomes 4 plus 252.
3:09
Remember, you have a negative 7 and you
3:11
have a minus out front.
3:12
Those cancel out, that's why we have a positive 252 for
3:16
that part right there.
3:17
And then our denominator, 2 times negative
3:22
7 is negative 14.
3:24
Now what does this equal?
3:28
Well, we have this is equal to negative 2 plus or minus the
3:33
square root of-- what's 4 plus 252?
3:36
It's just 256.
3:38
All of that over negative 14.
3:40
And what's 256?
3:43
What's the square root of 256?
3:46
It's 16.
3:47
You can try it out for yourself.
3:48
This is 16 times 16.
3:49
So the square root of 256 is 16.
3:53
So we can rewrite this whole thing as being equal to
3:56
negative 2 plus 16 over negative 14.
4:04
Or negative 2 minus-- right?
4:07
This is plus 16 over negative 14.
4:10
Or minus 16 over negative 14.
4:16
If you think of it as plus or minus, that plus is that plus
4:20
right there.
4:21
And if you have that minus, that minus is
4:26
that minus right there.
4:28
Now we just have to evaluate these two numbers.
4:32
Negative 2 plus 16 is 14 divided by negative 14 is
4:39
negative 1.
4:40
So q could be equal to negative 1.
4:42
Or negative 2 minus 16 is negative 18 divided by
4:47
negative 14 is equal to 18 over 14.
4:51
The negatives cancel out, which is equal to 9 over 7.
4:54
So q could be equal to negative 1, or it could be
4:57
equal to 9 over 7.
4:59
And you could try these out, substitute these q's back into
5:02
this original equation, and verify for yourself that they
5:04
satisfy it.
5:05
We could even do it with the first one.
5:07
So if you take q is equal to negative 1.
5:09
Negative 7 times negative 1 squared-- negative 1 squared
5:12
is just 1-- so this would be negative 7 times 1, right?
5:17
That's negative 1 squared.
5:18
Negative 1 times 2 is minus 2 plus 9.
5:22
So it's negative 7 minus 2, which is negative 9, plus 9,
5:26
does indeed equal 0.
5:27
So this checks out.
5:29
And I'll leave it up to you to verify that 9 over
5:31
7 also works out.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,iulx0z1lz8M,

0:00
- As a little bit of a review, we know that
0:01
if we have some function, let's call it ""f"".
0:04
We don't have to call it ""f"", but ""f"" is the letter
0:06
most typically used for functions,
0:08
that if I give it an input, a valid input,
0:11
if I give it a valid input, and I use the variable ""x""
0:14
for that valid input, it is going to map that to an output.
0:19
It is going to map that, or produce,
0:21
given this x, it's going to product an output
0:24
that we would call ""f(x).""
0:26
And we've already talked a little bit
0:28
about the notion of a domain.
0:29
A domain is the set of all of the inputs
0:32
over which the function is defined.
0:35
So if this the domain here, if this is the domain here,
0:39
and I take a value here, and I put that in for x,
0:42
then the function is going to output an f(x).
0:45
If I take something that's outside of the domain,
0:47
let me do that in a different color...
0:49
If I take something that is outside of the domain
0:52
and try to input it into this function,
0:55
the function will say, ""hey, wait wait,""
0:56
""I'm not defined for that thing""
0:57
""that's outside of the domain.""
1:00
Now another interesting thing to think about,
1:04
and that's actually what the focus of this video is,
1:06
okay, we know the set of all of the valid inputs,
1:08
that's called the domain, but what about all,
1:10
the set of all of the outputs that the function
1:13
could actually produce?
1:14
And we have a name for that.
1:16
That is called the range of the function.
1:19
So the range.
1:21
The range, and the most typical,
1:23
there's actually a couple of definitions for range,
1:25
but the most typical definition for range
1:27
is ""the set of all possible outputs.""
1:30
So you give me, you input something from the domain,
1:32
it's going to output something, and by definition,
1:34
because we have outputted it from this function,
1:36
that thing is going to be in the range,
1:39
and if we take the set of all of the things
1:40
that the function could output,
1:42
that is going to make up the range.
1:44
So this right over here is the set of all possible,
1:49
all possible outputs.
1:53
All possible outputs.
1:55
So let's make that a little bit more concrete,
1:57
with an example.
1:58
So let's say that I have the function f(x)
2:02
defined as, so once again, I'm gonna input x's,
2:06
and I have my function f, and I'm gonna output f(x).
2:10
And let's say this def...
2:12
The function definition here, the thing that tries to
2:13
figure out, ""okay, given an x, what f(x) do I produce?"",
2:16
the definition says ""f(x) is going to be equal""
2:20
""to whatever my input is, squared.""
2:23
Well, just as a little bit of review,
2:24
we know what the domain here is going to be.
2:26
The domain is the set of all valid inputs.
2:30
So what are the valid inputs here?
2:33
Well, I could take any real number
2:34
and input into this, and I could take any real number
2:37
and I can square it, there's nothing wrong with that,
2:39
and so the domain is all real numbers.
2:42
All, all real, all real numbers.
2:48
But what's the range?
2:49
Maybe I'll do that in a different color
2:50
just to highlight it.
2:52
What is going to be the range here,
2:54
what is the set of all possible outputs?
2:58
Well if you think about, actually,
2:59
to help us think about, let me actually draw a graph here.
3:02
Of what this looks like.
3:04
What this looks like.
3:06
So the graph of ""f(x) is equal to x squared""
3:08
is going to look something like this.
3:10
So, it's gonna look, it's going to look something like this.
3:15
I'm obviously hand-drawing it, so it's not perfect.
3:17
It's gonna be a parabola with a,
3:19
with a vertex right here at the origin.
3:22
So this is the graph, this is the graph,
3:24
""y is equal to f(x),"" this of course is the x-axis,
3:28
this of course is the y-axis.
3:31
So let's think about it, what is the set
3:33
of all possible outputs?
3:35
Well in this case, the set of all possible outputs
3:36
is the set of all possible y's here.
3:38
Well, we see, y can take on any non-negative value.
3:43
y could be zero, y could one, y could be pi, y could be e,
3:47
but y cannot be negative.
3:51
So the range here is, the range...
3:54
We could, well we could say it a couple of ways,
3:56
we could say, ""f(x)"", let me write it this way.
3:59
""f(x) is a member of the real numbers""
4:03
""such that, is such that f(x) is greater than""
4:09
""or equal to zero.""
4:11
We could write it that way, if we wanted to
4:13
write it in a less mathy notation,
4:15
we could say that ""f(x) is going to be""
4:19
""greater than or equal to zero.""
4:21
f(x) is not going to be negative,
4:24
so any non-negative number, the set of all
4:27
non-negative numbers, that is our range.
4:31
Let's do another example of this,
4:33
just to make it a little bit, just to make it a little bit,
4:35
a little bit clearer.
4:37
Let's say that I had, let's say that I had g(x),
4:42
let's say I have g(x), I'll do this in white,
4:45
let's say it's equal to ""x squared over x.""
4:49
So we could try to simplify g(x) a little bit,
4:52
we could say, ""look, if I have x squared""
4:53
""and I divide it by x, that's gonna,""
4:55
""that's the same thing as g(x) being equal to x.""
4:59
""x squared over x"" is x, but we have to be careful.
5:02
Because right over here, we have to,
5:04
in our domain, x cannot be equal to zero.
5:08
If x is equal to zero, we get zero over zero,
5:10
we get indeterminate form.
5:11
So in order for this function to be the exact same function,
5:14
we have to put that, 'cause it's not obvious now
5:16
from the definition, we have to say,
5:21
""x cannot be equal to zero.""
5:23
So g(x) is equal to x for any x
5:25
as long as x is not equal to zero.
5:28
Now these two function definitions are equivalent.
5:31
And we could even graph it.
5:33
We could graph it, it's going to look,
5:35
I'm gonna do a quick and dirty version of this graph.
5:38
It's gonna look something like, this.
5:40
It's gonna have a slope of one,
5:43
but it's gonna have a hole right at zero,
5:44
'cause it's not defined at zero.
5:47
So it's gonna look like this.
5:48
So the domain here, the domain of g
5:53
is going to be, ""x is a member of the real numbers""
5:57
""such that x does not equal zero,""
6:00
and the range is actually going to be the same thing.
6:03
The range here is going to be,
6:06
we could say ""f(x) is a member of the real numbers""
6:10
""such that f(x) does not equal zero.""
6:14
""f(x) does not equal zero.""
6:17
So the domain is all real numbers except for zero,
6:19
the range is all real numbers except for zero.
6:24
So the big takeaway here is the range is all the pos...

William and Luis are in different physics classes
0:03
at Santa Rita.
0:04
Luis's teacher always gives exams with 30 questions
0:07
on them, while William's teacher gives more
0:10
frequent exams with only 24 questions.
0:14
Luis's teacher also assigns three projects per year.
0:17
Even though the two classes have to take a different number
0:20
of exams, their teachers have told them
0:22
that both classes-- let me underline-- both classes will
0:25
get the same total number of exam questions each year.
0:29
What is the minimum number of exam questions
0:32
William's or Luis's class can expect to get in a given year?
0:36
So let's think about what's happening.
0:38
So if we think about Luis's teacher who
0:40
gives 30 questions per test, so after the first test,
0:44
he would have done 30 questions.
0:46
So this is 0 right over here.
0:48
Then after the second test, he would have done 60.
0:52
Then after the third test, he would have done 90.
0:56
And after the fourth test, he would have done 120.
1:00
And after the fifth test, if there is a fifth test,
1:03
he would do-- so this is if they have that many tests-- he
1:06
would get to 150 total questions.
1:08
And we could keep going on and on looking
1:10
at all the multiples of 30.
1:12
So this is probably a hint of what we're thinking about.
1:14
We're looking at multiples of the numbers.
1:16
We want the minimum multiples or the least multiple.
1:19
So that's with Luis.
1:20
Well what's going on with William?
1:22
Will William's teacher, after the first test,
1:25
they're going to get to 24 questions.
1:29
Then they're going to get to 48 after the second test.
1:32
Then they're going to get to 72 after the third test.
1:37
Then they're going to get to 96.
1:39
I'm just taking multiples of 24.
1:41
They're going to get to 96 after the fourth test.
1:45
And then after the fifth test, they're going to get to 120.
1:49
And if there's a sixth test, then they would get to 144.
1:55
And we could keep going on and on in there.
1:57
But let's see what they're asking us.
1:58
What is the minimum number of exam questions
2:00
William's or Luis's class can expect to get in a year?
2:03
Well the minimum number is the point
2:04
at which they've gotten the same number of exam questions,
2:07
despite the fact that the tests had
2:09
a different number of items.
2:10
And you see the point at which they have the same number
2:12
is at 120.
2:14
This happens at 120.
2:16
They both could have exactly 120 questions
2:19
even though Luis's teacher is giving 30 at a time
2:21
and even though William's teacher is giving 24 at a time.
2:25
And so the answer is 120.
2:28
And notice, they had a different number of exams.
2:30
Luis had one, two, three, four exams
2:33
while William would have to have one, two, three, four,
2:36
five exams.
2:37
But that gets them both to 120 total questions.
2:41
Now thinking of it in terms of some of the math notation
2:44
or the least common multiple notation we've seen before,
2:47
this is really asking us what is the least common multiple of 30
2:55
and 24.
2:56
And that least common multiple is equal to 120.
3:02
Now there's other ways that you can
3:04
find the least common multiple other than just looking
3:06
at the multiples like this.
3:07
You could look at it through prime factorization.
3:10
30 is 2 times 15, which is 3 times 5.
3:15
So we could say that 30 is equal to 2 times 3 times 5.
3:20
And 24-- that's a different color than that blue-- 24
3:28
is equal to 2 times 12.
3:31
12 is equal to 2 times 6.
3:33
6 is equal to 2 times 3.
3:36
So 24 is equal to 2 times 2 times 2 times 3.
3:44
So another way to come up with the least common multiple,
3:47
if we didn't even do this exercise up here, says, look,
3:49
the number has to be divisible by both 30 and 24.
3:52
If it's going to be divisible by 30,
3:54
it's going to have to have 2 times 3 times 5
4:00
in its prime factorization.
4:01
That is essentially 30.
4:03
So this makes it divisible by 30.
4:05
And say, well in order to be divisible by 24,
4:10
its prime factorization is going to need 3 twos and a 3.
4:13
Well we already have 1 three.
4:15
And we already have 1 two, so we just need 2 more twos.
4:18
So 2 times 2.
4:20
So this makes it-- let me scroll up
4:24
a little bit-- this right over here makes it divisible by 24.
4:29
And so this is essentially the prime factorization
4:32
of the least common multiple of 30 and 24.
4:34
You take any one of these numbers away,
4:37
you are no longer going to be divisible by one of these two
4:40
numbers.
4:40
If you take a two away, you're not going to be divisible by 24
4:43
anymore.
4:43
If you take a two or a three away.
4:45
If you take a three or a five away,
4:50
you're not going to be divisible by 30 anymore.
4:53
And so if you were to multiply all these out,
4:55
this is 2 times 2 times 2 is 8 times 3 is 24 times 5 is 120.
5:04
Now let's do one more of these.
5:06
Umama just bought one package of 21 binders.
5:09
Let me write that number down.
5:11
21 binders.
5:12
She also bought a package of 30 pencils.
5:17
She wants to use all of the binders and pencils
5:20
to create identical sets of office supplies
5:23
for her classmates.
5:24
What is the greatest number of identical sets
5:27
Umama can make using all the supplies?
5:29
So the fact that we're talking about greatest
5:31
is clue that it's probably going to be dealing
5:33
with greatest common divisors.
5:34
And it's also dealing with dividing these things.
5:36
We want to divide these both into the greatest
5:39
number of identical sets.
5:44
So there's a couple of ways we could think about it.
5:46
Let's think about what the greatest common divisor
5:49
of both these numbers are.
5:51
Or I could even say the greatest common factor.
5:53
The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30.
6:00
So what's the largest number that divides into both of them?
6:04
So we could go with the prime factor.
6:05
We could list all of their normal factors
6:07
and see what is the greatest common one.
6:09
Or we could look at the prime factorization.
6:16
So let's just do the prime factorization method.
6:18
So 21 is the same thing as 3 times 7.
6:21
These are both prime numbers.
6:23
30 is, let's see, it's 3-- actually,
6:27
I could write it this way-- it is 2 times 15.
6:30
We already did it actually just now.
6:32
And 15 is 3 times 5.
6:34
So what's the largest number of prime numbers that
6:37
are common to both factorizations?
6:39
Well you only have a three right over here.
6:42
Then you don't have a three times anything else.
6:44
So this is just going to be equal to 3.
6:47
So this is essentially telling us,
6:48
look, we can divide both of these numbers into 3
6:54
and that will give us the largest
6:56
number of identical sets.
6:58
So just to be clear of what we're doing.
7:00
So we've answered the question is 3,
7:02
but just to visualize it for this question,
7:04
let's actually draw 21 binders.
7:07
So let's say the 21 binders so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
7:13
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.
7:19
And then 30 pencils, so I'll just do those in green.
7:22
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
7:27
Let me just copy and paste that.
7:29
This is getting tedious.
7:31
So copy and paste.
7:35
So that's 20 and then paste that is 30.
7:41
Now, we figured out that 3 is the largest number that
7:45
divides into both of these evenly.
7:46
So I can divide both of these into groups of 3.
7:50
So for the binders, I could do it into three groups of 7.
7:55
And then for the pencils, I could do it
7:58
into three groups of 10.
8:01
So if there are three people that
8:03
are coming into this classroom, I
8:05
could give them each seven binders and 10 pencils.
8:11
But that's the greatest number of identical sets
8:14
Umama can make.
8:15
I would have three sets.
8:16
Each set would have seven binders and 10 pencils.
8:22
And we essentially are just thinking
8:23
about what's the number that we can divide both of these sets
8:27
into evenly, the largest number that we
8:30
can divide both of these sets into evenly.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,1Vb8t7Y-pI0,

So I've got a whole pizza here, and let's say
0:02
that I were to cut it into two equal pieces.
0:05
Let me cut it right over here into 2 equal pieces.
0:11
And let's say that I ate one of those 2 equal pieces.
0:14
So let's say I ate all of this right over here.
0:17
What fraction of the pizza have I eaten?
0:20
Well, I took the whole and I divide it
0:23
into two equal pieces, and then I ate one of those pieces.
0:33
So I ate 1/2 of the pizza.
0:37
Now, let's imagine that instead of cutting that pizza into only
0:43
2 equal pieces, let's imagine instead
0:45
that decide to cut it into 4 equal pieces.
0:48
So let's draw that.
0:50
So 4 equal pieces.
0:52
So I could cut once this way and then
0:56
I could cut it once this way.
0:59
And so here I have 4 equal pieces.
1:05
But let's say that I want to eat the same amount of pizza.
1:09
How many of these 4 equal pieces would I have to eat.
1:12
I encourage you to pause the video and think about that.
1:15
Well, I would eat this piece.
1:18
You could imagine me eating this piece and this piece right
1:20
over here.
1:21
I've eaten the same amount of the pizza.
1:25
Each of these pieces you could imagine got cut into 2 pieces
1:28
when I cut the whole pizza this way.
1:31
And so now I have to eat 2 slices of the 4,
1:34
as opposed to 1 slice of the 2.
1:36
So I just ate 2 out of the 4 slices.
1:42
I'm using different numbers here.
1:44
Here I'm using a 1 in the numerator
1:47
and 2 in the denominator.
1:48
Here, I'm using a 2 in the numerator
1:49
and a 4 in the denominator.
1:51
These two fractions represent the same quantity.
1:54
I ate the same amount of pizza.
1:56
If I eat 2/4 of a pizza, if I eat 2 out of 4 equal pieces,
2:00
that's the same fraction of the pizza
2:02
as if I eat 1 out of 2 equal pieces.
2:05
So we would say that these two things
2:07
are equivalent fractions.
2:10
Now let's do another one like this.
2:12
Instead of just dividing it into 4 equal pieces,
2:15
let's divide it into 8 equal pieces.
2:23
So now we could cut once like this.
2:26
So now we have 2 equal pieces.
2:29
Cut once like this.
2:30
Now we have 4 equal pieces.
2:32
And then divide each of those 4 pieces into 2 pieces.
2:35
So I'll cut those in-- So let's see.
2:39
I want to make them equal pieces.
2:40
Those don't look as equal as I would like.
2:43
So that looks more equal, and that looks reasonably equal.
2:51
So now how many equal pieces do I have?
2:53
I have 8 equal pieces.
2:57
But let's say I wanted to eat the same fraction of the pizza.
3:01
So I could eat all of these pieces right over here.
3:04
Well, how many of those 8 equal pieces have I eaten?
3:07
Well, I've eaten 1, 2, 3, 4 of those 8 equal pieces.
3:11
And so once again, this fraction, 4 of 8, or 4/8,
3:15
is equivalent to 2/4, which is equivalent to 1/2.
3:19
And you might see a little bit of a pattern here.
3:21
Going from this scenario to this scenario,
3:26
I got twice as many equal slices.
3:29
Because I had twice as many equal slices,
3:32
I needed to eat two times the number of slices.
3:35
So I multiply the denominator by 2,
3:38
and I multiply the numerator by 2.
3:41
If I multiply the numerator and the denominator
3:43
by the same number, then I'm not changing
3:46
what that fraction represents.
3:48
And you see that over here.
3:50
Going from 4 slices to 8 slices, I cut every slice,
3:54
I turned every slice into 2 more slices,
3:57
so I had twice as many slices.
3:59
And then if I want to eat the same amount,
4:01
I have to eat twice as many pieces.
4:07
So all of these, 1/2, 2/4, four 4/8, and I could keep going.
4:10
I could do 8/16.
4:12
I could do 16/32.
4:14
All of these would be equivalent fractions.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,N1X0vf5PUz4,

In the last video we saw how a matrix and figuring out its

0:06
And we did a 2 by 2.
0:07
And in the future, we'll do 3 by 3's.
0:09
We won't do 4 by 4's because those take too long.
0:11
But you'll see it applies to kind of an n by n matrix.
0:13
And that is probably the application of matrices that
0:17
you learn if you learn this in your Algebra 2 class, or your
0:20
Algebra 1 class.
0:22
And you often wonder, well why even do the
0:23
whole matrix thing?
0:25
Now I will show you another application of matrices that
0:28
actually you're more likely to see in your linear algebra
0:31
class when you take it in college.
0:34
But the really neat thing here is, and I think this will
0:37
really hit the point home, that the matrix representation
0:40
is just one way of representing multiple types of
0:43
problems. And what's really cool is that if different
0:45
problems can be represented the same way, it kind of tells
0:47
you that they're the same problem.
0:48
And that's called an isomorphism in math.
0:50
That if you can reduce one problem into another problem,
0:53
then all the work you did with one of them
0:54
applies to the other.
0:55
But anyway, let's figure out a new way that
0:58
matrices can be used.
1:00
So I'm going to draw some vectors.
1:03
Let's say I have the vector-- Let's call this vector a.
1:12
And I'm going to just write this is as a column vector.
1:14
And all of this is just convention.
1:16
These are just human invented things.
1:18
I could have written this diagonally.
1:19
I could have written this however.
1:20
But if I say vector a is 3, negative 6.
1:31
And I view this as the x component of the vector, and
1:33
this is equal to the y component of the vector.
1:35
And then I have vector b.
1:41
Vector b is equal to 2, 6.
1:57
And I want to know are there some combinations of vectors a
2:04
and b-- where you can say, 5 times vector a, plus 3 times
2:08
vector b, or 10 times victor a minus 6 times vector b-- some
2:13
combination of vector a and b, where I can get vector c.
2:19
And vector c is the vector 7, 6.
2:31
So let me see if I can visually draw this problem.
2:33
So let me draw the coordinate axes.
2:35
Let's see this one.
2:36
3, negative 6.
2:37
That'll be in quadrant-- these are both
2:39
in the first quadrant.
2:40
So I just want to figure out how much of the
2:42
axes I need to draw.
2:43
So let's see-- Let me do a different color.
2:52
That's my y-axis.
2:53
I'm not drawing the second or third quadrants, because I
2:56
don't think our vectors show up there.
2:58
And then this is the x-axis.
3:03
Let me draw each of these vectors.
3:08
So first I'll do vector a.
3:11
That's 3, negative 6.
3:13
1, 2, 3, and then negative 6.
3:17
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
3:24
So it's there.
3:26
So if I wanted to draw it as a vector, usually
3:31
start at the origin.
3:34
And it doesn't have to start at the origin like that.
3:36
I'm just choosing to.
3:37
You can move around a vector.
3:39
It just has to have the same orientation
3:42
and the same magnitude.
3:45
So that is vector a for the green.
3:52
Now let me do in magenta, I'll do vector b.
3:56
That is 2, 6.
3:59
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
4:04
So 2, 6 is right over there.
4:12
And that's vector b.
4:22
So it'll look like this.
4:25
That's vector b.
4:27
And then let me write down vector a down there.
4:30
That's vector a.
4:32
And I want to take some combination of
4:35
vectors a and b.
4:36
And add them up and get vector c.
4:38
So what does vector c look like?
4:39
It's 7, 6.
4:41
Let me do that in purple.
4:43
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
4:50
Comma 6.
4:52
So 7, 6 is right over there.
4:55
That's vector c.
5:00
Vector c looks like that.
5:09
I'm going to draw it like that.
5:10
And that's vector c.
5:14
So what was the original problem I said?
5:16
I said I want to add some multiple of vector a to some
5:19
multiple of vector b, and get vector c.
5:21
And I want to see what those multiples are.
5:24
So let's say the multiple that I multiply
5:25
times vector a is x.
5:27
And the multiple of vector b is y.
5:29
So I essentially want to say that-- let me do it in another
5:33
neutral color-- that vector ax-- that's how much of vector
5:42
a I'm contributing-- plus vector by-- that's how much of
5:49
vector b I'm contributing-- is equal to vector c.
5:54
And you know, maybe I can't.
5:56
Maybe there's no combinations of vector a and b when you add
5:59
them together equal vector c.
6:00
But let's see if we can solve this.
6:03
So how do we solve?
6:03
So let's expand out vectors a and b.
6:05
Vector a is what?
6:06
3, negative 6.
6:07
So vector a, we could write as 3, minus 6 times x.
6:17
That just tells us how much vector a we're contributing.
6:20
Plus vector b, which is 2, 6.
6:26
And then y is how much vector b we're contributing.
6:29
And that is equal to 7, 6.
6:33
Vector c.
6:36
Now this right here, this problem can be rewritten just
6:41
based on how we've defined matrix multiplication, et
6:43
cetera, et cetera, as this.
6:47
As 3, minus 6, 2, 6, times x, y, is equal to 7, 6.
7:07
Now how does that work out?
7:09
Well think about how matrix multiplication works out.
7:11
The way we learned matrix multiplication, we said, 3
7:16
times x, plus 2 times y is equal to 7.
7:25
3 times x plus 2 times y is equal to 7.
7:28
That's how we learned matrix multiplication.
7:30
That's the same thing here.
7:31
3 times x, plus 2 times y, is going to be equal to 7.
7:37
These x and y here are just scalar numbers.
7:39
So 3 times x plus 2 times y is equal to 7.
7:41
And then matrix multiplication here, minus 6 times x plus 6
7:45
times y is equal to 6.
7:47
That's just traditional matrix multiplication that we learned
7:49
several videos ago.
7:50
That's the same thing here.
7:51
Minus 6x plus 6y is equal to 6.
7:54
These x's and y's are just numbers.
7:56
They're just scalar numbers.
7:57
They're not vectors or anything.
7:58
We would just multiply them times both of these numbers.
8:01
So hopefully you see that this problem is the exact same
8:03
thing as this problem.
8:04
And you've maybe had an a-ha moment now, if you watched the
8:08
previous video.
8:08
Because this matrix also represented the problem, where
8:16
do we find the intersection of two lines?
8:18
Where the two lines-- I'm just going to do it on the side
8:20
here-- the intersection of the two lines, 3x plus
8:24
2y is equal to 7.
8:26
And minus 6x plus 6y is equal to 6.
8:31
And so, I had drawn two lines.
8:33
And we said, what's the point of intersection,
8:34
et cetera, et cetera.
8:35
And it was represented by this problem.
8:37
But here, we have-- well I won't say a completely
8:39
different problem, because we're learning they're
8:41
actually very similar-- but here I'm doing a problem of,
8:43
I'm trying to find what combination of the matrices a
8:46
and b add up to the matrix c.
8:49
But it got reduced to the same matrix representation.
8:53
And so we can solve this the same exactly way we solved
8:56
this problem.
8:57
If we call this the matrix a, let's figure out a inverse.
9:02
So we get a inverse is equal to what?
9:06
It equals 1 over the determinant of a.
9:08
The determinant of a is 3 times 6.
9:10
18 minus minus 12.
9:13
So that's 18 plus 12, which is 1/30.
9:18
And we did this in the previous video.
9:19
You swap these two numbers.
9:21
So you get 6 and 3.
9:23
And then you make these two negatives.
9:25
So you get 6 and minus 2.
9:28
That's a inverse.
9:29
And now to solve for x and y, we can multiply both sides of
9:32
this equation by a inverse.
9:34
If you multiply a inverse times a, this cancels out.
9:37
So you get x, y is equal to a inverse times this.
9:45
It's equal to 1/30 times 6, minus 2, 6, 3.
9:53
Times 7, 6.
9:55
And remember, with matrices, the order that
9:58
you multiply matters.
9:59
So on this side, we multiplied a inverse on
10:01
this side of the equation.
10:03
So we have to do a inverse on the left side on this side of
10:06
this equation.
10:07
So that's why did it here.
10:08
If we did it the other way, all bets are off.
10:11
So what does this equal?
10:13
This is equal to 1/30 times-- and we did this the previous
10:17
problem-- 6 times 7 is 42, minus 12.
10:21
30.
10:22
6 times 7, 42.
10:23
Plus 18.
10:24
60.
10:26
So that equals 1, 2.
10:30
So what does this tell us?
10:32
This tells us that if we have 1 times vector a, plus 2
10:37
times vector b.
10:38
1 times-- this is 1-- and 2 times vector b.
10:43
So 1 times vector a plus 2 times vector b is
10:46
equal to vector c.
10:47
And let's confirm that visually.
10:49
So 1 times vector a.
10:50
Well that's vector a right there.
10:52
So if we add 2 vector b's to it, we should get vector c.
10:55
So let's see if we can do that.
10:57
So if we just shift vector b over this way, well vector
11:01
let's see, vector b is over 2 and up 6.
11:03
So over 2 and up 6 would get us there.
11:08
So 1, vector b-- just doing heads to tail visual method of
11:12
adding vectors-- would get us there.
11:16
1, 2, 3.
11:17
Good.
11:20
No, let me see.
11:23
1, 2, 3.
11:26
And then vector b goes over two more.
11:30
two more.
11:33
So it'll get us up 6.
11:35
It's like that.
11:36
So that's 1, vector b.
11:40
And then if we add another-- but we want 2 times vector b.
11:43
We essentially need two vector b's.
11:45
So we had one, and then we add another one.
11:47
I think visually you see that it does actually-- I didn't
11:51
want to do it like that.
11:52
I wanted to use the line tool so it looks neat.
11:55
So you add another vector b.
11:56
And there you have it.
11:59
That's a vector b.
12:01
So it's 2 times vector b.
12:02
So it's the same direction as vector b, but it's two times
12:05
the length.
12:06
So we visually showed it.
12:07
We solved it algabraically.
12:10
But the real learning, and the big real discovery of this
12:13
whole video, is to show you that the matrix representation
12:18
can represent multiple different problems. This was a
12:23
finding the combinations of a vector problem.
12:26
And the previous one it was figure out if
12:28
two lines can intersect.
12:30
But what it tells you is that these two problems are
12:32
connected in some deep way.
12:33
That if we take the veneer of reality, that underlying it,
12:37
they are the same thing.
12:39
And frankly, that's why math is so interesting.
12:41
Because when you realize that two problems are really the
12:45
same thing, it takes all of the superficial human veneer
12:48
away from things.
12:49
Because our brains are kind of wired to perceive the world in
12:52
a certain way.
12:52
But it tells us that there's some fundamental truth,
12:56
independent of our perception, that is tying all of these
13:00
different concepts together.
13:01
But anyway, I don't want to get all mystical on you.
13:03
But if you do see the mysticism in
13:05
math, all the better.
13:07
But hopefully you found that pretty interesting.
13:10
And actually, I know I'm going over time, but I think this
13:12
is-- A lot of people take linear algebra, they learn how
13:15
to do all of the things, and they say, well what is the
13:17
whole point of this?
13:18
But this is kind of an interesting
13:20
thing to think about.
13:22
We had this had vector a and we had this vector b.
13:27
And we were able to say, well there's some combinations of
13:29
the vectors a and b, that when we added it up,
13:31
we got vector c.
13:34
So an interesting question is, what are all the vectors that
13:38
I could get to by adding combinations of
13:42
vectors a and b.
13:43
Or adding or subtracting.
13:44
Or you could say, I could multiply
13:46
them by negative numbers.
13:47
But either way.
13:47
What are all of the vectors that I can get by taking
13:51
linear combinations of vectors a and b?
13:53
And that's actually called the vector space spanned by the
13:57
vectors a and b.
13:58
And we'll do more of that in linear algebra.
14:01
And here we're dealing with a two
14:02
dimensional Euclidean space.
14:04
We could have had three dimensional vectors.
14:06
We could've had n dimensional vectors.
14:07
So it gets really, really, really abstract.
14:09
But this is, I think, a really good toe dipping for linear
14:14
algebra as well.
14:14
So hopefully I haven't confused or overwhelmed you.

And I'll see you in the next video.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,gsNgdVdAT1o,
khan_video_lSwsAFgWqR8_6,Does the x value of the respective functions of both limits have to approach the same value for the properties to apply?,Essay,"•
0:00
What I want to do in this video is give you
0:02
a bunch of properties of limits.
0:03
And we're not going to prove it rigorously here.
0:05
In order to have the rigorous proof of these properties,
0:07
we need a rigorous definition of what a limit is.
0:09
And we're not doing that in this tutorial,
0:11
we'll do that in the tutorial on the epsilon delta
0:13
definition of limits.
0:14
But most of these should be fairly intuitive.
0:17
And they are very helpful for simplifying limit problems
0:19
in the future.
0:21
So let's say we know that the limit of some function
0:24
f of x, as x approaches c, is equal to capital L.
0:28
And let's say that we also know that the limit
0:32
of some other function, let's say g of x, as x approaches c,
0:36
is equal to capital M.
0:39
Now given that, what would be the limit of f
0:43
of x plus g of x as x approaches c?
0:49
Well-- and you could look at this visually,
0:51
if you look at the graphs of two arbitrary functions,
0:53
you would essentially just add those two functions--
0:55
it'll be pretty clear that this is going to be equal to--
0:57
and once again, I'm not doing a rigorous proof,
0:59
I'm just really giving you the properties here--
1:01
this is going to be the limit of f of x as x approaches c,
1:06
plus the limit of g of x as x approaches c.
1:11
Which is equal to, well this right over here
1:14
is-- let me do that in that same color--
1:17
this right here is just equal to L.
1:20
It's going to be equal to L plus M. This right over here
1:26
is equal to M.
1:27
Not too difficult.
1:28
This is often called the sum rule, or the sum property,
1:33
of limits.
1:35
And we could come up with a very similar one with differences.
1:37
The limit as x approaches c of f of x minus g of x,
1:44
is just going to be L minus M. It's just
1:47
the limit of f of x as x approaches
1:49
c, minus the limit of g of x as x approaches c.
1:52
So it's just going to be L minus M.
1:58
And we also often call it the difference
2:00
rule, or the difference property, of limits.
2:02
And these once again, are very, very, hopefully, reasonably
2:05
intuitive.
2:06
Now what happens if you take the product of the functions?
2:08
The limit of f of x times g of x as x approaches c.
2:16
Well lucky for us, this is going to be
2:18
equal to the limit of f of x as x approaches
2:22
c, times the limit of g of x, as x approaches c.
2:28
Lucky for us, this is kind of a fairly intuitive property
2:31
of limits.
2:32
So in this case, this is just going
2:33
to be equal to, this is L times M. This is just
2:41
going to be L times M. Same thing,
2:45
if instead of having a function here, we had a constant.
2:47
So if we just had the limit-- let
2:50
me do it in that same color-- the limit of k times
2:56
f of x, as x approaches c, where k is just some constant.
3:00
This is going to be the same thing as k times the limit
3:03
of f of x as x approaches c.
3:06
And that is just equal to L. So this whole thing
3:13
simplifies to k times L.
3:20
And we can do the same thing with difference.
3:22
This is often called the constant multiple property.
3:25
We can do the same thing with differences.
3:28
So if we have the limit as x approaches
3:31
c of f of x divided by g of x.
3:35
This is the exact same thing as the limit
3:37
of f of x as x approaches c, divided
3:41
by the limit of g of x as x approaches c.
3:46
Which is going to be equal to-- I think you get it now--
3:49
this is going to be equal to L over M.
3:56
And finally-- this is sometimes called the quotient property--
3:59
finally we'll look at the exponent property.
4:01
So if I have the limit of-- let me
4:07
write it this way-- of f of x to some power.
4:09
And actually, let me even write it
4:10
as a fractional power, to the r over s
4:12
power, where both r and s are integers, then the limit of f
4:16
of x to the r over s power as x approaches c,
4:23
is going to be the exact same thing as the limit of f
4:28
of x as x approaches c raised to the r over s power.
4:33
Once again, when r and s are both integers, and s
4:36
is not equal to 0.
4:37
Otherwise this exponent would not make much sense.
4:40
And this is the same thing as L to the r over s power.
4:46
So this is equal to L to the r over s power.
4:54
So using these, we can actually find
4:56
the limit of many, many, many things.
4:58
And what's neat about it is the property of limits kind of
5:01
are the things that you would naturally want to do.
5:03
And if you graph some of these functions,
5:05
it actually turns out to be quite intuitive.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,lSwsAFgWqR8,

0:00
Let's see if we can express 16/21 as a decimal.
0:04
Or we could call this 16 twenty-firsts.
0:06
This is also 16 divided by 21.
0:09
So we can literally just divide 21 into 16.
0:12
And because 21 is larger than 16,
0:14
we're going to get something less than 1.
0:17
So let's just literally divide 21 into 16.
0:21
And we're going to have something less than 1.
0:23
So let's add some decimal places here.
0:25
We're going to round to the nearest thousandths in case
0:28
our digits keep going on, and on, and on.
0:31
And let's start dividing.
0:32
21 goes into 1 zero times.
0:34
21 goes into 16 zero times.
0:36
21 goes into 160-- well, 20 would go into 160 eight times.
0:41
So let's try 7.
0:44
Let's see if 7 is the right thing.
0:45
So 7 times 1 is 7.
0:48
7 times 2 is 14.
0:51
And then when we subtract it, we should
0:52
get a remainder less than 21.
0:54
If we pick the largest number here where,
0:59
if I multiply it by 21, I get close to 160
1:02
without going over.
1:03
And so if we subtract, we do get 13.
1:07
So that worked.
1:08
13 is less than 21.
1:10
And you could just subtract it.
1:11
I did it in my head right there.
1:13
But you could regroup.
1:14
You could say this is a 10.
1:15
And then this would be a 5.
1:17
10 minus 7 is 3.
1:18
5 minus 4 is 1.
1:19
1 minus 1 is 0.
1:22
Now let's bring down a 0.
1:25
21 goes into 130.
1:29
So let's see.
1:29
Would 6 work?
1:30
It looks like 6 would work.
1:31
6 times 21 is 126.
1:33
So that looks like it works.
1:34
So let's put a 6 there.
1:36
6 times 1 is 6.
1:38
6 times 2 is 120.
1:40
There's a little bit of an art to this.
1:42
All right, now let's subtract.
1:43
And once again, we can regroup.
1:45
This would be a 10.
1:46
We've taken 10 from essentially this 30.
1:48
So now this becomes a 2.
1:50
10 minus 6 is 4.
1:53
2 minus 2 is 0.
1:54
1 minus 1 is 0.
1:56
Now let's bring down another 0.
2:00
21 goes into 40, well, almost two times,
2:03
but not quite, so only one time.
2:06
1 times 21 is 21.
2:08
And now let's subtract.
2:09
This is a 10.
2:10
This becomes a 3.
2:12
10 minus 1 is 9.
2:14
3 minus 2 is 1.
2:16
And we're going have to get this digit.
2:18
Because we want to round to the nearest thousandth.
2:21
So if this is 5 or over, we're going round up.
2:24
If this is less than 5, we're going to round down.
2:27
So let's bring another 0 down here.
2:32
And 21 goes into 190.
2:35
Let's see, I think 9 will work.
2:38
Let's try 9.
2:38
9 times 1 is 9.
2:41
9 times 2 is 18.
2:45
When you subtract, 190 minus 189 is 1.
2:49
And we could keep going on, and on, and on.
2:51
But we already have enough digits
2:52
to round to the nearest thousandth.
2:54
This digit right over here is greater than or equal to 5.
3:00
So we will round up in the thousandths place.
3:03
So if we round to the nearest thousandths,
3:05
we can say that this is 0.76.

out, would literally be 109 percent, which is the same
0:16
thing as 109 per-- and I could write cent again, but that's
0:25
getting old.
0:26
Cent means 100, so it literally
0:28
means 109 per hundred.
0:32
If you had 100 per 100, you're dealing with the whole, but
0:35
now we have more than a whole.
0:37
We have 109 per 100.
0:38
We can actually write this as a ratio, or as a fraction.
0:41
This is the same thing as 109 per 100.
0:45
It's the the same thing as 109/100.
0:48
So let's shade that in.
0:50
So we have a whole here, so we could consider
0:53
this square a whole.

0:57
This is a 10 by 10 square.
0:58
It is cut up into 100 pieces.
1:01
So if we want 109 of those 100 pieces, what
1:05
are we talking about?
1:06
That means we're going to shade in all of the
1:08
100 right over here.
1:09
Let me do that in a new color.
1:10
So we'll shade in all of this.
1:17
If you just shaded that in, that would be 100%.
1:20
That would be 100/100, or 100 per 100, or 100%.
1:28
I think you're getting the meaning of all of this.
1:30
I don't just want you just memorize this stuff.
1:31
This really just means 100 out of 100, or a whole.
1:34
And you can see that this is the whole square.
1:37
That's 100 out of 100 right there.
1:39
The question is saying show us 109% by shading.
1:43
We already did 100 per 100, but we need to do another 9,
1:46
so let's shade in another 9.
1:48
So now we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

That would make you feel comfortable that you are getting this right.
1:08
and later we can think about other ways to get the intitution
1:11
of what these might be allowed you to actually make sense
1:14
but to make this make consistent with the rest of mathematics
1:18
that you know, you go into a little bit of a thought experiment
1:21
you say, well, what should five times
1:24
three plus negative three equal
1:28
well you already have a philosophy of adding negative numbers
1:32
or adding positive numbers to negative numbers, you know negative three is
1:35
the opposite of three, but you add three to negative three
1:39
you're going to get zero, so this is going to be equal to
1:42
five times zero
1:45
based on how you already thought about adding a negative number
1:52
to a positive, and anything times zero is going to be
1:54
zero, so this expression right over here should be zero
1:57
but you see, I want to multiply positive and negative
2:02
numbers to be consistent with this distributive property so
2:04
I should should be able to distribute this five
2:07
and for math to be consistent, and math should be consistent, I should
2:12
get the exact same answer, so let's distribute this five so
2:16
we get five times three
2:18
is going to write out as five times three
2:23
let me write this multiplication sign, not this dot
2:27
five times three, so i distributed there
2:31
plus five times negative three
2:35
i'll do that in yellow, five times negative three
2:39
and this whole thing we just said should be equal to zero
2:45
it should be equal to zero, well five times three
2:50
those are two positive numbers, we should know what should should be, that is going to be fifteen
2:54
now we get this thing, fifteen plus
2:57
times whatever five times negative three is
3:01
needs to be equal to zero in order to be consistent with all the other mathematics
3:09
that we know, well what plus fifteen is going to
3:12
be equal to zero, well the opposite of fifteen in order for this
3:16
to be true, in order for this to be consistent with all the other mathematics we know
3:20
this right over here needs to be equal to
3:23
negative fifteen until you say five times negative three
3:27
in order to be consistent with all other mathematics we know, needs to
3:31
be equal to negative fifteen. That's also consistent
3:34
with the intuition of adding negative three repeatedly
3:38
five times, now look above above us
3:41
slightly higher so you can see ideas of multiplying
3:44
two negatives, but we can do the exact same product experiment.
3:48
We want whatever this answer to be consistent with the rest of mathematics
3:52
that we know so we can
3:53
do the same product experiment. What would negative two times
3:58
six plus negative six to be equal to.
4:02
Well, six plus negative six is going to be zero.
4:05
Negative two times zero, anything times zero, needs to be equal to
4:09
zero, but then once again, we can distribute
4:12
negative two times six so we get
4:16
negative two times six, then plus negative two times
4:23
negative six plus negative two
4:27
times negative six, then once again all of this is going to be
4:30
equal to zero, now based on the five experiment we just
4:34
did, we said ""well this needs to be equal to negative twelve""
4:37
or we can view this as going to the six twice
4:41
left direction on the number line which gets us to negative twelve
4:44
or you could say repeatedly adding negative twos
4:48
times six would also get you to negative twelve and now
4:52
we also saw over here we want to multiply a positive and a negative
4:55
we got the negative so
4:58
this could be, you know, going to be equal to negative twelve
5:02
so we have negative twelve plus
5:05
whatever this business is
5:08
going to have to be equal to zero (repeated)
5:13
in order to be consistent with all the other mathematics that we know
5:17
and so what plus negative twelve is going to equal to be zero
5:21
Well, positive twelve plus negative twelve is going to equal to zero
5:25
so this needs to be equal to positive twelve in
5:27
order to be consistent with all the other mathematics we know
5:31
so there we get the idea that this is going positive
5:35
twelve. I'll leave you there and I'll see
5:39
if I can make a few other videos that can also give you a conceptual understanding
5:42
of why these are true",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,rK4sXm_MPWo,
khan_video_ysVcAYo7UPI_137,Is a negative square root an imaginary number?,MCQ,"•
0:00
In this video, I want to introduce you to the number i,
0:04
which is sometimes called the imaginary, imaginary unit
0:10
What you're gonna see here, and it might be a little bit difficult,
0:12
to fully appreciate, is that its a more bizzare number than
0:17
some of the other wacky numbers we learn in mathematics,
0:20
like pi, or e. And its more bizzare because it doesnt have a tangible value
0:25
in the sense that we normally, or are used to defining numbers.
0:29
""i"" is defined as the number whose square is equal to negative 1.
0:35
This is the definition of ""i"", and it leads to all sorts of interesting things.
0:44
Now some places you will see ""i"" defined this way;
0:46
""i"" as being equal to the principle square root of negative one.
0:50
I want to just point out to you that this is not wrong, it might make sense to you,
0:55
you know something squared is negative one, then maybe
0:57
its the principle square root of negative one.
1:00
And so these seem to be almost the same statement,
1:02
but I just want to make you a little bit careful, when you do this
1:04
some people will even go so far as to say this is wrong,
1:06
and it actually turns out that they are wrong to say that this is wrong.
1:09
But, when you do this you have to be a little bit careful about what it means
1:12
to take a principle square root of a negative number, and it being defined
1:16
for imaginary, and we'll learn in the future, complex numbers.
1:19
But for your understanding right now, you dont have to differentiate them,
1:22
you don't have to split hairs between any of these definitions.
1:26
Now with this definition, let us think about what these different powers of ""i"" are.
1:31
because you can imagine, if something squared is negative one,
1:33
if I take it to all sorts of powers, maybe that will give us weird things.
1:37
And what we'll see is that the powers of ""i"" are kind of neat,
1:40
because they kind of cycle, where they do cycle, through a whole set of values.
1:45
So I could start with, lets start with ""i"" to the zeroth power.
1:50
And so you might say, anything to the zeroth power is one,
1:53
so ""i"" to the zeroth power is one, and that is true.
1:57
And you could actually derive that even from this definition,
1:59
but this is pretty straight forward; anything to the zeroth power, including ""i"" is one.
2:03
Then you say, ok, what is ""i"" to the first power,
2:07
well anything to the first power is just that number times itself once.
2:11
So that's justgoing to be ""i"".
2:14
Really by the definition of what it means to take an exponent,
2:16
so that completely makes sense.
2:18
And then you have ""i"" to the second power.
2:19
""i"" to the second power, well by definition,
2:22
""i"" to the second power is equal to negative one.
2:29
Lets try ""i"" to the third power ill do this in a color i haven't used.
2:33
""i"" to the third power, well that's going to be ""i"" to the second power times ""i""
2:41
And we know that ""i"" to the second power is negative one,
2:44
so its negative one times ""i"" let me make that clear.
2:48
This is the same thing as this, which is the same thing as that,
2:51
""i"" squared is negative one.
2:52
So you multiply it out, negative one times ""i"" equals negative ""i"".
2:58
Now what happens when you take ""i"" to the fourth power,
3:01
I'll do it up here. ""i"" to the fourth power.
3:06
Well once again this is going to be ""i"" times ""i"" to the third power.
3:10
So that's ""i"" times ""i"" to the third power. ""i"" times ""i"" to the third power
3:14
Well what was ""i"" to the third power? ""i"" to the third power was negative ""i""
3:21
This over here is negative ""i"". And so ""i"" times ""i"" would get negative one,
3:28
but you have a negative out here, so its ""i"" times ""i"" is negative one,
3:31
and you have a negative, that gives you positive one.
3:35
Let me write it out. This is the same thing
3:37
as, so this is ""i"" times negative ""i"", which is the same thing as
3:43
negative one times, remember multiplication is commutative,
3:46
if you're multiplying a bunch of numbers you can just switch the order.
3:49
This is the same thing as negative one times ""i"" times ""i"".
3:52
""i"" times ""i"", by definition, is negative one.
3:55
Negative one times negative one is equal to positive one.
3:59
So ""i"" to the fourth is the same thing as ""i"" to the zeroth power.
4:02
Now lets try ""i"" to the fifth.
4:05
""i"" to the fifth power. Well that's just going to be ""i"" to to the fourth
4:09
times ""i"". And we know what ""i"" to the fourth is. It is one.
4:14
So its one times ""i"", or it is one times ""i"",
4:19
or it is just ""i"" again. So once again it is exactly the same thing
4:21
as ""i"" to the first power.
4:23
Lets try again just to see the pattern keep going.
4:25
Lets try ""i"" to the seventh power.
4:27
Sorry, ""i"" to the sixth power.
4:28
Well that's ""i"" times ""i"" to the fifth power, that's ""i"" times ""i"" to the fifth,
4:35
""i"" to the fifth we already established as just ""i"",
4:38
so its ""i"" times ""i"", it is equal to, by definition,""i"" times ""i"" is negative one.
4:44
And then lets finish off, well we could keep going on this way
4:47
We can keep putting high and higher powers of ""i"" here.
4:50
An we'll see that it keeps cycling back.
4:52
In the next video I'll teach you how taking an arbitrarily high power of ""i"",
4:56
how you can figure out what that's going to be.
4:58
But lets just verify that this cycle keeps going.
5:00
""i"" to the seventh power is equal to ""i"" times ""i"" to the sixth power.
5:06
""i"" to the sixth power is negative one. ""i"" times negative one is negative ""i"".
5:11
And if you take ""i"" to the eighth, once again it'll be one,
5:14
""i"" to the ninth will be ""i"" again, and so on and so forth.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,ysVcAYo7UPI,
khan_video_xks4cETlN58_6,"So if the gradient approaches zero, why doesn't the function sqrt(x) approach some number and have a horizontal asymtote as x approaches infinity?",Essay,"•
0:00
Let's say that f(x) is equal to x over the square root of x^2+1
0:09
and I want to think about the limit of f(x) as x approaches positive infinity
0:18
and the limit of f(x) as x approaches neagative infinity.
0:25
So let's think about what these are going to be.
0:28
Well, once again, and I'm not doing this in an ultra-rigorous way but more in an intuitive way
0:32
is to think about what this function approximately equals
0:36
as we get larger and larger and larger x'es.
0:38
This is the case if we're getting very positive x'es, in very positive infinity direction or very negative.
0:44
Still the absolute value of those x'es are very very very large as we approach positive infinity
0:48
or negative infinity.
0:50
Well, in the numerator we only have only 1 term -- we have this x term --
0:54
-- but in the denominator we have 2 terms under the radical here.
0:57
And as x gets larger and larger and larger either in the positive or the negative direction
1:01
this x squared term is going to really dominate this one
1:05
You can imagine, when x is 1 million, you're going to have a million squared plus one.
1:09
The value of the denominator is going to be dictated by this x squared term.
1:13
So this is going to be approximately equal to x over the square root of x squared.
1:22
This term right over here, the 1 isn't going to matter so much when we get very very very large x'es.
1:29
And this right over here -- x over the square root of x squared or x over the principle root of x squared --
1:34
-- this is going to be equal to x over --
1:37
-- if I square something and then take the principle root --
1:40
-- remember that the principle root is the positive square root of something --
1:43
-- then I'm essentially taking the absolute value of x.
1:45
This is going to be equal to x over the absolute value of x
1:49
for x approaches infinity or for x approaches negative infinity.
1:57
So, another way to say this, another way to restate these limits,
2:00
is as we approach infinity, this limit, we can restate it as the limit,
2:04
this is going to be equal to the limit as x approaches infinity of x over the absolute value of x.
2:11
Now, for positive x'es the absolute value of x is just going to be x.
2:15
This is going to be x divided by x, so this is just going to be 1.
2:19
Similarly, right over here, we take the limit as we go to negative infinity,
2:23
this is going to be the limit of x over the absolute value of x as x approaches negative infinity.
2:29
Remember, the only reason I was able to make this statement is that f(x) and this thing right over here
2:35
become very very similar, you can kind of say converge to each other,
2:39
as x gets very very very large or x gets very very very very negative.
2:45
Now, for negative values of x the absolute value of x is going to be positive,
2:50
x is obviously going to be negative and we're just going to get negative 1.
2:55
And so using this, we can actually try to graph our function.
3:01
So let's try to do that.
3:02
So let's say, that is my y axis,
3:06
this is my x axis,
3:10
and we see that we have 2 horizontal asymptotes.
3:13
We have 1 horizontal asymptote at y=1,
3:17
so let's say this right over here is y=1,
3:20
let me draw that line as dotted line,
3:23
we're going to approach this thing,
3:25
and then we have another horizontal asymptote at y=-1.
3:29
So that might be right over there, y=-1.
3:37
And if we want to plot at least 1 point we can think about what does f(0) equal.
3:41
So, f(0) is going to be equal to 0 over the square root of 0+1, or 0 squared plus 1.
3:50
Well that's all just going to be equal to zero.
3:53
So we have this point, right over here,
3:57
and we know that as x approaches infinity, we're approaching this blue, horizontal asymptote,
4:02
so it might look something like this.
4:06
Let me do it a little bit differently. There you go.
4:12
I'll clean this up. So it might look something like this.
4:16
That's not the color I wanted to use.
4:18
So it might look something like that.
4:25
We get closer and closer to that asymptote as x gets larger and larger
4:29
and then like this -- we get closer and closer to this asymptote as x approaches negative infinity.
4:38
I'm not drawing it so well.
4:39
So that right over there is y=f(x).
4:44
And you can verify this by taking a calculator, trying to plot more points
4:48
or using some type of graphing calculator or something.
4:50
But anyway, I just wanted to tackle another situation we're approaching infinity and or negative infinity
4:54
and we're trying to determine the horizontal asymptotes.
4:57
And remember, the key is just to say what terms dominate
5:01
as x approaches positive infinity or negative infinity.
5:05
To say, well, what is that function going to approach, and it's going to approach this horizontal asymptote
5:10
in the positive direction and this one in the negative.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,xks4cETlN58,
khan_video_za0QJRZ-yQ4_52,a domain is any real number?,MCQ,"•
0:00
Determine the domain and range
0:02
of the function f of x is equal to 3x squared plus 6x minus 2.
0:08
So, the domain of the function is: what is a set of all of the valid inputs,
0:12
or all of the valid x values for this function?
0:16
And, I can take any real number, square it, multiply it by 3,
0:19
then add 6 times that real number and then subtract 2 from it.
0:23
So essentially any number if we're talking about reals when we talk about any number.
0:27
So, the domain, the set of valid inputs, the set of
0:30
inputs over which this function is defined, is all real numbers.
0:35
So, the domain here is all real numbers.
0:44
And, for those of you who might say, well, you know, aren't all numbers real?
0:48
You may or may not know that there is a class of numbers,
0:50
that are a little bit bizarre when you first learn them,
0:53
called imaginary numbers and complex numbers.
0:56
But, I won't go into that right now.
0:57
But, most of the traditional numbers that you know of,
1:00
they are part of the set of real numbers.
1:02
It's pretty much everything but complex numbers.
1:05
So, you take any real number and you put it here,
1:07
you can square it, multiply it by 3, then add 6 times it and subtract 2.
1:11
Now, the range, at least the way we've been thinking about it
1:14
in this series of videos--
1:16
The range is set of possible, outputs of this function.
1:21
Or if we said y equals f of x on a graph, it's a set
1:26
of all the possible y values.
1:29
And, to get a flavor for this, I'm going to try to graph
1:31
this function right over here.
1:33
And, if you're familiar with quadratics--
1:35
and that's what this function is right over here, it is a quadratic--
1:38
you might already know that it has a parabolic shape.
1:41
And, so its shape might look something like this.
1:43
And, actually this one will look like this, it's upward opening.
1:46
But other parabolas have shapes like that.
1:48
And, you see when a parabola has a shape like this,
1:51
it won't take on any values below its vertex when it's upward opening,
1:55
and it won't take on any values above its vertex when it is downward opening.
1:59
So, let's see if we can graph this and maybe get a sense of its vertex.
2:04
There are ways to calculate the vertex exactly,
2:07
but let's see how we can think about this problem.
2:10
So, I'm gonna try some x and y values.
2:12
There's other ways to directly compute the vertex.
2:16
Negative b over 2a is the formula for it.
2:18
It comes straight out of the quadratic
2:19
formula, which you get from completing the square.
2:22
Lets try some x values and lets see what f of x is equal to.
2:27
So, let's try, well this the values we've been trying the last two videos.
2:30
What happens when x is equal to negative two?
2:33
Then f of x is 3 times negative 2 squared, which is 4, plus 6 times
2:39
negative 2, which is 6 times negative 2, so it's minus 12 minus 2.
2:44
So, this is 12 minus 12 minus 2.
2:48
So, it's equal to negative 2.
2:49
Now, what happens when x is equal to negative 1?
2:53
So, this is going to be 3 times negative 1 squared, which is just 1, minus, or I
2:59
should say plus 6 times negative 1 which is
3:02
minus 6 and then minus 2, and then minus 2.
3:07
So, this is 3 minus 6 is negative 3 minus
3:10
2 is equal negative 5, and that actually is the vertex.
3:14
And, you know the formula for the vertex, once again, is negative b over 2 a.
3:19
So, negative b.
3:20
That's the coefficient on this term right over here.
3:22
It's negative 6 over 2 times this one right over here, 2 times 3.
3:26
2 times 3, this is equal to negative 1.
3:30
So, that is the vertex, but let's just keep on going right over here.
3:34
So, what happens when x is equal to 0?
3:36
These first two terms are 0, you're just left with a negative 2.
3:40
When x is equal to positive 1.
3:42
And, this is where you can see that this
3:44
is the vertex, and you start seeing the symmetry.
3:46
If you go one above the vertex, f of x is equal to negative 2.
3:50
If you go one x value below the vertex, or below the x
3:53
value of the vertex, f of x is equal to negative 2 again.
3:56
But, let's just keep going.
3:58
We could try, let's do one more point over here.
4:01
So, we have, we could try, x is equal to 1.
4:04
When x is equal to 1, you have 3 times one squared which is 1.
4:09
So, 3 times 1 plus 6 times 1, which is just 6, minus 2.
4:14
So, this is 9 minus 2 it's equal to 7.
4:16
And, that I think is enough points to give
4:19
us a scaffold of what this graph will look like.
4:22
What the graph of the function would look like.
4:25
So, it would look something like this.
4:28
I do my best to draw it.
4:30
So, this is a x equals negative 2.
4:34
We draw the whole axis.
4:35
This is x is equal to negative 1, this is x is equal to, this is x is
4:40
equal to 0 and then this is x is equal to 1 right over there and then
4:45
when x is equal to, we go from negative 2 all the way to positive.
4:50
Or, we should go from negative 5 all the way to positive 7.
4:54
So, let's say this is negative 1,2,3,4,5.
5:00
That's negative five over there on the y axis,
5:03
y axis and then it will go to positive 7.
5:06
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
5:12
I could keep going, this is in the y, and we're going
5:15
to set y equal to whatever our output of the function is.
5:18
Y is equal to f of x.
5:20
And this is one right here.
5:22
So, lets plot the points.
5:23
You have the point negative 2, negative 2.
5:26
When x is negative 2, this is the x axis.
5:28
When x is negative 2, y is negative 2.
5:32
Y is negative 2 so that is that right over 3.
5:36
So, that is the point, that is the point negative 2, negative 2.
5:41
Fair enough?
5:42
Then, we have this point that we have this pink or purplish color.
5:47
Negative, when x is negative 1, f of x is negative 5.
5:49
When x is negative 1, f of x is negative 5.
5:53
And, we already said that this is the vertex.
5:54
And, you'll see the symmetry around it in a second.
5:56
So, this is the point negative 1, negative 5.
5:59
And then, with the point 0, negative 2.
6:03
0, negative when x is a 0, y is negative 2, for f' of x is negative
6:09
2 or f of 0 is negative 2, so this is the point 0, negative 2,
6:14
and then finally when x is equal to 1 and f of 1 is 7, f of 1 is 7.
6:20
So, that's right there it's a point 1, 7 and it gives us a
6:24
scaffold for what this parabola, what this curve will look like.
6:30
So, I'll try my best to draw it respectably.
6:34
So, it would look something, something like
6:37
that, and keep on going in that direction.
6:40
Keep on going in that direction.
6:42
But, I think you see the symmetry around the vertex.
6:45
That if you were to.
6:46
If you were to put a line right over here, the
6:47
two sides are kind of the mirror images of each other.
6:50
There, you can flip them over, and that's how we know it's the vertex.
6:53
And, that's how we also know, because this is an upward opening parabola, I
6:56
mean, there is formulas for vertex, and there are multiple ways of calculating it.
7:01
But, since it's an upward opening parabola, where
7:03
the vertex is going to be, the minimum point.
7:05
This is the minimum value that the parabola will take on.
7:08
So, going back to the original question, this is all for trying to figure out
7:12
the range, the set of y values, the set of outputs that this function can generate.
7:16
You see that the function, it can get as low as negative 5.
7:19
It got all the way down to negative 5 right at the vertex.
7:22
But, as you go to the right, as x values increase to
7:25
the right or decrease to the left, then the parabola goes upwards.
7:30
So, the parabola can never give you values--
7:32
f of x is never going to be less than negative 5.
7:36
So, our domain, but it can take on all the vaues.
7:37
It can keep on increasing forever as x gets
7:39
larger, x gets smaller farther away from the vertex.
7:42
So, our range, so we already said our domain is all real numbers.
7:46
Our range, the possible y values is all real
7:52
numbers greater than or equal to negative 5.
7:58
It can take on the value of any
8:00
real number greater than or equal to negative 5.
8:02
Nothing less than negative 5.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,za0QJRZ-yQ4,
khan_video_9ylUcCOTH8Y_70,So what is the definition of unit vector (notation)?,MCQ,"•
0:00
We've already seen that you can visually
0:02
represent a vector as an arrow, where the length of the arrow
0:06
is the magnitude of the vector and the direction of the arrow
0:10
is the direction of the vector.
0:12
And if we want to represent this mathematically,
0:15
we could just think about, well, starting
0:19
from the tail of the vector, how far
0:22
away is the head of the vector in the horizontal direction?
0:27
And how far away is it in the vertical direction?
0:29
So for example, in the horizontal direction,
0:32
you would have to go this distance.
0:37
And then in the vertical direction,
0:38
you would have to go this distance.
0:42
Let me do that in a different color.
0:44
You would have to go this distance right over here.
0:49
And so let's just say that this distance is 2
0:52
and that this distance is 3.
0:55
We could represent this vector-- and let's
0:56
call this vector v. We could represent vector
1:00
v as an ordered list or a 2-tuple of-- so we could say we
1:08
move 2 in the horizontal direction
1:11
and 3 in the vertical direction.
1:14
So you could represent it like that.
1:16
You could represent vector v like this,
1:19
where it is 2 comma 3, like that.
1:25
And what I now want to introduce you to--
1:27
and we could come up with other ways of representing
1:29
this 2-tuple-- is another notation.
1:32
And this really comes out of the idea
1:34
of what it means to add and scale vectors.
1:37
And to do that, we're going to define
1:39
what we call unit vectors.
1:45
And if we're in two dimensions, we
1:47
define a unit vector for each of the dimensions
1:49
we're operating in.
1:50
If we're in three dimensions, we would define a unit vector
1:53
for each of the three dimensions that we're operating in.
1:56
And so let's do that.
1:57
So let's define a unit vector i.
2:00
And the way that we denote that is the unit vector
2:04
is, instead of putting an arrow on top,
2:06
we put this hat on top of it.
2:09
So the unit vector i, if we wanted
2:11
to write it in this notation right over here,
2:14
we would say it only goes 1 unit in the horizontal direction,
2:18
and it doesn't go at all in the vertical direction.
2:21
So it would look something like this.
2:26
That is the unit vector i.
2:29
And then we can define another unit vector.
2:31
And let's call that unit vector--
2:33
or it's typically called j, which
2:37
would go only in the vertical direction and not
2:40
in the horizontal direction.
2:41
And not in the horizontal direction,
2:43
and it goes 1 unit in the vertical direction.
2:45
So this went 1 unit in the horizontal.
2:48
And now j is going to go 1 unit in the vertical.
2:54
So j-- just like that.
2:57
Now any vector, any two dimensional vector,
3:00
we can now represent as a sum of scaled up versions of i and j.
3:07
And you say, well, how do we do that?
3:09
Well, you could imagine vector v right here
3:13
is the sum of a vector that moves purely
3:15
in the horizontal direction that has a length 2,
3:18
and a vector that moves purely in the vertical direction that
3:21
has length 3.
3:23
So we could say that vector v-- let
3:28
me do it in that same blue color--
3:33
is equal to-- so if we want a vector that has length 2
3:36
and it moves purely in the horizontal direction,
3:39
well, we could just scale up the unit vector i.
3:42
We could just multiply 2 times i.
3:44
So let's do that-- is equal to 2 times our unit vector i.
3:49
So 2i is going to be this whole thing
3:52
right over here or this whole vector.
3:55
Let me do it in this yellow color.
3:56
This vector right over here, you could view as 2i.
4:00
And then to that, we're going to add 3 times j-- so plus 3 times
4:08
j.
4:11
Let me write it like this.
4:12
Let me get that color.
4:15
Once again, 3 times j is going to be
4:18
this vector right over here.
4:20
And if you add this yellow vector right over here
4:25
to the magenta vector, you're going to get-- notice,
4:29
we're putting the tail of the magenta vector
4:31
at the head of the yellow vector.
4:32
And if you start at the tail of the yellow vector
4:34
and you go all the way to the head of the magenta vector,
4:36
you have now constructed vector v. So vector v,
4:42
you could represent it as a column vector like this, 2 3.
4:46
You could represent it as 2 comma 3,
4:48
or you could represent it as 2 times i with this little hat
4:51
over it, plus 3 times j, with this little hat over it.
4:55
i is the unit vector in the horizontal direction,
4:57
in the positive horizontal direction.
4:59
If you want to go the other way, you
5:00
would multiply it by a negative.
5:02
And j is the unit vector in the vertical direction.
5:05
As we'll see in future videos, once you
5:07
go to three dimensions, you'll introduce a k.
5:11
But it's very natural to translate between these two
5:13
things.
5:13
Notice, 2, 3-- 2, 3.
5:16
And so with that, let's actually do some vector operations
5:19
using this notation.
5:21
So let's say that I define another vector.
5:24
Let's say it is vector b.
5:31
I'll just come up with some numbers here.
5:33
Vector b is equal to negative 1 times i-- times the unit vector
5:39
i-- plus 4 times the unit vector in the horizontal direction.
5:48
So given these two vector definitions,
5:50
what would the would be the vector v plus b be equal to?
5:57
And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it.
6:00
Well once again, we just literally
6:02
have to add corresponding components.
6:04
We could say, OK, well let's think
6:05
about what we're doing in the horizontal direction.
6:07
We're going 2 in the horizontal direction here,
6:09
and now we're going negative 1.
6:11
So our horizontal component is going
6:13
to be 2 plus negative 1-- 2 plus negative 1
6:20
in the horizontal direction.
6:22
And we're going to multiply that times the unit vector i.
6:24
And this, once again, just goes back
6:26
to adding the corresponding components of the vector.
6:30
And then we're going to have plus 4, or plus 3 plus 4-- And
6:36
let me write it that way-- times the unit vector
6:47
j in the vertical direction.
6:50
And so that's going to give us-- I'll
6:54
do this all in this one color-- 2 plus negative 1 is 1i.
6:59
And we could literally write that just as i.
7:01
Actually, let's do that.
7:02
Let's just write that as i.
7:03
But we got that from 2 plus negative 1 is 1.
7:05
1 times the vector is just going to be that vector,
7:08
plus 3 plus 4 is 7-- 7j.
7:15
And you see, this is exactly how we saw vector addition
7:19
in the past, is that we could also represent vector
7:22
b like this.
7:23
We could represent it like this-- negative 1, 4.
7:31
And so if you were to add v to b,
7:33
you add the corresponding terms.
7:35
So if we were to add corresponding terms, looking
7:39
at them as column vectors, that is
7:41
going to be equal to 2 plus negative 1, which is 1.
7:46
3 plus 4 is 7.
7:49
So this is the exact same representation as this.
7:52
This is using unit vector notation,
7:54
and this is representing it as a column vector.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,9ylUcCOTH8Y,
khan_video_ka8Yt4bTODs_41,"How do you draw Lewis structure and show VSEPR classification, 3-D structure + bond angles, molecular shape, and electron group geometry?",Essay,"•
0:01
Let's figure out the shape of the methane molecule
0:03
using VSEPR theory.
0:06
So the first thing that you do is draw a dot structure
0:08
to show it the valence electrons.
0:10
So for methane, carbon is in group four.
0:13
So 4 valence electrons.
0:14
Hydrogen is in group one, and I have four of them, so 1 times 4
0:18
is 4, plus 4 is 8 valence electrons
0:21
that we need to show in our dot structure.
0:23
Carbon goes in the center and carbon
0:25
is bonded to 4 hydrogens, so I can go ahead and put
0:28
my hydrogens in there like that.
0:30
And this is a very simple dot structure.
0:31
We've already shown all 8 of our valence electrons.
0:34
Let me go ahead and highlight those here.
0:35
2, 4, six, and 8.
0:38
So carbon has an octet and we are done.
0:41
The next thing we need to do is count the number
0:44
of electron clouds that surround our central atom.
0:48
So remember, electron clouds are regions of electron density,
0:52
all right?
0:52
So we can think about these bonding electrons
0:55
here as being electron clouds.
0:57
So that's one electron cloud.
0:58
Here's another one down here.
1:01
And then here's one.
1:02
And then finally, here's another one.
1:04
So we have four electron clouds surrounding our central atom.
1:08
The next step is to predict the geometry of your electron
1:11
clouds around your central atom.
1:13
And so VSEPR theory tells us that those valence electrons
1:17
are going to repel each other since they are negatively
1:19
charged.
1:20
And therefore, they're going to try
1:21
to get as far away from each other as they can in space.
1:24
And when you have four electron clouds,
1:26
the electron clouds are farthest away from each other
1:28
if they point towards the course of a tetrahedron, which
1:31
is a four sided figure.
1:33
So let me go ahead and draw the molecule here,
1:35
draw the methane molecule.
1:36
I'm going to attempt to show it in a tetrahedral geometry.
1:40
And then I'll actually show you what
1:41
a tetrahedron looks like here.
1:43
So here's a quick sketch of what the molecule sort of looks
1:46
like.
1:47
And let me go ahead and draw tetrahedron over
1:49
here so you can get a little bit better idea of the shape,
1:52
all right?
1:53
So four sided figure.
1:55
And so there you go.
1:56
Something like that.
1:57
So you could think about the corners of your tetrahedron
2:00
as being approximately where your hydrogens are
2:04
and that just gives you a little bit better visual picture
2:07
of that tetrahedron, that four sided figure here.
2:10
And so we've created the geometry of the electron clouds
2:13
around our central atom.
2:15
And in step four, we ignore any lone pairs
2:18
around our central atom, which we have none this time.
2:20
And so therefore, the geometry the molecule
2:22
is the same as the geometry of our electron pairs.
2:25
So we can say that methane is a tetrahedral molecule like that.
2:32
All right, in terms of bond angles.
2:34
So our goal now is to figure out what the bond angles are
2:38
in a tetrahedral molecule.
2:39
Turns out to be 109.5 degrees in space.
2:43
So that's having those bonding electrons
2:45
as far away from each other as they possibly
2:47
can using VSEPR theory.
2:50
So 109.5 degrees turns out to be the ideal bond
2:54
angle for a tetrahedral molecule.
2:57
Let's go ahead and do another one.
2:58
Let's look at ammonia.
3:00
So we have NH3.
3:02
First thing we need to do is draw the dot structure.
3:04
So we start by finding our valence electrons, nitrogen
3:08
in group five.
3:09
So 5 valence electrons.
3:11
Hydrogen in group one, and I have three of them.
3:13
So 1 times 3 plus 5 is 8.
3:15
So once again, we have 8 valence electrons to worry about.
3:19
We put nitrogen in the center and we
3:22
know nitrogen has bonded to 3 hydrogens,
3:25
so we go ahead and put our 3 hydrogens in there like that.
3:27
Let's see how many valence electrons we've used up so far.
3:30
2, 4, and 6.
3:33
So 8 minus 6 is 2 valence electrons left.
3:36
We can't put them on our terminal atoms,
3:38
because the hydrogens are already
3:39
surrounded by two electrons.
3:40
So we go ahead and put those two valence electrons
3:43
on our central atom, which is our nitrogen like that.
3:46
And so now we've gone ahead and represented those two valence
3:49
electrons.
3:50
So we have all eight valence electrons
3:52
shown for our dot structure.
3:54
All right, we go back up here to our steps
3:56
to remind us what to do after we've drawn our dot structure.
3:59
And we can see that now we're going
4:01
to think about the electron clouds that
4:03
surrounded the central atom.
4:05
So regions of electron density.
4:07
And let's go ahead and find those.
4:10
So I can see that I have these bonding electrons.
4:13
That's a region of electron density,
4:15
so that's an electron cloud.
4:17
Here's another one.
4:18
So that's two.
4:18
Here's another one.
4:19
So that's three.
4:21
And this lone pair of electrons, this non-bonding pair
4:25
of electrons is also going to be counted as an electron cloud.
4:28
It's a region of electron density too.
4:30
And so once again we have four regions of electron density.
4:35
When you're thinking about the geometry of those electron
4:39
clouds, those four electron clouds
4:41
are going to, once again, try to point
4:44
towards the corners of a tetrahedron.
4:45
So we can kind of sketch out the ammonia molecule.
4:48
And we can draw the base the same way we did before,
4:50
with our three hydrogens right here.
4:53
And then we're going to go ahead and put
4:55
our lone pair of electrons right up here.
4:58
And so again, it's an attempt to show the electron clouds
5:04
in a tetrahedral geometry.
5:06
Let's go back up here and look at our steps again.
5:10
So in step three, we predicted the geometry electron clouds
5:14
are going to attempt to be in a tetrahedron shape
5:16
around our central atom.
5:18
But when we're actually talking about the geometry or shape
5:20
of the molecule, we're going to ignore any lone pairs when
5:24
we predict the geometry of the molecule.
5:25
So when we look at the ammonia molecule,
5:27
we're going to ignore that lone pair of electrons
5:30
on top of the nitrogen and we're just
5:31
going to focus in on the bottom part for the shape here.
5:35
And so when we do that, we get something
5:37
that looks like a little squat pyramid here.
5:39
So if I'm [? ignoring ?] that lone pair of electrons
5:41
up there at the top, it's going to look something
5:44
like that for the shape.
5:47
And we call this trigonal pyramidal.
5:49
So this is a trigonal pyramidal shape.
5:57
So even though the electron clouds
6:00
are attempting to be in a tetrahedron fashion,
6:03
the shape is more trigonal pyramidal
6:04
because we ignore any lone pairs of electrons.
6:08
In terms of a bond angle, this lone pair
6:12
of electrons on the nitrogen actually occupies more space.
6:17
These non-bonding electrons occupy a little more space
6:19
than bonding electrons.
6:21
And because of that, those non-bonding electrons
6:24
are going to repel these bonding electrons.
6:27
I'm going to go ahead and put them
6:28
in blue here just as an example.
6:31
Repel these a little bit more than in the previous example
6:34
that we saw.
6:35
And that's actually going to make the bond
6:37
angle a little bit smaller than the ideal bonding angle
6:39
we saw before for 109.5 for a tetrahedral arrangement
6:43
of electron clouds.
6:45
And so it turns out that this bond angle between the atoms,
6:50
the hydrogen nitrogen hydrogen bond angle
6:52
gets a little bit smaller than 109.5.
6:55
So it actually gets smaller to approximately 107 degrees
6:59
here for a trigonal pyramidal situation.
7:02
All right, let's do one more.
7:05
Let's go ahead and do the water molecule.
7:07
All right, so we have H2O.
7:09
And to follow our steps, we know that hydrogen's in group one.
7:12
I have two of them.
7:13
And we know that oxygen is in group six.
7:16
So 6 plus 2 is once again 8 valence electrons
7:19
to represent for our dot structure.
7:21
And we put oxygen in the center.
7:24
Oxygen is bonded to two hydrogens,
7:26
so we go ahead and draw those in there.
7:28
And let's see, how many valence electrons have
7:30
we represented so far?
7:31
That's 2, that's 4.
7:33
So 8 minus 4 is 4 valence electrons left.
7:37
We first think about putting them on our terminal atoms,
7:39
but those are our hydrogens, so they're already
7:41
happy with two electrons.
7:42
So we go ahead and put those four valence electrons
7:45
on our central atom, which is our oxygen.
7:47
And four valence electrons means two lone pairs of electrons
7:51
now.
7:52
And so now we've represented all eight valence electrons
7:55
for water.
7:56
Our next step is, of course, to count how many electron clouds
8:00
we have around our central atom.
8:02
So once again, we could think about these bonding electrons
8:04
as being an electron cloud.
8:06
These bonding electrons as being electron cloud,
8:09
these non-bonding electrons as lone pairs in an electron
8:12
cloud, and same thing for these non-bonding electrons,
8:15
electron cloud over there as well.
8:17
And so once again we have four electron clouds.
8:20
And those four electron clouds are
8:22
going to attempt to be in a tetrahedral arrangement
8:25
around that central atom.
8:26
Using VSEPR theory, they're going to repel each other
8:29
and get as far away from each other as they possibly can.
8:35
Let me go and redraw the molecule here.
8:37
So let's go ahead.
8:38
And we have our water molecule and we
8:41
have our lone pairs of electrons like that.
8:45
And in this case we have two lone pairs of electrons.
8:48
Remember, lone pairs or non-bonding electrons take up
8:51
a little bit more space than bonding electrons.
8:54
And therefore, they're going to repel these electrons right
8:58
in here a little bit more.
9:00
And that's going to make our bond angle even smaller
9:03
than before.
9:04
So it's going to be even smaller than 107 degrees.
9:07
And so this bond angle right here,
9:09
you'll see it listed as approximately 104.5 degrees,
9:13
or some textbooks will say 105 degrees.
9:16
So that's approximately what it is for this.
9:18
In terms of the geometry of the molecule.
9:22
So the geometry of the electron clouds are attempting to be,
9:24
once again, a tetrahedral fashion,
9:26
but the geometry of the molecule is different
9:28
because you ignore lone pairs of electrons.
9:30
And so when you look at the shape,
9:32
if you look at the shape of this--
9:34
I'll go ahead and draw the shape over here.
9:36
If you're ignoring lone pairs of electrons, it looks like that.
9:38
And we've seen that shape before.
9:40
That's bent or angular.
9:42
So we say that the geometry of the water molecule
9:45
is bent or angular with an approximately 104.5 degree
9:51
bond angle.
9:52
So those are a couple examples of four electron clouds
9:56
and how to figure out the geometry while also

What I want to do in this video is
0:01
to show that if we start with any arbitrary triangle--
0:04
and this will be the arbitrary triangle that we're starting
0:07
with-- that we can always make this
0:10
the medial triangle of a larger triangle.
0:13
And when we say the medial triangle,
0:15
we mean that each of the vertices of this triangle
0:18
will be the midpoint of the sides of a larger triangle.
0:21
And I wanted to show that you can always construct that.
0:24
If you start with this triangle, you
0:25
can always have this be the medial triangle of a larger
0:29
triangle.
0:30
So to do that, let's draw a line that
0:33
goes through this point right over here,
0:35
but that's parallel to this line down here.
0:39
So this line and this line up here are going to be parallel.
0:44
So just like that.
0:46
And immediately we can start to say
0:47
some interesting things about the angles.
0:49
So if we have a transversal right over here,
0:53
we could view this side as a transversal of these two
0:55
parallel lines, or of this line in the segment.
0:58
We know that alternate interior angles are congruent.
1:01
So that angle is going to be congruent to that angle.
1:04
And we also know that this angle in blue,
1:07
is going to be congruent to that angle right over there.
1:10
Now, let's do that for the other two sides.
1:12
So let's create a line that is parallel
1:16
to this side of the triangle, but that
1:19
goes through this point right over here.
1:22
So let me draw it as well as possible.
1:27
And so these two characters are going to be parallel,
1:29
and you could always construct a line that's parallel
1:31
to another line that goes to a point that's not on that line.
1:35
And so once again, we can use alternate interior angles.
1:39
We know that if this angle right over here-- let's
1:42
say we have this orange angle-- it's alternate interior angle
1:45
is this angle right over there.
1:48
We also have corresponding angles.
1:50
This blue angle corresponds to this angle right over here.
1:55
So it will correspond to that angle right over there.
1:59
And now let's draw another line that is parallel
2:01
to this line right over here, but it
2:05
goes through this vertex.
2:06
It goes through the vertex that's opposite that line.
2:09
And so let me just draw it.
2:11
And you can always construct these parallel lines just
2:15
like that.
2:16
And let's see what happens.
2:17
So once again, these two lines are parallel.
2:19
So you could view this green line as a transversal.
2:21
If this green line is a transversal,
2:23
this corresponding angle is this angle right over here.
2:29
If we view this green line as a transversal of both
2:32
of these pink lines, then this angle
2:35
corresponds to this angle right over here.
2:39
If we view this yellow line as a transversal of both
2:42
of these pink lines-- actually, let's look at it this way.
2:47
View the pink line as a transversal of these two
2:50
yellow lines, then we know that this angle corresponds
2:53
to this angle right over here.
2:56
And if you view this yellow line as a transversal of these two
2:59
pink lines, then this angle corresponds
3:02
to this angle right over here.
3:06
And then the last thing we need to think about
3:11
is if we think about the two green parallel lines
3:18
and you view this yellow line as a transversal,
3:22
then this corresponding angle in orange is right over here.
3:27
This corresponds to that angle, because this yellow line
3:30
is a transversal on both of these green lines.
3:33
So what I've just shown starting with this inner triangle
3:37
right over here is that if I construct these parallel lines
3:40
in this way, that I now have four triangles
3:43
if I include the original one, and they're all
3:45
going to be similar to each other.
3:47
And we know that they're all similar
3:48
because they all have the exact same angles.
3:50
You just need two angles to prove similarity.
3:52
But all four of these triangles have the exact three angles.
3:55
Now, the other thing we can show is that they're congruent.
3:58
So all of these four are similar.
4:00
And we also know they're congruent.
4:01
For example, this side right over here in yellow
4:06
is the side in this triangle, between the orange
4:08
and the green side, is the side between the orange
4:11
and the green side on this triangle right over here.
4:13
So these two-- we have an angle, a side, and an angle.
4:18
Angle-side-angle congruency.
4:20
So these two are going to be congruent to each other.
4:23
Then over here, on this inner triangle,
4:26
our original triangle, the side that's
4:28
between the orange and the blue side
4:30
is going to be congruent to the side between the orange
4:33
and the blue side on that triangle.
4:35
Once again, we have angle-side-angle congruency.
4:37
So this is congruent to this, which is congruent to that.
4:40
All of these are going to be congruent.
4:42
And by the same exact argument, this middle triangle
4:49
is going to be congruent to this bottom triangle.
4:52
You have an angle, blue angle, purple side, green angle.
4:56
Blue angle, purple side, green angle.
4:59
They're congruent to each other.
5:00
So you have all of these triangles
5:02
are congruent to each other.
5:04
So their corresponding sides are equal.
5:06
So if you look at this triangle over here,
5:10
we know that the side between the blue angle
5:15
and the green angle is going to be
5:19
equal to this angle right over here.
5:21
Sorry, equal to this length.
5:24
So it's going to be equal to this length.
5:25
Between the blue and the green we
5:27
have this length, between the blue and the green
5:29
we have that length, between the blue and the green we
5:31
have that length right over there.
5:33
So you immediately see that this point-- and let me label it
5:35
now, maybe I should've labeled it before.
5:37
If we call that point A, we see that A
5:39
is the midpoint of-- let's call this point B,
5:44
and call this point C right over here.
5:46
So A is the midpoint of BC.
5:49
So that's fair enough.
5:50
So I was able to construct it in that way.
5:52
Now let's look at the other sides.
5:54
So this green side on all the triangles
5:56
is the side between the blue and the orange angle.
6:00
So between the blue and the orange angle,
6:02
you have the green side, between the blue and the orange angle
6:05
you have the green side.
6:07
So once again, this length is equal to this length.
6:10
And so if we call this point over here D,
6:13
and maybe this point over here E,
6:15
you see that D is the midpoint of BE.
6:18
And then finally, the yellow side
6:21
is between the green and the orange.
6:22
So between the green and the orange, we have a yellow side.
6:24
Between the green and the orange you have a yellow side.
6:27
All of these triangles are congruent.
6:28
So once again, let me call this F.
6:30
We see that F is the midpoint of EC.
6:35
So we've done what we wanted to do.
6:37
We've shown that if you start with any arbitrary
6:39
triangle, triangle ADF, we can construct a triangle BCE so
6:54
that ADF is triangle BCE's medial triangle.
7:05
And all that means is that the vertices of ADF
7:10
sit on the midpoints of BCE.
7:14
So you might say Sal, that by itself is interesting,
7:16
but what's the whole point of this?
7:18
The whole point of this is actually,
7:19
I wanted to use this fact that if you give me any triangle,
7:23
I can make it the medial triangle of the larger one
7:25
to prove that the altitudes of this triangle are concurrent.
7:29
And to see that, let me first draw the altitudes.
7:32
So an altitude from vertex A looks like this.
7:35
It starts at the vertex, goes to the opposite side,
7:37
and is perpendicular to the opposite side.
7:40
If I draw an altitude from vertex D,
7:42
it would look like this.
7:44
And if I draw an altitude from vertex F,
7:47
it will look like this.
7:49
And what I did, this whole set up of this video
7:51
is to show, to prove that these will always be concurrent.
7:57
And you might say, wait how do we
7:59
know that they are concurrent?
8:01
Well all you have to do is think about how
8:03
they interact with the larger triangle.
8:06
What are these altitudes to the larger triangle?
8:09
Well, this yellow altitude to the larger triangle.
8:12
Remember, these two yellow lines, line AD and line CE
8:16
are parallel.
8:17
So if this is a 90-degree angle, so its alternate interior angle
8:22
is also going to be 90 degrees.
8:23
So this right over here is perpendicular to CE,
8:27
and it bisects CE, because we know
8:29
that ADE is the medial triangle.
8:32
This is the midpoint.
8:33
So this right over here is perpendicular bisector.
8:36
This is a perpendicular bisector for the larger triangle,
8:42
for triangle BCE.
8:45
So this altitude for the smaller one
8:47
is a perpendicular bisector for the larger one.
8:49
We can do that for all of them.
8:51
If this angle right over here is 90 degrees,
8:53
then this angle right over there is
8:55
going to be 90 degrees, because this line is parallel to this,
8:58
this is a transversal, alternate interior angles are the same.
9:02
So this line right over here, this altitude of the smaller
9:05
triangle, it bisects right at the midpoint of the larger one,
9:09
on this side, and it's also a perpendicular bisector.
9:12
So it's a perpendicular bisector of the larger triangle.
9:15
And then finally, the same thing is
9:17
true of this altitude right over here.
9:19
It bisects this side of the larger
9:21
triangle at a 90-degree angle.
9:24
We know that because these two magenta lines the way
9:26
we constructed the larger triangle,
9:28
they're going to be parallel.
9:29
So once again, this is a perpendicular bisector.
9:32
So this whole reason, if you just give me any triangle,
9:36
I can take its altitudes and I know
9:38
that its altitude are going to intersect in one point.
9:40
They're going to be concurrent.
9:42
Because for any triangle, I can make it the medial triangle
9:45
of a larger one, and then it's altitudes
9:47
will be the perpendicular bisector for the larger
9:50
triangle.
9:50
And we already know that the perpendicular bisectors
9:53
for any triangle are concurrent.
9:55
They do intersect in exactly one point.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,aGwT2-RERXY,
khan_video_JVDrlTdzxiI_6,why do i need 4 equations for 4 unknowns?,MCQ,"•
0:00
I have here three linear equations of four unknowns.
0:03
And like the first video, where I talked about reduced
0:07
row echelon form, and solving systems of linear equations
0:10
using augmented matrices, at least my gut feeling says,
0:13
look, I have fewer equations than variables, so I probably
0:16
won't be able to constrain this enough.
0:18
Or maybe I'll have an infinite number of solutions.
0:20
But let's see if I'm right.
0:21
So let's construct the augmented matrix for this
0:24
system of equations.
0:27
My coefficients on the x1 terms are 1, 1, and 2.
0:33
Coefficients on the x2 are 2, 2, and 4.
0:38
Coefficients on x3 are 1, 2, and 0.
0:43
There's of course no x3 term, so we can view it as a 0
0:46
coefficient.
0:47
Coefficients on the x4 are 1, minus 1, and 6.
0:53
And then on the right-hand side of the equals sign, I
0:56
have 8, 12, and 4.
1:00
There's my augmented matrix, now let's put this guy into
1:04
reduced row echelon form.
1:08
The first thing I want to do is, I want to zero out these
1:10
two rows right here.
1:12
So what can we do?
1:14
I'm going to keep my first row the same for now, so it's 1,
1:18
2, 1, 1, 8.
1:23
That line essentially represents my equals sign.
1:28
What I can do is, let me subtract-- let me replace the
1:30
second row with the second row minus the first row.
1:35
So 1 minus 1 is 0, 2 minus 2 is 0, 2 minus 1 is 1, 1--
1:45
negative 1 minus 1 is minus 2, and then 12 minus 8 is 4.
1:54
There you go, that looks good so far, it looks like column,
1:58
or x2 which is represented by column two, looks like it
2:00
might be a free variable, but we're not 100% sure yet.
2:04
Let's do all of our rows.
2:07
So let's take-- to get rid of this guy right here, let's
2:11
replace our third equation with the third equation minus
2:14
two times our first equation.
2:17
So we get 2 minus 2 times 1 is 0, 4 minus 2 times 2, well
2:26
that's 0, 0 minus 2 times 1, that's minus 2.
2:35
6 minus 2 times 1, well that's 4, right?
2:40
6 minus 2.
2:41
And then 4 minus 2 times 8, is minus 16, 4
2:47
minus 16 is minus 12.
2:52
Now what can we do?
2:53
Well, let's see if we can get rid of this minus
2:56
2 term right there.
2:58
So let me rewrite my augmented matrix.
3:03
I'm going to keep row two the same this time, so I get a 0,
3:07
0, 1, minus 2, and essentially my equals sign, or the
3:12
augmented part of the matrix.
3:15
And now let's see what I can do.
3:17
Let me get rid of this 0 up here, because I want to get
3:19
into reduced row echelon form.
3:21
So any of my pivot entries, which are always going to have
3:24
the coefficient 1, or the entry 1, it should be the only
3:26
non-zero term in my row.
3:28
How do I get rid of this one here?
3:30
Well I can subtract-- I can replace row one with row 1
3:35
minus row 2.
3:38
So 1 minus 0 is 1, 2 minus 0 is 2, 1 minus 1 is 0, 1 minus
3:48
minus 2, that's 1 plus 2, which is 3.
3:52
And then 8 minus 4 is 4.
3:56
And now how can I get rid of this guy?
3:59
Well let me replace row 3 with row 3 plus 2 times row 1.
4:06
Sorry, with row 3 plus 2 times row 2.
4:09
Right?
4:10
Because then you'd have minus 2, plus 2 times this, and
4:12
they'd cancel out.
4:13
So let's see the zeros.
4:15
0 plus 2 times 0, that's 0.
4:18
0 plus 2 times 0, that's 0, minus 2 plus 2 times 1 is 0.
4:26
4 plus 2 times minus 2, that's 4 minus 4, that's 0.
4:35
And then I have minus 12, plus 2 times 4.
4:40
That's minus 12 plus 8, that's minus 4.
4:47
Now, this is interesting right now-- this is interesting.
4:49
I have essentially put this in reduced row echelon form.
4:53
I have two pivot entries, that's a pivot entry right
4:56
there, and that's a pivot entry right there.
4:59
They're the only non-zero term in their respective columns.
5:03
And this is just kind of a style issue, but this pivot
5:05
entry is in a lower row than that one.
5:08
So it's in a column to the right of this one right there.
5:12
And I just inspected, this looks like a-- this column two
5:16
looks kind of like a free variable-- there's no pivot
5:19
entry there, no pivot entry there.
5:20
But let's see, let's map this back to
5:22
our system of equations.
5:24
These are just numbers to me and I just kind of
5:26
mechanically, almost like a computer, put this in reduced
5:29
row echelon form.
5:31
Actually, almost exactly like a computer.
5:32
But let me put it back to my system of linear equations, to
5:35
see what our result is.
5:37
So we get 1 times x1, let me write it in yellow.
5:41
So I get 1 times x1, plus 2 times x2, plus 0 times x3,
5:50
plus 3 times x4 is equal to 4.
5:55
Obviously I could ignore this term right there, I didn't
5:57
even have to write it.
5:58
Actually.
5:59
I'm not going to write that.
5:59
Then I get 0 times x1, plus 0 times x2, plus 1 times x3, so
6:05
I can just write that.
6:05
I'll just write the one.
6:06
1 times x3, minus 2 times x4, is equal to 4.
6:12
And then this last term, what do I get?
6:14
I get 0 x1, plus 0 x2 plus 0 x3 plus 0 x4, well, all of
6:19
that's equal to 0, and I've got to write something on the
6:21
left-hand side.
6:22
So let me just write a 0, and that's got to be
6:25
equal to minus 4.
6:27
Well this doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
6:31
0 equals minus 4.
6:33
This is this is a nonsensical constraint, this is
6:36
impossible.
6:37
0 can never equal minus 4.
6:40
This is impossible.
6:46
Which means that it is essentially impossible to find
6:49
an intersection of these three systems of equations, or a
6:53
solution set that satisfies all of them.
6:56
When we looked at this initially, at the beginning of
6:58
the of the video, we said there are only three
7:00
equations, we have four unknowns, maybe there's going
7:02
to be an infinite set of solutions.
7:03
But turns out that these three-- I guess you can call
7:07
them these three surfaces-- don't intersect in r4.
7:11
Right?
7:11
These are all four dimensional, we're dealing in
7:14
r4 right here, because we have-- I guess each vector has
7:19
four components, or we have four variables, is the way you
7:22
could think about it.
7:23
And it's always hard to visualize things in r4.
7:26
But if we were doing things in r3, we can imagine the
7:29
situation where, let's say we had two planes in r3.
7:34
So that's one plane right there, and then I had another
7:36
completely parallel plane to that one.
7:39
So I had another completely parallel plane
7:42
to that first one.
7:43
Even though these would be two planes in r3, so let me give
7:47
an example.
7:47
So let's say that this first plane was represented by the
7:51
equation 3x plus 6y plus 9z is equal to 5, and the second
8:02
plane was represented by the equation 3x plus 6y plus 9z is
8:08
equal to 2.
8:11
These two planes in r3-- this is the case of r3, so this is
8:15
r3 right here.
8:17
These two planes, clearly they'll never intersect.
8:19
Because obviously this one has the same coefficients adding
8:23
up to 5, this one has the same coefficient adding up to 2.
8:26
And when, if we just looked at this initially, if it wasn't
8:28
so obvious, we would have said, we have only two
8:31
equations with three unknowns, maybe this has an infinite set
8:33
of solutions.
8:34
But it won't be the case, because you can actually just
8:36
subtract this equation, from the bottom equation, from the
8:39
top equation.
8:40
And what do you get?
8:41
You would get a very familiar-- so if you just
8:44
subtract the bottom equation from the top equation, and you
8:46
get 3x minus 3x, 6y minus 6y, 9z minus 9z-- actually, let me
8:50
do it right here.
8:51
So for that minus that, you get zero is equal to 5 minus
8:55
2, which is 3.
8:56
Which is a very similar result that we got up there.
8:59
So when you have two parallel planes, in this case in r3, or
9:03
really to any kind of two parallel equations, or a set
9:07
of parallel equations, they won't intersect.
9:08
And you're going to get, when you put it in reduced row
9:12
echelon form, or you just do basic elimination, or you
9:14
solve the systems, you're going to get a statement that
9:17
zero is equal to something, and that means that there are
9:19
no solutions.
9:23
So the general take-away, if you have zero equals
9:26
something, no solutions.
9:27
If you have the same number of pivot variables, the same
9:31
number of pivot entries as you do columns, so if you get the
9:36
situations-- let me write this down, this is good to know.
9:39
if you have zero is equal to anything, then
9:41
that means no solution.
9:44
If you're dealing with r3, then you probably have
9:46
parallel planes, in r2 you're dealing with parallel lines.
9:50
If you have the situation where you have the same number
9:55
of pivot entries as columns, so it's just 1, 1, 1, 1, this
10:02
is the case of r4 right there.
10:05
I think you get the idea.
10:07
That equals a, b, c, d.
10:10
Then you have a unique solution.
10:15
Now if, you have any free variables-- so free variables
10:19
look like this, so let's say we have 1, 0, 1, 0, and then I
10:23
have the entry 1, 1, let me be careful.
10:30
0, let me do it like this.
10:33
1, 0, 0, and then I have the entry 1, 2, and then I have a
10:41
bunch of zeroes over here.
10:43
And then this has to equal zero-- remember, if this was a
10:45
bunch of zeroes equaling some variable, then I would have no
10:47
solution, or equalling some constant, let's say this is
10:50
equal to 5, this is equal to 2.
10:52
If this is our reduced row echelon form that we
10:55
eventually get to, then we have a few free variables.
10:58
This is a free, or I guess we could call this column a free
11:02
column, to some degree this one would be too.
11:04
Because it has no pivot entries.
11:07
These are the pivot entries.
11:09
So this is variable x2 and that's variable x4.
11:13
Then these would be free, we can set
11:14
them equal to anything.
11:16
So then here we have unlimited solutions,
11:19
or no unique solutions.
11:21
And that was actually the first example we saw.
11:23
And these are really the three cases that you're going to see
11:25
every time, and it's good to get familiar with them so
11:27
you're never going to get stumped up when you have
11:29
something like 0 equals minus 4, or 0 equals 3.
11:32
Or if you have just a bunch of zeros and a bunch of rows.
11:35
I want to make that very clear.
11:36
Sometimes, you see a bunch of zeroes here, on the left-hand
11:40
side of the augmented divide, and you might say, oh maybe I
11:44
have no unique solutions, I have an
11:45
infinite number of solutions.
11:46
But you have to look at this entry right here.
11:50
Only if this whole thing is zero and you have free
11:52
variables, then you have an infinite number of solutions.
11:56
If you have a statement like, 0 is equal to a, if this is
11:59
equal to 7 right here, then all of the sudden you would
12:01
have no solution to this.
12:03
That you're dealing with parallel surfaces.

0:01
In the last video, we saw the classification of elements
0:04
into groups on the periodic table,
0:05
and we stopped with the definition
0:07
for a transition metal.
0:09
There are two ways to think about transition metals.
0:11
So one way to think about it would be when some teachers say
0:14
transition metal, they're talking
0:16
about elements found from Groups 3 through Group 12.
0:20
So all the elements in here, some people
0:23
consider these to be the transition metals.
0:25
So these are the elements found in the d block, right?
0:28
So we're talking about d orbitals here.
0:30
So you have to understand electron configurations
0:34
for this video.
0:35
So that's one way to think about the transition metals,
0:38
but that way is maybe a little bit too general sometimes.
0:41
So there is another definition, which
0:42
you'll find in the IUPAC website.
0:44
IUPAC is an acronym for International Union of Pure
0:48
and Applied Chemistry, and they say that a transition element
0:52
refers to an element whose atom has an incomplete d subshell.
0:58
So when you're talking about the d orbitals,
1:01
we already know there are five d orbitals,
1:03
and each orbital holds a maximum of two electrons.
1:06
So 5 times 2 is 10.
1:08
So 10 will be the maximum number of electrons
1:10
that you could fit in your d orbitals, or your d subshells.
1:13
So let's count that out on our periodic table so 10, so 1, 2,
1:17
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 for our d block.
1:23
So let's go ahead and write an electron configuration
1:27
for a transition metal and let's see
1:28
how that applies to our definition from IUPAC.
1:32
So let's write an electron configuration for iron.
1:36
So here's iron right here.
1:38
And if I wanted to write an electron configuration,
1:40
let's say I wanted to do noble gas notation.
1:42
So once again, I'm assuming that you know how to do this already
1:45
so I won't spend too much time talking about it.
1:48
But if I want to write a noble gas configuration,
1:51
I would go to argon, which is the noble gas before iron,
1:55
and I would put argon in brackets like that.
1:58
And that takes me to the fourth energy level
2:00
or the fourth period on the periodic table.
2:03
And then just looking at the periodic table,
2:05
I can say, oh, that would be 4s1, 4s2,
2:07
so I can write 4s2 here.
2:10
And then I'm in my d orbitals.
2:13
So, again, just looking at the periodic table
2:15
to write my electron configuration,
2:18
I would say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 electrons.
2:23
So that would be 3d6.
2:26
And I could have written this 3d6 4s2.
2:31
And right now, both are considered
2:33
to be correct answers.
2:34
And I won't get into a discussion
2:38
about the order of filling of these orbitals in this videos.
2:40
So I'll save that for another video.
2:42
This video is only talking about definitions
2:44
and identifying elements on the periodic table.
2:47
And so either one of these would be a correct electron
2:50
configuration.
2:51
And when I look at the d orbitals for the electron
2:56
configuration, I can see that there
2:57
are six electrons in my d orbitals.
3:00
Well, that's an incomplete d subshell,
3:03
because I can fit a total of 10 into my d orbitals.
3:06
And so iron would be an example of an element whose atom
3:10
has an incomplete d subshell.
3:12
So iron is a transition metal.
3:15
Let's write the electron configuration for zinc.
3:18
So let's find zinc over here, so right there
3:20
on pour periodic table.
3:21
So if I wanted to write the electron configuration
3:23
for zinc, once again, I would go to the noble gas
3:28
before it, which is argon.
3:30
So I would put in brackets argon right here.
3:33
And then, once again, it takes me to the fourth energy level.
3:36
So 4s1, 4s2, so 4s2.
3:40
And then I count over for my d electrons-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
3:45
7, 8, 9, and 10.
3:48
So it would be 3d10.
3:50
And once again, I could have written
3:51
that argon in brackets 3d10 4s2.
3:57
So it doesn't matter.
4:00
So let's think about the definition
4:02
for a transition metal, an element
4:04
whose atom has an incomplete d subshell.
4:07
Well, if I look at the d orbitals for zinc,
4:11
they are completely full.
4:12
I have 10 electrons in my d orbital,
4:15
and so this is a complete d subshell.
4:17
So this does not meet the definition
4:19
for a transition element.
4:21
Now, also in the definition, it talks about cations.
4:25
So let's think about to the cation that zinc would form.
4:27
Zinc would go to zinc 2 plus.
4:30
So if I wanted to write the electron configuration for zinc
4:33
2 plus, I need to think about where does zinc
4:37
lose two electrons?
4:39
So if you've going from a neutral atom of zinc
4:41
to zinc 2 plus, you would have to lose two electrons.
4:44
Well, I already know that those two electrons
4:46
are going to be lost from the 4s orbitals.
4:49
So we're going to lose these two electrons right here
4:52
on your electron configuration, and so you'd be left with 3d10.
4:55
And once again, you have a cation
4:58
that has a complete d subshell.
5:00
You've completely filled your d orbitals,
5:02
and so the cation does not have an incomplete d subshell, which
5:06
means that it doesn't fit our technical definition
5:09
for a transition element from IUPAC.
5:11
And so, once again, there are two ways of thinking about it.
5:14
One's a very general way.
5:16
So you might hear someone talk about an element from Groups 3
5:19
through to 12 as being a transition metal,
5:22
or you might find people who are a little bit more
5:24
particular about the definition, who go along with IUPAC.
5:29

0:00
In this video we're going to talk about another way of
0:03
visualizing data called the histogram, which is a very
0:09
fancy word for a not so fancy thing.
0:14
I think it's probably fair to say that the histogram is the
0:18
most used way of representing statistical data.
0:22
Let me just show you how to figure out a histogram for
0:25
some data, and I think you're going to get the
0:26
point pretty easily.
0:28
So I have some data here and I want to
0:30
represent it with a histogram.
0:33
What we're going to see is how frequent are
0:35
each of these numbers.
0:37
And in order to figure that out, let me just write the
0:39
numbers down, let me just categorize them in their
0:41
respective buckets.
0:43
So I have a 1 here.
0:48
I have a 4, so I want to leave space for the 2, the 3, and
0:54
put a 4 there.
0:55
I have a 2.
0:57
I have a 1.
0:59
Let me put that 1 on a stack right above that 1.
1:02
I have a 0-- let me put the 0 to the left of the 1.
1:06
I want to put them in order.
1:08
I have a 2, another 2.
1:10
Let me stack that above my first 2.
1:12
I have another 1.
1:14
Let me stack that above my other two 1's.
1:16
I have another 0.
1:17
Let me stack it there.
1:20
I have another 1.
1:24
Then I have another 2.
1:27
Another 1.
1:29
I have two more 0's.
1:32
0, 0.
1:33
I have two more 2's.
1:37
I have a 3.
1:41
I have two more 1's.
1:44
Another 3.
1:46
And then I have a 6.
1:49
So no 5's, and then I have a 6.
1:52
And that space right there was unnecessary.
1:54
But right here I've listed-- I've just rewritten those
1:56
numbers and I've essentially categorized them.
1:58
Now what I want to do is calculate how many of each of
2:01
these numbers we have. So let me go down here.
2:06
So I want to look at the frequency of
2:08
each of these numbers.
2:12
So I have one, two, three, four 0's.
2:16
I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven 1's.
2:20
I have one, two, three, four, five 2's.
2:24
I have one, two 3's.
2:26
I have one 4, and one 6.
2:31
So we could write it this way.
2:32
We could write the number, and then we
2:37
can have the frequency.
2:43
So I have the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4-- we could even throw 5
2:49
in there, although 5 has a frequency of 0.
2:52
And we have a 6.
2:53
So the 0 showed up four times in this data set.
2:57
1 showed up seven times in this data set.
3:01
2 showed up five times, 3 showed up to two times, 4
3:08
showed up one time, 5 didn't show up, and 6
3:12
showed up one time.
3:13
All I did is I counted this data set, and I did this
3:16
first. But you could say how many times do I see a 0?
3:18
I see it one, two, three, four times.
3:21
How many times do I see a 1?
3:22
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven times.
3:27
That's what we mean by frequency.
3:29
Now a histogram is really just a plot, kind of a bar graph,
3:34
plotting the frequency of each of these numbers.
3:36
It's going to look a lot like this original
3:38
thing that I drew.
3:40
So let me draw some axes here.
3:44
So the different buckets here are the numbers.
3:46
And that worked out because we're dealing with very clean
3:47
integers that tend to repeat.
3:49
If you're dealing with things that the exact number doesn't
3:54
repeat, oftentimes people will put the numbers
3:56
into buckets or ranges.
3:58
But here they fit into nice little buckets.
4:00
You have the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
4:08
This is the actual numbers.
4:09
And then on the vertical axis we're
4:11
going to plot the frequency.
4:15
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
4:20
So that's 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
4:25
So 0 shows up four times.
4:28
So we'll draw a little bar graph here.
4:29
0 shows up four times.
4:31
Draw it just like that.
4:34
0 shows up four times.
4:36
That is that information right there.
4:40
1 shows up seven times.
4:44
So I'll do a little bar graph.
4:45
1 shows up seven times.
4:48
Just like that.
4:50
I want to make it a little bit straighter than that-- 1 shows
4:53
up seven times.
4:58
2-- I'll do it in a different color-- 2 shows up five times.
5:06
Do a bar graph, go all the way up to five.
5:10
2 shows up five times.
5:12
3 shows up two times.
5:20
We have one 3, two 3's.
5:24
4 shows up one time here.
5:31
5 doesn't show up at all.
5:33
So it doesn't even get any height there.
5:37
And then finally, 6 shows up one time.
5:44
So I'll do 6 showing up one time.
5:47
What I just plotted here, this is a histogram.
5:51
This right here is a histogram.
5:53
Very fancy word, but I think you will agree it's a fairly
5:56
simple idea.

khan_video_CecgFWTg9pQ_8,"I mean, can we regard those sequences as geometric progression which have their range in the set of complex numbers?",Essay,"•
0:00
In the last video we saw that a geometric progression,
0:02
or a geometric sequence, is just a sequence where
0:05
each successive term is the previous term multiplied
0:08
by a fixed value.
0:10
And we call that fixed value the common ratio.
0:12
So, for example, in this sequence right over here,
0:14
each term is the previous term multiplied by 2.
0:18
So 2 is our common ratio.
0:21
And any non-zero value can be our common ratio.
0:26
It can even be a negative value.
0:27
So, for example, you could have a geometric sequence
0:31
that looks like this.
0:32
Maybe start at one, and maybe our common ratio,
0:37
let's say it's negative 3.
0:39
So 1 times negative 3 is negative 3.
0:41
Negative 3 times negative 3 is positive 9.
0:45
Positive 9 times negative 3 is negative 27.
0:49
And then negative 27 times negative 3 is positive 81.
0:53
And you could keep going on and on and on.
0:56
What I now want to focus on in this video
0:58
is the sum of a geometric progression
1:00
or a geometric sequence, and we would call that
1:03
a geometric series.
1:06
Let's scroll down a little bit.
1:08
So now we're going to talk about geometric series, which
1:15
is really just the sum of a geometric sequence.
1:17
So, for example, a geometric series
1:20
would just be a sum of this sequence.
1:22
So if we just said 1 plus negative 3,
1:31
plus 9, plus negative 27, plus 81,
1:36
and we were to go on, and on, and on,
1:38
this would be a geometric series.
1:41
And we could do it with this one up here
1:43
just to really make it clear of what we're doing.
1:45
So if we said 3 plus 6, plus 12, plus 24, plus 48,
1:51
this once again is a geometric series, just
1:54
the sum of a geometric sequence or a geometric progression.
1:59
So how would we represent this in general terms and maybe
2:01
using sigma notation?
2:03
Well, we'll start with whatever our first term is.
2:06
And over here if we want to speak in general terms
2:08
we could call that a, our first term.
2:11
So we'll start with our first term, a, and then
2:17
each successive term that we're going to add
2:19
is going to be a times our common ratio.
2:22
And we'll call that common ratio r.
2:24
So the second term is a times r.
2:26
Then the third term, we're just going
2:28
to multiply this one times r.
2:30
So it's going to be a times r squared.
2:35
And then we can keep going, plus a times r to the third power.
2:43
And let's say we're going to do a finite geometric series.
2:46
So we're not going to just keep on going forever.
2:48
Let's say we keep going all the way
2:50
until we get to some a times r to the n.
2:58
a times r to the n-th power.
3:03
So how can we represent this with sigma notation?
3:05
And I encourage you to pause the video and try it on your own.
3:09
Well, we could think about it this way.
3:13
And I'll give you a little hint.
3:15
You could view this term right over here as a times r
3:17
to the 0.
3:18
And let me write it down.
3:20
This is a times r to the 0.
3:21
This is a times r to the first, r squared,
3:24
r third, and now the pattern might be emerging for you.
3:27
So we can write this as the sum, so capital sigma
3:32
right over here.
3:33
We can start our index at 0.
3:35
So we could say from k equals 0 all the way to k
3:50
equals n of a times r to the k-th power.
4:13
And so this is, using sigma notation,
4:15
a general way to represent a geometric series where
4:19
r is some non-zero common ratio.
4:23
It can even be a negative value.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,CecgFWTg9pQ,

0:00
What I want to do in this video is
0:01
think about the antiderivative of 1/x.
0:05
Or another way of thinking about it, another way of writing it ,
0:07
is the antiderivative of x to the negative 1 power.
0:10
And we already know, if we somehow
0:12
try to apply that anti-power rule,
0:14
that inverse power rule over here,
0:15
we would get something that's not defined.
0:17
We would get x to the 0 over 0, doesn't make any sense.
0:20
And you might have been saying, OK, well, I
0:22
know what to do in this case.
0:24
When we first learned about derivatives,
0:25
we know that the derivative-- let
0:27
me do this in yellow-- the derivative with respect
0:29
to x of the natural log of x is equal to 1 over x.
0:36
So why can't we just say that the antiderivative
0:39
of this right over here is equal to the natural log of x plus c?
0:45
And this isn't necessarily wrong.
0:47
The problem here is that it's not broad enough.
0:50
When I say it's not broad enough,
0:52
is that the domain over here, for our original function
0:55
that we're taking the antiderivative of,
0:57
is all real numbers except for x equals 0.
1:00
So over here, x cannot be equal to 0.
1:04
While the domain over here is only positive numbers.
1:08
So over here, x, so for this expression,
1:12
x has to be greater than 0.
1:15
So it would be nice if we could come up
1:17
with an antiderivative that has the same domain as the function
1:21
that we're taking the antiderivative of.
1:23
So it would be nice if we could find an antiderivative that
1:26
is defined everywhere that our original function is.
1:29
So pretty much everywhere except for x equaling 0.
1:33
So how can we rearrange this a little bit
1:36
so that it could be defined for negative values as well?
1:39
Well, one one possibility is to think
1:41
about the natural log of the absolute value of x.
1:49
So I'll put little question mark here,
1:51
just because we don't really know
1:52
what the derivative of this thing is going to be.
1:54
And I'm not going to rigorously prove it here,
1:56
but I'll I will give you kind of the conceptual understanding.
1:59
So to understand it, let's plot the natural log of x.
2:03
And I had done this ahead of time.
2:04
So that right over there is roughly
2:06
what the graph of the natural log of x looks like.
2:09
So what would the natural log of the absolute value
2:11
of x is going to look like?
2:13
Well, for positive x's, it's going to look just like this.
2:17
For positive x's you take the absolute value of it,
2:20
it's just the same thing as taking that original value.
2:22
So it's going to look just like that for positive x's.
2:25
But now this is also going to be defined for negative x's.
2:28
If you're taking the absolute value of negative 1,
2:31
that evaluates to just 1.
2:33
So it's the natural log of 1, so you're going to be right there.
2:36
As you get closer and closer and closer to 0
2:40
from the negative side, you're just
2:42
going to take the absolute value.
2:43
So it's essentially going to be exactly this curve
2:45
for the natural log of x, but the left side
2:48
of the natural log of the absolute value of x
2:50
is going to be its mirror image, if you were to reflect around
2:53
the y-axis.
2:53
It's going to look something like this.
2:59
So what's nice about this function
3:01
is you see it's defined everywhere, except for-- I'm
3:06
trying to draw it as symmetrically as possible--
3:09
except for x equals 0.
3:11
So if you combine this pink part and this part on the right,
3:15
if you combine both of these, you
3:19
get y is equal to the natural log of the absolute value of x.
3:27
Now let's think about its derivative.
3:29
Well, we already know what the derivative of the natural log
3:32
of x is, and for positive values of x.
3:35
So let me write this down.
3:36
For x is greater than 0, we get the natural log
3:41
of the absolute value of x is equal to the natural log of x.
3:46
Let me write this.
3:47
Is equal to the natural log of x.
3:53
And we would also know, since these two are
3:55
equal for x is greater than 0, the derivative
4:00
of the natural log of the absolute value of x
4:02
is going to be equal to the derivative of the natural log
4:08
of x.
4:12
Which is equal to 1/x for x greater than 0.
4:16
So let's plot that.
4:18
I'll do that in green.
4:19
It's equal to 1/x.
4:21
So 1/x, we've seen it before.
4:22
It looks something like this.
4:26
So let me do my best attempt to draw it.
4:29
It has both vertical and horizontal asymptotes.
4:33
So it looks something like this.
4:37
So this right over here is 1/x x is greater than 0.
4:42
So this is 1/x when x is greater than 0.
4:46
So all it's saying here, and you can see pretty clearly,
4:49
is the slope right over here, the slope of the tangent line
4:52
is 1.
4:53
And so you see that when you look
4:54
at the derivative, the slope right over here,
4:56
the derivative should be equal to 1 here.
4:58
When you get close to 0, you have
5:00
a very, very steep positive slope here.
5:04
And so you see you have a very high value for its derivative.
5:07
And then as you move away from 0, it's still steep.
5:11
But it becomes less and less and less steep
5:13
all the way until you get to 1.
5:15
And then it keeps getting less and less and less steep.
5:19
But it never quite gets to absolutely flat slope.
5:22
And that's what you see its derivative doing.
5:25
Now what is the natural log of absolute value
5:27
of x doing right over here?
5:28
When we are out here, our slope is very close to 0.
5:34
It's symmetric.
5:34
The slope here is essentially the negative of the slope here.
5:38
I could do it maybe clearer, showing it right here.
5:40
Whatever the slope is right over here,
5:44
it's the exact negative of whatever
5:45
the slope is at a symmetric point on the other side.
5:49
So if on the other side, the slope is right over here,
5:52
over here it's going to be the negative of that.
5:54
So it's going to be right over there.
5:58
And then the slope it just gets more and more and more
6:00
negative.
6:01
Right over here, the slope is a positive 1.
6:04
Over here it's going to be a negative 1.
6:06
So right over here our slope is a negative 1.
6:09
And then as we get closer and closer to 0,
6:10
it's just going to get more and more and more negative.
6:13
So the derivative of the natural log
6:15
of the absolute value of x, for x is less than 0,
6:17
looks something like this.
6:22
And you see, and once again, it's
6:25
not a ultra rigorous proof, but what
6:28
you see is that the derivative of the natural log
6:31
of the absolute value of x is equal to 1/x for all
6:36
x's not equaling 0.
6:38
So what you're seeing, or hopefully you
6:41
can visualize, that the derivative-- let
6:44
me write it this way-- of the natural log
6:51
of the absolute value of x is indeed equal to 1/x for all
7:01
x does not equal 0.
7:04
So this is a much more satisfying antiderivative
7:07
for 1/x.
7:08
It has the exact the same domain.
7:12
So when we think about what the antiderivative is for 1/x--
7:15
and I didn't do a kind of a rigorous proof here,
7:17
I didn't use the definition of the derivative and all of that.
7:19
But I kind of gave you a visual understanding, hopefully,
7:21
of it.
7:22
We would say it's the natural log
7:23
of the absolute value of x plus c.
7:26
And now we have an antiderivative
7:28
that has the same domain as that function
7:30
that we're taking the antiderivative of.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,sPPjk4aXzmQ,
khan_video_X7GT9JKoAbo_18,What's up with the equation Sal is writing at 13:36?,MCQ,"•
0:00
if the angles A, B, and C of a triangle
0:03
are in an arithmetic progression
0:05
and if a, b and c - lower case a, b and c
0:08
denote the length of the sides opposite to
0:11
the capital, the angles A -
0:13
capital A, capital B and capital C respectively
0:16
then what is the value
0:18
of this expression right over here
0:20
so let's if we can work our way through this,
0:23
so let's just draw the triangle
0:24
so we have visualization of
0:25
what all the letters represent
0:27
so we have the angles A, B and C
0:29
so let me just draw like this
0:31
so we have the angles A B
0:35
and C and then the sides opposites them
0:39
are the lower case versions,
0:40
so the side opposite the capital A is lower case a
0:43
the side opposite to capital B is lower case b
0:46
and the side opposite to the angle capital C is
0:49
lower case c.
0:51
Now the first piece of information they tell us
0:54
is that they the angles
0:56
capital A, capital B and capital C of the triangle
0:58
are in an arithmetic progression
1:04
very fancy word
1:06
but all an arithmetic progression is,
1:08
is a series of numbers
1:09
that are separated by the same amount,
1:11
so and let me give you some examples,
1:13
so 1,2,3 - that's an arithmetic progression 2, 4, 6
1:19
arithmetic progression were separated by 2 every time
1:21
I could do 10, 20, 30
1:25
also an arithmetic progression.
1:27
These are all arithmetic progressions.
1:28
So all they're saying is
1:29
is to go from angle A to angle B -
1:31
however much that is,
1:32
is this the same amount to go from angle
1:35
B to angle C.
1:36
So let's see what that tells us
1:38
what that tells us about or maybe tells us,
1:41
maybe doesn't tell us anything about those angles
1:43
so if we could say
1:45
we could say we have angle A
1:48
and then we have the notion angle B
1:50
so we could say that
1:52
B is equal to A plus some constant
1:56
we don't know what that is.
1:57
it could go by 1, it could go by 2, it could go by 10
1:59
we don't know what it is,
2:01
so A plus N and then C would be equal to B plus N
2:07
which is the same thing
2:09
which is the same thing as B is A plus N,
2:12
so this is A plus N it plus
2:15
plus N which is equal to
2:16
A plus 2N
2:19
so what does that us?
2:20
Well, the other thing we know about three angles
2:23
in a triangles
2:24
that they have to add up to a 180 degrees. So:
2:26
this, this and this have to add up to a 180 degrees
2:31
let's try it out
2:32
so we have A plus A plus N plus A plus 2N,
2:38
plus A plus 2N is going to be equal to 180 degrees
2:42
we have one, two, three ""A""s here,
2:45
so we get 3A plus with one N and another two N:
2:49
three A plus 3 N is equal to 180 degrees
2:53
or you could divide both sides by 3
2:56
plus N is equal to
2:59
and you get A A plus N is equal to 60 degrees
3:03
so what does that
3:04
what does that tell usŁż
3:06
well A could still be anything cause
3:08
if N is 1 then A is 59
3:10
if N is 10
3:11
then A is going to be 50,
3:13
so it doesn't give us much information
3:15
about the angle A
3:16
but if you look up here, do you see A+N anywhere?
3:20
you see it right over here.
3:22
B is equal to A plus N and we just figured out that
3:26
A plus N has to be equal to sixty degrees
3:28
so using this first piece of information
3:31
we are able to come up with something pretty tangible
3:33
B must be equal to sixty degrees
3:37
and you could try it out with a bunch of numbers
3:43
that's an arithmetic progression
3:45
and once again B is the middle one right over here.
3:55
but no matter what the arithmetic progression is
3:57
in order for these three angles to add up to 180
4:00
the middle one has to be equal to
4:02
has to be equal to 60 degrees.
4:05
So that was a pretty
4:06
that's.. we're doing pretty well so far
4:08
so let's see what we can do it the next part
4:10
when the next part of problem.
4:12
I'm trying to
4:13
save some screen real estate right over here
4:14
okay
4:15
so they want us to figure out
4:16
the value of the expression a over c sine of two
4:20
C - capital C, plus c over a sine of two A.
4:23
So let me just write it down
4:24
so we have i'll do it..
4:27
i'll do it in blue a over c a over c
4:31
sine of two times capital C plus c over a
4:38
sine of two times capital A
4:42
what's that going to be equal to?
4:43
so, whenever you see stuff like this
4:45
you got a 2 here
4:46
a 2 here
4:47
frankly the best things you do
4:49
is just experiment with your trigonometric identities
4:51
and see if anything pops out of you
4:53
that might be useful and a little bit of a clue here
4:55
the first part of the problem helped us figure out
4:57
what B is
4:58
it helped us figure out what B is
5:01
but right now the expression has no B in it.
5:03
So right now this information seems kind of useless
5:06
but if we could put this somehow in terms of B
5:09
then we'll have will will be making progress
5:11
as we know information about angle B
5:14
so let's see what we can do
5:15
so the first thing i would use is
5:18
with sine of 2A - let me just rewrite each of these
5:21
so sine of
5:23
i just say sine of two times anything
5:25
that's just the same thing as
5:27
and this is called the double angle formula
5:30
so this is
5:31
I might be wrong I was forgot the actual names of them
5:34
but sine of two time something
5:36
is two sine of that something
5:39
times the cosine of that
5:41
times the cosine of that something
5:43
and you'll see that in any trigonometric book on the
5:45
inside cover even a lot of calculus books
5:47
let's do that for this the same thing right over here
5:49
so sine of 2A over here is going to be
5:51
2 sine of A cosine of A
5:56
that's just a standard trigonometric identity
5:58
and we've - in the trigonometric that we prove that identity
6:01
I think we do it multiple times
6:02
than on front we have our coefficients
6:05
still we have a over c times this
6:07
plus c over a times this
6:10
now is there anything we can do
6:13
and remembered in the back of our mind
6:14
we should be thinking
6:15
of how can we use this information
6:16
that B is equal sixty
6:18
so if we can somehow put this
6:20
in the form get B here
6:22
when I think about how do you get a B here
6:24
I think well you know we have a triangle here
6:27
so the things that relate the sides of the triangle
6:30
when especially it's not a right triangle
6:31
we're gonna deal with
6:32
the law of sines or law of cosines
6:34
and law of sines let me just rewrite it over here
6:36
just for our reference
6:37
so law sines would say sine of A
6:40
over a is equal to sine
6:42
of B over b which is equal to sine of C over c
6:49
at looks like we might be able to use that
6:51
let me just write the law of cosines here
6:53
just in case it's useful in the future
6:55
so law of cosines c squared
6:57
it's really the Pythagoras Theorem
6:59
with little adjustment for the fact that
7:00
it's not a right triangle
7:01
so c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared
7:05
minus 2ab cosine cosine of c - of capital C
7:12
so it's law of sines, law of cosines.
7:14
if we can somehow use both of these to put these
7:17
in terms of b which we have information about
7:19
well the first thing is
7:21
I could rewrite this.
7:23
So this is sine of c over c and this is sine of a over a
7:26
So let me do that
7:27
so I have let me do this.
7:30
so I have the two a
7:31
I have two a cosine of c.
7:34
let me write that separately
7:35
so I have two a cosine cosine of capital C
7:41
and then times sine of C over c times
7:46
I'll do it white.
7:47
\4c&amp;H000000&amp;sine of C
7:49
that's a capital C
7:51
sine of capital C over lower case c
7:54
that's that term and that term right over there
7:56
and then to that I'm adding to that I'm adding -
8:00
I'm doing the same thing over here
8:02
I have two times
8:03
I'm going to separate these guys out
8:06
actually now I want to do the sines.
8:08
So let me separate this guy and this guy out
8:13
and so I get plus two c cosine of A
8:19
times sine of capital over lower case a
8:23
times sine of capital A over lower case a
8:29
and I want this do for me
8:30
Look that the sine right over there
8:33
I have sine over c
8:34
that's that over there
8:35
and then I have sine of A over a.
8:37
That's that over there, capital A over lower case a
8:40
they're both equal to sine of B over b
8:42
so we were making progress. We have -
8:44
we started introducing B into the equation
8:46
and that's the expression that
8:48
we actually have information about
8:50
so this to be rewritten as sine of B over b
8:54
so this is the same thing
8:56
as sine of capital B over lower case b
9:00
and this is the same thing sine
9:02
of capital B over lower case b
9:06
and they are both being multiplied,
9:08
or both of these terms are multiplying -
9:10
be multiplied by that two a
9:14
cosine of capital C times that
9:16
and then plus two c
9:19
it's a lower case c
9:21
cosine of capital A times that
9:24
so we can factor out the sine of B over b
9:27
let's do that let's factor it out
9:29
so this is the same thing as
9:32
it's the same thing as two a
9:37
and I really have a sense of
9:38
what the next step is,
9:39
so I leave a little space here
9:40
two a times cosine of C plus, this -
9:45
and these are being multiplied,
9:46
I left some space there plus two c,
9:49
two lower case c times a cosine of A
9:54
and all of this
9:55
all of this times the sine of B over b
10:01
and we know - we already know the B is sixty degree
10:03
so we can evaluate this
10:04
uh... pretty pretty easily
10:06
But let's just continue see if we can somehow
10:09
somehow put this right over here in terms of b
10:12
well if you look over here
10:14
we have two a cosine of C, two c cosine of A
10:17
it looks -
10:18
it's starting to look
10:20
pretty darn close pretty darn close,
10:22
each of these terms
10:23
are pretty darn close to this part
10:25
to this part of the law of cosines over there
10:28
and actually let's solve
10:29
for that part of the law of cosines
10:31
That's what we can do.
10:33
so if you add two ab cosine of C on both sides,
10:37
you get two ab cosine of capital C
10:41
plus c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared
10:47
or if you subtract c squared from both sides
10:50
you get two ab cosine of capital C
10:54
is equal to a squared plus b squared minus c squared
10:59
and this is interesting
11:00
and we can, you know -
11:02
switch around the letters later on
11:03
but this looks pretty darn close to this
11:05
so what if - and this looks pretty darn close of
11:07
this except we're here
11:08
we're dealing with an a instead of a c.
11:10
We just switch the letters around
11:11
and we could rewrite this
11:13
actually let me rewrite it just for fun
11:15
I could rewrite this over here as
11:17
two two c b not rewrite it.
11:22
I can swap the letters times the cosine of A
11:26
Here I'm swaping the as and cs,
11:28
is equal to c squared plus b squared minus a squared
11:32
there's nothing unique about sides c
11:34
I can do this with all of the sides
11:36
so here
11:37
it's a big C here you have an a and a b out front
11:40
and then you have the a square plus b squared
11:42
minus the small c squared.
11:44
if you have a big A,
11:45
then you have the cb in the front
11:46
and then you are subtracting the a squared right over here
11:49
and this is useful
11:50
because this term right over here
11:52
this term right over here
11:54
looks almost like this term over here
11:56
if we could just -
11:57
if we could just multiply this by b
11:58
So let's do that we can multiply that by b
12:01
but let's multiply
12:02
this whole numerator this whole term by b
12:05
so if we multiply this whole term by b.
12:07
What do we get?
12:08
we get a b there.
12:09
we get a b there.
12:11
and of course you can just arbitrarily
12:13
multiply an expression by b that'll change its value
12:15
so what we could do is multiply the expression by b
12:17
which we just did
12:19
we distributed a b across here
12:20
but they'll also divide by b
12:22
where which - so I'll divide by b.
12:25
That's equivalent of multiplying the denominator
12:27
the denominator there, not b squared
12:30
that's equivalent of multiplying the denominator by b
12:32
that's the same thing as dividing by b
12:34
we multiplied by b, divided by b
12:36
where that's the same thing
12:37
as just turning this to b squared
12:39
now what does this give us well
12:43
we have this term right over here
12:44
this term right over here is now the exact same thing
12:48
as that over there
12:49
so it is now a square plus b squared minus c squared
12:54
and then this term right over here
12:57
is now the exact same thing as this thing over here
13:01
which is the same thing as that
13:02
we are using the law of cosines
13:04
so this is plus
13:05
c squared plus b squared minus a squared
13:10
and then all of that times this sine of B
13:13
sine of capital B over b squared
13:16
now what does this give us?
13:18
we have an a square and a negative a square
13:20
things are starting to simplify
13:22
a squared, negative a squared
13:24
we have a negative c squared
13:27
and a positive c squared
13:28
so what are we left is -
13:30
so we just left the two b squared
13:32
so our whole expression has simplified to
13:34
two b squared sine of B
13:37
sine of capital B over lower case b squared
13:43
these cancel out
13:44
so our whole expression simplifies to
13:46
two sine of B
13:49
and from the get go we knew what B was
13:52
we know it's sixty degrees so this is
13:54
equal to two times the sine of sixty degrees
13:58
and if you don't have
14:00
the sine of sixty degrees memorized
14:01
you can always just break out
14:03
a thirty sixty ninety triangle
14:04
so let me draw -

this is a right triangle right over here
14:08
This is sixty degrees hypotenuse has length one
14:12
we're dealing with the unit circle
14:13
this side is thirty degrees
14:15
the side opposite the thirty degrees is one-half
14:18
the side opposite the sixty degrees is
14:20
square root of three times that.
14:21
So it's square root of three over two.
14:23
you can even use the Pythagoras Theorem to figure out
14:25
Once you know one of them
14:26
you could figure out the other one
14:27
the sine of - sine is
14:30
opposite over hypotenuse
14:31
so square root of three over two over one
14:33
or just square root of three over two.
14:35
It's equal to two times -
14:37
it's the home stretch, we are exciting

square root of three over two these cancel out.

- Let's see if we can solve the equation
0:02
P squared is equal to 0.81.
0:08
So how could we think about this?
0:10
Well one thing we could do is we could say,
0:11
look if P squared is equal to 0.81,
0:14
another way of expressing this is, that well, that means
0:16
that P is going to be equal to the positive or negative
0:20
square root of 0.81.
0:23
Remember if we just wrote the square root symbol here,
0:25
that means the principal root,
0:26
or just the positive square root.
0:28
But here P could be positive or negative, because if you
0:31
square it, if you square even a negative number,
0:33
you're still going to get a positive value.
0:35
So we could write that P is equal
0:37
to the plus or minus square root of 0.81,
0:39
which kind of helps us, it's another way
0:41
of expressing the same, the same, equation.
0:44
But still, what could P be?
0:46
In your brain, you might immediately say, well okay,
0:49
you know if this was P squared is equal to 81,
0:52
I kinda know what's going on.
0:53
Because I know that nine times nine is equal to 81.
0:58
Or we could write that nine squared is equal to 81,
1:01
or we could write that nine is equal
1:03
to the principal root of 81.
1:05
These are all, I guess, saying the same truth
1:08
about the universe, but what about 0.81?
1:12
Well 0.81 has two digits behind, to the right of the decimal
1:17
and so if I were to multiply something that has
1:19
one digit to the right of the decimal times itself,
1:22
I'm gonna have something with two digits
1:23
to the right of the decimal.
1:24
And so what happens if I take, instead of nine squared,
1:27
what happens if I take 0.9 squared?
1:29
Let me try that out.
1:30
Zero, I'm gonna use a different color.
1:33
So let's say I took 0.9 squared.
1:38
0.9 squared, well that's going to be 0.9
1:41
times 0.9, which is going to be equal to?
1:45
Well nine times nine is 81, and I have one, two, numbers
1:50
to the right of the decimal, so I'm gonna have two
1:52
numbers to the right of the decimal in the product.
1:54
So one, two. So that indeed is equal to 0.81.
1:58
In fact we could write 0.81 as 0.9 squared.
2:03
So we could write this, we could write that P
2:07
is equal to the plus or minus, the square root of,
2:10
instead of writing 0.81,
2:12
I could write that as 0.9 squared.
2:17
In fact I could also write that as negative 0.9 squared.
2:20
Cause if you put a negative here and a negative here,
2:22
it's still not going to change the value.
2:24
A negative times a negative is going to be a positive.
2:27
I could, actually I would have put a negative there,
2:29
which would have implied
2:30
a negative here and a negative there.
2:31
So either of those are going to be true.
2:33
But it's going to work out for us
2:35
because we are taking the positive and negative square root.
2:37
So this is going to be,
2:39
P is going to be equal to plus or minus 0.9.
2:44
Plus or minus 0.9, or we could write it
2:48
that P is equal to 0.9,
2:51
or P could be equal to negative 0.9.
2:55
And you can verify that,
2:57
you would square either of these things, you get 0.81.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,tRHLEWSUjrQ,
khan_video_o5iot_ZsoV0_8,Is induced spending related to the consumption function?,MCQ,"•
0:00
Male: What I want to do in this video is introduce you
0:02
to the idea of a consumption function.
0:05
It's a very simple idea.
0:07
It's really just the notion that income,
0:09
income in aggregate in an economy
0:11
can drive consumption in aggregate in an economy.
0:17
Just to make things tangible, I will construct
0:19
a consumption function for a hypothetical economy,
0:24
and we can debate whether we can construct a better one.
0:27
All the numbers don't have to be exactly
0:29
what I'm about to do, but this is just
0:30
to make things concrete in your mind.
0:32
Maybe we have a hypothetical economy
0:33
where consumption is going to be equal to ...
0:36
well, maybe there's some base level of consumption
0:38
even if there's no aggregate income in our economy.
0:41
It's hard to image, but let's say there isn't.
0:42
There will still be consumption.
0:44
Maybe people can do it by digging into their savings.
0:47
They're essentially using resources
0:49
that they've already accumulated in some way.
0:51
Let's say that base level of consumption,
0:53
let's call that 500.
0:55
It could be billions of dollars or gold coins
0:58
or clamshells or whatever the unit
1:01
of measuring economic activity is in our economy.
1:03
That's our base level of consumption.
1:06
Then let's say if there is some aggregate income,
1:10
people will spend 60% of it.
1:12
I'm just picking these numbers somewhat arbitrarily.
1:14
Let's say if there's some above and beyond
1:17
the base level, they're going to spend 0.6
1:20
of any aggregate income they have.
1:22
Actually, to be a little bit more particular,
1:23
I'll write not just income, I'll write disposable income.
1:27
I'll want to do that in a different color.
1:30
They will ... that's not a different color.
1:32
Above and beyond the base level,
1:34
they'll spend 60% of their disposable income.
1:40
I make the distinction, just to clarify our model,
1:44
between income and disposable income
1:46
because all of the aggregate income in an economy
1:49
does not end up in consumers' pockets.
1:54
Just for a simplification, you might say,
1:56
""Yeah, some of it ends up in firms' pockets,""
1:58
but the firms, at the end of the day,
1:59
are owned by individuals, so it can end up
2:01
in individuals' or consumers' pockets.
2:03
But some of it goes off to the government.
2:07
When you think about income, and if you spend
2:09
any time looking at your pay stub this will
2:11
become familiar to you, you have your income
2:13
but you don't end up with all of that in your
2:15
checking account or your pocket
2:17
or your savings account.
2:18
A good fraction of that is taken out for taxes.
2:21
What you have left over when you subtract
2:23
taxes out of income, that is your disposable income.
2:31
That's why I write this here because that's actually
2:33
a more reasonable thing to say.
2:34
People will spend 60% of their disposable income.
2:37
They obviously can't spend a fraction of stuff that
2:39
they don't have, the stuff that's taken out for taxes.
2:42
Just to visualize this, we can draw it.
2:44
This will be a line.
2:45
This might ring a bell from your early algebra days.
2:48
Just the variables are different.
2:50
Instead of a y, we have a c,
2:52
but that's still the dependent variable.
2:54
It's a function of disposable income.
2:56
In algebra you'll often call this the independent variable.
2:59
The most typical variable is x.
3:01
It's really the same idea over here.
3:03
Let me draw this a little bit neater.
3:07
We can graph this, what's essentially going to be a line.
3:11
It doesn't have to be a line.
3:12
We just constructed a consumption function
3:13
that happens to be a line.
3:15
This is consumption right over here in the vertical axis.
3:19
That could be in billions of dollars
3:21
or clamshells or whatever else.
3:22
Then right over here we have disposable income.
3:31
If there is zero disposable income,
3:34
maybe I'll draw a little table over here.
3:38
This is I'll call it disposable income
3:41
and this is consumption.
3:42
If there's zero disposable income,
3:44
then this whole term right over here is 0.
3:46
Then you have 500 billion dollars,
3:49
or whatever our units are, of base consumption.
3:52
This would correspond to this point right over here.
3:56
In the horizontal axis you don't move at all
3:59
because this is 0.
4:00
Vertical axis is 500.
4:02
So you have 500.
4:03
Let's say disposable income is 1,000
4:09
whatever our units are.
4:10
So this is 500.
4:11
Let's say this is 1,000 billion clamshells.
4:14
This could be in billions of clamshells.
4:16
I don't want to keep having to say that
4:18
over and over again.
4:19
What is our consumption going to be in our units?
4:21
Our consumption is going to be equal to
4:24
500 + 0.6 x 1,000 which is equal to
4:30
500 + 600 which is equal to 1,100.
4:35
That would correspond, this right over here,
4:39
would correspond to; so 1,000,
4:42
so this might be 1,000 on this axis
4:44
so this would be 1,100 to this point right over here.
4:47
That would be the coordinate: 1,000; 1,100.
4:54
This is a line.
4:55
Two points make a line.
4:56
In this particular case we have
5:01
a consumption function that looks
5:03
something like this.
5:06
We picked two points to draw it.
5:07
If you remember a little bit of your slope,
5:08
you could view this as your y intercept,
5:11
or in this case your c intercept,
5:13
and that your slope would be the .6,
5:15
and we'll talk more about that in future videos
5:17
when we dig into the marginal propensity
5:18
to consume a little bit more.
5:20
But the one thing I just want to highlight
5:22
is it's a very simple idea.
5:23
This does not have to be the consumption function.
5:26
The consumption functions that we tend to study
5:28
in introductory economics classes will look like this.
5:31
It will be a line that has some intersection,
5:33
some base level of consumption.
5:34
But one could argue it might be very different.
5:36
Maybe the consumption function looks like this.
5:39
Maybe when income is low,
5:41
for every incremental dollar of income,
5:44
people are probably going to spend a lot.
5:47
As they become richer and richer and richer,
5:49
as their income goes higher and higher,
5:51
they're going to spend less and less
5:52
a fraction of their disposable income.
5:54
Essentially what I'm describing here
5:56
is a marginal propensity to consume changes.
5:58
In our first model, we had a very basic
6:00
marginal propensity to consume.
6:02
It was constant.
6:03
For every incremental dollar, .6 of that got spent.
6:07
So we had a marginal propensity to consume
6:09
that was constant of 0.6.
6:13
Marginal propensity to consume.
6:15
But, you could argue, that maybe a more
6:16
complex model is justified.
6:18
That when you have a very high marginal
6:20
propensity to consume, when people have very little
6:23
because they have a very low standard of living,
6:25
they really want to just get a little bit more
6:27
just so they can live a decent life,
6:29
but as they get more and more income they say,
6:31
""Hey, I'm starting to max out my standard of living,
6:34
""I'll save more and more of it for a rainy day.""",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,o5iot_ZsoV0,

0:00
We already know that an angle is formed
0:02
when two rays share a common endpoint.
0:04
So, for example, let's say that this is one ray right
0:06
over here, and then this is one another ray right over here,
0:11
and then they would form an angle.
0:13
And at this point right over here,
0:14
their common endpoint is called the vertex of that angle.
0:18
Now, we also know that not all angles seem the same.
0:21
For example, this is one angle here,
0:23
and then we could have another angle
0:26
that looks something like this.
0:34
And viewed this way, it looks like this one
0:36
is much more open.
0:39
So I'll say more open.
0:43
And this one right over here seems less open.
0:46
So to avoid having to just say, oh, more open and less open
0:50
and actually becoming a little bit more exact about it,
0:52
we'd actually want to measure how open an angle is,
0:55
or we'd want to have a measure of the angle.
0:59
Now, the most typical way that angles are measured,
1:01
there's actually two major ways of that they're measured.
1:04
The most typical unit is in degrees,
1:07
but later on in high school, you'll
1:09
also see the unit of radians being used, especially when you
1:13
learn trigonometry.
1:15
But the degrees convention really comes from a circle.
1:18
So let's draw ourselves a circle right over here,
1:20
so that's a circle.
1:22
And the convention is that-- when I say convention,
1:26
it's just kind of what everyone has been doing.
1:29
The convention is that you have 360 degrees in a circle.
1:33
So let me explain that.
1:34
So if that's the center of the circle,
1:36
and if we make this ray our starting point or one side
1:43
of our angle, if you go all the way around the circle,
1:48
that represents 360 degrees.
1:54
And the notation is 360, and then this little superscript
1:57
circle represents degrees.
1:59
This could be read as 360 degrees.
2:03
Now, you might be saying, where did this 360 number come from?
2:07
And no one knows for sure, but there's hints in history,
2:11
and there's hints in just the way that the universe works,
2:15
or at least the Earth's rotation around the sun.
2:17
You might recognize or you might already
2:19
realize that there are 365 days in a non-leap year, 366
2:25
in a leap year.
2:26
And so you can imagine ancient astronomers might have said,
2:29
well, you know, that's pretty close to 360.
2:38
And in fact, several ancient calendars,
2:40
including the Persians and the Mayans,
2:43
had 360 days in their year.
2:46
And 360 is also a much neater number than 365.
2:49
It has many, many more factors.
2:52
It's another way of saying it's divisible by a bunch of things.
2:55
But anyway, this has just been the convention, once again,
2:58
what history has handed us, that a circle is
3:00
viewed to have 360 degrees.
3:03
And so one way we could measure an angle
3:06
is you could put one of the rays of an angle right over here
3:09
at this part of the circle, and then the other ray of the angle
3:14
will look something like this.
3:17
And then the fraction of the circle circumference
3:24
that is intersected by these two rays, the measure of this angle
3:28
would be that fraction of degrees.
3:31
So, for example, let's say that this length right over here
3:38
is 1/6 of the circle's circumference.
3:49
So it's 1/6 of the way around the circle.
3:52
Then this angle right over here is
3:54
going to be 1/6 of 360 degrees.
3:58
So in this case, this would be 60 degrees.
4:01
I could do another example.
4:02
So let's say I had a circle like this, and I'll draw an angle.
4:07
I'll put the vertex at the center of the angle.
4:10
I'll put one of the rays right over here.
4:12
You could consider that to be 0 degrees.
4:15
Or if the other ray was also here, it would be 0 degrees.
4:19
And then I'll make the other ray of this angle,
4:23
let's say it went straight up.
4:25
Let's say it went straight up like this.
4:29
Well, in this situation, the arc that
4:33
connects these two endpoints just like this,
4:37
this represents 1/4 of the circumference of the circle.
4:40
This is, right over here, 1/4 of the circumference.
4:49
So this angle right over here is going to be 1/4 of 360 degrees.
4:55
360 degrees divided by 4 is going to be 90 degrees.
5:00
At an angle like this, one where one ray is straight up and down
5:03
and the other one goes to the right/left direction,
5:07
we would say these two rays are perpendicular,
5:11
or we would call this a right angle.
5:13
And the way that we oftentimes will denote that
5:16
is by a symbol like this.
5:19
But this literally means a 90-degree angle.
5:22
Let's do one more example.
5:24
Let's do one more example of this, just
5:25
to make sure that we understand what's going on.
5:28
Actually, at least one more example.
5:30
Maybe one more if we have time.
5:32
So let's say that we have an angle that looks like this.
5:35
Once more, I'm going to put its vertex
5:38
at the center of the circle.
5:40
That's one ray of the angle.
5:42
And let's say that this is the other ray.
5:45
This right over here is the other ray of the angle.
5:48
I encourage you to pause this video
5:50
and try to figure out what the measure of this angle
5:55
right over here is.
5:57
Well, let's think about where the rays intersect the circle.
6:00
They intersect there and there.
6:02
The arc that connects them on the circle
6:04
is that arc right over there.
6:06
That is literally half of the circumference of the circle.
6:09
That is half of the circumference, half of the way
6:13
around of the circle, circumference of the circle.
6:18
So this angle is going to be half of 360 degrees.
6:21
And half of 360 is 180 degrees.
6:26
And when you view it this way, these two rays
6:27
share a common endpoint.
6:28
And together, they're really forming a line here.
6:32
And let's just do one more example,
6:34
because I said I would.
6:36
Let me paste another circle.
6:39
Let me draw another angle.
6:42
Let me draw another angle.
6:44
So let's say that's one ray of the angle,
6:46
and this is the other ray.
6:49
This is the other ray of the angle right over here.
6:52
And we care.
6:53
There's actually two angles that are formed.
6:55
There's actually two angles formed in all of these.
6:57
There's one angle that's formed right over here,
6:59
and you might recognize that to be a 90-degree angle.
7:01
But what we really care about in this example
7:04
is this angle right over here.
7:07
So once again, where does it intersect the circle?
7:10
We care about this arc right over here,
7:13
because that's the arc that corresponds
7:17
to this angle right over here.
7:19
And it looks like we've gone 3/4 around the circle.
7:22
So this angle is going to be 3/4 of 360 degrees.
7:28
1/4 of 360 degrees is 90, so three of those

is going to be 270 degrees.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,D-EIh7NJvtQ,

It means that you cannot express it as the ratio of two

0:12
So we have the square root of 8 over 2.

Now, you have pi, 3.14159-- it just
0:40
keeps going on and on and on forever without ever repeating.
0:44
So this is irrational, probably the most famous
0:47
of all of the irrational numbers.
0:50
5.0-- well, I can represent 5.0 as 5/1.
0:55
So 5.0 is rational.
0:57
It is not irrational.
1:00
0.325-- well, this is the same thing as 325/1000.
1:08
So I can clearly represent it as a ratio of integers.
1:11
So this is rational.
1:12
Just as I could represent 5.0 as 5/1, both of these
1:16
are rational.
1:17
They are not irrational.
1:19
Here I have 7.777777, and it just
1:22
keeps going on and on and on forever.
1:23
And the way we denote that, you could just
1:25
say these dots that say that the 7's keep going.
1:28
Or you could say 7.7.
1:29
And this line shows that the 7 part, the second 7,
1:32
just keeps repeating on forever.
1:35
Now, if you have a repeating decimal-- in other videos,
1:38
we'll actually convert them into fractions--
1:40
but a repeating decimal can be represented
1:44
as a ratio of two integers.
1:47
Just as 1/3 is equal to 0.333 on and on and on.
1:52
Or I could say it like this.
1:54
I could say 3 repeating.
1:56
We can also do the same thing for that.
1:57
I won't do it here, but this is rational.
2:01
So it's not irrational.
2:03
8 and 1/2?
2:05
Well, that's the same thing.
2:06
8 and 1/2 is the same thing as 17/2.
2:09
So it's clearly rational.
2:11
So the only two irrational numbers
2:13
are the first two right over here.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,d9pO2z2qvXU,

Considering that I have a cold right now, I can't imagine a
0:03
more appropriate topic to make a video on than a virus.
0:08
And I didn't want to make it that thick.
0:09
A virus, or viruses.
0:14
And in my opinion, viruses are, on some level, the most
0:19
fascinating thing in all of biology.
0:21
Because they really blur the boundary between what is an
0:25
inanimate object and what is life?
0:30
I mean if we look at ourselves, or life as one of
0:33
those things that you know it when you see it.
0:35
If you see something that, it's born, it grows, it's
0:39
constantly changing.
0:40
Maybe it moves around.
0:41
Maybe it doesn't.
0:42
But it's metabolizing things around itself.
0:44
It reproduces and then it dies.
0:46
You say, hey, that's probably life.
0:48
And in this, we throw most things that we see-- or we
0:50
throw in, us.
0:52
We throw in bacteria.
0:55
We throw in plants.
0:57
I mean, I could-- I'm kind of butchering the taxonomy system
1:00
here, but we tend to know life when we see it.
1:03
But all viruses are, they're just a bunch of genetic
1:07
information inside of a protein.
1:09
Inside of a protein capsule.
1:11
So let me draw.
1:13
And the genetic information can come in any form.
1:16
So it can be an RNA, it could be DNA, it could be
1:22
single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA.
1:24
Sometimes for single stranded they'll write these two little
1:27
S's in front of it.
1:29
Let's say they are talking about double stranded DNA,
1:30
they'll put a ds in front of it.
1:32
But the general idea-- and viruses can come in all of
1:35
these forms-- is that they have some genetic information,
1:38
some chain of nucleic acids.
1:40
Either as single or double stranded RNA or single or
1:43
double stranded DNA.
1:44
And it's just contained inside some type of protein
1:47
structure, which is called the capsid.
1:49
And kind of the classic drawing is kind of an
1:53
icosahedron type looking thing.
1:56
Let me see if I can do justice to it.
1:58
It looks something like this.
2:00
And not all viruses have to look exactly like this.
2:02
There's thousands of types of viruses.
2:05
And we're really just scratching the surface and
2:06
understanding even what viruses are out there and all
2:09
of the different ways that they can essentially replicate
2:14
themselves.
2:15
We'll talk more about that in the future.
2:16
And I would suspect that pretty much any possible way
2:19
of replication probably does somehow exist
2:21
in the virus world.
2:22
But they really are just these proteins, these protein
2:25
capsids, are just made up of a bunch of little
2:27
proteins put together.
2:29
And inside they have some genetic material, which might
2:31
be DNA or it might be RNA.
2:33
So let me draw their genetic material.
2:35
The protein is not necessarily transparent, but if it was,
2:38
you would see some genetic material inside of there.
2:42
So the question is, is this thing life?
2:48
It seems pretty inanimate.
2:49
It doesn't grow.
2:50
It doesn't change.
2:51
It doesn't metabolize things.
2:53
This thing, left to its own devices, is just
2:55
going to sit there.
2:55
It's just going to sit there the way a book on a table just
2:59
sits there.
3:00
It won't change anything.
3:02
But what happens is, the debate arises.
3:06
I mean you might say, hey Sal, when you define it that way,
3:08
just looks like a bunch of molecules put together.
3:10
That isn't life.
3:11
But it starts to seem like life all of a sudden when it
3:14
comes in contact with the things that we normally
3:17
consider life.
3:18
So what viruses do, the classic example is, a virus
3:22
will attach itself to a cell.
3:24
So let me draw this thing a little bit smaller.
3:28
So let's say that this is my virus.
3:30
I'll draw it as a little hexagon.
3:32
And what it does is, it'll attach itself to a cell.
3:34
And it could be any type of cell.
3:35
It could be a bacteria cell, it could be a plant cell, it
3:39
could be a human cell.
3:41
Let me draw the cell here.
3:43
Cells are usually far larger than the virus.
3:48
In the case of cells that have soft membranes, the virus
3:51
figures out some way to enter it.
3:53
Sometimes it can essentially fuse-- I don't want to
3:58
complicate the issue-- but sometimes viruses have their
4:01
own little membranes.
4:02
And we'll talk about in a second where
4:03
it gets their membranes.
4:04
So a virus might have its own membrane like that.
4:08
That's around its capsid.
4:10
And then these membranes will fuse.
4:13
And then the virus will be able to enter into the cell.
4:16
Now, that's one method.
4:18
And another method, and they're seldom
4:19
all the same way.
4:20
But let's say another method would be, the virus
4:24
convinces-- just based on some protein receptors on it, or
4:26
protein receptors on the cells-- and obviously this has
4:29
to be kind of a Trojan horse type of thing.
4:31
The cell doesn't want viruses.
4:33
So the virus has to somehow convince the cell that it's a
4:36
non-foreign particle.
4:38
We could do hundreds of videos on how viruses work and it's a
4:41
continuing field of research.
4:43
But sometimes you might have a virus that just gets consumed
4:47
by the cell.
4:48
Maybe the cell just thinks it's something that it needs
4:49
to consume.
4:50
So the cell wraps around it like this.
4:56
And these sides will eventually merge.
4:58
And then the cell and the virus will go into it.
5:01
This is called endocytosis.
5:03
I'll just talk about that.
5:04
It just brings it into its cytoplasm.
5:06
It doesn't happen just to viruses.
5:11
But this is one mechanism that can enter.
5:12
And then in cases where the cell in question-- for example
5:17
in the situation with bacteria-- if the cell has a
5:20
very hard shell-- let me do it in a good color.
5:25
So let's say that this is a bacteria right here.
5:29
And it has a hard shell.
5:30
The viruses don't even enter the cell.
5:32
They just hang out outside of the cell like this.
5:36
Not drawing to scale.
5:37
And they actually inject their genetic material.
5:40
So there's obviously a huge-- there's a wide variety of ways
5:43
of how the viruses get into cells.
5:45
But that's beside the point.
5:46
The interesting thing is that they do get into the cell.
5:49
And once they do get into the cell, they release their
5:52
genetic material into the cell.
5:54
So their genetic material will float around.
5:56
If their genetic material is already in the form of RNA--
6:01
and I could imagine almost every possibility of different
6:05
ways for viruses to work probably do exist in nature.
6:08
We just haven't found them.
6:09
But the ones that we've already found really do kind
6:11
of do it in every possible way.
6:13
So if they have RNA, this RNA can immediately start being
6:20
used to essentially-- let's say this is the
6:23
nucleus of the cell.
6:25
That's the nucleus of the cell and it normally has the DNA in
6:28
it like that.
6:29
Maybe I'll do the DNA in a different color.
6:30
But DNA gets transcribed into RNA, normally.
6:37
So normally, the cell, this a normal working cell, the RNA
6:39
exits the nucleus, it goes to the ribosomes, and then you
6:43
have the RNA in conjunction with the tRNA and it produces
6:46
these proteins.
6:49
The RNA codes for different proteins.
6:51
And I talk about that in a different video.
6:53
So these proteins get formed and eventually, they can form
6:57
the different structures in a cell.
6:58
But what a virus does is it hijacks this process here.
7:03
Hijacks this mechanism.
7:04
This RNA will essentially go and do what the cell's own RNA
7:08
would have done.
7:09
And it starts coding for its own proteins.
7:11
Obviously it's not going to code for
7:12
the same things there.
7:13
And actually some of the first proteins it codes for often
7:15
start killing the DNA and the RNA that might otherwise
7:19
compete with it.
7:20
So it codes its own proteins.
7:22
And then those proteins start making more viral shells.
7:26
So those proteins just start constructing more and more
7:31
viral shells.
7:33
At the same time, this RNA is replicating.
7:36
It's using the cell's own mechanisms. Left to its own
7:39
devices it would just sit there.
7:40
But once it enters into a cell it can use all of the nice
7:43
machinery that a cell has around to replicate itself.
7:47
And it's kind of amazing, just the biochemistry of it.
7:51
That these RNA molecules then find themselves
7:54
back in these capsids.
7:57
And then once there's enough of these and the cell has
8:00
essentially all of its resources have been depleted,
8:05
the viruses, these individual new viruses that have
8:09
replicated themselves using all of the cell's mechanisms,
8:15
will find some way to exit the cell.
8:17
The most-- I don't want to say, typical, because we
8:20
haven't even discovered all the different types of viruses
8:23
there are-- but one that's, I guess, talked about the most,
8:26
is when there's enough of these, they'll release
8:28
proteins or they'll construct proteins.
8:30
Because they don't make their own.
8:32
That essentially cause the cell to either kill itself or
8:35
its membrane to dissolve.
8:37
So the membrane dissolves.
8:39
And essentially the cell lyses.
8:41
Let me write that down.
8:42
The cell lyses.
8:43
And lyses just means that the cell's membrane just
8:46
disappears.
8:46
And then all of these guys can emerge for themselves.
8:50
Now I talked about before that have some of these guys, that
8:53
they have their own membrane.
8:54
So how did they get there, these
8:56
kind of bilipid membranes?
8:58
Well some of them, what they do is, once they replicate
9:00
inside of a cell, they exit maybe not even killing-- they
9:07
don't have to lyse.
9:08
Everything I talk about, these are specific ways that a virus
9:11
might work.
9:12
But viruses really kind of explore-- well different types
9:15
of viruses do almost every different combination you
9:17
could imagine of replicating and coding for proteins and
9:22
escaping from cells.
9:23
Some of them just bud.
9:24
And when they bud, they essentially, you can kind of
9:26
imagine that they push against the cell
9:28
wall, or the membrane.
9:29
I shouldn't say cell wall.
9:30
The cell's outer membrane.
9:32
And then when they push against it, they take some of
9:36
the membrane with them.
9:38
Until eventually the cell will-- when this goes up
9:41
enough, this'll pop together and it'll take some of the
9:43
membrane with it.
9:44
And you could imagine why that would be useful thing
9:47
to have with you.
9:49
Because now that you have this membrane, you kind of look
9:51
like this cell.
9:52
So when you want to go infect another cell like this, you're
9:55
not going to necessarily look like a foreign particle.
9:58
So it's a very useful way to look like something that
10:02
you're not.
10:03
And if you don't think that this is creepy-crawly enough,
10:06
that you're hijacking the DNA of an organism, viruses can
10:10
actually change the DNA an organism.
10:14
And actually one of the most common examples is HIV virus.
10:18
Let me write that down.
10:21
HIV, which is a type of retrovirus, which is
10:27
fascinating.
10:28
Because what they do is, so they have RNA in them.
10:35
And when they enter into a cell, let's say that they got
10:38
into the cell.
10:39
So it's inside of the cell like this.
10:42
They actually bring along with them a protein.
10:46
And every time you say, where do they get this protein?
10:49
All of this stuff came from a different cell.
10:51
They use some other cell's amino acids and ribosomes and
10:54
nucleic acids and everything to build themselves.
10:56
So any proteins that they have in them came
10:58
from another cell.
11:00
But they bring with them, this protein reverse transcriptase.
11:04
And the reverse transcriptase takes their RNA and
11:07
codes it into DNA.
11:11
So its RNA to DNA.
11:14
Which when it was first discovered was, kind of,
11:16
people always thought that you always went from DNA to RNA,
11:19
but this kind of broke that paradigm.
11:22
But it codes from RNA to DNA.
11:23
And if that's not bad enough, it'll incorporate that DNA
11:29
into the DNA of the host cell.
11:31
So that DNA will incorporate itself into the
11:34
DNA of the host cell.
11:35
Let's say the yellow is the DNA of the host cell.
11:37
And this is its nucleus.
11:41
So it actually messes with the genetic makeup
11:44
of what it's infecting.
11:46
And when I made the videos on bacteria I said, hey for every
11:51
one human cell we have twenty bacteria cells.
11:53
And they live with us and they're useful and they're
11:56
part of us and they're 10% of our dry mass and all of that.
12:00
But bacteria are kind of along for the ride.
12:02
They don't change who we are.
12:03
But these retroviruses, they're actually changing our
12:07
genetic makeup.
12:07
I mean, my genes, I take very personally.
12:10
They define who I am.
12:12
But these guys will actually go in and
12:14
change my genetic makeup.
12:16
And then once they're part of the DNA, then just the natural
12:19
DNA to RNA to protein process will code
12:25
their actual proteins.
12:27
Or their-- what they need to-- so sometimes they'll lay
12:30
dormant and do nothing.
12:31
And sometimes-- let's say sometimes in some type of
12:33
environmental trigger, they'll start coding
12:35
for themselves again.
12:37
And they'll start producing more.
12:38
But they're producing it directly from the organism's
12:41
cell's DNA.
12:43
They become part of the organism.
12:45
I mean I can't imagine a more intimate way to become part of
12:49
an organism than to become part of its DNA.
12:51
I can't imagine any other way to
12:52
actually define an organism.
12:55
And if this by itself is not eerie enough, and just so you
13:00
know, this notion right here, when a virus becomes part of
13:06
an organism's DNA, this is called a provirus.
13:13
But if this isn't eerie enough, they estimate-- so if
13:16
this infects a cell in my nose or in my arm, as this cell
13:23
experiences mitosis, all of its offspring-- but its
13:27
offspring are genetically identical-- are going to have
13:29
this viral DNA.
13:30
And that might be fine, but at least my
13:32
children won't get it.
13:33
You know, at least it won't become part of my species.
13:35
But it doesn't have to just infect somatic cells, it could
13:38
infect a germ cell.
13:41
So it could go into a germ cell.
13:44
And the germ cells, we've learned already, these are the
13:46
ones that produce gametes.
13:49
For men, that's sperm and for women it's eggs.
13:52
But you could imagine, once you've infected a germ cell,
13:55
once you become part of a germ cell's DNA, then I'm passing
13:59
on that viral DNA to my son or my daughter.
14:02
And they are going to pass it on to their children.
14:05
And just that idea by itself is, at least to my mind.
14:10
vaguely creepy.
14:12
And people estimate that 5-8%-- and this kind of really
14:16
blurs, it makes you think about what we as humans really
14:19
are-- but the estimate is 5-8% of the human genome-- so when
14:26
I talked about bacteria I just talked about things that were
14:29
along for the ride.
14:30
But the current estimate, and I looked up this a lot.
14:33
I found 8% someplace, 5% someplace.
14:35
It's all a guess.
14:35
I mean people are doing it based on just looking at the
14:37
DNA and how similar it is to DNA in other organisms. But
14:40
the estimate is 5-8% of the human genome is from viruses,
14:47
is from ancient retroviruses that incorporated themselves
14:51
into the human germ line.
14:53
So into the human DNA.
14:55
So these are called endogenous retroviruses.
15:04
Which is mind blowing to me, because it's not just saying
15:07
these things are along for the ride or that they might help
15:09
us or hurt us.
15:10
It's saying that we are-- 5-8% of our DNA
15:14
actually comes from viruses.
15:16
And this is another thing that speaks to
15:17
just genetic variation.
15:19
Because viruses do something-- I mean this is called
15:24
horizontal transfer of DNA.
15:27
And you could imagine, as a virus goes from one species to
15:30
the next, as it goes from Species A to B, if it mutates
15:37
to be able to infiltrate these cells, it might take some--
15:41
it'll take the DNA that it already has, that
15:43
makes it, it with it.
15:45
But sometimes, when it starts coding for some of these other
15:48
guys, so let's say that this is a provirus right here.
15:52
Where the blue part is the original virus.
15:55
The yellow is the organism's historic DNA.
16:00
Sometimes when it codes, it takes up little sections of
16:04
the other organism's DNA.
16:07
So maybe most of it was the viral DNA, but it might have,
16:11
when it transcribed and translated itself, it might
16:14
have taken a little bit-- or at least when it translated or
16:16
replicated itself-- it might take a little bit of the
16:18
organism's previous DNA.
16:20
So it's actually cutting parts of DNA from one organism and
16:23
bringing it to another organism.
16:24
Taking it from one member of a species to another member of
16:27
the species.
16:27
But it can definitely go cross-species.
16:29
So you have this idea all of a sudden that DNA can jump
16:32
between species.
16:34
It really kind of-- I don't know, for me it makes me
16:36
appreciate how interconnected-- as a species,
16:39
we kind of imagine that we're by ourselves and can only
16:41
reproduce with each other and have genetic variation within
16:45
a population.
16:45
But viruses introduce this notion of horizontal transfer
16:50
via transduction.
16:53
Horizontal transduction is just the idea of, look when I
16:57
replicate this virus, I might take a little bit of the
17:00
organism that I'm freeloading off of, I might take a little
17:04
bit of their DNA with me.
17:06
And infect that DNA into the next organism.
17:09
So you actually have this DNA, this jumping,
17:11
from organism to organism.
17:13
So it kind of unifies all DNA-based life.
17:17
Which is all the life that we know on the planet.
17:20
And if all of this isn't creepy enough-- and actually
17:24
maybe I'll save the creepiest part for the end.
17:28
But there's a whole-- we could talk all about the different
17:30
classes of viruses.
17:31
But just so you're familiar with some of the terminology,
17:33
when a virus attacks bacteria, which they often do.
17:37
And we study these the most because this might be a good
17:41
alternative to antibiotics.
17:42
Because viruses that attack bacteria might-- sometimes the
17:45
bacteria is far worse for the virus-- but these are called
17:47
bacteriaphages.
17:52
And I've already talked to you about how they have their DNA.
17:55
But since bacteria have hard walls, they will just inject
17:57
the DNA inside of the bacteria.
18:00
And when you talk about DNA, this idea of a provirus.
18:06
So when a virus lyses it like this, this is
18:09
called the lytic cycle.
18:11
This is just some terminology that's good to know if you're
18:13
going to take a biology exam about this stuff.
18:16
And when the virus incorporates it into the DNA
18:18
and lays dormant, incorporates into the DNA of the host
18:22
organism and lays dormant for awhile, this is called the
18:25
lysogenic cycle.
18:28
And normally, a provirus is essentially experiencing a
18:32
lysogenic cycle in eurkaryotes, in organisms that
18:35
have a nuclear membrane.
18:38
Normally when people talk about the lysogenic cycle,
18:40
they're talking about viral DNA laying dormant in the DNA
18:44
of bacteria.
18:45
Or bacteriophage DNA laying dormant
18:48
in the DNA of bacteria.
18:51
But just to kind of give you an idea of what this, quote
18:53
unquote, looks like, right here.
18:59
I got these two pictures from Wikipedia.
19:01
One is from the CDC.
19:11
These little green dots you see right here all over the
19:14
surface, this big thing you see here, this is a white
19:17
blood cell.
19:20
Part of the human immune system.
19:21
This is a white blood cell.
19:27
And what you see emerging from the surface, essentially
19:31
budding from the surface of this white blood cell-- and
19:34
this gives you a sense of scale too--
19:36
these are HIV-1 viruses.
19:39
And so you're familiar with the terminology, the HIV is a
19:46
virus that infects white blood cells.
19:51
AIDS is the syndrome you get once your immune system is
19:54
weakened to the point.
19:55
And then many people suffer infections that people with a
19:58
strong immune system normally won't suffer from.
20:01
But this is creepy.
20:03
These things went inside this huge cell, they used the
20:06
cell's own mechanism to reproduce its own DNA or its
20:11
own RNA and these protein capsids.
20:14
And then they bud from the cell and take a little bit of
20:16
the membrane with it.
20:17
And they can even leave some of their DNA behind in this
20:20
cell's own DNA.
20:22
So they really change what the cell is all about.
20:25
This is another creepy picture.
20:26
These are bacteriaphages.
20:34
And these show you what I said before.
20:36
This is a bacteria right here.
20:38
This is its cell wall.
20:41
And it's hard.
20:42
So it's hard to just emerge into it.
20:45
Or you can't just merge, fuse membranes with it.
20:47
So they hang out on the outside of this bacteria.
20:52
And they are essentially injecting their genetic
20:55
material into the bacteria itself.
20:58
And you could imagine, just looking at the
20:59
size of these things.
21:01
I mean, this is a cell.
21:02
And it looks like a whole planet or something.
21:04
Or this is a bacteria and these
21:05
things are so much smaller.
21:06
Roughly 1/100 of a bacteria.
21:08
And these are much less than 1/100 of this cell we're
21:10
talking about.
21:11
And they're extremely hard to filter for.
21:15
To kind of keep out.
21:16
Because they are such, such small particles.
21:20
If you think that these are exotic things that exist for
21:23
things like HIV or Ebola , which they do cause, or SARS,
21:31
you're right.
21:32
But they're also common things.
21:33
I mean, I said at the beginning of this video that I
21:35
have a cold.
21:36
And I have a cold because some viruses have infected the
21:40
tissue in my nasal passage.
21:42
And they're causing me to have a runny nose and whatnot.
21:46
And viruses also cause the chicken pox.
21:48
They cause the herpes simplex virus.
21:50
Causes cold sores.
21:51
So they're with us all around.
21:53
I can almost guarantee you have some virus
21:56
with you as you speak.
21:57
They're all around you.
21:58
But it's a very
22:04
philosophically puzzling question.
22:06
Because I started with, at the beginning, are these life?
22:09
And at first when I just showed it to you, look they
22:11
are just this protein with some nucleic
22:13
acid molecule in it.
22:15
And it's not doing anything.
22:16
And that doesn't look like life to me.
22:17
It's not moving around.
22:18
It doesn't have a metabolism.
22:19
It's not eating.
22:20
It's not reproducing.
22:21
But then all of a sudden, when you think about what it's
22:23
doing to cells and how it uses cells to kind of reproduce.
22:27
It kind of like-- in business terms it's asset light.
22:29
It doesn't need all of the machinery because it can use
22:31
other people's machinery to replicate itself.
22:35
You almost kind of want to view it as a
22:38
smarter form of life.
22:39
Because it doesn't go through all of the trouble of what
22:42
every other form of life has.
22:44
It makes you question what life is, or even what we are.
22:47
Are we these things that contain DNA or are we just
22:51
transport mechanisms for the DNA?
22:54
And these are kind of the more important things.
22:56
And these viral infections are just battles between different
22:59
forms of DNA and RNA and whatnot.
23:02
Anyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.
23:04
But hopefully this gives you a good idea of what viruses are
23:08
and why they really are, in my mind, the most fascinating

0:00
Like we did with parabolic mirrors, what I really want to do in this video
0:04
is just for put objects at different distances relative to this convex lens
0:10
and just think about what its image will look like
0:12
And the whole point of doing that is going through all the different situations but
0:16
more is getting practice of how to think about it
0:19
So let's first put an object out here
0:23
That's more than two focal lengths away from the lens
0:28
I'll put the object right here
0:30
We'll do our classic arrow
0:32
Actually I'll make a point here. When we dealt with parabolic mirrors
0:37
we talked about the distance of two focal lengths being our center of curvature
0:42
Over here we're just gonna call it 2 focal length, because it's really not
0:45
the center of curvature--
0:47
or this distance really isn't the radius of curvature of
0:51
each of these curves. So we're just gonna call it 2 focal lengths
0:53
So with that said, let's actually try to figure out what the image of this thing would look like
0:59
as the light from it gets refracted through this lens
1:02
So like always, it's useful to draw one ray
1:06
Every point of this object is emitting rays in every direction
1:10
because it's diffusely reflecting light
1:12
So we can just pick rays that are convenient
1:15
So we can go from the tip of the arrow
1:17
and go parallel to our principal axis just like that
1:22
I'm not gonna show all the internal refraction within this lens right here
1:26
But we know that if we enter the lens, parallel to the principal axis
1:31
when we get refracted, we will go through the focal point on the other side of the lens
1:41
And on the left side of the lens
1:45
we'll do another ray that goes through the focal point on the left side
1:48
and then comes out parallel
2:00
The incident ray goes through the left focal point
2:04
and when it gets refracted, it will now be parallel
2:10
And so the light that came from that point of the object will reconverge right over here
2:18
So if you did this for every point of this object
2:21
if you did a point in the middle right over here, it would reconverge right over here
2:25
If you did this point right over here, it would reconverge right over there
2:30
So the image of this object is going to look like this
2:38
So it's going to be a real image. The rays actually converge here. So it's a real inverted image
2:46
It was pointing up before. Now it's pointing that down
2:48
And in this situation, it's actually going to be smaller than the original
2:53
So, real, smaller, inverted image
2:57
Let's do a couple of other scenarios
3:00
Let me copy and paste this before starting this video to save on time
3:05
Let's do a situation now where the object is at the 2 focal distances. I guess we can call that
3:13
Let's put the object right over here
3:20
We can do the exact same thing
3:22
You might want to do it on paper on your own to get some practice doing it
3:26
We'll do one ray that's parallel
3:31
When it gets refracted, it will go through the focal point on the other side
3:36
And then we'll do another ray that goes through the focal point on the left side
3:40
and then it will become parallel
3:45
And they can reconverge or they converge right over there
3:48
So you can see that this is actually a parallelogram
3:53
This distance right there is going to be the same thing as that distance over here
3:58
It is actually--I don't want to say symmetry. You can't flip it over
4:01
But this is a--and this distance right over here is going to be the same
4:05
thing as this distance over here. I won't go into all the geometry
4:08
Anyway, this would be an inverted image of exactly the same size at the exact same distance
4:17
Actually I didn't talk about distance in this one over here
4:19
Over here, it's a real image; it's smaller and it's also going to be closer in
4:24
than this one was. It's gonna be closer to lens
4:27
But here the image is going to be the same size as the original object
4:33
It's going to be inverted, but it's going to be at the same distance from the lens
4:37
just on the other side. Once again this is a real image
4:41
Let's do another one
4:45
Copy and paste
4:48
So let's stick something between one focal length and two focal lengths
4:53
So what's put my object right over there
5:03
So once again, let's go parallel
5:06
then we will refract through the focus on the other side
5:16
And then let's go through the focus on the left side
5:19
And then we will refract and go parallel
5:25
So here, we will have--remember, I could use any point. Here I just used the tip
5:30
because I know the base will converge over there
5:34
If I took 2 points, it would go converge right back there
5:38
And then if I did with a point right here
5:40
and I did that same exercise, it would go right over there
5:43
And so the whole image would show up over here
5:47
So here, it's real; it's inverted; and it's larger
5:50
and it is now further away from the lens than the object on the other side
5:57
This is really kind of the reverse of the first example
6:00
The first example, the object was larger and more than two focal lengths away
6:04
and the image was in this range
6:06
Now the object is here and now the image's on the other side. So they're kind of--
6:10
that's really just the other side of that first examples
6:13
Let's do a couple more
6:18
So let's put the object at the focal point and see what would happen
6:27
And sometimes people memorize this type of things for physics exams
6:31
You don't need to. All you have to do is remember just think about 2 rays
6:35
usually from the tip of the arrow that gives you a sense what the image will look like
6:38
and you do one parallel and one that goes through the focal point
6:42
Well, with that said
6:43
we're gonna do something slightly different when something is sitting at the focal point
6:48
When something is sitting at the focal point
6:50
one is we can do the parallel
6:54
It will be refracted through the focal point on the other side
6:58
And then instead of doing a ray that goes through the focal point on this side
7:04
because actually you can't. You're sitting on the focal point right there
7:08
Let's do a ray that does not get refracted. We did a similar thing with the parabolic mirrors
7:13
What I want do is a ray that'll go right to the center of the lens
7:19
where it won't get refracted
7:22
It's just go straight through the center of the lens
7:28
So what you have here is, both of these rays that were diverging from this point from this tip
7:35
they don't reconverge anywhere
7:37
And they don't even look like they're diverging from another point
7:39
if someone's eyeball is right over here
7:43
They're just going to see these as 2 parallel rays of light
7:47
So no image will form. Not a real image or virtual image
7:50
So we can say no image is going to form
7:57
Now the last case is, let's put the object less than one focal distance away
8:09
Let's put the object right over here. And think about what happens
8:16
Once again, the light ray from this tip
8:19
where to go parallel. It will be refracted through the focal point on the other side
8:24
And then let's do another light ray, going
8:26
in a direction as if it were coming the direction of the focal point on this side
8:30
So it comes from that direction
8:32
The light ray would go like that
8:34
And then it would come out on the other side parallel
8:40
So clearly, these two light rays are not converging
8:43
So no real image's going to form
8:45
But they do look like they're diverging from some point
8:51
Continue these lines. They both look like they're coming from a point right over there
8:59
So what's going to happen? If someone's eyes are processing these light rays
9:04
they're gonna see the tip of this arrow all the way up here
9:06
They're gonna see the base of this arrow down here
9:11
And essentially, they're going to see a magnified virtual image of the actual arrow

SAL KHAN: I'm here with our exercise guru, Ben Eater--
0:03
BEN EATER: Hi, Sal.
0:04
SAL KHAN: --who made this exercise, and now we're
0:05
going to try to work through it.
0:07
So let's see.
0:07
It says what are the factors of 9?
0:10
You can re-size this box with 9 dots-- the box
0:13
has 9 dots-- to help you find the factors.
0:15
BEN EATER: So what you're looking at,
0:17
is you've got these 9 dots on the screen.
0:19
And right now, there are just 1 row of 9 dots.
0:22
And if you grab that little thing
0:24
on the right side of the box and move that around to the left--
0:27
SAL KHAN: Oh, that's neat.
0:28
BEN EATER: --you still have 9 dots,
0:29
but they're arranged differently.
0:31
SAL KHAN: I see.
0:31
BEN EATER: And so what you can see is, try to get them
0:33
so you have the same number in each row.
0:35
SAL KHAN: I see, so this one.
0:36
So if you have-- let's see, not the same number.
0:39
BEN EATER: There you go.
0:40
SAL KHAN: Oh, 3 there.
0:41
And so you could get to 9 by literally
0:43
multiplying 3 rows times 3 columns.
0:47
BEN EATER: That's right.
0:48
SAL KHAN: And you get to 9.
0:49
BEN EATER: So 3 is a factor.
0:51
SAL KHAN: And then we would write that in this box right
0:52
over here.
0:53
BEN EATER: Mm-hm.
0:54
SAL KHAN: So we'd write 3-- do we have to write 3 twice,
0:57
because we have-- or is just writing 3 once--
0:59
BEN EATER: 3 is the factor--
1:00
SAL KHAN: 3 is a factor.
1:00
BEN EATER: --so you just put it once.
1:01
SAL KHAN: We don't have to write it.
1:02
If we wrote it twice would it be wrong?
1:04
BEN EATER: Uh-huh, yes, actually.
1:05
SAL KHAN: It would?
1:05
OK, so--
1:05
BEN EATER: We do mark that wrong.
1:06
SAL KHAN: --you actually do mark that wrong.
1:08
OK, so there's 3 and 3.
1:09
But there was also, right when you started, you had 9 and 1.
1:11
BEN EATER: That's right.
1:12
Both of those are factors.
1:13
SAL KHAN: And I don't have to write
1:14
these in any special order?
1:15
BEN EATER: No, no.
1:16
SAL KHAN: 1 and 9.
1:17
BEN EATER: Just got to get them all.
1:18
SAL KHAN: And I believe that's all there is.
1:21
And we could look at the other ones,
1:22
and we can see, look 2 and 8 definitely--
1:25
BEN EATER: No.
1:26
SAL KHAN: No, that's not working out.
1:28
It's interesting for people to think
1:29
about why these aren't working out.
1:30
BEN EATER: Right.
1:31
Yeah, you can't divide 2 into 9.
1:36
SAL KHAN: And this just gets us to 1 and 9 again,
1:38
and we don't want to repeat it.
1:39
BEN EATER: Those are the same factors.
1:40
SAL KHAN: Exactly.
1:40
So let's check our answer.
1:41
Let's see how we're doing.
1:42
BEN EATER: OK.
1:43
SAL KHAN: Let's see.
1:44
There we go.
1:44
We got it all right.
1:45
Let's do one more.
1:46
BEN EATER: OK.
1:47
SAL KHAN: Let's do one more.
1:48
Correct.
1:48
The next question.
1:52
You can resize this box with 16 dots
1:53
to help you find the factor.
1:55
It's 1 and 16.
1:56
BEN EATER: 1 and 16 are factors, sure.
1:57
SAL KHAN: So me write those.
1:58
BEN EATER: Those are all its factors.
1:58
SAL KHAN: So 1 and 16.
2:00
So let's play with this box here.
2:04
That's not working.
2:05
That's not working.
2:07
So I'm trying to figure out-- so this is essentially
2:10
going 2 times-- 2 might be a factor if I could just--
2:14
oh look, it is.
2:15
BEN EATER: There it is, yeah.
2:15
2 is a factor
2:16
SAL KHAN: 2 is a factor.
2:17
BEN EATER: And so is 8.
2:18
SAL KHAN: Exactly, exactly.
2:19
2 rows of 8 works.
2:21
And so we could say 2 and 8 are factors.
2:24
BEN EATER: And if you think about it,
2:26
2 and 8 both divide into 16.
2:27
SAL KHAN: Absolutely.
2:28
BEN EATER: 2 divides eight times.
2:29
SAL KHAN: Yes.
2:30
BEN EATER: Or 8 divides two times.
2:31
SAL KHAN: Yes, you can that.
2:31
You can construct.
2:32
BEN EATER: Right.
2:33
SAL KHAN: 16 dots, you can divide them into 2 groups of 8.
2:35
BEN EATER: That's right.
2:36
SAL KHAN: And I suspect also 8 groups of 2.
2:37
BEN EATER: Well, you can see that.
2:38
SAL KHAN: Let's see, so that's 2 groups
2:40
of 8, really, or 2 rows of 8.
2:41
Let's see, or oh, look at that.
2:44
4 times 4.
2:45
BEN EATER: 4 times 4.
2:45
SAL KHAN: And I'll just write the 4 once.
2:46
BEN EATER: So 4 is a factor.
2:47
SAL KHAN: 4 is a factor.
2:49
And then I can-- and I've probably-- well, I've
2:53
already gotten 8 and 2.
2:54
BEN EATER: Already got that.
2:54
SAL KHAN: Now I have 8 groups of 2 instead of 2 groups of 8,
2:56
but they're still both factors.
2:58
Then you go back to 16 and 1.
2:59
BEN EATER: That's right.
3:00
SAL KHAN: So I think we're done.
3:01
BEN EATER: I think so.
3:01

Welcome to the presentation on quadratic inequalities.
0:05
Before we get to quadratic inequalities, let's just start
0:09
graphing some functions and interpret them and then we'll
0:11
slowly move to the inequalities.
0:13
Let's say I had f of x is equal to x squared plus x minus 6.
0:26
Well, if we wanted to figure out where this function
0:29
intersects the x-axis or the roots of it, we learned in our
0:33
factoring quadratics that we could just set f of x
0:35
is equal to 0, right?
0:36
Because f of x equals 0 when you're intersecting the x-axis.
0:39
So you would say x squared plus x minus 6 is equal to 0.
0:46
And you just factor this quadratic.
0:48
x plus 3 times x minus 2 equals 0.
0:57
And you would learn that the roots of this quadratic
1:03
function are x is equal to minus 3, and x is equal to 2.
1:11
How would we visualize this?
1:13
Well let's draw this quadratic function.
1:21
Those are my very uneven lines.
1:24
So the roots are x is equal to negative 3.
1:27
So this is, right here, x is at minus 3y0 -- by definition one
1:33
of the roots is where f of x is equal to 0.
1:36
So the y, or the f of x axis here is 0.
1:41
The coordinate is 0.
1:42
And this point here is 2 comma 0.
1:47
Once again, this is the x-axis, and this is the f of x-axis.
1:53
We also know that the y intercept is minus 6.
1:56
This isn't the vertex, this is the y intercept.
1:57
And that the graph is going to look something like this -- not
2:03
as bumpy as what I'm drawing, which I think you get the
2:05
general idea if you've ever seen a clean parabola.
2:10
It looks like that with x minus 3 here, and x is 2 here.
2:16
Pretty straightforward.
2:17
We figured out the roots, we figured out what it looks like.
2:19
Now what if we, instead of wanting to know where f of x is
2:22
equal to 0, which is these two points, what if we wanted
2:24
to know where f of x is greater than 0?
2:29
What x values make f of x greater than 0?
2:33
Or another way of saying it, what values make
2:36
the statement true?
2:37
x squared plus x minus 6 is greater than 0, Right,
2:42
this is just f of x.
2:44
Well if we look at the graph, when is f of x greater than 0?
2:49
Well this is the f of x axis, and when are we
2:52
in positive territory?
2:52
Well f of x is greater than 0 here -- let me draw that
2:55
another color -- is greater than 0 here, right?
3:00
Because it's above the x-axis.
3:04
And f of x is greater than 0 here.
3:11
So just visually looking at it, what x values make this true?
3:17
Well, this is true whenever x is less than minus 3, right, or
3:23
whenever x is greater than 2.
3:26
Because when x is greater than 2, f of x is greater than 0,
3:31
and when x is less than negative 3, f of x
3:35
is greater than 0.
3:37
So we would say the solution to this quadratic inequality, and
3:41
we pretty much solved this visually, is x is less than
3:46
minus 3, or x is greater than 2.
3:52
And you could test it out.
3:53
You could try out the number minus 4, and you should get f
3:56
of x being greater than 0.
3:58
You could try it out here.
4:00
Or you could try the number 3 and make sure that this works.
4:04
And you can just make sure that, you could, for example,
4:06
try out the number 0 and make sure that 0 doesn't work,
4:10
right, because 0 is between the two roots.
4:12
It actually turns out that when x is equal to 0, f
4:15
of x is minus 6, which is definitely less than 0.
4:19
So I think this will give you a visual intuition of what this
4:22
quadratic inequality means.
4:24
Now with that visual intuition in the back of your mind, let's
4:26
do some more problems and maybe we won't have to go through the
4:29
exercise of drawing it, but maybe I will draw it just to
4:32
make sure that the point hits home.
4:35
Let me give you a slightly trickier problem.
4:37
Let's say I had minus x squared minus 3x plus 28, let me
4:49
say, is greater than 0.
4:52
Well I want to get rid of this negative sign in
4:53
front of the x squared.
4:54
I just don't like it there because it makes it look
4:56
more confusing to factor.
4:58
I'm going to multiply everything by negative 1.
5:00
Both sides.
5:00
I get x squared plus 3x minus 28, and when you multiply or
5:08
divide by a negative, with any inequality you have
5:10
to swap the sign.
5:11
So this is now going to be less than 0.
5:16
And if we were to factor this, we get x plus 7 times x
5:25
minus 4 is less than 0.
5:29
So if this was equal to 0, we would know that the two roots
5:32
of this function -- let's define the function f of x --
5:37
let's define the function as f of x is equal to -- well we can
5:40
define it as this or this because they're the same thing.
5:42
But for simplicity let's define it as x plus 7 times x minus 4.
5:47
That's f of x, right?
5:49
Well, after factoring it, we know that the roots of this,
5:53
the roots are x is equal to minus 7, and x is equal to 4.
6:05
Now what we want to know is what x values make
6:07
this inequality true?
6:10
If this was any equality we'd be done.
6:12
But we want to know what makes this inequality true.
6:14
I'll give you a little bit of a trick, it's always going to be
6:17
the numbers in between the two roots or outside
6:21
of the two roots.
6:23
So what I do whenever I'm doing this on a test or something, I
6:25
just test numbers that are either between the roots or
6:28
outside of the two roots.
6:30
So let's pick a number that's between x equals minus
6:34
7 and x equals 4.
6:36
Well let's try x equals 0.
6:41
Well, f of 0 is equal to -- we could do it right here -- f of
6:46
0 is 0 plus 7 times 0 minus 4 is just 7 times minus
6:57
4, which is minus 28.
7:00
So f of 0 is minus 28.
7:04
Now is this -- this is the function we're working with
7:08
-- is this less than 0?
7:11
Well yeah, it is.
7:13
So it actually turns that a number, an x value between
7:16
the two roots works.
7:17
So actually I immediately know that the answer here
7:19
is all of the x's that are between the two roots.
7:23
So we could say that the solution to this is
7:29
minus 7 is less than x which is less than 4.
7:34
Because now the other way.
7:35
You could have tried a number that's outside of the roots,
7:38
either less than minus 7 or greater than 4 and
7:41
have tried it out.
7:42
Let's say if you had tried out 5.
7:45
Try x equals 5.
7:48
Well then f of 5 would be 12 times 1, right,
7:55
which is equal to 12.
7:58
f of 5 is 12.
7:59
Is that less than 0?
8:02
No.
8:03
So that wouldn't have worked.
8:04
So once again, that gives us a confidence that we
8:06
got the right interval.
8:07
And if we wanted to think about this visually, because we got
8:11
this answer, when you do it visually it actually makes, I
8:14
think, a lot of sense, but maybe I'm biased.
8:26
If you look at it visually it looks like this.
8:35
If you drive visually and this is the parabola, this is f of
8:40
x, the roots here are minus 7, 0 and 4, 0, we're saying that
8:52
for all x values between these two numbers, f of
8:56
x is less than 0.
8:57
And that makes sense, because when is f of x less than 0?
8:59
Well this is the graph of f of x.
9:06
And when is f of x less than 0?
9:07
Right here.
9:08
So what x values give us that?
9:10
Well the x values that give us that are right here.
9:14
I hope I'm not confusing you too much with
9:15
these visual graphs.
9:16
And you're probably saying, well how do I know
9:19
I don't include 0?
9:20
Well you could try it out, but if you -- oh, well how come
9:23
I don't include the roots?
9:24
Well at the roots, f of x is equal to 0.
9:28
So if this was this, if this was less than or equal to 0,
9:31
then the answer would be negative 7 is less than
9:36
or equal to x is less than or equal to 4.
9:39
I hope that gives you a sense.
9:40
You pretty much just have to try number in between the
9:42
roots, and try number outside of the roots, and that tells
9:45
you what interval will make the inequality true.

The function f of x is graphed.
0:03
What is its domain?
0:05
So the way it's graphed right over here,
0:06
we could assume that this is the entire function
0:08
definition for f of x.
0:11
So for example, if we say, well, what
0:12
does f of x equal when x is equal to negative 9?
0:14
Well, we go up here.
0:15
We don't see it's graphed here.
0:16
It's not defined for x equals negative 9 or x equals
0:20
negative 8 and 1/2 or x equals negative 8.
0:22
It's not defined for any of these values.
0:24
It only starts getting defined at x equals negative 6.
0:29
At x equals negative 6, f of x is equal to 5.
0:32
And then it keeps getting defined. f of x
0:34
is defined for x all the way from x equals
0:37
negative 6 all the way to x equals 7.
0:40
When x equals 7, f of x is equal to 5.
0:43
You can take any x value between negative 6,
0:45
including negative 6, and positive 7,
0:48
including positive 7, and you just
0:50
have to see-- you just have to move up
0:52
above that number, wherever you are,
0:54
to find out what the value of the function is at that point.
0:59
So the domain of this function definition?
1:03
Well, f of x is defined for any x that
1:06
is greater than or equal to negative 6.
1:08
Or we could say negative 6 is less than or equal to x,
1:11
which is less than or equal to 7.
1:13
If x satisfies this condition right over here,
1:16
the function is defined.
1:19
So that's its domain.
1:20
So let's check our answer.
1:21
Let's do a few more of these.
1:24
The function f of x is graphed.
1:26
What is its domain?
1:27
Well, exact similar argument.
1:29
This function is not defined for x is negative 9, negative 8,
1:33
all the way down or all the way up I should say to negative 1.
1:36
At negative 1, it starts getting defined.
1:39
f of negative 1 is negative 5.
1:42
So it's defined for negative 1 is less than or equal to x.
1:45
And it's defined all the way up to x equals 7,
1:48
including x equals 7.
1:50
So this right over here, negative 1
1:51
is less than or equal to x is less than or equal to 7,
1:54
the function is defined for any x that
1:56
satisfies this double inequality right over here.
2:00
Let's do a few more.
2:02
The function f of x is graphed.
2:04
What is its range?
2:06
So now, we're not thinking about the x's
2:08
for which this function is defined.
2:10
We're thinking about the set of y values.
2:14
Where do all of the y values fall into?
2:17
Well, let's see.
2:18
The lowest possible y value or the lowest possible value
2:22
of f of x that we get here looks like it's 0.
2:25
The function never goes below 0.
2:29
So f of x-- so 0 is less than or equal to f of x.
2:32
It does equal 0 right over here. f of negative 4 is 0.
2:36
And then the highest y value or the highest value
2:38
that f of x obtains in this function definition is 8.
2:42
f of 7 is 8.
2:44
It never gets above 8, but it does equal 8 right over here
2:47
when x is equal to 7.
2:48
So 0 is less than f of x, which is less than or equal to 8.
2:55
So that's its range.
2:57
Let's do a few more.
2:58
This is kind of fun.
2:59
The function f of x is graphed.
3:01
What is its domain?
3:02
So once again, this function is defined for negative 2.
3:06
Negative 2 is less than or equal to x, which is less than
3:09
or equal to 5.
3:11
If you give me an x anywhere in between negative 2 and 5,
3:14
I can look at this graph to see where the function is defined.
3:17
f of negative 2 is negative 4.
3:19
f of negative 1 is negative 3.
3:22
So on and so forth, and I can even
3:23
pick the values in between these integers.
3:26
So negative 2 is less than or equal to x, which is less than
3:29
or equal to 5.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,sXP7VhU1gYE,
khan_video_FaDtge_vkbg_105,25% of what number is 80?,MCQ,"•
0:00
Let's give ourselves a little bit
0:02
of practice with percentages.
0:04
So let's ask ourselves, what percent of-- I don't know,
0:13
let's say what percent of 16 is 4?
0:18
And I encourage you to pause this video
0:20
and to try it out yourself.
0:22
So when you're saying what percent of 16 is 4,
0:25
percent is another way of saying, what fraction of 16
0:29
is 4?
0:30
And we just need to write it as a percent, as per 100.
0:35
So if you said what fraction of 16 is 4, you would say,
0:39
well, look, this is the same thing as 4/16,
0:43
which is the same thing as 1/4.
0:48
But this is saying what fraction 4 is of 16.
0:51
You'd say, well, 4 is 1/4 of 16.
0:53
But that still doesn't answer our question.
0:55
What percent?
0:58
So in order to write this as a percent,
0:59
we literally have to write it as something over 100.
1:03
Percent literally means ""per cent.""
1:05
The word ""cent"" you know from cents and century.
1:08
It relates to the number 100.
1:10
So it's per 100.
1:12
So you could say, well, this is going
1:13
to be equal to question mark over 100, the part of 100.
1:19
And there's a bunch of ways that you could think about this.
1:21
You could say, well, look, if in the denominator
1:23
to go from 4 to 100, I have to multiply by 25.
1:27
In the numerator to go from-- I need
1:30
to also multiply by 25 in order to have an equivalent fraction.
1:34
So I'm also going to multiply by 25.
1:37
So 1/4 is the same thing as 25/100.
1:40
And another way of saying 25/100 is this is 25 per 100, or 25%.
1:48
So this is equal to 25%.
1:52
Now, there's a couple of other ways
1:53
you could have thought about it.
1:55
You could have said well, 4/16, this
2:00
is literally 4 divided by 16.
2:02
Well, let me just do the division
2:04
and convert to a decimal, which is
2:05
very easy to convert to a percentage.
2:08
So let's try to actually do this division right over here.
2:10
So we're going to literally divide 4 by 16.
2:15
Now, 16 goes into 4 zero times.
2:18
0 times 16 is 0.
2:20
You subtract, and you get a 4.
2:22
And we're not satisfied just having this remainder.
2:24
We want to keep adding zeroes to get a decimal answer right over
2:30
here.
2:31
So let's put a decimal right over here.
2:33
We're going into the tenths place.
2:35
And let's throw some zeroes right over here.
2:38
The decimal makes sure we keep track of the fact
2:41
that we are now in the tenths, and in the hundredths,
2:43
and in the thousandths place if we have to go that far.
2:45
But let's bring another 0 down.
2:47
16 goes into 40 two times.
2:51
2 times 16 is 32.
2:54
If you subtract, you get 8.
2:57
And you could bring down another 0.
2:59
And we have 16 goes into 80.
3:03
Let's see, 16 goes into 80 five times.
3:08
5 times 16 is 80.
3:11
You subtract, you have no remainder, and you're done.
3:14
4/16 is the same thing as 0.25.
3:17
Now, 0.25 is the same thing as twenty-five hundredths.
3:21
Or, this is the same thing as 25/100,
3:26
which is the same thing as 25%.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,FaDtge_vkbg,

0:00
So, let's think about all the different ways that we can represent 7/9.
0:07
So let's just visualize 7/9.
0:10
So here I have 9 equal sections and 7 ninths you represent as 7 of those equal sections.
0:18
So let me get myself a bigger thing to draw with so that I can fill this in fast. I don't like how that looks, I'm going to use the paintbrush.
0:29
So here we go, so that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. So that's one way of representing 7 ninths, we already know that, that's not too interesting.
0:49
So let's see if we can represent it as the sum of other fractions.
0:53
So let's imagine, maybe we can represent it as, let's do it as 2 ninths (let me get another brush here) so let's represent it as 2 ninths.
1:05
2 over 9, plus ( I don't know) maybe 3 over 9, but that doesn't quite get us to 7 ninths yet.
1:20
2 over 9 plus 3 over 9, that's going to get us to 5 over 9 so we need 2 more, so that's going to be plus another 2 over 9.
1:28
Plus another 2/9, so what would this look like? So let's just draw another grid here, so this is going to look like (so I'm going to put it right below it so we can look at what it looks like).
1:46
So we have 2 ninths, this here is 2 ninths well we have nine equal sections.
1:53
So 2 ninths is going to be, 1 and 2.
2:02
And then we're going to add 3 more ninths, so one, two, three, so we add 3 ninths.
2:15
And then 2 more ninths, that's 1 and 2.
2:22
So notice, when I added 2 ninths to 3 ninths to 2 ninths, this equals 7 ninths.
2:30
And we know that when we add a bunch of fractions like this that have the same denominator, we can just add the numerators.
2:36
And this is why, this is 2/9 and 3/9 and 2/9 and they give me 7/9.
2:41
Actually, let's do this again, this is a lot of fun. So let me draw my grid again.
2:48
And then, let's see what we can do. So let me get my pen tool out and make sure my ink isn't too thick.
3:02
And let's add a couple of ninths. So let's add 1/9 and let's add 2/9 and then we could add (I dunno), maybe we could add 3/9.
3:22
And then we could add, that won't get us, let's see 1/9. I'm going to try to add 4 fractions here.
3:30
So first I'm going to try to add 1/9 and see where that get's us. 1/9 is going to get us right over here.
3:37
So that's 1/9, so let's say we add 2/9 to that. So that's 1 and 2, so that still doesn't get us there.
3:56
So that's 3/9, 1 plus 2 is 3. So let's add 4 ninths.
4:05
So 4/9. So let's see where this get's us. Actually, why not.
4:18
And so that's going to get us 1, 2, 3, 4. So that looks like it got us all the way. Because 1+2+4=7 so that's 7/9.
4:33
So what could we put here? We could actually put 0/9. Why not? So we could put in 0/9.
4:44
And how would we visualize that? Well we're saying none of these. So this is 1/9 plus 2/9 plus 4/9 equals 7/9.

Let's do some examples comparing absolute values.
0:04
So let's say we were to ask ourselves
0:06
how the absolute value of negative 9, I should say,
0:12
how that compares to the absolute value of-- let
0:19
me think of a good number-- let's say
0:20
the absolute value of negative 7.
0:23
So let's think about this a little bit,
0:25
and let's think about what negative 9 looks like,
0:27
or where it is on the number line, where negative 7
0:29
is on the number line.
0:30
Let's look at what the absolute values mean,
0:33
and then we should probably be able to do this comparison.
0:36
So there's a couple of ways to think about it.
0:38
One is you could draw them on the number line.
0:40
So if this is 0, if this is negative 7, and then
0:46
this is negative 9 right over here.
0:49
Now, when you take the absolute value of a number,
0:52
you're really saying how far is that number from 0,
0:55
whether it's to the left or to the right of 0.
0:58
So, for example, negative 9 is 9 to the left of 0.
1:03
So the absolute value of negative 9 is exactly 9.
1:07
This evaluates to 9,
1:09
Negative 7 is exactly 7 to the left of 0.
1:16
So the absolute value of negative 7 is positive 7.
1:20
And so if you were to compare 9 and 7,
1:22
this is a little bit more straightforward.
1:23
9 is clearly greater than 7.
1:29
And if you ever get confused with the greater than or less
1:31
than symbols, just remember that the symbol
1:33
is larger on the left-hand side.
1:35
So that's the greater than side.
1:37
If I were to write this-- and this
1:39
is actually also a true statement.
1:41
If you took these without the absolute value signs,
1:43
it is also true that negative 9 is less than negative 7.
1:49
Notice the smaller side is on the smaller number.
1:52
And so that's the interesting thing.
1:54
Negative 9 is less than negative 7,
1:56
but their absolute value, since negative 9
1:58
is further to the left of 0, it is-- the absolute value
2:03
of negative 9, which is 9, is greater
2:05
than the absolute value of negative 7.
2:08
Another way to think about it is if you take the absolute value
2:11
of a number, it's really just going
2:12
to be the positive version of that number.
2:14
So if you took the absolute value of 9, that equals 9.
2:19
Or the absolute value of negative 9,
2:21
that is also equal to 9.
2:22
Well, when you think of it visually,
2:23
that's because both of these numbers
2:25
are exactly 9 away from 0.
2:27
This is 9 to the right of 0, and this is 9 to the left of 0.
2:31
Let's do a few more of these.
2:33
So let's say that we wanted to compare the absolute value of 2
2:39
to the absolute value of 3.
2:43
Well, the absolute value of a positive number
2:46
is just going to be that same value.
2:47
2 is two to the right of 0, so this is just
2:50
going to evaluate to 2.
2:51
And then the absolute value of 3,
2:53
that's just going to evaluate to 3.
2:55
It's actually pretty straightforward.
2:57
So 2 is clearly the smaller number here.
3:00
And so we clearly get 2 is less than 3,
3:02
or the absolute value of 2 is less than 3.
3:05
So we have a less than right over here.
3:07
Let's say you wanted to compare--
3:10
I'm trying to find a suitable color-- the absolute value
3:13
of negative 8 to the absolute value of 8.
3:18
Well, one way to think about is that they're
3:20
both 8 away from 0.
3:22
This 8 to the left of 0.
3:24
This is 8 to the right of 0.
3:25
So both of these things evaluate to 8.
3:28
Absolute value of negative 8 is 8.
3:31
Absolute value of 8 is 8.
3:33
And so, clearly, 8 is equal to 8.
3:37
Let me do a couple more examples.
3:39
Let's say I wanted to compare the absolute value
3:43
of negative 1, and I want to compare that to positive 2.
3:48
So the absolute value of negative 1
3:50
is just the positive version of 1,
3:53
or it's just the positive version of negative 1,
3:56
which is just 1.
3:57
So 1 is clearly less than 2.
3:59
Or the other way to think about it, the absolute value
4:02
of negative 1 is clearly less than 2.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,hKkBlcnU9pw,

Let's graph ourselves some inequalities.
0:03
So let's say I had the inequality y is less than or
0:06
equal to 4x plus 3.
0:11
On our xy coordinate plane, we want to show all the x and y
0:15
points that satisfy this condition right here.
0:19
So a good starting point might be to break up this less than
0:22
or equal to, because we know how to graph y is
0:24
equal to 4x plus 3.
0:26
So this thing is the same thing as y could be less than
0:31
4x plus 3, or y could be equal to 4x plus 3.
0:38
That's what less than or equal means.
0:41
It could be less than or equal.
0:43
And the reason why I did that on this first example problem
0:46
is because we know how to graph that.
0:47
So let's graph that.
0:52
Try to draw a little bit neater than that.
0:55
So that is-- no, that's not good.
0:57
So that is my vertical axis, my y-axis.
1:02
This is my x-axis, right there.
1:07
And then we know the y-intercept, the
1:09
y-intercept is 3.
1:11
So the point 0, 3-- 1, 2, 3-- is on the line.
1:16
And we know we have a slope of 4.
1:21
Which means if we go 1 in the x-direction, we're going to go
1:25
up 4 in the y.
1:26
So 1, 2, 3, 4.
1:29
So it's going to be right here.
1:31
And that's enough to draw a line.
1:33
We could even go back in the x-direction.
1:35
If we go 1 back in the x-direction, we're
1:37
going to go down 4.
1:38
1, 2, 3, 4.
1:40
So that's also going to be a point on the line.
1:43
So my best attempt at drawing this line is going to look
1:47
something like-- this is the hardest part.
1:52
It's going to look something like that.
1:55
That is a line.
1:57
It should be straight.
1:58
I think you get the idea.
2:00
That right there is the graph of y is equal to 4x plus 3.
2:05
So let's think about what it means to be less than.
2:07
So all of these points satisfy this
2:09
inequality, but we have more.
2:11
This is just these points over here.
2:13
What about all these where y ix less than 4x plus 3?
2:17
So let's think about what this means.
2:20
Let's pick up some values for x.
2:22
When x is equal to 0, what does this say?
2:26
When x is equal to 0, then that means y is going to be
2:29
less than 0 plus 3. y is less than 3.
2:33
When x is equal to negative 1, what is this telling us?
2:40
4 times negative 1 is negative 4, plus 3 is negative 1. y
2:44
would be less than negative 1.
2:46
When x is equal to 1, what is this telling us?
2:50
4 times 1 is 4, plus 3 is 7.
2:54
So y is going to be less than 7.
2:57
So let's at least try to plot these.
2:59
So when x is equal to-- let's plot this one first. When x is
3:04
equal to 0, y is less than 3.
3:11
So it's all of these points here-- that I'm shading in in
3:15
green-- satisfy that right there.
3:19
If I were to look at this one over here, when x is negative
3:22
1, y is less than negative 1.
3:26
So y has to be all of these points down here.
3:30
When x is equal to 1, y is less than 7.
3:36
So it's all of these points down here.
3:39
And in general, you take any point x-- let's say you take
3:44
this point x right there.
3:47
If you evaluate 4x plus 3, you're going to get the point
3:50
on the line.
3:52
That is that x times 4 plus 3.
3:55
Now the y's that satisfy it, it could be equal to that
3:58
point on the line, or it could be less than.
4:01
So it's going to go below the line.
4:03
So if you were to do this for all the possible x's, you
4:06
would not only get all the points on this line which
4:11
we've drawn, you would get all the points below the line.
4:15
So now we have graphed this inequality.
4:19
It's essentially this line, 4x plus 3, with all of the area
4:23
below it shaded.
4:25
Now, if this was just a less than, not less than or equal
4:29
sign, we would not include the actual line.
4:32
And the convention to do that is to actually make the line a
4:36
dashed line.
4:37
This is the situation if we were dealing with just less
4:44
than 4x plus 3.
4:46
Because in that situation, this wouldn't apply, and we
4:49
would just have that.
4:50
So the line itself wouldn't have satisfied it, just the
4:53
area below it.
4:55
Let's do one like that.
4:57
So let's say we have y is greater than negative x
5:06
over 2 minus 6.
5:09
So a good way to start-- the way I like to start these
5:11
problems-- is to just graph this equation right here.
5:14
So let me just graph-- just for fun-- let me graph y is
5:18
equal to-- this is the same thing as negative 1/2 minus 6.
5:24
So if we were to graph it, that is my vertical axis, that
5:30
is my horizontal axis.
5:34
And our y-intercept is negative 6.
5:36
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
5:40
So that's my y-intercept.
5:42
And my slope is negative 1/2.
5:43
Oh, that should be an x there, negative 1/2 x minus 6.
5:49
So my slope is negative 1/2, which means when I go 2 to the
5:53
right, I go down 1.
5:55
So if I go 2 to the right, I'm going to go down 1.
6:02
If I go 2 to the left, if I go negative 2, I'm
6:05
going to go up 1.
6:06
So negative 2, up 1.
6:09
So my line is going to look like this.
6:11
My line is going to look like that.
6:15
That's my best attempt at drawing the line.
6:17
So that's the line of y is equal to
6:19
negative 1/2 x minus 6.
6:22
Now, our inequality is not greater than or equal, it's
6:24
just greater than negative x over 2 minus 6, or greater
6:28
than negative 1/2 x minus 6.
6:30
So using the same logic as before, for any x-- so if you
6:35
take any x, let's say that's our particular x we want to
6:39
pick-- if you evaluate negative x over 2 minus 6,
6:43
you're going to get that point right there.
6:44
You're going to get the point on the line.
6:47
But the y's that satisfy this inequality are the y's
6:50
greater than that.
6:51
So it's going to be not that point-- in fact, you draw an
6:54
open circle there-- because you can't include the point of
6:58
negative 1/2 x minus 6.
7:00
But it's going to be all the y's greater than that.
7:05
That'd be true for any x.
7:06
You take this x.
7:07
You evaluate negative 1/2 or negative x over 2 minus 6,
7:11
you're going to get this point over here.
7:13
The y's that satisfy it are all the y's above that.
7:19
So all of the y's that satisfy this equation, or all of the
7:22
coordinates that satisfy this equation, is this entire area
7:25
above the line.
7:28
And we're not going to include the line.
7:30
So the convention is to make this line into a dashed line.
7:33
And let me draw-- I'm trying my best to turn it into a
7:35
dashed line.
7:36
I'll just erase sections of the line, and hopefully it
7:41
will look dashed to you.
7:43
So I'm turning that solid line into a dashed line to show
7:45
that it's just a boundary, but it's not included in the
7:48
coordinates that satisfy our inequality.
7:51
The coordinates that satisfy our equality are all of this
7:53
yellow stuff that I'm shading above the line.

Write six hundred forty-five million five hundred
0:05
eighty-four thousand four hundred
0:08
sixty-two in standard form.
0:10
So let's tackle this piece by piece.
0:13
So the first part we have six hundred
0:16
and forty-five million.
0:21
So let's think about that.
0:22
So we have six hundred and forty-five.
0:26
But it's not just six hundred forty-five.
0:28
We have six hundred forty-five millions.
0:31
So we could view that as 645 times 1,000,000.
0:37
One million is one followed by six zeroes.
0:41
So this piece right here is this right over here.
0:44
That is six hundred and forty-five million.
0:48
And what is that when we write it out?
0:50
If we were to multiply this out, this is equal to-- it
0:53
would be 645 times this 1 with six zeroes behind it.
0:57
So this would be equal to 600-- I'll write it like this.
1:01
This is equal to 645, and then we have our six zeroes.
1:07
One, two, three, one, two, three.
1:10
That's just this part of the number.
1:13
And I'm going to do it kind of slow and do all of the
1:16
different parts of the problem, but once you get some
1:18
practice, you'll find that these are a bit second nature,
1:20
and you won't have to go through all of these steps.
1:22
You'll just be able to write the number.
1:24
Now, let's move on to the next part.
1:25
We have five hundred and eighty-four.
1:28
Let me write that down.
1:33
Well, I'll write it like this.
1:34
584 thousand.
1:40
So let me write the thousand.
1:42
So 584 thousand.
1:43
So it's 584 times 1,000.
1:47
And what's that going to look like?
1:48
So that's this whole part right here.
1:51
So 584 times 1,000 is equal to what?
1:55
Well, it's going to be 584 with three zeroes behind it,
1:59
or you could view it as 584 times the 1, and then you're
2:01
going to have three zeroes in the final answer.
2:04
So it's going to be 584,000.
2:11
We have our three zeroes at the end.
2:13
584, three zeroes.
2:15
So that's that part.
2:16
And then finally, we have four hundred sixty-two, and that's
2:22
just 462, straight up.
2:24
You could view it as 462 ones.
2:28
So then you just have 462, which
2:31
obviously equals just 462.
2:35
Now our number is all of these combined.
2:38
It is 645,000,000 and 584,000 and 462.
2:45
So one way to think about it is that you could add these
2:48
three numbers.
2:49
So if we were to add them, we get 645,584,462.
3:08
Now, I said it'll become a little bit of second nature to
3:10
you in a little bit, and the way to think about that, the
3:13
easiest way to think about that, is millions will have
3:16
six zeroes behind them, thousands will have three
3:18
zeroes behind them, and just regular numbers have no zeroes
3:22
behind them.
3:23
So what you can do when you kind of want to learn it
3:25
second nature, you'll just look at the six hundred and
3:28
forty-five million, so you'll write 645, and you'll kind of
3:33
keep in the back of your mind that you're going to have to
3:35
have six more digits to the right of this.
3:38
And then you say five hundred and eighty-four thousand, so
3:41
then you have your five hundred and eighty-four
3:44
thousand, so then you write that down, 584,000, keeping in
3:50
mind that you're going to need three digits to
3:51
the right of that.
3:52
And so if they didn't tell us 462, we would just put three
3:55
zeroes here, and that would also fulfill the six zeroes we
3:58
need behind 645,000,000.
4:00
But then they tell us 462, so we just write that right here.

- [Voiceover] We've seen this reaction before,
0:03
this is the decomposition
0:04
of nitrogen dioxide
0:06
to nitric oxide and oxygen.
0:08
And we've already proved it's a second-order reaction,
0:11
and we also found the rate constant
0:14
at 300 degrees C.
0:16
So in part a, if the initial concentration of
0:19
nitrogen dioxide is .008 Molar,
0:22
what is the concentration of nitrogen dioxide
0:25
after 20 minutes?
0:27
Well, we know this is a second-order reaction.
0:30
So we can use our integrated rate law
0:32
for a second-order reaction.
0:34
And that was one over the concentration of A
0:38
minus one over the initial concentration of A
0:43
is equal to the rate constant K
0:45
times the time.
0:47
So this is one form of our integrated rate equation.
0:51
Now let's think about what we're gonna plug in here.
0:53
We're trying to solve for the final concentration
0:57
of NO2.
0:58
So we're gonna put in here
0:59
one over the concentration of nitrogen dioxide
1:03
at 20 minutes,
1:05
right this would be minus
1:06
one over the initial concentration of nitrogen dioxide,
1:10
which is .008.
1:12
So we plug that into here.
1:14
So one over .008,
1:16
this is equal to
1:18
our rate constant
1:19
which is .54,
1:22
so we have .54,
1:24
one over Molar times seconds.
1:28
And then we're gonna multiply that by the time.
1:32
Notice we have seconds here,
1:33
for our rate constant we were given minutes.
1:36
So we need to convert minutes to seconds.
1:39
So if you have 20 minutes,
1:42
all right we know that there are 60 seconds
1:45
for every one minute.
1:49
So if we multiply, minutes cancels,
1:51
and that gives us seconds.
1:52
So 20 times 60 is 1200.
1:56
So we have 1200 seconds.
2:00
All right, so let's go ahead and let's do the math.
2:03
So let's get out the calculator here,
2:04
and we'll multiply
2:06
.54 by 1200.
2:10
And so on the right side we have 648.
2:17
Notice your units, your seconds would cancel here.
2:20
And the left, what's one over .008?
2:24
So let's do that.
2:25
What's one divided by .008?
2:28
That gives us 125.
2:31
So we have 125 here,
2:34
and we have our minus,
2:35
this would be one over the concentration of NO2.
2:40
All right so now of course we're just solving
2:42
for the concentration of nitrogen dioxide.
2:44
So one over the concentration of NO2
2:48
is equal to 648 plus 125.
2:52
And that of course, is 773.
2:56
So to solve for the concentration
2:59
of nitrogen dioxide,
3:02
that would be one over 773.
3:06
So let's get our calculator out,
3:07
and let's do one divided by 773.
3:12
And so the concentration would be .0013.
3:17
So this is equal to
3:18
.0013 Molar.
3:24
So if you start with a concentration of .008 Molar,
3:30
the concentration after 20 minutes
3:32
goes down to .0013 Molar.
3:37
All right, let's move on to part b.
3:39
So in part b, if the initial concentration
3:42
of nitrogen dioxide is .008 Molar again,
3:46
what is the half-life?
3:47
So in the previous video,
3:48
we talked about the equation for the half-life
3:51
of a second-order reaction.
3:53
And we found that the half life for a second-order reaction
3:56
is equal to one over the rate constant K,
3:59
times the initial concentration of A.
4:03
And so for this case,
4:05
this would be one over the rate constant which is .54,
4:10
one over Molar times seconds.
4:13
And then we need to multiply that
4:15
by the initial concentration of A,
4:17
which of course would be the initial concentration
4:19
of NO2.
4:20
So that's times
4:21
.00800 Molar.
4:26
All right, so let's do that math.
4:29
So we get out our calculator here,
4:30
and we take .54 and we multiply that by .008.
4:36
So we get .00432,
4:41
and so we take one divided by that,
4:43
one divided by our answer here
4:45
will get us our half-life.
4:48
So we get 2.3 times ten to the second,
4:52
seconds right?
4:53
So this is equal to,
4:55
t 1/2 is equal to 2.3
4:59
times 10 to the second seconds.
5:03
Or we could say approximately 230 seconds.
5:10
So if we're going from a concentration of .008,
5:14
if we're going from a concentration of .008 Molar,
5:19
and we wait approximately 230 seconds,
5:23
the concentration goes down to .004.
5:26
So we have half of our initial concentration
5:29
after one half-life.
5:31
All right, let's compare what we got in b
5:35
to what we're gonna get in c.
5:37
Because in c we're changing
5:38
the initial concentration of N02 to .004 Molar.
5:43
So now what's the half-life?
5:45
So the calculation is the same, right?
5:47
We're gonna plug in t 1/2 is equal to one over K,
5:51
times the initial concentration of A.
5:54
The difference is we're changing the initial concentration.
5:57
All right so K stays the same,
5:59
so .54 one over Molar times seconds.
6:03
But now we're gonna plug in .004 instead of .008.
6:08
So we have .004 Molar
6:12
and we're solving for the half-life.
6:15
So once again we can get out our calculator here,
6:17
take .54, multiply that by .004,
6:23
and then if we take one over our answer
6:26
then we should get our half-life.
6:28
So that's 4.6 times ten to the second.
6:34
So this would be equal to,
6:37
so our half life would be equal to
6:40
4.6 times ten to the second...
6:45
Seconds.
6:46
All right? So this is seconds.
6:47
So I think I forgot to point that out
6:49
in the previous example.
6:50
If you're looking at your units,
6:52
the Molar would cancel here,
6:55
and so you'd have one over one over seconds.
6:58
Which of course is equal to seconds.
7:00
So the half-life is measured in seconds.
7:03
It'd be the same thing for up here, right?
7:04
The Molars would cancel,
7:06
we'd have one over one over seconds,
7:09
so we'd get seconds here.
7:10
So this half-life, 4.6,
7:12
let me just make this look more like a 6,
7:14
4.6 times ten to the second,
7:17
that's twice our first half-life.
7:20
So if we're going from a concentration of .004 Molar,
7:25
and we wait
7:28
approximately 460 seconds,
7:32
we're gonna end up with a concentration of .002 Molar.
7:37
So remember, for a second-order reaction,
7:40
the half-life is not constant.
7:42
So we talked about this in the previous video.
7:44
The half-life for a second order reaction
7:47
depends on the concentration that you're starting with.
7:50
And so we can see here,
7:52
we're starting with a concentration
7:55
that's half of the first one,
7:57
and we can see that our half-life is twice as long.
8:01
So this second half-life here is twice as long

as the first half-life that we talked about for part b.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,OmWyMLucEbE,

In your mathematical careers you might
0:03
encounter people who say it is wrong to say
0:05
that i is equal to the principal square root of negative 1.
0:10
And if you ask them why is this wrong,
0:12
they'll show up with this kind of line of logic
0:15
that actually seems pretty reasonable.
0:17
They will tell you that, OK, well
0:19
let's just start with negative 1.
0:21
We know from definition that negative 1
0:23
is equal to i times i.
0:26
Everything seems pretty straightforward right now.
0:28
And then they'll say, well look, if you
0:30
take this, if you assume this part right here,
0:33
then we can replace each of these i's with the square root
0:36
of negative 1.
0:36
And they'd be right.
0:37
So then this would be the same thing
0:39
as the square root of negative 1 times the square root
0:42
of negative 1.
0:43
And then they would tell you that,
0:45
hey, look just from straight up properties
0:48
of the principal square root function,
0:50
they'll tell you that the square root of a times b
0:53
is the same thing as the principal square root
0:55
of a times the principal square root of b.
0:58
And so if you have the principal square root of a times
1:01
the principal square root of b, that's
1:02
the same thing as the square root of a times b.
1:04
So based on this property of the radical of the principal root,
1:09
they'll say that this over here is
1:11
the same thing as the square root
1:13
of negative 1 times negative 1.
1:20
If I have the principal root of the product of two things,
1:23
that's the same thing as the product
1:24
of each of their principal roots.
1:26
I'm doing this in the other order here.
1:28
Here I have the principal root of the products,
1:30
over here I have this on the right.
1:32
And then from that we all know that negative 1 times
1:35
negative 1 is 1.
1:36
So this should be equal to the principal square root of 1.
1:41
And then the principal square root of 1-- Remember,
1:44
this radical means principal square root,
1:45
positive square root, that is just going to be positive 1.
1:51
And they'll say, this is wrong.
1:52
Clearly, negative 1 and positive 1 are not the same thing.
1:59
And they'll argue therefore, you can't make this substitution
2:02
that we did in this step.
2:04
And what you should then point out
2:06
is that this was not the incorrect step.
2:09
That it is true negative 1 is not equal to 1,
2:11
but the faulty line of reasoning here
2:13
was in using this property when both a and b are negative.
2:21
If both a and b are negative, this will never be true.
2:26
So a and b both cannot be negative.
2:36
In fact normally when this property is given-- sometimes
2:38
it's given a little bit in the footnotes
2:40
or you might not even notice it because it's not relevant
2:42
when you're learning it the first time--
2:43
but they'll usually give a little bit of a constraint
2:45
there.
2:45
They'll usually say for a and b greater than or equal to 0.
2:52
So that's where they list this property.
2:53
This is true for a and b greater than or equal 0.
2:56
And in particular, it's false if both a and b are both,
3:00
if they are both negative.
3:03
Now, I've just spent the last three minutes
3:07
saying that people who tell you that this is wrong are wrong.
3:11
But with that said, I will say that you
3:12
have to be a little bit careful about it.
3:16
When we take traditional principal square roots.
3:19
So when you take the principle square root of 4.
3:22
We know that this is positive 2, that 4 actually
3:24
has two square roots.
3:26
There's negative 2 also is a square root of 4.
3:34
If you have negative 2 times negative 2
3:36
it's also equal to 4.
3:38
This radical symbol here means principal square root.
3:42
Or when we're just dealing with real numbers, non
3:44
imaginary, non complex numbers, you
3:46
could really view it as the positive square root.
3:48
This has two square roots, positive and negative 2.
3:50
If you have this radical symbol right here
3:52
principal square roots, it means the positive square root of 2.
3:57
So when you start thinking about taking
3:59
square roots of negative numbers--
4:01
or even in the future we'll do imaginary numbers
4:03
and complex numbers and all the rest--
4:05
you have to expand the definition
4:07
of what this radical means.
4:08
So when you are taking the square root of really
4:12
of any negative number, you're really
4:16
saying that this is no longer the traditional principal
4:19
square root function.
4:20
You're now talking that this is the principal complex square
4:24
root function, or this is now defined
4:25
for complex inputs or the domain,
4:28
it can also generate imaginary or complex outputs,
4:31
or I guess you could call that the range.
4:34
And if you assume that, then really straight
4:36
from this you get that negative, the square root of negative x
4:42
is going to be equal to i times the square root of x.
4:47
And this is only-- and I'm going to make this clear
4:49
because I just told you that this will be false
4:51
if both a and b are negative.
4:52
So this is only true-- So we could
4:55
apply this when x is greater than or equal to 0.
5:06
So if x is greater than or equal to 0,
5:08
then negative x is clearly a negative number,
5:10
or I guess it could also be 0.
5:12
It's a negative number.
5:13
And then we can apply this right over here.
5:16
If x was less than 0, then we would
5:18
be doing all of this nonsense up here.
5:20
And we start to get nonsensical answers.
5:23
And if you look at it this way and you say hey,
5:25
look, i can be the square root of negative one,
5:27
if it's the principal branch of the complex square root
5:30
function.
5:31
Then you could rewrite this right over here
5:33
as the square root of negative 1 times the square root of x.
5:41
And so really the real fault in this logic when people
5:45
say, hey, negative 1 can't be equal to 1,
5:48
the real fault is using this property
5:52
when both a and b, where both of these are negative numbers.
5:57
That will come up with something that is unambiguously false.
6:00
If you expand your definition of the complex
6:03
or expand your definition of the principal root
6:05
to include negative numbers in the domain
6:09
and to include imaginary numbers, then you can do this.
6:13
You can say the square root of negative x
6:16
is the square root of negative 1 times--
6:19
Or you should say the principal square root of negative x--
6:22
I should be particular my words--
6:23
is the same thing as the principal square root
6:26
of negative 1 times the principal square root of x when
6:30
x is greater than or equal to 0.
6:32
And I don't want to confuse you, if x
6:34
is greater than or equal to 0, this negative x, that
6:39
is clearly a negative, or I guess
6:41
you should say a non positive number.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,rYG1D5lUE4I,

0:00
It never hurts to get a lot of practice, so in this video I'm
0:02
just going to do a bunch more of essentially, what we call
0:05
long division problems.
0:07
And so if you have 4 goes into 2,292.
0:17
And I don't know exactly why they call it long division,
0:20
and we saw this in the last video a little bit.
0:23
I didn't call it long division then, but I think the reason
0:26
why is it takes you a long time or it takes a long
0:30
piece of your paper.
0:31
As you go along, you kind of have this thing, this long tail
0:36
that develops on the problem.
0:37
So all of those are, at least, reasons in my head why
0:39
it's called long division.
0:41
But we saw in the last video there's a way to tackle any
0:43
division problem while just knowing your multiplication
0:46
tables up to maybe 10 times 10 or 12 times 12.
0:49
But just as a bit of review, this is the same thing
0:52
as 2,292 divided by 4.
0:58
And it's actually the same thing, and you probably haven't
0:59
seen this notation before, as 2,292 divided by 4.
1:07
This, this, and this are all equivalent statements
1:10
on some level.
1:12
And you could say, hey Sal, that looks like a fraction
1:14
in case you have seen fractions already.
1:17
And that is exactly what it is.
1:18
It is a fraction.
1:20
But anyway, I'll just focus on this format and in future
1:22
videos we'll think about other ways to represent division.
1:26
So let's do this problem.
1:28
So 4 goes into 2 how many times?
1:31
It goes into 2 no times, so let's move on to-- let
1:34
me just switch colors.
1:35
So let's move on to the 22.
1:37
4 goes into 22 how many times?
1:40
Let's see.
1:40
4 times 5 is equal to 20.
1:45
4 times 6 is equal to 24.
1:49
So 6 is too much.
1:51
So 4 goes into 22 five times.
1:55
5 times 4 is 20.
1:58
There's going to be a little bit of a leftover.
2:00
And then we subtract 22 minus 20.
2:03
Well that's just 2.
2:05
And then you bring down this 9.
2:08
And you saw in the last video exactly what this means.
2:11
When you wrote this 5 up here-- notice we wrote
2:13
in the 100's place.
2:13
So this is really a 500.
2:15
But in this video I'm just going to focus more on the
2:17
process, and you can think more about what it actually means
2:19
in terms of where I'm writing the numbers.
2:21
But I think the process is going to be crystal
2:23
clear hopefully, by the end of this video.
2:25
So we brought down the 9.
2:27
4 goes into 29 how many times?
2:29
It goes into at least six times.
2:31
What's 4 times 7?
2:32
4 times 7 is 28.
2:34
So it goes into it at least seven times.
2:36
What's 4 times 8?
2:38
4 times 8 is 32, so it can't go into it eight times so it's
2:41
going to go into it seven.
2:43
4 goes into 29 nine seven times.
2:46
7 times 4 is 28.
2:49
29 minus 28 to get our remainder for this step
2:53
in the problem is 1.
2:56
And now we're going to bring down this 2.
2:59
We're going to bring it down and you get a 12.
3:03
4 goes into 12?
3:04
That's easy.
3:05
4 times 3 is 12.
3:06
4 goes into 12 three times.
3:09
3 times 4 is 12.
3:11
12 minus 12 is 0.
3:13
We have no remainder.
3:14
So 4 goes into 2,292 exactly 573 times.
3:20
So this 2,292 divided by 4 we can say is equal to 573.
3:26
Or we could say that this thing right here is equal to 573.
3:32
Let's do a couple of more.
3:34
Let's do a few more problems.
3:39
So I'll do that red color.
3:40
Let's say we had 7 going into 6,475.
3:50
Maybe it's called long division because you write it nice and
3:53
long up here and you have this line.
3:54
I don't know.
3:55
There's multiple reasons why it could be called long division.
3:58
So you say 7 goes into 6 zero times.
4:00
So we need to keep moving forward.
4:03
So then we go to 64.
4:06
7 goes into 64 how many times?
4:09
Let's see.
4:11
7 times 7 is?
4:15
Well, that's way too small.
4:16
Let me think about it a little bit.
4:18
Well 7 times 9 is 63.
4:20
That's pretty close.
4:21
And then 6 times 10 is going to be too big.
4:23
7 times 10 is 70.
4:25
So that's too big.
4:26
So 7 goes into 64 nine times.
4:29
9 times 7 is 63.
4:32
64 minus 63 to get our remainder of this stage 1.
4:38
Bring down the 7.
4:41
7 goes into 17 how many times?
4:43
Well, 7 times 2 is 14.
4:45
And then 7 times 3 is 21.
4:47
So 3 is too big.
4:48
So 7 goes into 17 two times.
4:51
2 times 7 is 14.
4:54
17 minus 14 is 3.
4:57
And now we bring down the 5.
5:03
And 7 goes into 35?
5:05
That's in our 7 multiplication tables, five times.
5:07
5 times 7 is 35.
5:14
And there you go.
5:15
So the remainder is zero.
5:17
So all the examples I did so far had no remainders.
5:20
Let's do one that maybe might have a remainder.
5:22
And to ensure it has a remainder I'll just
5:23
make up the problem.
5:24
It's much easier to make problems that have remainders
5:27
than the ones that don't have remainders.
5:29
So let's say I want to divide 3 into-- I'm going to divide it
5:38
into, let's say 1,735,092.
5:47
This will be a nice, beastly problem.
5:49
So if we can do this we can handle everything.
5:50
So it's 1,735,092.
5:54
That's what we're dividing 3 into.
5:58
And actually, I'm not sure if this will have a remainder.
6:00
In the future video I'll show you how to figure out whether
6:04
something is divisible by 3.
6:06
Actually, we can do it right now.
6:07
We can just add up all these digits.
6:08
1 plus 7 is 8.
6:10
8 plus 3 is 11.
6:13
11 5 five is 16.
6:15
16 plus 9 is 25.
6:20
25 plus 2 is 27.
6:22
So actually, this number is divisible by 3.
6:24
So if you add up all of the digits, you get 27.
6:27
And then you can add up those digits-- 2 plus 7 is 9.
6:30
So that is divisible by 9.
6:32
That's a trick that only works for 3.
6:34
So this number actually is divisible by 3.
6:35
So let me change it a little bit, so it's
6:37
not divisible by 3.
6:41
Let me make this into a 1.
6:44
Now this number will not be divisible by 3.
6:47
I definitely want a number where I'll end
6:49
up with a remainder.
6:50
Just so you see what it looks like.
6:53
So let's do this one.
6:54
3 goes into 1 zero times.
6:57
So we can just move forward.
6:57
You could write a 0 here and multiply that out, but that
7:01
just makes it a little bit messy in my head.
7:03
So we just move one to the right.
7:04
3 goes into 17 how many times?
7:06
Well, 3 times 5 is equal to 15.
7:11
And 3 times 6 is equal to 18 and that's too big.
7:13
So 3 goes into 17 right here five times.
7:18
5 times 3 is 15.
7:20
And we subtract.
7:22
17 minus 15 is 2.
7:27
And now we bring down this 3.
7:31
3 goes into 23 how many times?
7:33
Well, 3 times 7 is equal to 21.
7:36
And 3 times 8 is too big.
7:38
That's equal to 24.
7:40
So 3 goes into 23 seven times.
7:44
7 times 3 is 21.
7:46
Then we subtract.
7:47
23 minus 21 is 2.
7:51
Now we bring down the next number.
7:53
We bring down the 5.
7:54
I think you can appreciate why it's called long division now.
7:57
We bring down this 5.
8:00
3 goes into 25 how many times?
8:02
Well, 3 times 8 gets you pretty close and 3 times 9 is too big.
8:06
So it goes into it eight times.
8:08
8 times 3 is 24.
8:10
I'm going to run out of space.
8:12
You subtract, you get 1.
8:14
25 minus 24 is 1.
8:16
Now we can bring down this 0.
8:23
And you get 3 goes into 10 how many times?
8:25
That's easy.
8:25
It goes into it three times.
8:26
3 times 3 is 9.
8:28
That's about as close to 10 as we can get.
8:30
3 times 3 is 9.
8:32
10 minus 9, I'm going to have to scroll up and
8:34
down here a little bit.
8:36
10 minus 9 is 1, and then we can bring down the next number.
8:39
I'm running out of colors.
8:41
I can bring down that 9.
8:44
3 goes into 19 how many times?
8:46
Well, 6 is about as close as we can get.
8:48
That gets us to 18.
8:51
3 goes into 19 six times.
8:53
6 times 3-- let me scroll down.
8:56
6 times 3 is 18.
8:59
19 minus 18-- we subtract it up here too.
9:01
19 minus 18 is 1 and then we're almost done.
9:04
I can revert back to the pink.
9:06
We bring down this 1 right there.
9:09
3 goes into 11 how many times?
9:11
Well, that's three times because 3 times 4 is too big.
9:15
3 times 4 is 12, so that's too big.
9:17
So it goes into it three times.
9:18
So 3 goes into 11 three times.
9:22
3 times 3 is 9.
9:26
And then we subtract and we get a 2.
9:30
And there's nothing left to bring down.
9:32
When we look up here there's nothing left to bring
9:34
down, so we're done.
9:35
So we're left with the remainder of 2 after doing
9:38
this entire problem.
9:40
So the answer, 3 goes into 1,735,091-- it goes into
9:46
it 578,363 remainder 2.
9:52
And that remainder 2 was what we got all the way down there.
9:57
So hopefully you now appreciate and you can tackle pretty
9:59

- [Voiceover] Find the components of vector AB.
0:04
So when they're talking about the components,
0:05
at least in this context,
0:07
they're just talking about breaking it down into
0:09
if we start at point A and we're finishing at point B,
0:12
how much do we have to move in the X direction?
0:14
So this is going to be essentially our change in X.
0:17
And then how much do we have to move in the Y direction
0:20
to go from point A to point B?
0:22
So this one over here is going to be our change in X.
0:25
I just wrote the Greek letter Delta for change in X.
0:28
And then, the second component is going to be
0:33
our change in Y.
0:35
And to think about that,
0:36
let's just think about what our starting
0:38
and final points are,
0:39
our initial and our terminal point are.
0:42
So, this point right over here,
0:44
point A, its coordinates are (4,4).
0:48
And then point B, its coordinates are,
0:51
let's see its X coordinate is (-7,-8).
0:56
So let's first think about what our change in X is,
1:00
and like always, I encourage you to pause the video
1:02
and try to work through it on your own.
1:04
Well let's see, if we're starting at four
1:07
and then we are going from X equals four.
1:10
That's where we're starting,
1:11
to X equals negative seven.
1:16
So that right over there is our change in X.
1:20
And there's a couple of ways you could compute that.
1:22
You could say, ""Look, we finished at negative seven.
1:27
""We started at negative four.""
1:28
You take your final point or where you end up,
1:31
so that's negative seven,
1:34
and you subtract your initial point, minus four,
1:37
which is going to be equal to negative 11.
1:40
The negative tells us that we decreased in X by 11.
1:44
And you could see that.
1:45
If you could just visually count the squares,
1:47
you could say, ""Look, if I'm going from four
1:48
""to negative seven, I have to go down four
1:50
""just to get back to X equals zero,
1:51
""and then I have to go down another seven.
1:54
""So I have to go to the left 11 spaces.""
1:56
So that's negative 11.
1:58
So that's my X component, negative 11.
2:01
And what is my change in Y?
2:03
Well I'm going from Y equals four.
2:05
In fact, I'll start at this point right over here.
2:07
I'm starting at Y equals four.
2:10
And I'm ending up at Y is equal to,
2:12
let me do that in that other color.
2:15
So, I'm starting at Y is equal to four,
2:18
and I'm ending up at Y is equal to negative eight.
2:22
So our change in Y,
2:24
our change in Y, what's going to be my final Y value,
2:28
which is negative eight,
2:29
minus my initial Y value, which is four,
2:32
minus four, which is equal to negative 12.
2:36
So negative 12.
2:40
And you could see that here.
2:41
If I'm starting up here,
2:42
I have to go four down just to get back to the X axis.
2:45
Then I have to go down another eight,
2:46
so I have to go down a total of 12.

khan_video_pPM72fPwIjw_0,"now that we've proved that the sum of rational and irrational numbers is irrational, what about the sum of irrational and irrational numbers?",Essay,"•
0:00
So I'm curious as to what happens
0:02
if I were to take a rational number
0:04
and I were to add it to an irrational number.
0:09
Is the resulting number going to be rational or irrational?
0:16
Well, to think about this, let's just
0:17
assume it's going to be rational and then see
0:20
if this leads to any form of contradiction.
0:24
So let's assume that this is going
0:25
to give us a rational number.
0:30
So let's say that this first rational number
0:32
we can represent as the ratio of two integers, a and b.
0:38
Let's call this irrational number, let's just call this x.
0:42
And their sum gives us another rational number.
0:46
Well, let's express that as the ratio of two
0:49
other integers, m and n.
0:53
So we're saying that a/b plus x is equal to m/n.
1:03
Well, another way of thinking about it--
1:05
we could subtract a/b from both sides
1:07
and we would get our irrational number
1:09
x is equal to m/n minus a/b, which
1:18
is the same thing as n times b in the denominator.
1:26
And then let's see.
1:27
m/n is the same thing as mb over nb.
1:30
So this would be mb.
1:33
I'm just adding these two fractions.
1:34
mb minus--
1:40
Let's see. a/b is the same thing as n times a over n times b.
1:45
So minus n times a.
1:52
All I did is I added these two fractions.
1:54
I found a common denominator.
1:55
So to make it clear, I multiplied this one b and b,
1:59
and then I multiplied this one n and n then
2:02
I just added these two things, and I got this expression right
2:05
over here.
2:06
So this denominator is clearly an integer.
2:08
I have the product of two integers.
2:10
That's going to be an integer.
2:12
That's going to be an integer.
2:14
And then this numerator, mb, is an integer.
2:17
na is an integer.
2:18
The difference of two integers.
2:19
This whole thing is going to be an integer.
2:24
So it looks like, assuming that the sum is rational,
2:29
that all of a sudden we have this contradiction.
2:31
We assumed that x is irrational, we're assuming x is irrational,
2:35
but, all of a sudden, because we made that assumption,
2:37
we're able to assume that we can represent it
2:39
as this ratio of two integers.
2:42
So this tells us that x must be rational.
2:48
And that is the contradiction.
2:51
That is a very large contradiction right over there.
2:54
The assumption was that x is irrational.
2:57
Now we got that x must be rational.
3:00
So, therefore, this cannot be the case.
3:02
A rational plus an irrational must--
3:05
so this is not right-- a rational plus
3:08
an irrational must be irrational.
3:10
Let me write that down.
3:11
So a rational plus an irrational must be irrational.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,pPM72fPwIjw,
khan_video_FlIG3TvQCBQ_53,how could someone encrypt a message with numbers in it?,MCQ,"•
0:04
For over 400 years, the problem remained.
0:07
How could Alice design a cipher that hides her fingerprint,
0:11
thus stopping the leak of information?
0:14
The answer is randomness.
0:18
Imagine Alice rolled a 26 sided die
0:20
to generate a long list of random shifts,
0:23
and shared this with Bob instead of a code word.
0:26
Now, to encrypt her message, Alice
0:28
uses the list of random shifts instead.
0:31
It is important that this list of shifts
0:34
be as long as the message, as to avoid any repetition.
0:38
Then she sends it to Bob, who decrypts the message using
0:41
the same list of random shifts she had given him.
0:46
Now Eve will have a problem, because the resulting
0:49
encrypted message will have two powerful properties.
0:53
One, the shifts never fall into a repetitive pattern.
0:59
And two, the encrypted message will have a uniform frequency
1:02
distribution.
1:04
Because there is no frequency differential and therefore
1:07
no leak, it is now impossible for Eve
1:09
to break the encryption.
1:14
This is the strongest possible method of encryption,
1:18
and it emerged towards the end of the 19th century.
1:21
It is now known as the one-time pad.
1:25
In order to visualize the strength of the one-time pad,
1:28
we must understand the combinatorial explosion
1:32
which takes place.
1:34
For example, the Caesar Cipher shifted every letter
1:37
by the same shift, which was some number between 1 and 26.
1:42
So if Alice was to encrypt her name,
1:44
it would result in one of 26 possible encryptions.
1:48
A small number of possibilities, easy to check them all,
1:52
known as brute force search.
1:55
Compare this to the one-time pad, where each letter would
1:58
be shifted by a different number between 1 and 26.
2:01
Now think about the number of possible encryptions.
2:04
It's going to be 26 multiplied by itself five times, which
2:08
is almost 12 million.
2:10
Sometimes it's hard to visualize,
2:13
so imagine she wrote her name on a single page,
2:15
and on top of it stacked every possible encryption.
2:20
How high do you think this would be?
2:24
With almost 12 million possible five-letter sequences,
2:28
this stack of paper would be enormous,
2:32
over one kilometer high.
2:35
When Alice encrypts her name using the one-time pad,
2:38
it is the same as picking one of these pages at random.
2:42
From the perspective of Eve, the code breaker,
2:44
every five letter encrypted word she
2:46
has is equally likely to be any word in this stack.

khan_video_iTRxuBxttj8_25,Does refraction of light change momentum of a photon?,MCQ,"•
0:00
- [Narrator] So in the early 20th century,
0:02
physicists were bamboozled because light,
0:05
which we thought was a wave,
0:06
started to behave in certain experiments
0:09
as if it were a particle.
0:10
So, for instance, there was an experiment done
0:13
called the photoelectric effect,
0:15
where, if you shine light at a metal,
0:17
it'll knock electrons out of the metal
0:19
if that light has sufficient energy,
0:22
but if you tried to explain this using wave mechanics,
0:25
you get the wrong result.
0:26
And it was only by resorting to a description of light
0:29
as if it could only deliver energy in discrete packets
0:33
that Einstein was able to describe
0:35
how this photoelectric effect worked,
0:37
and predict the results
0:39
that they actually measure in the lab.
0:41
In other words, light was only giving energy
0:44
in certain bunches,
0:46
equal to something called planks constant,
0:48
multiplied by the frequency of the light.
0:51
It either gave all of this energy to the electron,
0:53
or it gave none of the energy to the electron.
0:55
It was never half and half.
0:57
It never gave half of this energy,
0:59
it was sort of all or nothing.
1:00
But this was confusing to people.
1:02
'Cause we thought we had established
1:04
that light was a wave,
1:05
and we thought that because if you shine light
1:07
through a double slit,
1:08
if it were a particle,
1:10
if light were just a bunch of particles,
1:12
you would expect particles
1:13
to just either go through the top hole
1:15
and give you a bright spot right here,
1:17
or go through the bottom hole,
1:18
give you a bright spot right here,
1:20
but what we actually measure
1:21
when you do this experiment with light,
1:23
is that the light seemingly diffracts from both holes,
1:27
overlaps, and it gives you
1:28
a diffraction pattern on the screen.
1:31
So instead of just two bright spots,
1:33
it gives you this constructive and destructive pattern
1:36
that would only emerge if the light beam
1:39
were passing through both slits,
1:41
and then overlapping, the way waves would,
1:43
out of two holes on this other side of the double slit.
1:47
So this experiment showed that light behaved like a wave,
1:50
but the photoelectric effect showed
1:52
that light behaved more like a particle,
1:54
and this kept happening.
1:55
You kept discovering different experiments
1:57
that showed particle-like behavior,
1:59
or different experiments
2:00
that showed wave-like behavior for light.
2:02
Finally, physicists resigned to the fact
2:04
that light can seemingly have particle-like properties,
2:08
and wave-length properties,
2:10
depending on the experiment being conducted.
2:12
So that's where things sat when in 1924,
2:16
a young French physicist, a brilliant young physicist,
2:19
named Louis de Broglie,
2:21
now, it looks like you pronounce this ""Louis de Broe-glee"",
2:25
and that's what I always said.
2:26
I always read this and I said ""de Broe-glee"" in my mind,
2:29
and I knew that wasn't right.
2:30
If you look it up, it's more like ""Louis de Broy"",
2:33
so get rid of all that, replace it with a ""y"" in your mind,
2:36
Louis de Broglie, in 1924, wrote a paper,
2:39
and he did something no one else was doing.
2:41
Everyone else was worried about light,
2:43
and light behaving like a particle or a wave,
2:46
depending on the experiment;
2:47
Louis de Broglie said this, ""What about the electron?
2:50
""You got this electron flying off here,""
2:52
he said, ""if light, which we thought was a wave,
2:55
""can act like a particle,
2:57
""maybe electrons, which we thought were particles,
3:00
""can act like a wave.""
3:02
In other words, maybe they have a wavelength
3:03
associated with them.
3:05
He was trying to synthesize these ideas
3:07
into one over arching framework
3:10
in which you could describe both quanta of light,
3:13
i.e. particles of light, and particles,
3:16
which we thought were just particles,
3:18
but maybe they can behave like waves as well.
3:20
So maybe, he was saying, everything in the universe
3:23
can behave like a particle or a wave,
3:25
depending on the experiment that's being conducted.
3:28
And he set out to figure out what would this wavelength be,
3:31
he figured it out, it's called the ""de Broe-lee"" wavelength,
3:34
oh, I reverted, sorry,
3:36
""de Broy"" wavelength, not the ""de Broe-glee"" wavelength.
3:40
The de Broglie wavelength, he figured it out,
3:43
and he realized it was this.
3:44
So, he actually postulated it.
3:46
He didn't really prove this.
3:48
He motivated the idea,
3:49
and then it was up to experimentalists to try this out.
3:52
So he said that the wavelength associated
3:54
with things that we thought were matter,
3:56
so sometimes these were called matter waves,
3:59
but the wavelength of, say, an electron,
4:01
is gonna be equal to Planck's constant,
4:04
divided by the momentum of that electron.
4:07
And so, why did he say this?
4:09
Why did he pick Planck's constant,
4:11
which, by the way,
4:12
if you're not familiar with Planck's constant,
4:14
it is like the name suggests, just a constant,
4:17
and it's always the same value,
4:18
it's 6.626 times 10,
4:22
to the negative 34th joule seconds.
4:26
It's really small.
4:28
This was a constant discovered in other experiments,
4:31
like this photoelectric effect,
4:33
and the original blackbody experiments
4:35
that Planck was dealing with.
4:37
It's called Planck's constant,
4:38
it shows up all around modern physics and quantum mechanics.
4:42
So how did Louis de Broglie even come up with this?
4:44
Why Planck's constant over the momentum?
4:47
Well, people already knew for light,
4:50
that the wavelength of a light ray
4:52
is gonna also equal Planck's constant,
4:54
divided by the momentum of the photons in that light ray.
4:59
So the name for these particles of light are called photons.
5:03
I'm drawing them localized in space here,
5:05
but don't necessarily think about it that way.
5:08
Think about it just in terms of,
5:10
they only deposit their energy in bunches.
5:12
They don't necessarily have to be
5:14
at a particular point at a particular time.
5:17
This is a little misleading, this picture here,
5:19
I'm just not sure how else to represent this idea
5:22
in a picture that they only deposit
5:24
their energies in bunches.
5:26
So this is a very loose drawing,
5:28
don't take this too seriously here.
5:30
But people had already discovered
5:31
this relationship for photons.
5:34
And that might bother you, you might be like,
5:35
""Wait a minute, how in the world can photons have momentum?
5:40
""They don't have any mass.
5:41
""I know momentum is just m times v,
5:44
""if the mass of light is zero,
5:46
""doesn't that mean the momentum always has to be zero?
5:49
""Wouldn't that make this wavelength infinite?""
5:51
And if we were dealing with classical mechanics,
5:53
that would be right,
5:54
but it turns out, this is not true
5:57
when you travel near the speed of light.
5:59
Because parallel to all these
6:01
discoveries in quantum physics,
6:03
Einstein realized that this was actually not true
6:06
when things traveled near the speed of light.
6:08
The actual relationship, I'll just show you,
6:10
it looks like this.
6:11
The actual relationship is that the energy squared,
6:14
is gonna equal the rest mass squared,
6:17
times the speed of light to the fourth,
6:19
plus the momentum of the particles squared,
6:22
times the speed of light squared.
6:23
This is the better relationship that shows you
6:26
how to relate momentum and energy.
6:28
This is true in special relativity,
6:30
and using this, you can get this formula
6:33
for the wavelength of light in terms of its momentum.
6:36
It's not even that hard.
6:37
In fact, I'll show you here, it only takes a second.
6:39
Light has no rest mass, we know that,
6:41
light has no rest mass, so this term is zero.
6:44
We've got a formula for the energy of light,
6:46
it's just h times f.
6:48
So e squared is just gonna be h squared times f squared,
6:51
the frequency of the light squared,
6:53
so that equals the momentum of the light squared,
6:56
times the speed of light squared,
6:57
I could take the square root of both sides now
6:59
and get rid of all these squares,
7:01
and I get hf equals momentum times c,
7:04
if I rearrange this, and get h over p on the left hand side,
7:09
if I divide both sides by momentum,
7:11
and then divide both sides by frequency,
7:13
I get h over the momentum
7:15
is equal to the speed of light over the frequency,
7:18
but the speed of light over the frequency
7:20
is just the wavelength.
7:21
And we know that, because the speed of a wave
7:23
is wavelength times frequency,
7:25
so if you solve for the wavelength,
7:27
you get the speed of the wave over the frequency,
7:29
and for light, the speed of the wave is the speed of light.
7:32
So c over frequency is just wavelength.
7:34
That is just this relationship right here.
7:36
So people knew about this.
7:39
And de Broglie suggested, hypothesized,
7:41
that maybe the same relationship works
7:44
for these matter particles like electrons, or protons,
7:48
or neutrons, or things that we thought were particles,
7:51
maybe they also can have a wavelength.
7:53
And you still might not be satisfied,
7:55
you might be like, ""What, what does that even mean,
7:57
""that a particle can have a wavelength?""
8:00
That's hard to even comprehend.
8:01
How would you even test that?
8:03
Well, you'd test it the same way you test
8:05
whether photons and light can have a wavelength.
8:08
You subject them to an experiment
8:10
that would expose the wave-like properties,
8:12
i.e., just take these electrons,
8:15
shoot them through the double slit.
8:17
So, if light can exhibit wave-like behavior
8:20
when we shoot it through a double slit,
8:22
then the electrons, if they also have a wavelength
8:24
and wave-like behavior,
8:26
they should also demonstrate wave-like behavior
8:29
when we shoot them through the double slit.
8:30
And that's what people did.
8:31
There was an experiment by Davisson and Germer,
8:34
they took electrons, they shot them through a double slit.
8:37
If the electrons just created two bright electron splotches
8:41
right behind the holes, you would've known that,
8:43
""Okay, that's not wave-like.
8:46
""These are just flat out particles, de Broglie was wrong.""
8:49
But that's not what they discovered.
8:51
Davisson and Germer did this experiment,
8:53
and it's a little harder,
8:55
the wavelength of these electrons are really small.
8:58
So you've gotta use atomic structure
9:00
to create this double slit.
9:02
It's difficult, you should look it up, it's interesting.
9:04
People still use this, it's called electron diffraction.
9:06
But long story short, they did the experiment.
9:09
They shot electrons through here,
9:11
guess what they got?
9:12
They got wave-like behavior.
9:13
They got this diffraction pattern on the other side.
9:16
And when they discovered that,
9:17
de Broglie won his Nobel Prize,
9:19
'cause it showed that he was right.
9:22
Matter particles can have wavelength,
9:24
and they can exhibit wave-like behavior,
9:27
just like light can,
9:29
which was a beautiful synthesis between
9:31
two separate realms of physics, matter and light.
9:34
Turns out they weren't so different after all.
9:37
Now, sometimes, de Broglie is given sort of a bum rap.
9:40
People say, ""Wait a minute, all he did
9:43
""was take this equation that people already knew about,
9:46
""and just restate it for matter particles?""
9:49
And no, that's not all he did.
9:50
If you go back and look at his paper, I suggest you do,
9:53
he did a lot more than that.
9:55
The paper's impressive, it's an impressive paper,
9:57
and it's written beautifully.
9:59
He did much more than this,
10:00
but this is sort of the thing
10:02
people most readily recognize him for.
10:04
And to emphasize the importance of this,
10:06
before this point, people had lots of ideas
10:09
and formulas in quantum mechanics
10:11
that they didn't completely understand.
10:13
After this point, after this pivot,
10:15
where we started to view matter particles as being waves,
10:19
previous formulas that worked,
10:22
for reasons we didn't understand, could now be proven.
10:25
In other words, you could take this formula
10:27
and idea from de Broglie,
10:29
and show why Bohr's atomic model actually works.
10:33
And shortly after de Broglie's paper,
10:35
Schrodinger came around and basically
10:37
set the stage for the entire rest of quantum physics.
10:41
And his work was heavily influenced
10:43
by the ideas of Louis de Broglie.
10:46
So recapping, light can have
10:47
particle-like or wave-like properties,
10:49
depending on the experiment,
10:51
and so can electrons.
10:53
The wavelength associated with these electrons,
10:55
or any matter particle,
10:57
can be found by taking Planck's constant,
10:59
divided by the momentum of that matter particle.
11:02
And this wavelength can be tested in experiments,
11:05
where electrons exhibit wave-like behavior,
11:07
and this formula accurately represents the wavelength
11:10
that would be associated with the diffraction pattern
11:13
that emerges from that wave-like behavior.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,iTRxuBxttj8,

What I want to do in this video
0:01
is think about the demand curve
0:02
for two different products.
0:04
So this is some laptop
0:05
that's on the market.
0:06
And this, let's just say,
0:08
is the cheapest car
0:09
that happens to be on the market
0:10
this is actually a picture of a 1985
0:12
assuming this is the cheapest car on the market.
0:15
So let's just think about
0:17
their hypothetical demand curves right now
0:20
So once again, on the vertical axis,
0:23
we're going to put price,
0:24
and on the horizontal axis,
0:25
we put quantity,
0:29
and then over here
0:30
let me do it for the same thing
0:32
So this is price,
0:36
and this right over here is quantity.
0:37
And both of them satisfy the law of demand
0:42
if the price is really high
0:44
the quantity demanded is going to be really low for the laptop
0:48
and so it might be right over there
0:50
and if the price is low
0:51
the quantity demanded is going to increase.
0:53
So, the demand curve might look something like that.
0:57
And it doesn't have to be a curve,
0:59
or doesn't have to be a line,
1:00
it could be a curve or anything like that.
1:02
So that is the current demand for the laptop
1:09
All else equal,
1:10
so we're not talking about shifting any of those other factors
1:13
that we've been talking about in the last few videos.
1:15
Now we can draw a similar demand curve
1:18
for this very cheap automobile.
1:20
If the price is high,
1:22
very few people are going to want to buy it,
1:24
and I'm not going to specify what the price is,
1:26
but this is a general idea
1:27
if the price is higher,
1:28
fewer people are going to want to buy it
1:30
If the price is lower,
1:31
more people are going to want to buy it
1:33
So this demand curve will also have the same shape
1:36
from the top left to the bottom right
1:38
it satisfies the law of demand.
1:40
So once again, that is the current demand.
1:46
Now let's think about
1:47
how the demand for each of these goods might change
1:50
depending on changes in income.
1:54
So we're going to focus on the income factor
1:57
the income effect, for this video
2:00
and see how these 2 products might change.
2:02
So let's just assume that
2:05
income in the general population goes up.
2:10
So for something like a laptop, wow,
2:12
if more people are making more money
2:14
especially in real terms
2:16
they have more money to spend well
2:17
for any given price point,
2:18
at any given price point,
2:20
there's going to be a higher quantity
2:25
that's demanded.
2:26
At any given price point,
2:26
higher quantity demanded.
2:30
And so if income goes up for this laptop,
2:33
the demand will increase.
2:35
And the way we show demand increasing
2:37
is the whole curve shifts to the right
2:39
so this right over here demand increased
2:43
demand went up when income went up.
2:46
And this makes complete sense
2:48
and if income were to go down,
2:49
demand would go down
2:51
because people would have less money
2:52
to buy something like a laptop.
2:54
And this is the case for most goods
2:56
we call things like this,
2:57
when income goes up, demand goes up,
2:59
whole curve shifts to the right
3:01
income goes down, demand goes down,
3:02
whole curve shifts to the left
3:04
We call this a normal good.
3:06
So this right over here is a normal good.
3:11
Now let's think about
3:12
what happens with the cheapest car on the market.
3:16
And let's assume we're in a developed country
3:18
where almost everyone has some form of a car.
3:21
Now, what happens when income goes up?
3:25
So people have more money
3:27
but are they going to spend that money
3:29
buying the cheapest car on the market?
3:31
Well, in most cases, if income goes up generally,
3:35
people say, well I have a little bit more money,
3:36
maybe I'll buy a slightly nicer car.
3:39
So, and maybe in particular
3:40
the people who were going to buy this car
3:42
at any given price point
3:44
So this price point,
3:45
the people who were going to buy the car will say
3:47
Wait! I can now afford a better car!
3:49
Why should I you know,
3:51
this is not safe
3:52
maybe or not as safe as the other cars,
3:53
and I want to impress my friends
3:56
from high school and all that,
3:57
so something very strange might happen for this car,
4:00
the demand for this car.
4:02
It actually will decrease
4:04
so the whole curve could shift to the left.
4:11
So income is a very strange thing for this good
4:14
because income increasing maybe people say,
4:16
hey you know what,
4:17
I could trade out of this good
4:18
I could get a good that
4:19
I'd rather have than just getting more of this thing right over here
4:23
Demand went down.
4:24
And goods like this, we call them inferior goods.
4:30
And the general way to think about
4:32
inferior goods are the goods
4:33
that people will want to not own if they had more money
4:36
they would want to buy, I guess, less inferior goods.
4:39
Or another way to think about it is,
4:41
if income were to go down,
4:45
and more people are budget strapped
4:46
and they can't afford
4:47
the Mercedes-Benz or the BMW
4:49
or even the mid-sized sedan anymore,
4:51
so if income were to go down
4:52
and things were getting tighter,
4:54
more people would want this car
4:56
more people would have to trade down to this
4:57
because they're strapped,
4:59
they're tightening their belts
5:00
and so you'll have this strange situation
5:04
where if income goes down,
5:06
demand would go up for this thing
5:09
So income goes down,
5:12
demand goes up.
5:13
Remember, we're talking about demand,
5:15
we're talking about the entire shifting of the curve.
5:17
At any given price point,
5:18
the quantity demanded will go up.
5:21
Because, this is, or we're assuming,
5:23
is the cheapest car on the market.
5:27
So, and likewise,
5:28
if income were to go down for a normal good,
5:30
it'll do what you'll expect,
5:31
demand would go down.
5:32
So this, an inferior good,
5:33
does the opposite of a normal good
5:35
when we're talking about the income effect,
5:40
the inferior good will do the opposite of a normal good
5:44
and that's because people want to trade out of it
5:46
when their income goes up
5:47
or they don't want to buy it
5:48
or they want to buy something nicer.
5:49
And when their income goes down,
5:50
they'll say
5:51
I have to buy this thing,
5:52
so you know, let me just do it.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,wYuAwm-5-Bk,

0:00
In this video I'm going to talk a little more about points on
0:03
angle bisector but before that I want to at least make sure we
0:07
understand what we mean when we talk about the distance
0:09
between a point and a line.
0:12
So say that that is some point, point A
0:16
this is some line right over here, we'll call that line,
0:19
BC, so when you're taking the distance between
0:23
a point and another point, it's very obvious,
0:25
you just draw a line to that other point,
0:28
Well I already used B, you just draw a line to that other point
0:30
and you find the length of that line,
0:33
so distance seems very straight foreward between
0:35
two points, but what about a point and a line
0:37
because there are many points on this line
0:40
maybe were going to find this distance, or maybe were going to find this distance, or this distance,
0:45
and these are all going to be different lengths
0:48
so how do we have one unique distance?
0:49
And the way that we think about this, and we're going
0:52
to do this in much more depth in future math courses
0:54
especially when you start vectors and linear algebra
0:57
and all the rest, is distance between a point and a line is
1:00
really the shortest distance and that shortest distance
1:03
is as if you were to drop a
1:05
perpendicular from that point to the line, so this right over here,
1:08
this right over here, is what we call the distance
1:12
the distance between the point and the line, and this
1:15
is perpendicular right over here, to
1:17
recognize that this is indeed the shortest distance
1:20
think about this relative -the distance between this point
1:23
and any other point on this line. so pick another
1:28
point on this line right over here, let's call this
1:31
point E, and think about this --now this is an
1:36
arbitrary point I could have drawn E here,
1:38
I could have drawn E here, I could have drawn E anywhere,
1:39
but regardless of where you draw E, if you
1:41
draw a line segment between A and E, you see that
1:44
we've form a right triangle from A to E, to the
1:47
point we had the perpendicular, so let me call this
1:51
point right here F, you're always going to draw
1:54
a right triangle assuming that E is different than F
1:57
and if you will immediately see that you see that D
2:00
has to be shorter than this orange length, because this
2:02
orange length is the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse
2:05
is always going to be the longest side a triangle
2:07
D squared plus whatever length this squared, is
2:10
going to be equal to this length squared. So hopefully
2:14
that at least gives you a decent sense why dropping
2:16
the perpendicular will always give you the shortest
2:20
distance between a point and a line, and that unique
2:22
shortest distance is what we call the distance
2:25
between a point and a line. Now with that out of the way,
2:28
let's think a little bit about angle bisectors.
2:31
So let me draw an angle here, so let me, draw an angle.
2:38
So lets call this point, let me do it in a different color,
2:42
let's call that point A, lets call this point B,
2:44
and let's call this point C right over here.
2:47
And an angle bisector is essentially line, or a segment,
2:50
or a ray that splits an angle into two equal angles
2:53
and we've talked about this before,
2:56
so for example if we want to bisect angle ABC,
2:59
so this angle right over here, we want to split it
3:01
in two, we are going to -I can draw a better version
3:05
of that, we want to split it in two, we want to split it in two
3:09
like, let me draw a little bit better, my drawing
3:13
still doesn't look like, that looks decent, alright,
3:17
so lets call this point right over here D,
3:23
and again we could even say that, that's a ray,
3:25
or we could call that a segment, or whatever,
3:27
but the way to think about this, is if now
3:29
angle DBC is equal to angle DBA, so this angle,
3:35
DBC is equal to angle DBA, we can say that DB bisects
3:43
angle ABC, so we can say that DB and now Im talking
3:49
about segment DB we could have made it a ray if we
3:52
had -keep going to the right, or a line. DB
3:54
bisects BISECTS angle ABC, ABC
4:02
Fare enough, now, the whole reason why I started
4:05
this video talking about distances between points and lines,
4:08
is that I want to show you, that any point that is on
4:10
an angle bisector, is actually going to be
4:12
equidistant from the sides of the angle, and then were
4:16
going to go the other way saying, any point
4:18
that is equidistant from the sides of an angle is
4:20
going on the angle bisector. So lets take an
4:24
arbitrary point that sits on this angle bisector
4:26
so let's take this point right over here,
4:30
Ill call that arbitrary point F, or actually I havnt used
4:33
E yet, so this is going to be and arbitrary point on our
4:36
angle bisector, and now let's look at the distance between
4:40
E and BC and the distance between E and BA we already
4:44
say that, -we already said that the distance between
4:46
point and a line is if you drop a perpendicular
4:49
from a point to that line, which you can always do
4:51
so lets draw a perpendicular right over here,
4:54
this is one distance, and then this is the other distance
4:57
this is, -this orange line right here is the distance between E and BC and this orange line is the distance
5:04
between E and BA and what I want to prove is that these distances are equal
5:11
well the first thing to realize, is that we have two right triangles over here, they both share
5:17
th- they both have the same angle, they're not sharing it but angle ABE is congruent
5:24
to angle CBE and we know that because DB bisects it so this angle is equal to that angle
5:29
they're both right triangles so the actually have 2 angles in common, which actually means
5:34
they actually have 3 angles in common and constrains what this other angle would be and they also have
5:38
this side in common, -they have 3 angles are congruent to each other, they are not
5:44
necessarily in common, but it does have this side in common, BE is the hypotenuse
5:48
of both of these right triangles, and so, you can invoke
5:52
using this angle, that angle and this side, this angle,that angle and this side
5:56
you could say that these 2 triangles are going to be congruent to each other
6:00
so we could say that triangle, and let me put some points over here, so let's see
6:04
let's call this F and let's call this G, we can say that triangle EBF is congruent to triangle
6:14
EBG and we can use AAS, by Angle Angle Side congruency or you could say hey if
6:23
two angles, -if corresponding angles are the same then the third angle is also going to be the same
6:28
so this angle right over here could also be the same and
6:31
you could use ASA, but either way these two things are going to be congruent
6:35
but if these two things are congruent, then the corresponding sides are going to be congruent
6:39
so then, then length of EF, segment EF, is going to be congruent to segment
6:47
EF is going to be congruent to segment EG which is the same
6:51
thing as the length of EF is equal to the length of EG, these are really, these are really
6:57
equivalent statements right over there, so the length of EF, the length of EF
7:02
is equal to the length of EG and the length of those two segments are the distances
7:06
between the point and those 2 respective sides.
7:09
We've just proven the first case, if a point lies on an angle bisector, it is
7:15
equidistant from the 2 sides of the angle, now let's go the other way around,
7:21
let's say that I have, so let me draw another angle here, so let me draw another angle over here and let's call
7:29
this A, B, and C and let's pick some arbitrary point E, let's point some arbitrary point E
7:40
right over here and let's say we start off with the assumption that E is equidistant
7:43
to BC and BA and what we want to do is prove that E must be on the angle bisector,
7:51
so here, if you're on the angle bisector you're equidistant, over here we're going to show if you're
7:55
equidistant you're on the angle bisector, so if it's equidistant to BC and BA, then this perpendicular
8:02
right over here, this perpendicular right over here, is going to be congruent to this
8:06
perpendicular right over there, and let me give these points' labels, so let call this point D, and let's
8:13
call this point right over F, and let's just draw segment BE here, let's just draw segment
8:20
BE right over here, so once again, we have 2 right triangles, we already know that
8:29
2 of the legs are congruent to each other, they both share the hypotenuse this
8:32
hypotenuse is equal to its self, we know from the pythagorean theorm
8:36
if you know 2 sides of a triangle, it determines the third side, so and we know 2 sides of both
8:43
of these, so the third sides must be the same, so this side must be equal to that side
8:48
so you could invoke SSS, Side Side Side, to show these 2 triangles are congruent
8:53
or you actually didn't need to -have to good there you could have used a special
8:56
case, the RSH case, where if you have a right triangle, so if you have the right triangle
9:02
you have one set of sides that are congruent, and you have the hypotenuse that is congruent
9:06
then you're also okay, you could use RSH to prove congruency as well,
9:11
and so either way we know that triangle EBD, triangle EBD, is congruent to triangle EBF
9:21
congruent to triangle EBF, we used Side Side Side here but you could have used RSH, let me write that
9:29
RSH, which is -we know that Angle Side Side can be used for any general triangle
9:34
but it can be, -RSH is essentially Angle Side Side for right triangles, if you have
9:38
2 sides of a right triangle and- in common, --if 2 sides of a right triangle are congruent then
9:49
the 2 triangles are definitely congruent but once you know that two triangles are congruent, then
9:57
they're corresponding angles have to be congruent, and angle EBD, angle EBD
10:01
corresponds to angle EBF so we know that angle EBD must be congruent to angle EBF
10:11
so EBD must be congruent to EBF, well if EBD is congruent to EBF then that means
10:21
that segment EB must bisect, must bisect angle CBF, or actually CBA even, it could be called CEF
10:38
angle CBA. So we're done! If over here, we show that if something sits on a bisector is
10:43
equidistant from the sides of the angle, and here we showed if it's equidistant from the sides
10:48
of the angle it sits on the angle bisector, or, or -it could even be the end point of an angle bisector
10:54
but clearly, it sits on it.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,yj4oS-27Q3k,

So you're me, and you're in math class.
0:01
And your teacher's ranting on and on
0:03
about this article about whether
0:04
algebra should be taught in school –
0:05
as if he doesn't realize that what he's teaching
0:07

0:08
which could have been interesting –
0:09
but how to manipulate symbols
0:10
and some special cases of elementary algebra –
0:12
which isn't.
0:13
And so, instead of learning about
0:15
self-consistent systems and logical thought,
0:17
you spent all week memorizing
0:18
how to graph parabolas.
0:20
News flash: No one cares about parabolas.
0:23
Which is why half the class is
0:24
playing Angry Birds under their desks.

But, since you don't have a smart phone yet,
0:28
you have to resort to a more noble
0:29
and outdated form of boredom relief –
0:31
that is, doodling.
0:33
And you've invented a game of your own.
0:35
A doodle game that connects the dots
0:37
in ways your math curriculum never will –
0:39
except instead of connecting to the closest dots
0:41
to discover the mysterious hidden picture
0:43
you've got this precise method of skipping over
0:46
some number of dots and connecting them that way.
0:48
In the past you've characterized how this works
0:50
if your dots are arranged in a circle – say 11 dots –
0:52
and connect one to the dot four dots over,
0:55
you get these awesome stars.
0:56
And you can either draw the lines
0:57
in the order of the dots,
0:58
or you can just keep going around and
1:00
maybe it will hit all the dots, or maybe it won't,
1:02
depending on how many dots are in your circle,
1:04
and how many dots you skip.
1:05
But then there are other shapes.

Circles are good friends with sine waves.
1:09
And sine waves are good friends with square waves.

And let's admit it, that's pretty cool looking.
1:13
In fact, just two simple straight lines of dots
1:15
connecting the dots from one line to the other
1:18
in order somehow gives you
1:19
this awesome woven curve shape.
1:22
Another student is asking the teacher when he's ever
1:24
going to need to know how to graph a parabola –
1:26
even as he hides his multi-million dollar enterprise
1:28
of a parabola graphing game under his desk.
1:31
If your teacher thought about it,
1:32
he would probably think shooting birds at things
1:35
is a great reason to learn about parabolas
1:37
because he's come to understand that
1:38
education is about money and prestige and
1:40
not about becoming a better human able to do great things.
1:42
You yourself haven't done anything really great yet
1:44
but you figure the path to your future greatness
1:47
lies more in inventing awesome new connect-the-dot arrangements
1:49
than in graphing parabolas or shooting birds at things.
1:52
And that's when you begin to worry.
1:54
What if this cool liney curvey thing you drew
1:56
approximates a parabola?
1:59
As if your teacher doesn't realize
2:00
everyone has their phones under their desks,
2:02
but he's underpaid and overworked and
2:03
his whole word runs on plausible deniability,
2:05
so he shouts state-mandated, pass the test,
2:08
teach-to-the-middle nonsense at students
2:09
who are not at all fooled
2:11
by his false enthusiasm or false mathematics and
2:13
he pretends he's teaching algebra and
2:14
the students pretend to be taught algebra and
2:16
everyone else involved in the system
2:17
is too invested to do anything
2:19
but pretend to believe them both.
2:20
You think maybe it's a hyperbola,
2:22
which is similar to the parabola
2:24
in that they are both conic sections.
2:25
A hyperbola is a nice vertical slice of cone,
2:28
the cone itself being just like a line swirled around in a circle,
2:31
which is why the cone is like two cones radiating both ways;
2:34
the lovely hyperbola insecting both parts.
2:37
Two perfect curves, looking disconnected when seen alone
2:40
but sharing their common conic heritage.
2:42
While the boring old parabola is a slice taken at an angle
2:45
completely meant to miss the top part of the cone and
2:47
to miss wrapping around the bottom like an ellipse would.
2:50
And it's such a special, specific case of conic section
2:53
that all parabolas are exactly the same,
2:54
just bigger or smaller or moved around.
2:57
Your teacher could just as well hand you parabolas already drawn
3:00
and have you draw coordinate grids on parabolas
3:02
rather than parabolas on coordinate grids.
3:04
And it's stupid, and you hate it,
3:06
and you don't wanna learn to graph them,
3:07
even if it means not making a billion dollars
3:09
from a game about shooting birds at things.
3:11
Meanwhile anyone who actually learns how to think mathematically
3:14
can then learn to graph a parabola or anything else
3:17
they need in like five minutes.
3:18
But teaching how to think is an individualized process
3:21
that gives power and responsibility to individuals
3:23
while teaching what to think can be done
3:25
with one-size-fits-all bullet points and check-boxes
3:27
and our culture of excuses demands that we do the latter,
3:30
keeping ourselves placated in the comforting structure
3:32
of tautology and clear expectations.
3:34
Algebra has become a check-box subject and
3:37
mathematics weeps alone in the top of the ivory tower prison
3:40
to which she has been condemned.
3:42
But you're not interested in check-boxes;
3:44
you're interested in dots, and lines that connect them.
3:46
Or maybe you could connect them with semicircles,
3:48
to give visual structure to lines that would otherwise overlap.
3:51
Or you could say one dot is the center of a circle and
3:53
another defines a radius and draw the entire circle
3:56
and do things that way.
3:57
You could make rules about how every dot
3:59
is the center of a circle with its neighbor being the radius,
4:01
or say one dot stays the center of all circles,
4:04
and all of the others define radii.
4:06
But then you just get concentric circles,
4:08
which I suppose should have been obvious.
4:09
But what if you did it the other way around and
4:11
said one dot always stays on the circle and
4:14
all the other dots are centers, like this.
4:16
Looks more promising.
4:17
So you try putting all the dots in a circle and
4:19
using them as circle centers and
4:20
choose just one dot for the circles to go through and
4:23
you get this awesome shape that looks kind of like a heart.
4:26
So let's call it, oh I don't know, a cardioid.
4:28
Which happens to be the same curve that you get
4:30
when parallel lines like rays of light reflect off a circle
4:33
the same heart of sunshine in a cup.
4:35
Or maybe instead of circle centers
4:37
you could have points all on the curve of a circle,
4:39
which means you need three points to define a circle,
4:42
maybe just a point and its two closest neighbors to start with.
4:45
And of course, any collection of circles is two-colorable,
4:48
which means you can contrast light and dark colors
4:50
for a classy color scheme.
4:51
Or maybe you could throw down some random points
4:53
to make all possible circles.
4:54
Only that would be a lot of circles,
4:56
so you choose just ones you like.
4:57
And then, against your will, you begin to wonder
4:59
how many points it takes to define the boring old parabola.
5:02
Because parabolas are actually a lot like circles in that
5:04
both are like extreme ellipses,
5:06
because a circle is like taking one focus of an ellipse
5:09
and putting the other focus zero distance away.
5:11
And a parabola is like an ellipse where
5:14
one focus is infinity distance away.
5:16
Which is why everyone lies to you and says
5:18
throwing balls or shooting birds is all about parabolas
5:20
when really it's about ellipses
5:22
because the earth is a sphere and
5:24
gravity doesn't actually go straight down.
5:25
And the other focus of the elliptical orbit of
5:27
your thrown object of choice may be very far away,
5:30
but very far away is a great bit closer than infinity.
5:33
So let's not fool ourselves.
5:34
You can't look at everything that seems kind of parabolic
5:37
and call it a parabola.
5:39
Sure, if you connect two dots with a hanging string or chain,
5:41
it looks parabolic, and so do structurally strong arches,
5:44
but they're actually catenary arches and
5:45
maybe you can't tell by sight,
5:47
but if you're an architect you'd better know the difference.
5:49
Though caternarys are quite related to parabolas,
5:51
you get them by rolling around a parabola
5:52
and tracing the focus
5:53
which makes them a cousin of the ellipse and
5:55
even a hyperbola is like an ellipse that got turned inside out
5:57
or whose focus went through infinity and
5:59
came out the other side or something.
6:00
And of course parabolas and hyperbolas and ellipses
6:02
are all conic sections which mean
6:04
they all come from a line that got spun around.
6:05
And a line is just what happens
6:07
when a couple dots get connected.
6:08
Or maybe what happens when your circle is so big that,
6:10
like the extreme ellipse that becomes a parabola,
6:13
the extreme circle is broken at infinity and
6:16
becomes a line before getting larger than infinitely big
6:19
which brings it back to the other side.
6:20
This linear circle, the infinite in-between.
6:23
Or maybe a line is what happens
6:25
when you roll around a circle and trace the focus.
6:27
Or rather the 2 foci, which are zero distance apart, in ellipse terms.
6:30
Which makes you wonder what you get
6:32
when you roll around an ellipse and trace the foci.
6:34
In fact, there's lots of great shapes
6:36
you can get by rolling around shapes on other shapes,
6:38
like if you roll a circle around a circle and trace the focus,
6:41
you get just another circle.
6:42
But, if you trace a point on the edge,
6:44
you get our awesome friend the cardioid again.
6:46
So now it's related to circles in three ways ,
6:49
which means it's a close cousin of the ellipse
6:51
and a second cousin to the infinite ellipse or, parabola.
6:53
Except, not just that, if you take a parabola and
6:56
invert it around the unit circle, reversing inside and outside,
6:57
one half becomes two, one hundred becomes a hundredth,
7:01
one stays one, infinity becomes zero,
7:03
you get once again, the cardioid.
7:06
The cardioid is the anti-parabola which is good
7:09
because parabolas make you sad but you heart cardioids.
7:12
And of course, any time you want to
7:14
connect two dots on a piece of paper,
7:16
instead of drawing the line you could fold the line.
7:18
Here's the thing about connecting dots.
7:20
You can have all the steps laid out for you,
7:22
taking whatever next step is easiest and closest
7:25
and be sure of what you're getting the whole time.
7:27
This way is safe and comfortable.
7:29
Or, you can try new ways of connecting dots
7:32
and not know what you're going to get.
7:33
Maybe it will be something great, maybe it will fail.
7:36
And when it fails it will be your fault.
7:38
You can't blame anyone else, not mathematics
7:40
or the system or the check-boxes.
7:41

0:00
A function-- and I'm going to speak about it
0:02
in very abstract terms right now-- is something that
0:06
will take an input, and it'll munch on that input,
0:11
it'll look at that input, it will do something
0:13
to that input.
0:14
And based on what that input is, it will produce a given output.
0:20
What is an example of a function?
0:22
I could have something like f of x-- and x
0:27
tends to be the variable most used for an input
0:30
into the function.
0:31
And the name of a function, f tends
0:34
to be the most-used variable.
0:35
But we'll see that you can use others-- is equal to,
0:41
let's say, x squared, if x is even.
0:48
And let's say it is equal to x plus 5, if x is odd.
0:59
What would happen if we input 2 into this function?
1:03
The way that we would denote inputting 2
1:05
is that we would want to evaluate f of 2.
1:10
This is saying, let's input 2 into our function f.
1:14
And everywhere we see this x here,
1:16
this variable-- you can kind of use as a placeholder-- let's
1:19
replace it with our input.
1:21
So let's see.
1:21
If 2 is even, do 2 squared.
1:24
If 2 is odd, do 2 plus 5.
1:27
Well, 2 is even, so we're going to do 2 squared.
1:31
In this case, f of 2 is going to be 2 squared, or 4.
1:36
Now what would f of 3 be?
1:40
Well, once again, everywhere we see this variable,
1:42
we'll replace it with our input.
1:48
So f of 3, 3 squared if 3 is even, 3 plus 5 if 3 is odd.
1:54
Well, 3 is odd, so it's going to be 3 plus 5.
1:57
It is going to be equal to 8.
2:02
You might say, OK, that's neat, Sal.
2:04
This was kind of an interesting way
2:05
to define a function, a way to kind of munch on these numbers.
2:09
But I could have done this with traditional equations
2:12
in some way, especially if you allowed
2:13
me to use the squirrelly bracket thing.
2:16
What can a function do that maybe my traditional toolkits
2:19
might have not been as expressive about?
2:22
Well, you could even do a function like this.
2:25
Let me not use f and x anymore, just
2:27
to show you that the notation is more general than that.
2:30
I could say h of a is equal to the next largest number that
2:47
starts with the same letter as variable a.
3:00
And we're going to assume that we're dealing in English.
3:03
Given that, what is h of 2 going to be?
3:09
Well, 2 starts with a T. What's the next largest
3:12
number that starts with a T?
3:14
Well, it's going to be equal to 3.
3:18
Now what would h of-- I don't know, let's think about this,
3:25
h of 8 be equal to?
3:27
Well, 8 starts with an E. The next largest number
3:31
that starts with an E-- it's not 9, 10-- it would be 11.
3:37
And so now you see it's a very, very, very general tool.
3:42
This h function that we just defined, we'll look at it.
3:44
We'll look at the letter that the number
3:46
starts with in English.
3:47
So it's doing this really, really, really, really
3:49
wacky thing.
3:50
Now not all functions have to be this wacky.
3:53
In fact, you have already been dealing with functions.
3:55
You have seen things like y is equal to x plus 1.
4:02
This can be viewed as a function.
4:04
We could write this as y is a function
4:07
of x, which is equal to x plus 1.
4:11
If you give as an input-- let me write
4:16
it this way-- for example, when x is 0 we could say f of 0
4:23
is equal to, well, you take 0.
4:25
You add 1.
4:26
It's equal to 1.
4:28
f of 2 is equal to 2.
4:30
You've already done this before.
4:31
You've done things where you said, look,
4:33
let me make a table of x and put our y's there.
4:37
When x is 0, y is 1.
4:40
I'm sorry.
4:42
I made a little mistake.
4:44
Where f of 2 is equal to 3.
4:46
And you've done this before with tables where you say,
4:48
look, x and y.
4:51
When x is 0, y is 1.
4:53
When x is 2, y is 3.
4:57
You might say, well, what was the whole point of using
4:59
the function notation here to say
5:01
f of x is equal to x plus 1?
5:03
The whole point is to think in these more general terms.
5:07
For something like this, you didn't really
5:09
have to introduce function notations.
5:11
But it doesn't hurt to introduce function notations because it
5:14
makes it very clear that the function takes an input,
5:17
takes my x-- in this definition it munches on it.
5:21
It says, OK, x plus 1.
5:23
And then it produces 1 more than it.
5:26
So here, whatever the input is, the output is 1 more
5:29
than that original function.
5:31
Now I know what you're asking.
5:32
All right.
5:32
Well, what is not a function then?
5:35
Well, remember, we said a function
5:36
is something that takes an input and produces only one
5:39
possible output for that given input.
5:43
For example-- and let me look at a visual way
5:46
of thinking about a function this time, or a relationship,
5:49
I should say-- let's say that's our y-axis,
5:53
and this right over here is our x-axis.
5:58
Let me draw a circle here that has radius 2.
6:05
So it's a circle of radius 2.
6:07
This is negative 2.
6:09
This is positive 2.
6:11
This is negative 2.
6:12
So my circle, it's centered at the origin.
6:15
It has radius 2.
6:17
That's my best attempt at drawing the circle.
6:20
Let me fill it in.
6:21
So this is a circle.
6:23
The equation of this circle is going
6:25
to be x squared plus y squared is equal to the radius squared,
6:28
is equal to 2 squared, or it's equal to 4.
6:31
The question is, is this relationship between x and y--
6:34
here I've expressed it as an equation.
6:35
Here I've visually drawn all of the x's and y's that satisfy
6:40
this equation-- is this relationship between x
6:43
and y a function?
6:45
And we can see visually that it's not
6:47
going to be a function.
6:48
You pick a given x.
6:49
Let's say x is equal to 1.
6:53
There's two possible y's that are associated with it,
6:57
this y up here and this y down here.
7:00
We could even solve for that by looking at the equation.
7:02
When x is equal to 1, we get 1 squared plus y squared
7:06
is equal to 4.
7:07
1 plus y squared is equal to 4.
7:11
Or subtracting 1 from both sides, y squared is equal to 3.
7:15
Or y is equal to the positive or the negative square root of 3.
7:20
This right over here is the positive square root of 3,
7:23
and this right over here is the negative square root of 3.
7:26
So this situation, this relationship
7:28
where I inputted a 1 into my little box here,
7:34
and associated with the 1, I associate
7:36
both a positive square root of 3 and a negative square root
7:40
of 3, this is not a function.
7:47
I cannot associate with my input two different outputs.
7:51
I can only have one output for a given input.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,kvGsIo1TmsM,

0:00
- Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a
0:02
principle of quantum mechanics.
0:04
And so if we take a particle, let's say we have
0:06
a particle here of Mass M, moving with Velocity V,
0:11
the momentum of that particle, the linear momentum
0:14
is equal to the Mass times the Velocity.
0:16
And according to the uncertainty principle,
0:19
you can't know the position and momentum
0:22
of that particle accurately, at the same time.
0:25
So if you know the position, if you know where that particle
0:28
is in space really well, you don't know the momentum,
0:32
or you don't know the velocity of that particle,
0:34
and vice versa.
0:35
If you know the momentum really well,
0:36
you don't know the position.
0:38
So let's look at a mathematical description
0:40
of the uncertainty principle.
0:42
So the uncertainty in the position,
0:44
so Delta X is the uncertainty in the position,
0:47
times the uncertainty in the momentum,
0:49
so Delta P is uncertainty in momentum,
0:53
the product of these two must be greater than
0:56
or equal to some constant.
0:58
And that constant is Planck's Constant:
1:00
h divided by four pi.
1:03
So we have a constant divided by another constant.
1:08
So this just gives us a number on the right side,
1:11
and you might see something a little bit different
1:12
in another textbook.
1:13
It doesn't really matter that much,
1:15
it just depends on how you define things.
1:17
So the point is, the product of the two uncertainties
1:21
must be greater than or equal to some number.
1:24
So the uncertainties are inversely proportional
1:27
to each other: if you increase one, you decrease the other.
1:31
Let's go ahead and use some really simple numbers here,
1:33
just so you can understand that point.
1:35
So let's say, and this is just extremely simplified,
1:39
so let's just see if we can understand that idea
1:40
of inversely proportional.
1:42
So if you have an uncertainty of two for the position,
1:46
and let's say you had an uncertainty
1:47
of two for the momentum.
1:49
Alright, so two times two is equal to four,
1:52
so I won't even worry about greater than,
1:55
I'll just put equal to here.
1:56
So if two times two is equal to four.
1:59
If I decrease the uncertainty of the position,
2:02
so I decrease it to one,
2:03
so the uncertainty in the momentum must increase to four,
2:08
because one times four is equal to four.
2:10
If I decrease the uncertainty in the position even more,
2:13
so if I lower that to point five, I increase the uncertainty
2:17
in the momentum, that must go up to eight.
2:19
So point five times eight gives us four.
2:22
And so, what I'm trying to show you here,
2:24
is as you decrease the uncertainty in the position,
2:28
you increase the uncertainty in the momentum.
2:31
So another way of saying that is,
2:33
the more accurately you know the position of a particle,
2:37
the less accurately you know the momentum of that particle.
2:40
And that's the idea of the uncertainty principle.
2:44
And so let's apply this uncertainty principle
2:46
to the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom.
2:49
So let's look at a picture of the Bohr model
2:51
of the hydrogen atom.
2:52
Alright, we know our negatively charged electron
2:55
orbits the nucleus, like a planet around the sun.
2:58
And, let's say the electron is going this direction,
3:01
so there is a velocity associated with that electron,
3:05
so there is velocity going in that direction.
3:08
Alright, the reason why the Bohr model is useful,
3:10
is because it allows us to understand things like
3:12
quantized energy levels.
3:14
And we talked about the radius for the electron,
3:18
so if there's a circle here, there's a radius
3:21
for an electron in the ground state,
3:23
this would be the radius of the first energy level,
3:26
is equal to 5.3 times 10 to the negative 11 meters.
3:30
So if we wanted to know the diameter of that circle,
3:33
we could just multiply the radius by two.
3:35
So two times that number would be equal
3:38
to 1.06 times 10 to the negative 10 meters.
3:44
And this is just a rough estimate of the size
3:47
of the hydrogen atom using the Bohr model,
3:50
with an electron in the ground state.
3:52
Alright, we also did some calculations
3:55
to figure out the velocity.
3:57
So the velocity of an electron in the ground state
4:01
of a hydrogen atom using the Bohr model,
4:03
we calculated that to be
4:04
2.2 times 10 to the six meters per second.
4:08
And since we know the mass of an electron,
4:10
we can actually calculate the linear momentum.
4:12
So the linear momentum P is equal
4:14
to the mass times the velocity.
4:16
Let's say we knew the velocity with a 10% uncertainty
4:21
associated with that number.
4:23
So a 10% uncertainty.
4:26
If we convert that to a decimal, we just divide 10 by 100,
4:30
so we get 10% is equal to point one.
4:34
So we have point one here.
4:35
If I want to know the uncertainty of the momentum
4:38
of that electron, so the uncertainty
4:40
in the momentum of that particle,
4:43
momentum is equal to mass times velocity.
4:45
If there's a 10% uncertainty associated with the velocity,
4:50
we need to multiply this by point one.
4:52
So let's go ahead and do that.
4:54
So we would have the mass of the electron
4:58
is 9.11 times 10 to the negative 31st.
5:02
The velocity of the electron is
5:04
2.2 times 10 to the sixth, and we know that
5:08
with 10% uncertainty, so we need to multiply
5:10
all of that by point one.
5:12
So let's go ahead and do that.
5:14
We're gonna multiply all those things together.
5:17
So we take the mass of an electron,
5:18
9.11 times 10 to the negative 31st
5:23
and we multiply that by the velocity,
5:26
2.2 times 10 to the sixth,
5:29
and we know there's a 10% uncertainty
5:32
associated with the velocity,
5:34
so we get an uncertainty in the momentum
5:36
2.0 times 10 to the negative 25.
5:40
So the uncertainty in the momentum is
5:43
2.0 times 10 to the negative 25.
5:47
And the units would be,
5:48
this is the mass in kilograms, and the velocity
5:51
was in meters over seconds,
5:53
so kilograms times meters per second.
5:55
Alright, so this is the uncertainty associated
5:59
with the momentum of our electrons.
6:02
Let's plug it in to our uncertainty principle here:
6:06
we had the uncertainty in the position of the electron,
6:10
times the uncertainty in the momentum of the electron
6:13
must be greater than or equal to
6:15
Planck's Constant divided by four pi.
6:19
So we can take that uncertainty in the momentum
6:22
and we can plug it in here.
6:24
So now we have the uncertainty in the position
6:27
of the electron in the ground state of the hydrogen atom
6:30
times 2.0 times 10 to the negative 25.
6:34
This product must be greater than or equal to,
6:37
Planck's Constant is 6.626 times 10 to the negative 34.
6:43
Alright, divide that by four pi.
6:48
So we could solve for the uncertainty in the position.
6:52
So, Delta X must be greater than or equal to,
6:56
let's go ahead and do that math.
6:58
So we have Planck's Constant,
7:00
6.626 times 10 to the negative 34,
7:06
we divide that by 4, we need to divide that also by pi,
7:13
and then we need to divide by the
7:15
uncertainty in the momentum.
7:17
So we also need to divide by the uncertainty in momentum,
7:20
that's 2.0 times 10 to the negative 25,
7:25
and that gives us 2.6 times 10 to the negative 10.
7:30
So the uncertainty in the position must be greater than
7:33
or equal to 2.6 times 10 to the negative 10
7:39
and if you worked our your units,
7:41
you would get meters for this.
7:43
So the uncertainty in the position must be
7:46
greater than or equal to
7:46
2.6 times 10 to the negative 10 meters.
7:49
Let's go back up here to the picture of the hydrogen atom.
7:53
2.6 times 10 to the negative 10 meters,
7:55
that's greater than the diameter of our hydrogen atom,
8:00
so the uncertainty would be greater than this diameter.
8:04
So the uncertainty in the position would be greater than
8:07
the diameter of the hydrogen atom, using the Bohr model.
8:10
So the Bohr model is wrong.
8:12
It's telling us we know the electron is orbiting the nucleus
8:15
at a certain radius, and it's moving at a certain velocity.
8:18
The uncertainty principle says this isn't true.
8:21
If we know the velocity fairly accurately,
8:24
we don't know the position of the electron,
8:27
the position of the electron is greater than
8:28
the diameter, according to the Bohr model.
8:30
So this just one reason why the Bohr model is wrong.
8:34
But again, we keep the Bohr model around
8:36
because it is useful as a simple model
8:38
when you're just starting to get into chemistry.
8:40
But this concept of the uncertainty principle goes
8:44
against our natural intuitions.
8:46
So our every day life doesn't really give us
8:48
any experience with the uncertainty principle.
8:51
For example, if we had a particle,
8:53
let's make it a much bigger particle here,
8:55
so a much bigger particle than an electron,
8:58
so something that we can actually see in our real life,
9:00
and so this has a much bigger mass,
9:03
and moving with some velocity,
9:04
logic tells us we can figure out pretty accurately
9:07
where the position of that object is,
9:09
and we can probably, pretty accurately,
9:11
figure out the velocity, and so we know the momentum.
9:14
And, that's true.
9:16
We do know these things fairly accurately.
9:19
But if you did a calculation using
9:21
the uncertainty principle, so if you plugged in some
9:24
different numbers, like if you increased the mass,
9:26
so instead of 9.11 times 10 to the negative 31st,
9:29
let's say you're using nine kilograms,
9:31
and you plugged in some velocity here,
9:34
and you solved for the uncertainty in the position,
9:37
you're gonna get an uncertainty in the position
9:38
that's extremely small.
9:40
So you don't really notice those things
9:42
on a macroscopic scale.
9:44
You only notice them when you think about the atomic scale.
9:47
And so that's why this isn't really an intuitive concept.
9:50
Same idea with quantum mechanics:
9:52
quantum mechanics is something
9:53
that makes absolutely no sense when you first encounter it.
9:56
You have no experience with quantum mechanics
9:58
in your daily life, it just doesn't make any sense.
10:00
You don't see these sorts of things.
10:02
So this is just showing you an application
10:05
at an atomic scale.
10:07
Again, this is the uncertainty principle.
10:09
We'll get more into quantum mechanics,
10:11
and how quantum mechanics affects

We are being asked, what is the smallest-- this
0:04
is a little typo here-- what is the smallest
0:07
possible sum of squares of two numbers
0:10
if their product is negative 16?
0:14
So let's say that these two numbers are x and y.
0:19
So how could we define the sum of the squares of the two
0:22
numbers?
0:23
So I'll just call that the sum of the squares,
0:25
s for sum of the squares, and it would just
0:28
be equal to x squared plus y squared.
0:32
And this is what we want to minimize.
0:35
We want to minimize s.
0:40
Now, right now s is expressed as a function of x and y.
0:43
We don't know how to minimize with respect to two variables,
0:46
so we have to get this in terms of only one variable.
0:48
And lucky for us, they give us another piece of information.
0:51
Their product is negative 16.
0:54
So x times y is equal to negative 16.
1:00
So let's say we wanted this expression
1:03
right over here only in terms of x.
1:05
Well, then we can figure out what
1:07
y is in terms of x and then substitute.
1:10
So let's do that right over here.
1:11
If we divide both sides by x, we get y is equal to negative 16
1:16
over x.
1:17
And so let's replace our y in this expression
1:20
with negative 16 over x.
1:23
So then we would get our sum of squares
1:27
as a function of x is going to be
1:29
equal to x squared plus y squared.
1:32
y is negative 16 over x.
1:38
And then that's what we will now square.
1:41
So this is equal to x squared plus, what is this?
1:46
256 over x squared.
1:48
Or we could write that as 256x to the negative 2 power.
1:54
That is the sum of our squares that we now want to minimize.
1:59
Well, to minimize this, we would want
2:02
to look at the critical points of this, which
2:04
is where the derivative is either 0 or undefined,
2:07
and see whether those critical points are possibly
2:09
a minimum or a maximum point.
2:11
They don't have to be, but those are
2:12
the ones if we have a minimum or a maximum point,
2:15
they're going to be one of the critical points.
2:16
So let's take the derivative.
2:18
So the derivative s prime-- let me
2:21
do this in a different color-- s prime of x.
2:24
I'll do it right over here, actually.
2:26
The derivative s prime of x with respect
2:28
to x is going to be equal to 2x times
2:32
negative 2 times 2x plus 256 times negative 2.
2:38
So that's minus 512x to the negative 3 power.
2:45
Now, this is going to be undefined when x is equal to 0.
2:52
But if x is equal to 0, then y is undefined.
2:55
So this whole thing breaks down.
2:57
So that isn't a useful critical point, x equals 0.
3:01
So let's think about any other ones.
3:02
Well, it's defined everywhere else.
3:04
So let's think about where the derivative is equal to 0.
3:07
So when does this thing equal 0?
3:09
So when does 2x minus 512x to the negative 3 equal 0?
3:16
Well, we can add 512x to the negative 3 to both sides.
3:19
So you get 2x is equal to 512x to the negative third power.
3:26
We can multiply both sides times x to the third power
3:32
so all the x's go away on the right-hand side.
3:34
So you get 2x to the fourth is equal to 512.
3:40
We can divide both sides by 2, and you
3:42
get x to the fourth power is equal to 256.
3:49
And so what is the fourth root of 256?
3:52
Well, we could take the square root of both sides just
3:54
to help us here.
3:56
So let's see.
3:57
So it's going to be x squared is going to be equal to 256
4:01
is 16 squared.
4:03
So this is 16.
4:05
This is going to be x squared is equal to 16 or x is equal to 4.
4:12
Now that's our only critical point we have,
4:15
so that's probably the x value that
4:17
minimizes our sum of squares right over here.
4:19
But let's make sure it's a minimum value.
4:21
And to do that, we can just do our second derivative test.
4:24
So let's figure out.
4:25
Let's take the second derivative s
4:27
prime prime of x and figure out if we are concave upwards
4:31
or downwards when x is equal to 4.
4:34
So s prime prime of x is going to be equal to 2.
4:37
And then we're going to have negative 3 times negative 512.
4:41
So I'll just write that as plus 3 times 512.
4:45
That's going to be 1,536.
4:48
Is that right?
4:48
Yeah, 3 times 500 is 1,500, 3 times 12
4:51
is 36, x to the negative 4 power.
4:57
And this thing right over here is actually
4:59
going to be positive for any x.
5:04
x to the negative 4, even if the negative x value,
5:08
that's going to be positive.
5:09
Everything else is positive.
5:10
This thing is always positive.
5:12
So we are always in a concave upwards situation.
5:18
Concave upwards means that our graph might look something
5:22
like that.
5:23
Actually, I don't want to draw the little squiggle.
5:25
It might look something like that.
5:26
And you see there's a reason why the second derivative implies
5:29
concave upwards, a second derivative positive
5:31
means that our derivative is constantly increasing.
5:35
So the derivative is constantly increasing.
5:36
It's negative, less negative, even less negative.
5:39
Let me do it in a different color.
5:41
You see it's negative, less negative, even less negative,
5:45
0, positive, more positive.
5:47
So it's increasing over the entire place.
5:50
So if you have a critical point where
5:53
the derivative is equal to 0, so the slope is equal to 0,
5:57
and it's concave upwards, you see pretty clearly
6:00
that we have minimized the function.
6:04
So what is y going to be equal to?
6:06
We actually don't even have to figure out
6:08
what y has to be equal to in order
6:10
to minimize the sum of squares.
6:11
We could just put it back into this.
6:13
But just for fun, we see that y would be negative 16 over x.
6:17
So y would be equal to negative 4.
6:20
And we could just figure out now what our sum of squares is.
6:23
Our minimum sum of squares is going
6:26
to be equal to 4 squared, which is 16 plus negative 4
6:31
squared plus another 16, which is equal to 32.
6:35
Now I know some of you might be thinking, hey,
6:37
I could have done this without calculus.
6:39
I could have just tried out numbers whose product is
6:41
negative 16 and I probably would have tried out 4 and negative 4
6:45
in not too much time and then I would
6:47
have been able to maybe figure out it's lower than if I did
6:49
2 and negative 8 or negative 2 and 8 or 1 and 16.
6:53
And that's true, you probably would
6:55
have been able to do that.
6:56
But you still wouldn't have been able to feel good
6:58
that that was a minimum value, because you wouldn't
7:00
have tried out 4.01 or 4.0011.
7:03
In fact, you couldn't have tried out all of the possible values.
7:06
Remember, we didn't say that this is only integers.
7:08
It just happened to be that our values just worked out
7:12
to be integers in this situation.
7:14
You can imagine what would happen if the problem wasn't
7:17
if their product is negative 16, but what
7:19
if their product is negative 17?
7:23
Or what if the product is negative 16.5?
7:25
Or what if their product was pi squared?
7:28
Then you wouldn't be able to try everything else out
7:30
and you would have to resort to doing
7:32
what we did in this video.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,1TK8V_qmqrk,
khan_video_Alhcv5d_XOs_15,How would you solve this to determine dependence without knowing the value(s) of a vector?,Essay,"•
0:00
I think by now we have a reasonable sense of what
0:03
linear dependence means.
0:07
So let's just do a slightly more formal definition of
0:11
linear dependence.
0:13
So we're going to say that a set of vectors-- Let me just
0:16
define my set of vectors.
0:18
Let me call my set s of vectors, v1, v2,
0:24
all the way to vn.
0:27
I'm going to say that they are linearly dependent.
0:36
If and only if.
0:38
So sometimes it's written if, if with a lot of f's in there.
0:42
So sometimes it's written if and only if.
0:45
Sometimes it's shown like an arrow in two directions.
0:49
If and only if I can satisfy this equation, I can find a
0:54
set of constants c1 times v1.
0:59
I can take a linear combination of my vectors all
1:03
the way to cn vn, that satisfy the equation that I can create
1:10
this into the 0 vector.
1:13
Sometimes it's just written as a bold 0, and sometimes you
1:16
could just write it -- I mean we don't know the
1:18
dimensionality of this vector.
1:20
It would be a bunch of 0's.
1:22
We don't know how many actual elements are in each of these
1:29
vectors, but you get the idea.
1:32
My set of vectors is linearly dependent-- remember I'm
1:35
saying dependent, not independent --is linearly
1:39
dependant, if and only if I can satisfy this equation for
1:43
some ci's where not all of them are equal to 0.
1:54
This is key, not all are 0.
1:58
Or you could say it the other way.
2:00
You could say at least one is non-zero.
2:09
So how does this gel with what we were talking about in the
2:12
previous video where I said look, a set is linearly
2:15
dependent if one of the of vectors can be represented by
2:19
the combination of the other vectors?
2:24
Let me write that down.
2:25
In the last few I said, look, one vector can be -- Let me
2:35
write it this way.
2:37
One vector being represented by the some of the other
2:39
vectors, I can just write it like this.
2:41
I can write it a little bit more math-y.
2:43
In the last video, I said that linear dependence means that--
2:46
let me just pick an arbitrary vector, v1.
2:50
Let's say that v1, you know this is arbitrary, v1 one
2:53
could be represented by some combination
2:55
of the other vectors.
2:57
Let me call them a1 times v -- let me be careful -- a2 times
3:04
v2 plus a3 times v3 plus all the way up to an times vn.
3:11
This is what we said in the previous video.
3:13
If this is linear dependence, any one of these guys can be
3:16
represented as some combination of the other ones.
3:19
So how does this imply that?
3:21
In order show this if and only if, I have to show that this
3:24
implies that and I have to show that that implies this.
3:29
So this is almost a trivially easy proof.
3:31
Because if I subtract v1 from both sides of this equation I
3:36
get 0 is equal to minus 1 v1 plus a2 v2 plus a3 v3 all the
3:49
way to an vn.
3:52
And clearly I've just said, well,
3:55
this is linearly dependent.
3:57
That means that I can represent this vector as a sum
4:00
of the other vectors, which means that minus 1 times v1
4:04
plus some combination of the other vectors is equal to 0,
4:07
which means that I've been able to satisfy this equation,
4:12
and at least one of my constants is non-zero.
4:19
So I've shown you that, if I can represent one of the
4:23
vectors by a sum of the other ones, then this condition is
4:26
definitely going to be true.
4:28
Now let me go the other way.
4:29
Let me show you if I have this situation that I can
4:32
definitely represent one of the vectors as
4:35
the sum of the others.
4:36
So let's say that this is true.
4:42
And one of these constants, remember it's not just this,
4:46
it's at least one, is non-zero.
4:48
So let me just assume, just for the sake of simplicity-- I
4:50
mean these are all arbitrary.
4:53
I'll do it in a new color.
4:55
Let me do it in the magenta.
4:57
Let me assume that c1 is not equal to 0.
5:03
If c1 is not equal to 0, then I can divide both sides of
5:06
this equation by c1.
5:08
And what do I get?
5:09
I get v1 plus c2 over c1 v2 plus all the way up to cn over
5:19
c1 is equal to 0.
5:23
And then I can multiply both sides of this, or I could add
5:28
negative v1 to both sides of this equation or subtract v1
5:31
from both sides.
5:32
And I get c2 over c1 v2 plus all the way up to cn over c1
5:41
vn-- there's a vn here --is equal to minus v1.
5:46
Now if I just multiply both sides of this by negative 1, I
5:49
get a minus, and all these become minuses and this
5:52
becomes a plus.
5:53
And I just showed you that if at least one of these
5:56
constants is non-zero, that I can represent my vector v1 as
6:02
some combination of the other vectors.
6:04
So we're able to go this way too.
6:07
If this condition is true, then I can represent one of
6:10
the vectors as a combination of the others.
6:12
If I can represent one of those vectors as a combination
6:14
of the others, then this condition is true.
6:17
Hopefully that kind of proves that these two definitions are
6:20
equivalent.
6:21
Maybe it's a little bit of overkill.
6:22
Let's apply that definition now, to actually test. You
6:26
might say, hey Sal, why'd you go through all of this effort?
6:28
I went through all of this effort because this is
6:30
actually a really useful way to test whether things are
6:36
linearly independent or dependent.
6:39
Let's try it out.
6:40
Let's use our newly found tool.
6:43
Let's say I have the set of vectors--
6:47
Let me do it up here.
6:48
I want to be efficient with my space usage.
6:51
So let's say I have the set of vectors 2,1 and 3,2.
6:59
And my question to you is, are these linearly independent or
7:03
are they linearly dependent?
7:06
In order for them to be linearly dependent, that means
7:11
that if some constant times 2,1 plus some other constant
7:18
times this second vector, 3,2 where this
7:23
should be equal to 0.
7:24
Where these both aren't necessarily 0.
7:27
Before I go up for this problem, let's remember what
7:30
we're going to find out.
7:32
If either of these are non-zero, if c1 or c2 are
7:38
non-zero, then this implies that we are dealing with a
7:44
dependent, linearly dependent set.
7:51
If c1 and c2 are both 0, if the only way to satisfy this
7:58
equation -- I mean you can always satisfy it by sitting
8:02
everything equal to 0.
8:02
But if the only way to satisfy it is by making both of these
8:06
guys 0, then we're dealing with a
8:08
linearly independent set.
8:13
Let's try to do some math.
8:15
And this'll just take us back to our Algebra 1 days.
8:19
In order for this to be true, that means 2 times c1 plus 3
8:25
times c2 is equal to -- when I say this is equal to 0, it's
8:29
really the 0 vector.
8:30
I can rewrite this as 0,0.
8:34
So 2 times c1 plus 3 times c2 would be
8:37
equal to that 0 there.
8:39
And then we'd have 1 times c1 plus 2 times c2 is
8:46
equal to that 0.
8:50
And now this is just a system, two equations, two unknowns.
8:53
A couple of things we could do.
8:55
Let's just multiply this top equation by 1/2.
9:02
If you multiply it by 1/2 you get c1 plus 3/2 plus 3/2 c2 is
9:12
equal to 0.
9:15
And then if we subtract the green equation from the red
9:18
equation this becomes 0.
9:20
2 minus 1 and 1/2-- 3/2 is 1 and 1/2 --of this is just 1/2
9:25
c2 is equal to 0.
9:27
And this is easy to solve.
9:29
c2 is equal to 0.
9:32
So what's c1?
9:33
Well, just substitute this back in. c2 is equal to 0.
9:36
So this is equal to 0.
9:38
So c1 plus 0 is equal to 0.
9:40
So c1 is also equal to 0.
9:42
We could have substituted it back into that
9:44
top equation as well.
9:45
So the only solution to this equation involves both c1 and
9:52
c2 being equal to 0.
9:54
So they both have to be 0.
9:56
So this is a linearly independent set of vectors.
10:04
Which means that neither of them are redundant
10:06
of the other one.
10:07
You can't represent one as a combination of the other.
10:10
And since we have two vectors here, and they're linearly
10:13
independent, we can actually know that this will span r2.
10:22
The span of my r vectors is equal to r2.
10:26
If one of these vectors was just some multiple of the
10:29
other, than the span would have been some line within r2,
10:32
not all of.
10:33
But now I can represent any vector in r2 as some
10:35
combination of those.
10:37
Let's do another example.
10:41
Let me scroll to the right, because sometimes this thing,
10:46
when I go too far down, I haven't figured out why, when
10:49
I go too far down it starts messing up.
10:51
So my next example is the set of vectors.
10:56
So I have the vector 2,1.
11:00
I have the vector 3,2.
11:04
And I have the vector 1,2.
11:08
And I want to know are these linearly dependent or linearly
11:11
independent.
11:12
So I go to through the same drill.
11:13
I use that little theorem that I proved at the beginning of
11:17
this video.
11:19
In order for them to be linearly dependent there must
11:24
be some set of weights that I can multiply these guys.
11:28
So c1 times this vector plus c2 times this vector plus c3
11:37
times that vector, that will equal the 0 vector.
11:43
And if one of these is non-zero then we're dealing
11:45
with a linearly dependent set of vectors.
11:49
And if all of them are 0, then it's independent.
11:52
Let's just do our linear algebra.
12:00
So this means that 2 times c1 plus 3 times c2 plus c3 is
12:10
equal to that 0 up there.
12:13
And then if we do the bottom rows-- Remember when you
12:15
multiply a scalar times a vector you multiply it by each
12:17
of these terms. So c1 times 1.
12:19
1c1 plus 2c2 plus 2c3 is equal to 0.
12:29
There's a couple of giveaways on this problem.
12:31
If you have three two-dimensional vectors, one
12:34
of them is going to be redundant.
12:37
Because, in the very best case, even if you assume that
12:41
that vector and that vector are linearly independent, then
12:44
these would span r2.
12:45
Which means that any point, any vector, in your
12:49
two-dimensional space can be represented by some
12:51
combination of those two.
12:53
In which case, this is going to be one of them because this
12:56
is just a vector in two-dimensional space.
12:57
So it would be linearly dependent.
12:59
And then, if you say, well, these aren't linearly
13:01
independent then, they're just multiples of each other.
13:07
In which case, this would definitely be a linearly
13:09
dependent set.
13:11
When you see three vectors that are each only vectors in
13:15
r2, that are each two-dimensional vectors, it's
13:17
a complete giveaway that this is linearly dependent.
13:20
But I'm going to show it to you using our dependent, using
13:25
our little theorem here.
13:27
So I'm going to show you that I can get non-zero c3's, c2's,
13:30
and c1's such that I can get a 0 here.
13:34
If all of these had to be 0-- I mean you can always set them
13:37
equal to 0.
13:37
But if they had to be equal to 0, then it would be linearly
13:39
independent.
13:41
Let me just show you.
13:43
I can just pick some random c3.
13:45
Let me pick c3 to be equal to negative 1.
13:49
So what would these two equations reduce to?
13:51
I mean you have just three unknowns and two equations, it
13:53
means you don't have enough constraints on your system.
13:57
So if I just set c3-- I just pick that out of a hat.
13:59
I could have picked c3 to be anything.
14:01
But if I set c3 to be equal to negative 1, what do these
14:05
equations become?
14:06
You get 2c1 plus 3c2 minus 1 is equal to 0.
14:12
And you get c1 plus 2c2 minus 2 is equal to 0.
14:19
Right?
14:19
2 times minus 1.
14:22
What can I do here?
14:24
If I multiply this second equation by 2, what do I get?
14:28
I get 2 plus 4c2 minus 4 is equal to 0.
14:37
And now let's subtract this equation from that equation.
14:41
So the c1's cancel out.
14:43
3c2 minus 4c2 is minus c2.
14:47
And then minus 1 minus minus 4, so that's minus 1 plus 4.
14:53
That's plus 3 is equal to 0.
14:58
And so we get our -- Let me make sure I got that right.
15:06
We have a minus 1 minus a minus 4.
15:10
So plus 4.
15:11
So we have a plus 3.
15:13
So that is a minus 2.
15:20
So minus c2 is equal to minus 3 or c2 is equal to 3.
15:28
And if c2 is equal to 3 and c3 is equal to minus 1-- Let's
15:32
just substitute here, so we get c1 plus 2 times c2, so
15:38
plus 6, plus 2 times c3.
15:41
So minus 2 is equal to 0.
15:45
c1 plus 4 is equal to 0.
15:48
c1 is equal to minus 4.
15:54
I'm giving you a combination of c's that
15:56
will give us a 0 vector.
15:58
If I multiply minus 4 times our first vector, 2,1, that's
16:03
c1, plus 3 times our second vector, 3,2 minus 1 times our
16:13
third vector, 1,2 this should be equal to 0.
16:16
Let's verify it just for fun.
16:18
Minus 4 times 2 is minus 8 plus 9 minus 1.
16:24
Yeah, that's minus 9 plus 9.
16:26
That's 0.
16:27
Minus 4 times plus 6 minus 2 that's also 0.
16:36
So we've just shown a linear combination of these vectors,
16:39
where actually none of the constants are 0.
16:41
But all we had to show was that at least one of the
16:43
constants had to be non-zero, and we actually showed all
16:46
three of them were.
16:47
But at least one of these had to be non-zero.
16:49
And I was able to satisfy this equation, I was able to make
16:53
them into the zero vector.
16:54
So this shows, this proves, that this is a linearly
17:02
dependent set of vectors.
17:07
Which means one of the vectors is redundant.
17:09
And you can never just say, oh, this is the redundant
17:11
vector, because I can represent this as combination
17:13
of those two.
17:14
You could just as easily pick this guy as the redundant
17:16
vector, and say, hey, I can represent this guy as the sum
17:19
of those two.
17:20
There's not one bad apple in the bunch.
17:23
Any of them can be represented by the combination of some
17:26
other, by all of the rest of them.
17:29
So hopefully you have a better intuition of linear dependence
17:33
and independence.
17:33
Maybe I'll continue.
17:34
I'll do a few more examples in the next video.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Alhcv5d_XOs,

Let's think about how or what 1/2 times 5 represents.
0:07
So one way to think about it is that this could be five 1/2's
0:11
added together.
0:12
So you could view this as 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2
0:17
plus 1/2 plus 1/2, which is the same thing as 1 plus 1 plus 1
0:22
plus 1 plus 1, over 2, which is equal to 5/2.
0:32
The other way to think about this
0:34
is that you start with 5 things.
0:41
So let's say, that's 1 thing.
0:42
Let me copy and paste that so they all look the same.
0:47
So then let me paste it.
0:48
So that's 2 things.
0:51
That's 3 things.
0:53
That's 4 things.
0:56
And that's 5 things.
0:58
So the other way to think about it is you start with 5 things,
1:01
and you take 1/2 of them.
1:03
So what would be 1/2 of this?
1:06
Well, let's see.
1:07
You have 5 things, so you would get-- 5 divided by 2
1:11
would be 2 and 1/2.
1:13
So you would get this far.
1:16
Let me make it like this.
1:18
So you would get this one.
1:20
You would get this one.
1:22
And you would get this one.
1:24
Now, is this the same thing as 5/2?
1:27
Well, what happens if we divide each of these wholes
1:29
into halves?
1:30
So let's do that.
1:32
So if we just multiplied-- so we just divide each of these
1:36
into 2.
1:37
So instead of having 5 wholes, we now have 10 halves.
1:44
How many of those halves have we filled in?
1:47
Well, we have filled in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
1:52
So this is also equal to 5/2.
2:02
So far we just did it thinking about what
2:04
multiplication actually means.
2:06
But if you said, well, how did I compute this?
2:09
Well, the way you could think about it,
2:11
and multiplying fractions is actually
2:13
straightforward from that point of view,
2:15
is as long as you can express both of them as fractions,
2:19
and 5 we already know is the same thing as 5 ones,
2:24
so this we can just multiply times 5/1.
2:32
So now that I've expressed both of them as fractions,
2:35
I can just multiply the numerator.
2:37
So 1 times 5 over 2 times 1.
2:51
And what's that going to be equal to?
2:53
Well, 1 times 5 is 5.
2:57
2 times 1 is 2.

0:03
So here we have this number line
0:05
that goes from zero to 0.1, or 1/10,
0:09
and between zero and 1/10,
0:11
we have one, two, three, four, five, six,
0:14
seven, eight, nine, ten equal spaces.
0:18
So each of these spaces represents 1/10th of the distance,
0:23
is one out of ten equal spaces.
0:26
Or we could say, it is 1/10th of this tenth,
0:31
it's a tenth of the way to 1/10th.
0:35
That's a little bit tricky,
0:36
maybe let's pause and look at that visually
0:38
and think about what does a tenth of a tenth really mean.
0:42
So here I have already drawn
0:44
a picture that's divided into 10 equal pieces.
0:47
And if we shade one of them, then we're shading 1/10th.
0:53
This right here is 1/10th.
0:55
And this amount right here is what the number line showed,
0:58
the whole number line showed 1/10th.
1:01
But then we had divided that tenth into 10 equal pieces,
1:05
so if we split that 10 into 10 equal pieces,
1:09
we're gonna have something like this.
1:12
So here again this top row would represent the entire tenth,
1:17
from the whole number line,
1:19
but each little piece would be 1/10th of that whole tenth.
1:26
Or, so this is what each little piece
1:29
on the number line represents,
1:31
or we could say that's 1/100th,
1:35
a tenth of a tenth is a 1/100th,
1:38
'cause when you divide 10 into 10 equal pieces,
1:40
you're gonna end up with 100 pieces.
1:43
So a tenth of a tenth is a 1/100th.
1:48
So looking back at the number line,
1:50
now we know that this distance,
1:53
a tenth of our tenth, is 1/100th.
1:57
And we want to graph 0.04.
2:02
Well this four right here, let's think about place value.
2:06
The zero's in the ones, the next zero in the tenth,
2:10
and this four is in the hundreds,
2:12
so we could call this four hundredths,

So if one of these lengths is 1/100

and we wanna go 4/100,

0:00
In this video we're going to get introduced to the
0:03
Pythagorean theorem, which is fun on its own.
0:14
But you'll see as you learn more and more mathematics it's
0:16
one of those cornerstone theorems of really all of math.
0:21
It's useful in geometry, it's kind of the backbone
0:24
of trigonometry.
0:26
You're also going to use it to calculate distances
0:29
between points.
0:30
So it's a good thing to really make sure we know well.
0:33
So enough talk on my end.
0:35
Let me tell you what the Pythagorean theorem is.
0:38
So if we have a triangle, and the triangle has to be a right
0:43
triangle, which means that one of the three angles in the
0:49
triangle have to be 90 degrees.
0:51
And you specify that it's 90 degrees by drawing that
0:54
little box right there.
0:55
So that right there is-- let me do this in a different
0:58
color-- a 90 degree angle.
1:05
Or, we could call it a right angle.
1:09
And a triangle that has a right angle in it is
1:13
called a right triangle.
1:15
So this is called a right triangle.
1:21
Now, with the Pythagorean theorem, if we know two sides
1:25
of a right triangle we can always figure out
1:28
the third side.
1:30
And before I show you how to do that, let me give you one
1:34
more piece of terminology.
1:36
The longest side of a right triangle is the side opposite
1:43
the 90 degree angle-- or opposite the right angle.
1:46
So in this case it is this side right here.
1:49
This is the longest side.
1:51
And the way to figure out where that right triangle is, and
1:55
kind of it opens into that longest side.
1:58
That longest side is called the hypotenuse.
2:03
And it's good to know, because we'll keep referring to it.
2:05
And just so we always are good at identifying the hypotenuse,
2:09
let me draw a couple of more right triangles.
2:12
So let's say I have a triangle that looks like that.
2:17
Let me draw it a little bit nicer.
2:19
So let's say I have a triangle that looks like that.
2:22
And I were to tell you that this angle right
2:24
here is 90 degrees.
2:25
In this situation this is the hypotenuse, because it is
2:29
opposite the 90 degree angle.
2:33
It is the longest side.
2:34
Let me do one more, just so that we're good at
2:36
recognizing the hypotenuse.
2:39
So let's say that that is my triangle, and this is the 90
2:44
degree angle right there.
2:45
And I think you know how to do this already.
2:47
You go right what it opens into.
2:49
That is the hypotenuse.
2:51
That is the longest side.
2:57
So once you have identified the hypotenuse-- and let's say
3:00
that that has length C.
3:02
And now we're going to learn what the Pythagorean
3:03
theorem tells us.
3:05
So let's say that C is equal to the length of the hypotenuse.
3:08
So let's call this C-- that side is C.
3:11
Let's call this side right over here A.
3:17
And let's call this side over here B.
3:21
So the Pythagorean theorem tells us that A squared-- so
3:28
the length of one of the shorter sides squared-- plus
3:32
the length of the other shorter side squared is going to
3:36
be equal to the length of the hypotenuse squared.
3:41
Now let's do that with an actual problem, and you'll see
3:43
that it's actually not so bad.
3:45
So let's say that I have a triangle that looks like this.
3:49
Let me draw it.
3:51
Let's say this is my triangle.
3:54
It looks something like this.
3:57
And let's say that they tell us that this is the right angle.
4:00
That this length right here-- let me do this in different
4:02
colors-- this length right here is 3, and that this
4:06
length right here is 4.
4:09
And they want us to figure out that length right there.
4:14
Now the first thing you want to do, before you even apply the
4:17
Pythagorean theorem, is to make sure you have your
4:19
hypotenuse straight.
4:20
You make sure you know what you're solving for.
4:23
And in this circumstance we're solving for the hypotenuse.
4:26
And we know that because this side over here, it is the side
4:30
opposite the right angle.
4:33
If we look at the Pythagorean theorem, this is C.
4:36
This is the longest side.
4:38
So now we're ready to apply the Pythagorean theorem.
4:41
It tells us that 4 squared-- one of the shorter sides-- plus
4:48
3 squared-- the square of another of the shorter sides--
4:53
is going to be equal to this longer side squared-- the
4:56
hypotenuse squared-- is going to be equal to C squared.
5:00
And then you just solve for C.
5:02
So 4 squared is the same thing as 4 times 4.
5:06
That is 16.
5:08
And 3 squared is the same thing as 3 times 3.
5:11
So that is 9.
5:13
And that is going to be equal to C squared.
5:18
Now what is 16 plus 9?
5:20
It's 25.
5:22
So 25 is equal to C squared.
5:25
And we could take the positive square root of both sides.
5:29
I guess, just if you look at it mathematically, it could
5:30
be negative 5 as well.
5:33
But we're dealing with distances, so we only care
5:34
about the positive roots.
5:37
So you take the principal root of both sides and
5:41
you get 5 is equal to C.
5:44
Or, the length of the longest side is equal to 5.
5:50
Now, you can use the Pythagorean theorem, if we give
5:52
you two of the sides, to figure out the third side no matter
5:54
what the third side is.
5:55
So let's do another one right over here.
5:59
Let's say that our triangle looks like this.
6:10
And that is our right angle.
6:12
Let's say this side over here has length 12, and let's say
6:17
that this side over here has length 6.
6:21
And we want to figure out this length right over there.
6:27
Now, like I said, the first thing you want to do is
6:29
identify the hypotenuse.
6:31
And that's going to be the side opposite the right angle.
6:34
We have the right angle here.
6:35
You go opposite the right angle.
6:37
The longest side, the hypotenuse, is right there.
6:41
So if we think about the Pythagorean theorem-- that A
6:46
squared plus B squared is equal to C squared-- 12
6:50
you could view as C.
6:52
This is the hypotenuse.
6:54
The C squared is the hypotenuse squared.
6:56
So you could say 12 is equal to C.
6:59
And then we could say that these sides, it doesn't matter
7:00
whether you call one of them A or one of them B.
7:02
So let's just call this side right here.
7:04
Let's say A is equal to 6.
7:06
And then we say B-- this colored B-- is equal
7:11
to question mark.
7:12
And now we can apply the Pythagorean theorem.
7:15
A squared, which is 6 squared, plus the unknown B squared is
7:25
equal to the hypotenuse squared-- is equal
7:28
to C squared.
7:29
Is equal to 12 squared.
7:33
And now we can solve for B.
7:35
And notice the difference here.
7:36
Now we're not solving for the hypotenuse.
7:38
We're solving for one of the shorter sides.
7:40
In the last example we solved for the hypotenuse.
7:42
We solved for C.
7:43
So that's why it's always important to recognize that A
7:46
squared plus B squared plus C squared, C is the length
7:49
of the hypotenuse.
7:49
So let's just solve for B here.
7:51
So we get 6 squared is 36, plus B squared, is equal
7:59
to 12 squared-- this 12 times 12-- is 144.
8:04
Now we can subtract 36 from both sides of this equation.
8:11
Those cancel out.
8:13
On the left-hand side we're left with just a B squared
8:17
is equal to-- now 144 minus 36 is what?
8:23
144 minus 30 is 114.
8:27
And then you subtract 6, is 108.
8:30
So this is going to be 108.
8:33
So that's what B squared is, and now we want to take the
8:36
principal root, or the positive root, of both sides.
8:40
And you get B is equal to the square root, the
8:44
principal root, of 108.
8:48
Now let's see if we can simplify this a little bit.
8:50
The square root of 108.
8:53
And what we could do is we could take the prime
8:54
factorization of 108 and see how we can
8:56
simplify this radical.
8:58
So 108 is the same thing as 2 times 54, which is the same
9:07
thing as 2 times 27, which is the same thing as 3 times 9.
9:15
So we have the square root of 108 is the same thing as the
9:19
square root of 2 times 2 times-- well actually,
9:24
I'm not done.
9:25
9 can be factorized into 3 times 3.
9:28
So it's 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 times 3.
9:34
And so, we have a couple of perfect squares in here.
9:36
Let me rewrite it a little bit neater.
9:38
And this is all an exercise in simplifying radicals that you
9:41
will bump into a lot while doing the Pythagorean theorem,
9:44
so it doesn't hurt to do it right here.
9:46
So this is the same thing as the square root of 2 times 2
9:55
times 3 times 3 times the square root of that last
10:00
3 right over there.
10:02
And this is the same thing.
10:04
And, you know, you wouldn't have to do all of
10:05
this on paper.
10:07
You could do it in your head.
10:08
What is this?
10:09
2 times 2 is 4.
10:11
4 times 9, this is 36.
10:14
So this is the square root of 36 times the square root of 3.
10:18
The principal root of 36 is 6.
10:20
So this simplifies to 6 square roots of 3.
10:25
So the length of B, you could write it as the square root of
10:28
108, or you could say it's equal to 6 times the
10:34
square root of 3.
10:35
This is 12, this is 6.
10:37
And the square root of 3, well this is going to be a 1
10:40
point something something.
10:41
So it's going to be a little bit larger than 6.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,AA6RfgP-AHU,

This is positive 2.

Move the orange dot to 1.9 on the number line.
0:34

0:38
This gets us to 1.
0:39
In fact, this is 0.5, 1, 1.5.
0:43
And 1.9 is only going to be a tenth less than 2.
0:46
So it's going to be-- let's see, that's 2,
0:49
so a tenth less than that.
0:52
And I'm assuming that it's locking us to the tenths.
0:55
And it looks like it is, so that looks pretty close to 1.9.
0:59
Let's do one more of these.
1:01
Move the orange dot to 0.5 on the number line.

teded_The wars that inspired Game of Thrones - Alex Gendler - 06:01_1,Why were they called the Wars of the Roses?,multiple-choices,"As far as we know,
Medieval England was never invaded
by ice zombies,
or terrorized by dragons,
but it was shaken by a power struggle
between two noble families
spanning generations
and involving a massive 
cast of characters
with complex motives 
and shifting loyalties.
If that sounds familiar,
it's because the historical conflicts
known as the Wars of the Roses
served as the basis for much 
of the drama in Game of Thrones.
The real-life seeds of war were sewn 
by the death of King Edward III in 1377.
Edward's oldest son 
had died before his father,
but his ten-year-old son, Richard II,
succeeded to the throne 
ahead of Edward's three surviving sons.
This skipping of an entire generation
left lingering claims to the throne
among their various offspring,
particularly the Lancasters,
descended from Edward's third son,
and the Yorks, descended 
from his fourth son.
The name of the ensuing wars
comes from the symbols 
associated with the two families,
the white rose of York
and the red rose of Lancaster.
The Lancasters first gained the throne
when Richard II was deposed 
by his cousin Henry IV in 1399.
Despite sporadic unrest,
their reign remained secure until 1422,
when Henry V's death 
in a military campaign
left an infant Henry VI as king.
Weak-willed and dominated by advisors,
Henry was eventually convinced to marry
Margaret of Anjou to gain French support.
Margaret was beautiful, ambitious,
and ruthless in persecuting 
any threat to her power,
and she distrusted 
Richard of York, most of all.
York had been the King's close advisor
and loyal General,
but was increasingly 
sidelined by the Queen,
who promoted her favorite supporters,
like the Earls of Suffolk and Somerset.
York's criticism of their inept handling
of the war against France
led to his exclusion from court
and transfer to Ireland.
Meanwhile, mounting military failures,
and corrupt rule by Margaret 
and her allies
caused widespread discontent,
and in the midst of this chaos,
Richard of York returned with an army
to arrest Somerset and reform the court.
Initially unsuccessful, 
he soon got his chance
when he was appointed 
Protector of the Realm
after Henry suffered a mental breakdown.
However, less than a year later,
Henry suddendly recovered
and the Queen convinced him 
to reverse York's reforms.
York fled and raised an army once more.
Though he was unable 
to directly seize the throne,
he managed to be reinstated as Protector
and have himself and his heirs designated
to succeed Henry.
But instead of a crown,
York's head acquired a pike
after he was killed in battle
with the Queen's loyalists.
His young son took up the claim
and was crowned Edward IV.
Edward enjoyed great military success
against the Lancasters.
Henry was captured,
while Margaret fled into exile
with their reportedly cruel son, 
Edward of Westminster.
But the newly crowned King
made a tragic political mistake
by backing out of his arranged marriage
with a French Princess
to secretly marry the widow
of a minor Noble.
This alienated his most powerful ally,
the Earl of Warwick.
Warwick allied with the Lancasters,
turned Edward's jealous 
younger brother, George, against him,
and even briefly managed 
to restore Henry as King,
but it didn't last.
Edward recaptured the throne,
the Lancaster Prince was killed in battle,
and Henry himself died 
in captivity not long after.
The rest of Edward IV's reign 
was peaceful,
but upon his death in 1483, 
the bloodshed resumed.
Though his twelve-year-old son
was due to succeed him,
Edward's younger brother Richard III
declared his nephews illegitimate
due to their father's secret marriage.
He assumed the regency himself
and threw the boys in prison.
Though no one knows what ultimately
became of them,
after a while, the Princes disappeared
and Richard's power seemed secure.
But his downfall would come
only two years later
from across the narrow sea
of the English Channel.
Henry Tudor was a direct descendant
of the first Duke of Lancaster,
raised in exile after his father's 
death in a previous rebellion.
With Richard III's power grab
causing a split in the York faction,
Henry won support for his royal claim.
Raising an army in France,
he crossed the Channel in 1485
and quickly defeated Richard's forces.
And by marrying Elizabeth of York,
elder sister of the disappeared Princes,
the newly crowned Henry VII
joined the two roses,
finally ending nearly a century of war.
We often think of historical wars
as decisive conflicts
with clearly defined winners and losers.
But the Wars of the Roses,
like the fiction they inspired,
show us that victories
can be uncertain,
alliances unstable,
and even the power of Kings
as fleeting as the seasons.",TED-Ed,Social Studies,The wars that inspired Game of Thrones - Alex Gendler - 06:01,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjO55pKuBo4,data/teded/crawled_data/videos/The wars that inspired Game of Thrones - Alex Gendler - 06:01,,

- Let's delve into the world of mitochondria
0:03
which are probably my favorite organelle.
0:07
So let's just have a little review of what mitochondria are
0:10
and then we can delve a little bit deeper
0:11
into their structure.
0:13
So let's just think about a cell
0:15
and not just any cell, but a eukaryotic cell.
0:18
So that's the cellular membrane
0:20
and when people say a eukaryote or a eukaryotic cell
0:23
they most typically say, ""Oh! That must have its nuclear DNA
0:27
""in a membrane-bound nucleus."" and that would be true,
0:31
so let's draw our membrane-bound nucleus.
0:33
That's our nuclear membrane.
0:35
You have your DNA in here,
0:38
so let's draw some DNA.
0:39
But when we talk about eukaryotic cells,
0:42
we're not just talking about a membrane-bound nucleus,
0:44
we're also talking about other membrane-bound organelles
0:47
and in a close second place for a membrane-bound structure
0:51
that is very important to the cell
0:52
would be the mitochondria.
0:55
So let's draw some mitochondria right over here.
0:58
So I'll talk a little bit more about
1:00
what these little squiggly lines that I'm drawing
1:02
inside of the mitochondria are
1:04
and this is actually a little bit more
1:05
of a textbook visualization, as we'll learn
1:06
in a few minutes or seconds that we now have more
1:09
sophisticated visualizations of what's actually going on
1:12
inside of a mitochondria, but we haven't actually
1:13
answered all of our questions,
1:15
but you might have already learned that,
1:17
so let me make it clear, these are mitochondria.
1:20
That's the plural.
1:21
If we're just talking about one of them,
1:22
we're talking about a mitochondrion.
1:24
That's the singular of mitochondria.
1:26
But you might have already learned,
1:27
some time in your past or in another Khan Academy video,
1:31
that these are viewed as the ATP factories for cells.
1:35
So let me right it this way.
1:38
So ATP factories.
1:40
A-T-P factories and if you watched the videos on ATP
1:45
or cellular respiration or other videos,
1:48
I'd repeatedly talk about how ATP is really the currency
1:51
for energy in the cell that when it's in its ATP form
1:55
you have adenosine triphosphate.
1:57
If you pop one of the phosphate groups off,
2:00
you pop one of the P's off, it release energy
2:02
and that's what your body uses to do all sort of things
2:05
from movement to thinking to all sorts of things
2:08
that actually go on in your bodies,
2:10
so you can imagine mitochondria are really important
2:12
for energy, for when the cell has to do things.
2:16
And that's why you'll find more mitochondria
2:18
in things like muscle cells, things that have to use
2:21
a lot of energy.
2:22
Now before I get into the structure of mitochondria,
2:25
I wanna talk a little bit about its fascinating past
2:28
because we think of cells as the most basic unit of life
2:31
and that is true, that comes straight out of cell theory,
2:33
but it turns out the most prevalent theory
2:36
of how mitochondria got into our cells
2:39
is that at one time the predecessors,
2:43
the ancestors to our mitochondria,
2:45
were free, independent organisms, microorganisms.
2:49
So they're descendent from bacterial-like microorganisms
2:54
that might have been living on their own
2:57
and they were maybe really good at processing energy
2:59
or maybe they were even good at other things,
3:01
but at some point in the evolutionary past,
3:04
they got ingested by what the ancestors of our cells
3:08
and instead of just being engulfed and being torn to shreds
3:10
and kind of being digested and eaten,
3:12
it was like, ""Hey, wait, if these things stick around,
3:15
""those cells are more likely to survive
3:17
""because they're able to help process glucose
3:19
""or help generate more energy out of things.""
3:24
And so the cells that were able to kind of live
3:27
in symbiosis have them kind of give a place
3:30
for the mitochondria to live or the pre-mitochondria,
3:33
the ancestor mitochondria, those survived
3:35
and then through kind of the processes of natural selection,
3:38
this is what we now associate,
3:41
we now associate eukaryotic cells
3:43
as having mitochondria,
3:44
so I find this whole idea of one organism being inside
3:47
of another organism in symbiosis even at the cellular level,
3:52
that's kind of mind-boggling, but anyway,
3:55
I'll stop talking about that and now let's just talk
3:57
about the present, let's talk about
3:59
what the actual structure of mitochondria are.
4:03
And I'll first draw kind of a simplified drawing
4:06
of a mitochondion and I'll draw a cross section.
4:10
So, I'm gonna draw a cross section.
4:13
So if we were to kind of cut it in half.
4:15
So what I've drawn right over here
4:16
this would be its outer membrane.
4:18
This is the outer membrane right over here
4:24
and we label that.
4:25
Outer membrane.
4:28
And all of these membranes that I'm gonna draw,
4:30
they're all going to be phospholipid bilayers.
4:34
So if I were to zoom in right over here,
4:38
so let me, if I were to zoom in,
4:41
we would see a bilayer of phospholipids.
4:44
So you have your
4:47
hydrophilic heads facing outwards,
4:50
hydrophilic heads facing outwards
4:53
and your hydrophobic tails facing inwards.
4:57
So.
5:00
You see something just like that,
5:02
so they're all phospholipid bilayers.
5:05
But they aren't just phospholipids.
5:07
All of these membranes have all sorts of proteins imbedded,
5:10
I mean cells are incredibly complex structures,
5:13
but even organelles like mitochondria have a fascinating,
5:16
I guess you would say sub-structure to them.
5:18
They themselves have all sorts of interesting proteins,
5:21
enzymes imbedded in their membranes
5:23
and are able to help regulate what's going on
5:25
inside and outside of these organelles.
5:28
And one of the proteins that you have in the outer membrane
5:34
of mitochondria, they're called porins
5:38
and porins aren't found only in mitochondria,
5:40
but they're kind of tunnel proteins,
5:41
they're structured so they kind of form a hole
5:44
in the outer membrane.
5:46
So I'm drawing them the best that I can.
5:49
These are porins
5:51
and what's interesting about porins is they don't allow
5:54
large molecules to pass through passively,
5:57
but small molecules like sugars or ions can pass passively
6:02
through the porins.
6:04
And so, because of that, your ion concentration
6:06
and well, I should actually say,
6:07
your small molecule concentrations tend
6:09
to be similar on either side of this membrane,
6:12
on either side of this outer membrane.
6:15
But that's not the only membrane involved
6:17
in a mitochondrion.
6:18
We also have a inner membrane.
6:20
I'll do that in yellow.
6:22
We also have a inner membrane
6:24
and I'm gonna draw it with a textbook model first
6:27
and then we'll talk a little bit about,
6:28
since we think this model is not quite right,
6:32
but in this, so we have this inner membrane,
6:36
inner membrane,
6:41
and this inner membrane has these folds in it
6:45
to increase their surface area
6:46
and the surface area is really important
6:48
for the inner membrane because that's
6:50
where the processes of the electron transport chain
6:53
occur across, essentially, these membranes.
6:55
So you want this extra surface area
6:57
so you can essentially have more of that going on.
7:00
And these folds have a name.
7:02
So if you're talking about one of them,
7:04
if you're talking about one of these folds,
7:05
you're talking about a crista,
7:10
but if you're talking about more than one of them,
7:14
you would call that a cristae, cristae.
7:18
Sometimes I've seen the pronunciation of this
7:20
as cristae, cristae or cristae, that's plural for crista.
7:24
These are just folds in the inner membrane
7:27
and once again the inner membrane is also
7:30
a phospholipid bilayer.
7:33
Now inside of the inner membranes,
7:36
so between the outer membrane and the inner membrane
7:40
you could imagine what this is gonna be called.
7:42
That space is called the intermembrane space,
7:46
not too creative of a name, intermembrane space
7:51
and because of the porins,
7:53
the small molecule concentration
7:56
of the intermembrane space and then outside
7:58
of the mitochondria,
8:02
out in the cytosol,
8:03
those concentrations are gonna be similar,
8:05
but then the inner membrane does not have the porins
8:08
in it and so you can actually have a different concentration
8:11
on either side and that is essential
8:12
for the electron transport chain.
8:14
The electron transport chain really culminates
8:16
with hydrogen, a hydrogen ion gradient
8:19
being built between the two sides
8:20
and then they flow down that gradient through a protein
8:24
called ATP synthase which helps us synthesize ATP,
8:28
but we'll talk more about that maybe in this video
8:29
or in a future video,
8:31
but let's finish talking about the different parts
8:33
of a mitochondrion.
8:36
So inside the inner membrane you have
8:40
this area right over here is called the matrix.
8:42
It's called, let me use this in a different color,
8:45
this is
8:48
the matrix
8:49
and it's called the matrix 'cause it actually has
8:50
a much higher protein concentration,
8:53
it's actually more viscous than the cytosol
8:58
that would be outside of the
9:03
mitochondria.
9:05
So this right over here is the matrix.
9:07
When we we talk about cellular respiration,
9:09
cellular respiration has many phases in it.
9:11
We talk about glycolysis.
9:13
Glycolysis is actually occurring in the cytosol.
9:15
So glycolysis can occur in the cytosol.
9:20
Glycolysis.
9:22
But the other major phases of cellular respiration.
9:26
Remember we talk about the citric acid cycle
9:28
also known as the Krebs cycle,
9:29
that is occuring in the matrix.
9:32
So Krebs cycle
9:35
is occuring in the matrix
9:37
and then I said the electron transport chain
9:40
which is really what's responsible for producing
9:42
the bulk of the ATP, that is happening through proteins
9:46
that are straddling the inner membrane
9:49
or straddling the cristae right over here.
9:55
Now we're just done.
9:56
Probably one of the most fascinating parts of mitochondria,
9:59
we said that we think that they are descendent
10:01
from these ancient independent lifeforms
10:04
and in order to be an ancient independent life form,
10:06
they'd would have to have some information,
10:09
some way to actually transmit their genetic information
10:13
and, it turns out, mitochondria actually have
10:16
their own genetic information.
10:18
They have mitochondrial DNA
10:19
and they often don't just even have one copy of it,
10:21
they have multiple copies of it
10:23
and they're in loops very similar to bacterial DNA.
10:28
In fact, they have a lot in common
10:29
with bacterial DNA and that's why we think
10:30
that the ancestor to mitochondria that live independently
10:34
was probably a form of bacteria or related to bacteria
10:38
in some way.
10:39
So this is, this right over there,
10:41
that is the loop of mitochondrial DNA.
10:43
So all the DNA that's inside of you, the bulk of it,
10:46
yes, it is in your nuclear DNA, but you still have
10:50
a little bit of DNA in your mitochondria
10:52
and what's interesting is your mitochondrial DNA,
10:55
your mitochondria, are inherited, essentially,
10:59
from your mother's side, because when a egg is fertilized,
11:05
a human egg has tons of mitochondria in it
11:09
and I'm obviously not drawing all of the things
11:11
in the human egg.
11:12
It obviously has a nucleus and all of that.
11:14
The sperm has some mitochondria in it,
11:17
you could imagine it needs to be able
11:20
to win that very competitive fight
11:22
to get to fertilize the egg,
11:24
but the current theory is all or most of that
11:26
gets digested or dissolved once it actually gets
11:30
into the egg.
11:31
And anyway, the egg itself has way more mitochondria,
11:34
so the DNA in your mitochondria is
11:38
from your mother or is essentially from your mother's side
11:42
and that's actually used, mitochondrial DNA,
11:43
when people talk about kind of an ancient Eve
11:45
or tracing back to having kind
11:47
of one common mother,
11:48
people are looking at the mitochondrial DNA,
11:52
so it is actually quite, quite fascinating.
11:56
Now I said a little bit earlier,
11:58
and you know, obviously, it has its own DNA
12:00
and then because it has its own DNA
12:02
it's able to synthesize some of its own RNA,
12:04
its own ribosomes, so it also has ribosomes here.
12:07
But it doesn't synthesize all of the proteins
12:10
that are sitting in mitochondria.
12:11
A lot of those are still synthesized by
12:14
or encoded for by your nuclear DNA
12:17
and are actually synthesized outside of the mitochondria
12:19
and then make their way into the mitochondria,
12:22
but mitochondria are these fascinating, fascinating things.
12:25
They're these little creatures living in symbiosis
12:29
in our cells and they're able to replicate themselves
12:32
and I don't know, I find all of this mind boggling.
12:34
But anyway.
12:35
I said that this was the textbook model
12:37
because it turns out, when you look
12:39
at a micrograph, a picture of mitochondria,
12:43
it seems to back up this textbook model
12:45
of these folds, these cristae just kind of folding in,
12:49
but when we've been able to have more sophisticated
12:51
visualizations it actually turns out
12:53
that it's not just these simple folds
12:55
that the inner membrane essentially hooks
12:59
into the matrix and it turns out it has
13:02
these little tunnels that connect the space
13:05
inside of the cristae to the intermembrane space.
13:10
So I like to think about this because it makes you realize,
13:12
you know, we look in textbooks and we take these things
13:14
like mitochondria for granted, like, ""Oh yeah, of course.
13:17
""That's where ATP factories are,""
13:18
but it's still an area for visualization research
13:21
to fully understand exactly how they work
13:24
and even how they are structured
13:25
that this Baffle Model where you see these cristae
13:28
kind of just coming in and out of the different sides.
13:31
This is actually no longer the accepted model
13:33
for the actual visualization, the structure of mitochondria.
13:36
Something more like this, something more where
13:39
you have this cristae junction model
13:42
where you have, if I were to draw a cross section
13:46
where this is the,
13:50
I drew the outer membrane and the inner membrane,
13:52
I'll just draw has these little tunnels
13:54
to the actual space inside of the cristae.
13:59
This is actually now the more accepted visualization,
14:03
so I want you to appreciate
14:04
that when in Biology, you read something in a textbook
14:06
you kind of say, ""Oh, people have figured all
14:08
""of this stuff out,"" but people are still think about,
14:10
""Well, how does this structure work?
14:11
""What is the actual structure?"" and then,
14:12
""How does it actually let this organelle,
14:14

0:00
- [Instructor] Let's try a hard one.
0:01
This one's a classic.
0:02
Let's say you have two charges,
0:03
positive eight nanoCoulombs and negative eight nanoCoulombs,
0:06
and instead of asking what's the electric field
0:08
somewhere in between, which is essentially
0:10
a one-dimensional problem, we're gonna ask,
0:12
what's the electric field up here, at this point, P?
0:15
Now, this is a two-dimensional problem
0:17
because if we wanna find the net electric field
0:19
up here, the magnitude n direction
0:22
of the net electric field at this point,
0:24
we approach it the same way initially.
0:26
We say alright, each charge is gonna create a field
0:29
up here that goes in a certain direction.
0:30
This positive charge creates a field
0:32
up here that goes radially away from it,
0:34
and radially away from this positive
0:36
at point P is something like this.
0:39
I'll call this electric field blue E
0:41
because it's created by this blue positive charge,
0:43
and this negative charge creates its own electric field
0:46
at that point that goes radially into the negative,
0:49
and radially into the negative
0:50
is gonna look something like this.
0:52
I'll call this electric field yellow E
0:55
because it's created by the yellow electric field.
0:57
So far so good.
0:58
Same approach, but now things get a little weird.
1:00
Look, these fields aren't even pointing
1:02
in the same direction.
1:03
They're lying in this two-dimensional plane,
1:06
and we wanna find the net electric field.
1:08
So what we have to do in these 2D electric field problems
1:10
is break up the electric fields into their components.
1:13
In other words, the field created by this positive charge
1:16
is gonna have a horizontal component,
1:17
and that's gonna point to the right.
1:19
And I'll call that blue E x because it was the horizontal
1:22
component created by the blue, positive charge.
1:25
And this electric field is gonna have a vertical
1:27
component, that's gonna point upward.
1:28
I'll call that blue E y.
1:30
And similarly, for the electric field this negative charge
1:32
creates, it has a horizontal component
1:35
that points to the right.
1:36
We'll call that yellow E x, and a vertical component,
1:39
but this vertical component points downward.
1:41
I'll call that yellow E y.
1:43
What do we do with all these components
1:45
to find the net electric field?
1:47
Typically what you do in these 2D electric problems
1:50
is focus on finding the components
1:52
of the net electric field in each direction separately.
1:55
We divide and conquer.
1:56
We're gonna ask, what's the horizontal component
1:59
of the net electric field, and what's
2:00
the vertical component of the net electric field?
2:03
And then once we know these, we can combine them
2:04
using the Pythagorean theorem if we want to,
2:07
to get the magnitude of that net electric field.
2:09
But we're kind of in luck in this problem.
2:11
There's a certain amount of symmetry
2:13
in this problem, and when there's a certain amount
2:15
of symmetry, you can save a lot of time.
2:17
What I mean by that is that both
2:18
of these charges have the same magnitude of charge.
2:21
And because this point, P, lies directly
2:22
in the middle of them, the distance
2:24
from the charge to point P is gonna be the same
2:27
as the distance from the negative charge to point P,
2:29
so both of these charges create an electric field
2:31
at this point of equal magnitude.
2:33
The fields just point in different directions,
2:36
and what that means is that this positive charge
2:38
will create an electric field that has
2:39
some vertical component upward of some positive amount.
2:43
We don't know exactly how much that is,
2:44
but it'll be a positive number because it points up,
2:46
and this negative charge is gonna create
2:48
an electric field that has a vertical component downward,
2:51
which is gonna be negative, but it's gonna have
2:52
the same magnitude as the vertical component
2:54
of the blue electric field.
2:56
In other words, the field created by the positive charge
2:59
is just as upward as the field created
3:01
by the negative charge is downward.
3:04
So when you add those up, when you add
3:05
up these two vertical components to find the vertical
3:08
component of the net electric field,
3:10
you're just gonna get zero.
3:12
They're gonna cancel completely,
3:14
which is nice because that means we only have
3:15
to worry about the horizontal components.
3:18
These will not cancel.
3:19
How come these don't cancel?
3:20
Because they're both pointing to the right.
3:22
If one was pointing right and the other was left,
3:25
then the horizontal components would cancel,
3:26
but that's not what happens here.
3:28
These components combine to form a total component
3:30
in the x direction that's larger than either one of them.
3:34
In fact, it's gonna be twice as big
3:35
because each charge creates the same amount
3:38
of electric field in this x direction
3:40
because of the symmetry of this problem.
3:42
So we've reduced this problem to just finding
3:44
the horizontal component of the net electric field.
3:47
To do that, we need the horizontal components
3:48
of each of these individual electric fields.
3:51
If I can find the horizontal component
3:53
of the field created by the positive charge,
3:55
that's gonna be a positive contribution
3:57
to the total electric field, since this points
3:59
to the right, and I'd add that
4:01
to the horizontal component of the yellow electric field
4:04
because it also points to the right,
4:06
even though the charge creating that field is negative,
4:08
the horizontal component of that field is positive
4:11
because it points to the right.
4:13
So if I can get both of these,
4:14
I will just add these up, and I'd get my total
4:16
electric field in the x direction.
4:18
How do I get these?
4:19
How do I determine these horizontal components?
4:21
Well, to get the horizontal component
4:22
of this blue electric field, I first need
4:24
to find what's the magnitude of this blue electric field.
4:28
We know the formula for that.
4:29
I'll write it over here.
4:30
The magnitude of the electric field
4:31
is always k Q over r squared.
4:34
So for this blue field, we'll say that E
4:36
is equal to nine times 10 to the ninth,
4:39
and the charge is eight nanoCoulombs.
4:42
Nano means 10 to the negative ninth.
4:44
And then we divide by the r, but what's the r in this case?
4:47
It's not four or three.
4:49
Remember, the r in that electric field formula
4:51
is always from the charge to the point you're trying
4:54
to determine the electric field at.
4:55
So r is this.
4:57
This distance is r.
4:58
How do we figure out what this is?
5:00
Well, we're kind of in luck.
5:01
If you know about three, four, five triangles,
5:03
look at, this forms a three, this side is three,
5:06
meters, and this side is four meters.
5:08
That means that this side automatically
5:09
we know is five meters.
5:11
If you're not comfortable with that,
5:12
you can always do the Pythagorean theorem.
5:14
Pythagorean theorem says that a squared
5:17
plus b squared equals c squared for a right triangle,
5:19
which is what we have here.
5:21
A is this side, three.
5:22
B is the four meter side.
5:24
And then c would be r, I'll call that r squared.
5:28
And if you solve this for r, nine plus 16,
5:30
square root gives you r is five meters, just like we said.
5:34
But if you know three, four, five triangles,
5:35
it's kinda nice because you could just quote that.
5:37
And that's the r we're gonna use up here.
5:39
We'll use five meters squared,
5:41
which, if you calculate, you get
5:42
that the electric field is 2.88 Newtons per Coulomb.
5:47
This is the magnitude of the electric field
5:49
created at this point, P, by the positive charge.
5:52
How do we get the horizontal component of that field?
5:54
There's a few ways to do it.
5:56
One way to do it is first just find this angle here.
5:59
If we could find what that angle is,
6:01
we can do trigonometry to get this horizontal component.
6:04
How do I find this angle?
6:05
Well, you note that that angle's gonna be
6:07
the same as this angle down here.
6:09
These are gonna be similar angles
6:11
because I've got horizontal lines
6:13
and then this diagonal line just continues right through.
6:15
So this angle is the same as this angle,
6:17
so if I could find this angle here,
6:19
I've found that angle up top.
6:20
How do I get this angle?
6:22
I know each side of this triangle,
6:23
so I can use either sine, cosine, or tangent.
6:26
I'm just gonna use tangent.
6:28
We'll say that tangent of that angle
6:30
is defined always to be the opposite over adjacent.
6:33
We know the opposite side to this angle
6:36
is four meters, and the adjacent side was three meters,
6:39
so tangent theta's gonna equal 4/3.
6:42
How do we get theta?
6:43
We say that theta's going to equal
6:45
the inverse tangent of 4/3.
6:48
We basically take inverse tangent of both sides.
6:51
We get theta on the left, and if you plug this
6:53
into your calculator, you get 53.1 degrees.
6:57
So that's what this angle is right here.
6:58
This is 53.1 degrees, but that means this angle up here
7:02
is also 53.1 degrees because these are the same angle.
7:06
This horizontal component is not the same
7:08
as this three meters?
7:09
And this diagonal electric field is not the same
7:12
as five meters, but the angle between those components
7:15
are the same as the angle between these length components.
7:18
So what do I do to get this horizontal component?
7:20
This is the adjacent side to this angle,
7:22
so this E x is adjacent to that angle.
7:25
We're gonna use cosine.
7:26
We're gonna say that cosine of 53.1 degrees
7:30
is gonna be equal to the adjacent side, which is E x.
7:33
We'll write this as E x divided
7:35
by the hypotenuse, and we found the hypotenuse.
7:38
This is the magnitude of the total
7:40
electric field right here, which is the hypotenuse
7:42
of this triangle, so that's 2.88.
7:45
And we get that E x is going to be 2.88 Newtons
7:49
per Coulomb times cosine of 53.1,
7:52
which, if you plug that into the calculator
7:54
is gonna give you 1.73 Newtons per Coulomb.
7:59
This is how much electric field
8:00
the positive charge creates in the x direction.
8:03
That's what this component up here is.
8:05
This is 1.73 Newtons per Coulomb.
8:08
So that's what this is.
8:09
That's what I'm gonna plug in here.
8:10
To get this horizontal component
8:11
of the yellow field created by the negative charge,
8:14
you could go through the whole thing again
8:16
or you could notice that because
8:18
of symmetry, this horizontal component
8:20
has to be the exact same as the horizontal component
8:23
created by the positive charge.
8:24
They're both 1.73, and they're both positive
8:27
because both of these components point to the right.
8:30
So to get the total electric field
8:32
in the x direction, we'll take 1.73
8:35
from the positive charge and we'll add that
8:37
to the horizontal component from the negative charge,
8:39
which is also positive 1.73, to get
8:42
a horizontal component in the x direction
8:44
of the net electric field equal to
8:47
3.46 Newtons per Coulomb.
8:51
This is the horizontal component
8:53
of the net electric field at that point.
8:56
We basically took both of these values and added them up,
8:59
which, essentially is just one of them times two.
9:01
And now you might be worried though, this is just
9:03
the horizontal component of the net electric field.
9:05
How do we get the magnitude of the total net electric field?
9:09
Well, this is gonna be the same value
9:10
because since there was no vertical component
9:13
of the electric field, the horizontal component
9:15
is gonna be equal to the magnitude
9:17
of the total electric field at that point.
9:20
If there was a vertical component
9:21
of the electric field, we'd have
9:22
to do the Pythagorean theorem to get the total magnitude
9:25
of the net electric field, but since there was only
9:27
a horizontal component, and these
9:29
vertical components canceled, the total electric field's
9:32
just gonna point to the right, and it will be equal
9:35
to two times one of these horizontal components,
9:38
which, when you add them up,
9:39
gives you 3.46 Newtons per Coulomb.
9:43
That's the magnitude of the net electric field,
9:45
and the direction would be straight to the right.
9:47
So recapping, when you have a 2D electric field problem,
9:50
draw the field created by each charge,
9:52
break those fields up into their individual components.
9:56
If there's any symmetry involved,
9:57
figure out which component cancels,
9:59
and then to find the net electric field,
10:01
use the component that doesn't cancel,
10:03
and determine the contribution
10:05
from each charge in that direction.
10:07
Add or subtract them accordingly,
10:09
based on whether those components point
10:10
to the right or to the left, and that will give you
10:13
your net electric field at that point,

khan_video_69V-60sga3M_27,"4:09, why is ideal gas law in kelvin?",MCQ,"•
0:00
Let's do a few more examples with the ideal gas equation.
0:04
So we have pressure times volume is equal to the number
0:08
of molecules we have in moles times the ideal gas constant
0:13
times temperature in Kelvin.
0:15
And I just got a comment on one of the videos saying
0:17
it made sense except for the fact that
0:20
R seems kind of like this mysterious thing in here.
0:24
And the way you think about R
0:25
-- let me rearrange this a little bit.
0:27
Let me write it as pressure times volume
0:28
is equal to R times nT.
0:33
So we've established, or hopefully we've established,
0:35
the intuition that the pressure times the volume
0:37
should be proportional to essentially
0:40
the total energy we have in the system.
0:42
Temperature is average energy, or energy per molecule,
0:47
and this is the total number molecules we had.
0:49
What R is, the ideal gas constant is,
0:52
when you multiply moles times Kelvin, you get mole Kelvin.
0:58
And with pressure times volume,
1:00
it's force per area times the volume.
1:03
You get force times distance,
1:04
or force times one dimension of distance,
1:07
which is joules, so this is in joules.
1:11
So what the ideal gas constant essentially does is it converts
1:14
-- we know that this is proportional to this,
1:17
but it sets the exact constant of proportionality
1:21
and it also makes sure we get the units right,
1:23
so that's all it is.
1:24
It just helps us translate from a world dealing
1:27
with moles and Kelvins to a world of dealing with,
1:30
well, in this case, atmospheres and liters,
1:33
or bars and meters cubed,
1:37
or kilopascals and meters cubed.
1:39
But no matter what the units
1:40
of the pressure and the volume are,
1:41
the whole unit of pressure
1:43
times volume is going to be joules.
1:44
So it's just a translation between the two
1:46
and we know that they're proportional.
1:48
Now, with that said, let's do some more problems.
1:50
So let's say we want to know how many grams of oxygen.
1:56
So we want to know grams of O2. O2 in grams.
2:02
So how many grams of O2 are in a 300-milliliter container
2:09
that has a pressure of 12 atmospheres
2:14
and the temperature is 10 degrees Celsius.
2:20
Well, we've already broken out our ideal gas equation.
2:25
Let's see, pressure is 12 atmospheres.
2:28
So we can say 12.
2:30
I'll keep the units there.
2:32
12 atmospheres times the volume.
2:35
The volume should be in liters, so this is 300 milliliters,
2:39
or 300 thousandths or 3 tenths.
2:43
So that's 0.3 liters.
2:48
300 one thousandths of a liter is 0.3 liters.
2:52
And that is equal to the number of moles we have of this,
2:57
and that's what we need to figure out.
2:58
If we know the number of moles, we know the number of grams.
3:00
So this is equal to n times R.
3:04
Now which R should we use?
3:06
We're dealing with liters and atmospheres.
3:08
We'll deal with this one.
3:13
Times 0.082.
3:16
And what's our temperature?
3:17
It's 10 degrees Celsius.
3:19
We always have to do everything in Kelvin.
3:20
So it's 283 degrees Kelvin.
3:25
So all we have to solve for is n.
3:28
We just have to divide both sides
3:29
of this equation by this right here,
3:31
and so we have n is equal to 12 atmospheres
3:37
-- I'm just swapping the sides
3:38
-- times 0.3 liters divided by 0.082 times 283 degrees.
3:47
Our answer will be in moles.
3:50
And if you want to verify that,
3:52
you can plug in all the units
3:54
and use units for the ideal gas constant.
3:57
The number of moles we're dealing with,
4:01
so it's 12 times 0.3 divided by 0.082 divided by 283
4:11
is equal to 0.155 moles. It's equal to 0.155 moles.
4:22
Now how many grams are in one mole of an oxygen molecule?
4:31
So one mole of O2, well, we know oxygen's atomic mass.
4:39
It's 16.
4:40
One molecule of oxygen, of gaseous oxygen,
4:44
has two atoms in it, so it has an atomic mass of 32.
4:51
So it's molar mass, it's mass per mole,
4:56
is going to be 32 grams.
4:58
Now we don't have one mole.
4:59
We have 0.155 moles.
5:02
So to figure out how many grams we have,
5:04
we multiply 32 grams per mole times 0.155 moles,
5:21
and we'll get our answer.
5:23
So let's do that.
5:24
So we have 32 times 0.155 is equal to 4.96 grams,
5:35
or roughly 5 grams.
5:37
So we have approximately 5 grams of molecular oxygen.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,69V-60sga3M,

0:00
Let's say I'm over here.
0:01
I'm going to do two scenarios.
0:03
So I'm an observer over here.
0:04
This is me.
0:06
And then maybe even better, I should just draw my eyeball
0:10
because we're going to be observing light.
0:12
So I'm just going to draw my eyeball.
0:15
So this is me in the first scenario or this
0:18
is one of my eyeballs.
0:20
And then this is one of my eyeballs
0:21
in the second scenario.
0:24
Now in the first scenario-- so let me draw it--
0:26
so in both scenarios, we're going to have an object.
0:28
We're going to have some type of source of light.
0:31
But in the first scenario, relative to me,
0:35
the source of light will not be moving.
0:37
While in the second scenario, the source
0:38
of light-- just for the sake of discussion, just for fun--
0:43
will be moving at half the speed of light.
0:45
Unimaginably fast speed, but let's just assuming that it is.
0:49
So it's moving at-- it has a velocity of 1/2
0:52
the speed of light, 1/2 light speed away from me
1:02
who is the observer.
1:05
Now let's just imagine what would happen.
1:07
They're both emitting light.
1:08
So and they're both going to start
1:09
emitting light at the exact same time.
1:12
And when they start emitting light,
1:14
they're both at the exact same distance from my eye.
1:18
The only difference is is that this
1:19
is stationary, relative to me, while this is moving away
1:23
from me at half the speed of light.
1:26
So let's say that after some period of time,
1:29
that the light wave from this source reaches my eye.
1:35
And then it looks something like this.
1:36
I'll try my best to draw it.
1:40
So let's say I have-- I want to draw a couple of wavelengths
1:42
here.
1:43
So let's say that's half a wavelength.
1:45
That's a full wavelength.
1:47
That's another half, a full wavelength, another half,
1:51
full wavelength, and then a half, and then
1:53
a full wavelength.
1:54
So let me see if I can draw that.
1:55
So it would look like full wavelength,
2:00
full wavelength, full wave length.
2:04
This is not easy to do.
2:05
And then you got another full wavelength.
2:07
So it would look something like that, the actual waveform.
2:11
And so the front of the wave form is just getting to my eye.
2:16
And then as the wave forms keep going past my eye,
2:20
my eye will perceive some type of a wave length or frequency
2:23
and perceive it to be some type of color,
2:25
assuming that we're in the visible part
2:27
of the electromagnetic spectrum.
2:28
Now let's think about what's going
2:30
to happen with this source.
2:31
So the first thing is is that the front of the wave form
2:34
is going to reach me at the exact same time.
2:36
One of those neat and amazing things about light travelling
2:41
in general, or especially in a vacuum,
2:43
it doesn't matter that this is moving away from me at half
2:47
the speed of light.
2:48
The light will still move towards me
2:50
at the speed of light.
2:52
It's absolute.
2:53
It doesn't matter if this is going away at 0.9
2:55
the speed of light.
2:56
The light will still travel to me at the speed of light.
3:00
And it's very unintuitive.
3:01
Because in our everyday sense, if I'm moving away from you
3:05
at half the speed of a bullet and I shoot a bullet,
3:07
the bullet will only move towards you
3:09
at-- it'll kind of-- that half of its velocity
3:12
will be subtracted.
3:13
And it'll only move towards me at half of its normal velocity,
3:17
relative to whether it was stationary,
3:18
but not the case with the light.
3:20
So with that out of the way, let's think
3:22
about what the wave form would look like.
3:24
So by the time the light reached here,
3:27
we need to think of-- let me actually redraw this over here.
3:29
Let me redraw this eyeball right over here.
3:37
So this is me again.
3:38
So by the time the light reaches my eye-- so they both started
3:42
emitting the light at the exact same time--
3:44
this guy has traveled half this distance.
3:47
If it took light a certain amount of time to get this far,
3:52
this guy will get half as far in that same amount of time.
3:54
So by the time the light reaches my eye,
3:57
this guy will have traveled about half that distance.
4:00
So he would have traveled about that far.
4:03
They started emitting the light at the same time.
4:06
So that very first photon, if you view light as a particle,
4:10
will reach my eye at the very same time
4:13
as the very first photon from this guy.
4:16
So the wave form is going to essentially be stretched.
4:19
So instead of having-- so we're still
4:22
going to have one, two, three, four full wavelengths,
4:28
but they'll now be stretched.
4:29
Let me see if I can draw four full wavelengths.
4:31
So let me cut this in half over here.
4:34
And let me cut each of those in half.
4:37
So each of these are going to be a full wavelength.
4:40
And then they're going to have a half wavelength in between.
4:47
And so the wave form is going to look like this.
4:52
Let me try my best to draw it.
4:55
This is the hardest part, drawing the stretched out wave
4:58
form.
5:00
And there you go.
5:01
It's going to look like this.
5:02
And so when it gets to my eye, my eye
5:04
is going to perceive it as having a longer wavelength,
5:07
even though from the perspective of each
5:09
of these objects, if you're traveling with each of them,
5:12
the frequency and the wavelength of the light emitted
5:15
is the same.
5:16
The only difference is this guy's moving away from me--
5:18
or I'm moving away from it, depending
5:20
on how you want to view it-- while I am stationary,
5:23
while in this first case, the observer and the source
5:26
are both stationary.
5:27
Now, in this situation, what's my eye going to say?
5:29
Well, my eye will get each of these successive pulses,
5:33
or each of these successive wave trains.
5:35
And it's going to say, hey, there's a longer wavelength
5:37
here, a perceived longer wavelength--
5:46
let me write that-- perceived longer wavelength here,
5:51
and also, a perceived lower frequency.
6:00
So what would that do to the perception of the light?
6:03
Let's say that this is green light.
6:06
So if you are stationary with the observer,
6:08
it would be green light.
6:09
So let's look at the electromagnetic spectrum.
6:11
I got this off of Wikipedia.
6:13
So if I were stationary towards-- with the observer,
6:16
we'd be in the green light part of the spectrum,
6:20
so a 500 nanometer wavelength.
6:23
But if all of a sudden, because the object
6:26
is moving away from me at this huge velocity,
6:29
the perceived wavelength becomes wider.
6:32
So from my perception, it is going
6:34
to have a wider wavelength.
6:36
And you can see what's happening.
6:37
It will look redder.
6:39
It will move towards the red part of the spectrum.
6:42
And this phenomenon is called redshift.
6:53
And I've done a bunch of videos of the physics playlist
6:55
on the Doppler effect.
6:56
And over there, I talk about sound waves and the perceived
6:59
frequency of sound-- if something travels towards you
7:02
verses away from you-- as the exact same idea.
7:05
This is the Doppler effect applied to light.
7:07
And the reason why the Doppler effect
7:09
works for light traveling through space
7:12
and for sound traveling through air
7:15
is because the sound wave in air, regardless
7:17
of whether the source is moving away
7:19
or towards you, the sound wave is
7:21
going to move at the speed of sound in air
7:23
at a certain pressure and all of that.
7:25
And light is the same thing.
7:27
But in a vacuum, It will always, regardless of the source,
7:32
regardless of what the source is doing,
7:34
the actual light wave itself will always
7:36
travel at the same velocity.
7:39
The only difference is is that its perceived frequency
7:42
and wavelength will change.
7:43
And now the whole reason why I'm talking about this
7:45
is you can use this property of light,
7:49
that it gets redshift, to see whether things are traveling
7:52
away or towards you.
7:55
And people talk about redshift because, frankly, most things
7:57
are traveling away from us.
7:59
And that's one of the reasons why
8:00
we tend to believe in the Big Bang.
8:02
The opposite, if something is traveling towards me
8:05
at super high velocities, then we
8:07
would have something called-- you
8:09
don't hear the word-- it would be violetshift.
8:11
The frequency would increase.
8:15
So it would look bluer or more purple.
8:17
Now the other thing I want to highlight
8:19
is this redshift phenomenon, this idea,
8:21
it doesn't apply only to visible light.
8:24
So it could even apply the things that we can't even see.
8:27
So it would only-- it would become redder.
8:29
But it's not like you can even see.
8:31
It could even be applied to things
8:32
that are even more red than red.
8:34
So maybe it's a microwave that is being emitted.
8:37
But because the source is moving away from us so fast,
8:40
it could be perceived as an actual radio wave.
8:44
And actually, I should have talked about this in the video
8:46
on the microwave background radiation
8:49
is that we're perceiving it as microwaves.
8:52
But these sources were moving away from us.
8:55
They were being redshift.
8:57
So they were not actually emitting microwave radiation.
9:00
It's just what we observe-- and this is actually
9:03
what would be predicted based on the Big Bang-- is actually
9:07
microwave radiation.
9:08
So anyway, hopefully, that gives you
9:10
a sense of what redshift is.
9:11
And now we can use this tool to explain
9:16
why we think many, many things are moving away from us.
9:19
And now let me just actually make sure you get that idea.
9:22
If I have two objects, let's say that these are suns.
9:25
Let's say that these are both suns, or both galaxies,
9:29
either way.
9:30
And because of other properties--
9:32
and I won't talk about them right now--
9:33
we know that they are probably emitting
9:37
light of the same color.
9:39
They're probably emitting light of the same color
9:41
because we know other properties of that star or of that galaxy.
9:45
Now, if what we actually perceive
9:48
is that this one looks redder to us than this one,
9:51
then we know that it is traveling away from us.
9:55
And the redder it looks, the more its wavelength
9:57
is spread out relative to this other star, the faster we know
10:00
that this is moving away from us.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,mx2M_ZKXM_c,

- [Voiceover] We're now in 1944 and the things
0:04
are really starting to close in on the Axis powers now.
0:07
We can start in January.
0:09
You might remember, you've had the Siege of Leningrad
0:11
going on for several years now.
0:13
Incredibly bloody siege,
0:15
incredibly hard on the civilians of Leningrad.
0:17
But the Soviet army is finally able to end that,
0:20
and so you see from these troop movements on this map
0:23
starting in January of 1944 with the end of the siege,
0:27
they are able to really take the offensive
0:29
and start marching through the Baltics,
0:32
through the Baltic states.
0:33
At the same time, you have the Soviet armies marching
0:37
and they're able to force the Axis to surrender
0:42
in the Crimea.
0:44
You fast forward further into the year, further into 1944.
0:48
You might remember in 1943, the Allies were able
0:51
to land on Italy and force the surrender of Italy
0:56
to the Allied powers.
0:58
But that doesn't mean that Italy, as we know it today,
1:00
or even as we knew it then, was free of the German troops,
1:04
or from the Axis troops.
1:06
And so, the Allies were continuing to slog through,
1:09
slog through Italy, and in particular Rome.
1:13
Rome did not get liberated in 1943.
1:16
The Allies had to continue bombing Rome.
1:18
And it doesn't get liberated until June of 1944.
1:23
So Rome is liberated.
1:25
So liberated in the summer of 1944.
1:30
That happens June, 5th.
1:32
The next day, and this is probably one of the most
1:34
famous events in World War II,
1:36
especially from an American point of view,
1:38
something that's documented in many films,
1:40
is June, 6th, D-Day, 1944.
1:44
You have the invasion of Normandy,
1:45
the amphibious invasion of Normandy,
1:47
probably most famously depicted in the opening scenes
1:50
of Saving Private Ryan.
1:52
We have British, primarily British and American troops.
1:54
They are able to storm the beaches of Normandy successfully
1:57
which allows them to start making progress
2:01
in northern France towards Germany.
2:05
Now, also in the summer of 1944,
2:08
rockets start to get involved in a serious way
2:11
in World War II.
2:12
The Germans are starting to send their V1 rockets
2:15
over to Great Britain.
2:18
And the V1 rockets, this is just significant
2:20
from the history of technology.
2:21
Obviously today rockets play a big deal
2:24
in a whole bunch of context,
2:26
and this was the first time that they were deployed
2:28
in a major way during a war.
2:30
The first V1 rockets, they weren't all that impressive,
2:32
they traveled three or four hundred miles per hour,
2:35
slower than modern jet-liners.
2:37
They didn't travel at that high of an altitude.
2:39
But as we'll see, or as we'll see even in this video,
2:42
within a few months, by September,
2:45
they were sending in V2 rockets,
2:47
which were far more advanced,
2:49
going several thousand miles per hour,
2:50
getting to altitudes of tens of miles high,
2:53
and carrying even larger payloads.
2:55
So the Germans were really starting to push the envelope
2:57
in terms of rocket science.
3:00
What's good about the Allie is, is that the Germans
3:02
were kind, they developed this technology a little bit late.
3:05
They are starting to be on the heels, obviously,
3:07
on both the Western front and the Eastern front,
3:10
and even in the South the Allies
3:12
were really on the offensive now,
3:14
but rockets are starting to get involved.
3:15
V1's in the summer, and then the V2's in the fall.
3:22
Now, also as we go into the late summer and fall,
3:25
you see that Russians, after defeating the Germans at Kursk,
3:28
are marching towards,
3:32
are marching towards Poland,
3:36
and marching in particular towards Warsaw,
3:38
as we go through 1944.
3:43
And at the end of 1944, not the end really,
3:45
at the end of the summer of 1944,
3:48
in August of 1944,
3:50
you have the Polish uprising, you have kind of the rebels.
3:55
The underground is taking on the German occupiers.
3:59
So this is August, 1944.
4:02
August, 1944.
4:04
With the Russian troops, or the Soviet troops
4:07
not that far away, they're getting closer and closer
4:09
and closer to Warsaw.
4:11
Now, also in August of 1944, you have Paris, is liberated.
4:17
So this is August, 25th, 1944.
4:22
Paris is liberated.
4:25
And then, as we go later into that year,
4:27
British troops are able to liberate Athens.
4:32
So British troops are able to liberate Athens.
4:35
So Athens is liberated.
4:36
And actually this, once this liberated,
4:38
then you start having the beginnings of the Civil War,
4:41
of the Greek Civil War that occurs
4:43
between kind of the government troops and the Communists,
4:46
or as you say the more left-leaning people
4:49
who were involved in fighting against the Axis powers.
4:55
So, even though they were liberated,
4:56
it's kind of the start of another unfortunate chapter
5:00
with the Greek Civil War.
5:02
And then, finishing out 1944, the Axis powers,
5:06
and particularly the Germans, they weren't done yet.
5:08
Even though the war is not looking good,
5:10
they finally mount a, I guess you could say
5:12
one of their last counteroffensive,
5:14
just not their last major counteroffensive.
5:16
And that's over here against the Allied troops,
5:21
particularly the American troops,
5:23
at the Battle of the Bulge.
5:25
And this starts in December of 1944.
5:30
It's called the Battle of the Bulge
5:32
because the shape in which, so if the Allied,
5:35
you know, the front, the Allied front looks like that
5:37
as it is advancing.
5:39
The Germans mount a counteroffensive
5:41
and they are able to create a,
5:43
what's called in military terms a salient,
5:46
where they're able to push through,
5:48
where they're able to push through
5:50
and kind of create, and create this bulge.
5:53
This is an incredibly bloody battle,
5:56
it's actually the most bloody battle
5:58
faced by American troops.
5:59
They lose nearly 20 thousand, not just lose,
6:04
20 thousand die, American troops die
6:07
just in the Battle of the Bulge
6:09
that starts in December of 1944.
6:12
But this really is the Germans last hurrah.
6:16

6:17

6:19

- [Voiceover] Let's say that I've got a triangle,
0:03
and this side has length b,
0:07
which is equal to 12,
0:10
12 units or whatever units of measurement we're using.
0:14
Let's say that this side right over here,
0:17
this side right over here, has length c,
0:20
and that happens to be equal to nine.
0:23
And that we want to figure out the length
0:30
of this side, and this side has length a,
0:33
so we need to figure out what a is going to be equal to.
0:36
Now, we won't be able to figure this out
0:38
unless we also know the angle here,
0:40
because you could bring the blue side
0:44
and the green side close together,
0:45
and then a would be small,
0:46
but if this angle was larger than a would be larger.
0:49
So we need to know what this angle is as well.
0:51
So let's say that we know that this angle,
0:53
which we will call theta,
0:55
is equal to 87 degrees.
0:59
So how can we figure out a?
1:01
I encourage you to pause this and try this on your own.
1:04
Well, lucky for us, we have the Law of Cosines,
1:07
which gives us a way for determining a third side
1:10
if we know two of the sides and the angle between them.
1:13
The Law of Cosines tells us that a squared is going
1:18
to be equal b squared plus c squared.
1:23
Now, if we were dealing with a pure right triangle,
1:25
if this was 90 degrees, then a would be the hypotenuse,
1:28
and we would be done, this would be the Pythagorean Theorem.
1:30
But the Law of Cosines gives us an adjustment
1:32
to the Pythagorean Theorem, so that we can do this
1:34
for any arbitrary angle.
1:36
So Law of Cosines tell us a squared is going
1:38
to be b squared plus c squared,
1:41
minus two times bc,
1:48
times the cosine of theta.
1:55
And this theta is the angle that opens up
1:59
to the side that we care about.
2:02
So we can use theta because we're looking for a.
2:05
If they gave us another angle right over here,
2:06
that's not the angle that we would use.
2:08
We care about the angle that opens up
2:10
into the side that we are going to solve for.
2:13
So now let's solve for a,
2:14
because we know what bc and theta actually are.
2:18
So a squared is going to be equal to b squared...
2:24
so it's going to be equal to 144,
2:27
plus c squared which is 81, so plus 81,
2:32
minus two times b times c.
2:35
So, it's minus two, I'll just write it out.
2:37
Minus two times 12 times nine,
2:45
times the cosine of 87 degrees.
2:52
And this is going to be equal to,
2:56
let's see, this is 225 minus,
3:00
let's see, 12 times nine is 108.
3:03
108 times two is 216.
3:05
Minus 216 times the cosine of 87 degrees.
3:12
Now, let's get our calculator out
3:13
in order to approximate this.
3:15
And remember, this is a squared.
3:16
Actually, before I get my calculator out,
3:18
let's just solve for a.
3:19
So a is just going to be the square root of this.
3:21
So a is going to be equal to the square root...
3:26
of all of this business, which I can just copy and paste.
3:29
It's going to be equal to the square root of that.
3:31
So let me copy and paste it.
3:34
So a is going to be equal to the square root of that,
3:36
which we can now use the calculator to figure out.
3:39
Let me increase this radical a little bit,
3:40
so that we make sure we're taking the square root
3:42
of this whole thing.
3:43
So let me get my calculator out.
3:45
So I want to find that square root of 220.
3:49
Actually, before I do that, let me just make sure I'm
3:50
in degree mode, and I am in degree mode.
3:53
Because we're evaluating a trig function in degrees here.
3:58
So that's fine, so let me exit.
3:59
So it's going to be 225 minus 216,
4:04
times cosine
4:08
of 87 degrees.
4:10
Not 88 degrees, 87 degrees.
4:13
And we deserve a drumroll now.
4:16
This is going to be 14.61,
4:20
or 14.618.
4:22
If, say, we wanted to round to the nearest tenth,
4:24
just to get an approximation,
4:25
it would be approximately 14.6.
4:28
So a is approximately equal
4:31
to 14.6, whatever units we're using long.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,ZElOxG7_m3c,

0:00
Thought I would do a video on communism
0:02
just because I've been talking about it a bunch in the history
0:05
videos, and I haven't given you a good definition of what
0:09
it means, or a good understanding of what it means.
0:11
And to understand communism-- let
0:12
me just draw a spectrum here.
0:13
So I'm going to start with capitalism.
0:15
And this is really just going to be an overview.
0:17
People can do a whole PhD thesis on this type of thing.
0:21
Capitalism, and then I'll get a little bit more--
0:24
and then we could progress to socialism.
0:28
And then we can go to communism.
0:30
And the modern versions of communism
0:33
are really kind of the brainchild
0:35
of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin.
0:37
Karl Marx was a German philosopher
0:39
in the 1800s, who, in his Communist Manifesto and other
0:43
writings, kind of created the philosophical underpinnings
0:46
for communism.
0:47
And Vladimir Lenin, who led the Bolshevik Revolution
0:51
in the-- and created, essentially, the Soviet Union--
0:54
he's the first person to make some of Karl Marx's ideas
0:58
more concrete.
0:59
And really every nation or every country
1:03
which we view as communist has really
1:04
followed the pattern of Vladimir Lenin.
1:07
And we'll talk about that in a second.
1:08
But first, let's talk about the philosophical differences
1:11
between these things, and how you would move.
1:13
And Karl Marx himself viewed communism
1:16
as kind of a progression from capitalism
1:20
through socialism to communism.
1:22
So what he saw in capitalism-- and at least this part
1:25
of what he saw was right-- is that you
1:28
have private property, private ownership of land.
1:32
That's the main aspect of capitalism.
1:34
And this is the world that most of us live in today.
1:38
The problem that he saw with capitalism
1:40
is he thought, well, look, when you
1:42
have private property, the people who start accumulating
1:46
some capital-- and when we talk about capital,
1:48
we could be talking about land, we
1:51
could be talking about factories,
1:53
we could be talking about any type of natural resources--
1:55
so the people who start getting a little bit of them--
1:58
so let me draw a little diagram here.
2:00
So let's say someone has a little bit of capital.
2:03
And that capital could be a factory, or it could be land.
2:07
So let me write it.
2:08
Capital.
2:10
And let's just say it's land.
2:11
So let's say someone starts to own a little bit of land.
2:14
And he owns more than everyone else.
2:16
So then you just have a bunch of other people
2:18
who don't own land.
2:20
But they need, essentially-- and since this guy
2:22
owns all the land, they've got to work on this guy's land.
2:25
They have to work on this guy's land.
2:28
And from Karl Marx's point of view, he said, look,
2:31
you have all of these laborers who don't have as much capital.
2:35
This guy has this capital.
2:37
And so he can make these laborers work
2:39
for a very small wage.
2:42
And so any excess profits that come out
2:45
from this arrangement, the owner of the capital
2:48
will be able to get it.
2:49
Because these laborers won't be able to get
2:52
their wages to go up.
2:53
Because there's so much competition for them
2:56
to work on this guy's farm or to work on this guy's land.
2:59
He really didn't think too much about, well,
3:01
maybe the competition could go the other way.
3:04
Maybe you could have a reality eventually where
3:06
you have a bunch of people with reasonable amounts of capital,
3:10
and you have a bunch of laborers.
3:12
And the bunch of people would compete for the laborers,
3:15
and maybe the laborers could make their wages go up,
3:19
and they could eventually accumulate their own capital.
3:22
They could eventually start their own small businesses.
3:24
So he really didn't think about this reality
3:26
too much over here.
3:27
He just saw this reality.
3:28
And to his defense-- and I don't want
3:31
to get in the habit of defending Karl Marx too
3:33
much-- to his defense, this is what
3:36
was happening in the late 1800s, especially--
3:39
we have the Industrial Revolution.
3:41
Even in the United States, you did
3:42
have kind of-- Mark Twain called it the Gilded Age.
3:45
You have these industrialists who
3:47
did accumulate huge amounts of capital.
3:50
They really did have a lot of the leverage
3:51
relative to the laborers.
3:53
And so what Karl Marx says, well, look,
3:55
if the guy with all the capital has all the leverage,
3:58
and this whole arrangement makes some profits,
4:00
he's going to be able to keep the profits.
4:02
Because he can keep all of these dudes' wages low.
4:05
And so what's going to happen is that the guy with the capital
4:07
is just going to end up with more capital.
4:11
And he's going to have even more leverage.
4:13
And he'll be able to keep these people on kind of a basic wage,
4:17
so that they can never acquire capital for themselves.
4:20
So in Karl Marx's point of view, the natural progression
4:23
would be for these people to start organizing.
4:26
So these people maybe start organizing into unions.
4:30
So they could collectively tell the person who
4:33
owns the land or the factory, no, we're not going to work,
4:36
or we're going to go on strike unless you increase our wages,
4:39
or unless you give us better working conditions.
4:42
So when you start talking about this unionization stuff,
4:45
you're starting to move in the direction of socialism.
4:48
The other element of moving in the direction of socialism
4:52
is that Karl Marx didn't like this kind
4:54
of high concentration-- or this is socialists in general,
4:57
I should say-- didn't like this high concentration of wealth.
5:00
That you have this reality of not only
5:03
do you have these people who could accumulate all
5:06
of this wealth-- and maybe, to some degree,
5:08
they were able to accumulate it because they were innovative,
5:10
or they were good managers of land,
5:12
or whatever, although the Marxists don't
5:14
give a lot of credit to the owners of capital.
5:16
They don't really give a lot of credit
5:18
to saying maybe they did have some skill in managing
5:20
some type of an operation.
5:22
But the other problem is is that it gets handed over.
5:24
It gets handed over to their offspring.
5:27
So private property, you have this situation where it just
5:30
goes from maybe father to son, or from parent to a child.
5:34
And so it's not even based on any type of meritocracy.
5:37
It's really just based on this inherited wealth.
5:39
And this is a problem that definitely happened in Europe.
5:43
When you go back to the French Revolution,
5:45
you have generation after generation of nobility,
5:48
regardless of how incompetent each generation would
5:52
be, they just had so much wealth that they were essentially
5:55
in control of everything.
5:56
And you had a bunch of people with no wealth
5:59
having to work for them.
6:00
And when you have that type of wealth disparity,
6:02
it does lead to revolutions.
6:05
So another principle of moving in the socialist direction
6:07
is kind of a redistribution of wealth.
6:10
So let me write it over here.
6:11
So redistribution.
6:16
So in socialism, you can still have private property.
6:20
But the government takes a bigger role.
6:23
So you have-- let me write this.
6:24
Larger government.
6:27
And one of the roles of the government
6:29
is to redistribute wealth.
6:30
And the government also starts having
6:33
control of the major factors of production.
6:37
So maybe the utilities, maybe some
6:39
of the large factories that do major things, all of a sudden
6:42
starts to become in the hands of the government,
6:45
or in the words of communists, in the hands of the people.
6:49
And the redistribution is going on,
6:51
so in theory, you don't have huge amounts of wealth
6:54
in the hands of a few people.
6:57
And then you keep-- if you take these ideas
7:00
to their natural conclusion, you get
7:03
to the theoretical communist state.
7:05
And the theoretical communist state
7:07
is a classless, and maybe even a little bit--
7:12
a classless society, and in Karl Marx's point of view-- and this
7:16
is a little harder to imagine-- a stateless society.
7:21
So in capitalism, you definitely had classes.
7:23
You had the class that owns the capital,
7:28
and then you had the labor class,
7:29
and you have all of these divisions,
7:30
and they're different from each other.
7:32
He didn't really imagine a world that maybe a laborer could
7:35
get out of this, they could get their own capital,
7:38
then maybe they could start their own business.
7:40
So he just saw this tension would eventually to socialism,
7:43
and eventually a classless society where
7:45
you have a central-- Well, he didn't even
7:48
go too much into the details but you have kind of equal,
7:52
everyone in society has ownership over everything,
7:55
and society somehow figures out where
7:57
things should be allocated, and all of the rest.
8:00
And it's all stateless.
8:01
And that's even harder to think about in a concrete fashion.
8:05
So that's Karl Marx's view of things.
8:07
But it never really became concrete
8:09
until Vladimir Lenin shows up.
8:12
And so the current version of communism
8:14
that we-- The current thing that most of us view as communism
8:18
is sometimes viewed as a Marxist-Leninist state.
8:25
These are sometimes used interchangeably.
8:28
Marxism is kind of the pure, utopian, we're eventually
8:31
going to get to a world where everyone is equal,
8:35
everyone is doing exactly what they want,
8:38
there's an abundance of everything.
8:40
I guess to some degree, it's kind
8:42
of describing what happens in Star Trek, where everyone can
8:44
go to a replicator and get what they want.
8:46
And if you want to paint part of the day,
8:48
you can paint part of the day, and you're not just a painter,
8:50
you can also do whatever you want.
8:52
So it's this very utopian thing.
8:53
Let me write that down.
8:54
So pure Marxism is kind of a utopian society.
9:00
And just in case you don't know what utopian means,
9:02
it's kind of a perfect society, where you don't have classes,
9:05
everyone is equal, everyone is leading these kind
9:08
of rich, diverse, fulfilling lives.
9:10
And it's also, utopian is also kind of viewed as unrealistic.
9:13
It's kind of, if you view it in the more negative light, is
9:16
like, hey, I don't know how we'll ever
9:17
be able to get there.
9:18
Who knows?
9:19
I don't want to be negative about it.
9:20
Maybe we will one day get to a utopian society.
9:23
But Leninist is kind of the more practical element of communism.
9:27
Because obviously, after the Bolshevik Revolution, 1917,
9:30
in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union gets created,
9:33
they have to actually run a government.
9:35
They have to actually run a state based
9:36
on these ideas of communism.
9:39
And in a Leninist philosophy-- and this
9:43
is where it starts to become in tension with the ideas
9:46
of democracy-- in a Leninist philosophy,
9:50
you need this kind of a party system.
9:52
So you need this-- and he calls this the Vanguard Party.
9:55
So the vanguard is kind of the thing that's leading,
9:58
the one that's leading the march.
10:00
So this Vanguard Party that kind of
10:02
creates this constant state of revolution,
10:05
and its whole job is to guide society, is to kind of almost
10:10
be the parent of society, and take it from capitalism
10:14
through socialism to this ideal state of communism.
10:18
And it's one of those things where
10:19
the ideal state of communism was never--
10:22
it's kind of hard to know when you get there.
10:24
And so what happens in a Leninist state is
10:26
it's this Vanguard Party, which is usually called the Communist
10:29
Party, is in a constant state of revolution, kind of saying,
10:32
hey, we're shepherding the people to some future state
10:35
without a real clear definition of what that future state is.
10:39
And so when you talk about Marxist-Leninist,
10:42
besides talking about what's happening
10:44
in the economic sphere, it's also
10:46
kind of talking about this party system, this party system where
10:50
you really just have one dominant party that it will
10:53
hopefully act in the interest of the people.
10:56
So one dominant communist party that
11:02
acts in the interest of the people.
11:04
And obviously, the negative here is that how do
11:09
you know that they actually are acting
11:11
in the interest of people?
11:12
How do you know that they actually are competent?
11:14
What means are there to do anything
11:16
if they are misallocating things, if it is corrupt,
11:18
if you only have a one-party system?
11:21
And just to make it clear, the largest existing communist
11:25
state is the People's Republic of China.
11:28
And although it is controlled by the Communist Party,
11:31
in economic terms it's really not that communist anymore.
11:35
And so it can be confusing.
11:36
And so what I want to do is draw a little bit of a spectrum.
11:39
On the vertical axis, over here, I want to put democratic.
11:46
And up here, I'll put authoritarian or totalitarian.
11:51
Let me put-- well, I'll put authoritarian.
11:53
I'll do another video on the difference.
11:56
And they're similar.
11:58
And totalitarian is more an extreme form of authoritarian,
12:02
where the government controls everything.
12:05
And you have a few people controlling everything
12:07
and it's very non-democratic.
12:08
But authoritarian is kind of along those directions.
12:12
And then on this spectrum, we have the capitalism, socialism,
12:15
and communism.
12:17
So the United States, I would put-- I
12:19
would put the United States someplace over here.
12:23
I would put the United States over here.
12:25
It has some small elements of socialism.
12:28
You do have labor unions.
12:29
They don't control everything.
12:31
You also have people working outside of labor unions.
12:34
It does have some elements of redistribution.
12:38
There are inheritance taxes.
12:41
There are-- I mean it's not an extreme form of redistribution.
12:44
You can still inherit private property.
12:46
You still have safety nets for people,
12:49
you have Medicare, Medicaid, you have welfare.
12:51
So there's some elements of socialism.
12:53
But it also has a very strong capitalist history,
12:57
private property, deep market, so I'd
12:59
stick the United States over there.
13:01
I would put the USSR-- not current Russia,
13:05
but the Soviet Union when it existed-- I
13:08
would put the Soviet Union right about there.
13:14
So this was the-- I would put the USSR right over there.
13:21
I would put the current state of Russia,
13:23
actually someplace over here.
13:28
Because they actually have fewer safety nets,
13:30
and they kind of have a more-- their economy
13:32
can kind of go crazier, and they actually
13:34
have a bigger disparity in wealth
13:37
than a place like the United States.
13:38
So this is current Russia.
13:42
And probably the most interesting one here
13:44
is the People's Republic of China, the current People's
13:47
Republic of China, which is at least
13:49
on the surface, a communist state.
13:52
But in some ways, it's more capitalist than the United
13:54
States, in that they don't have strong wealth redistribution.
13:58
They don't have kind of strong safety nets for people.
14:02
So you could put some elements of China--
14:05
and over here, closer to the left.
14:07
And they are more-- less democratic than either the US
14:10
or even current Russia, although some people would
14:13
call current Russia-- well, I won't go too much into it.
14:15
But current China, you could throw it here a little bit.
14:17
So it could be even a little bit more capitalist
14:19
than the United States.
14:20
Definitely they don't even have good labor laws, all the rest.
14:24
But in other ways, you do have state ownership of a lot,
14:28
and you do have state control of a lot.
14:30
So in some ways, they're kind of spanning this whole range.
14:35
So this right over here is China.
14:37
And even though it is called a communist state, in some ways,
14:40
it's more capitalist than countries
14:42
that are very proud of their capitalism.
14:44
But in a lot of other ways, especially with the government
14:47
ownership and the government control of things,
14:49
and this one dominant party, so it's
14:50
kind of Leninist with less of the Marxist going on.
14:54
So in that way, it is more in the communist direction.
14:57

15:00
be a confusing topic.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,MmRgMAZyYN0,

What I want to do in this video is give ourselves
0:02
a basic introduction to the phenomenon of light.
0:07
And light is, at least to me, mysterious.
0:11
Because on one level it really defines our reality.
0:14
It's maybe the most defining characteristic of our reality.
0:17
Everything we see, how we perceive reality,
0:20
is based on light bouncing off of objects
0:23
or bending around objects or diffracting around objects,
0:26
and then being sensed by our eyes,
0:29
and then sending signals into our brain that
0:32
create models of the world we see around us.
0:35
So it really is, almost, the defining characteristic
0:37
of our reality.
0:38
But at the same time, when you really go down to experiment
0:42
and observe with light, it starts
0:44
to have a bunch of mysterious properties.
0:47
And to a large degree it is not fully understood yet.
0:51
And probably the most amazing thing about light--
0:54
well, actually there's tons of amazing things about light--
0:56
but one of the mysterious things is when you really get down
0:59
to it-- and this is actually not just true of light,
1:01
this is actually true of almost anything
1:03
once you get onto a small enough quantum mechanical level--
1:07
light behaves as both a wave and a particle.
1:12
And this is probably not that intuitive to you,
1:15
because it's not that intuitive to me.
1:17
In my life, I'm used to certain things behaving as waves,
1:19
like sound waves or the waves of an ocean.
1:22
And I'm used to certain things behaving like particles,
1:25
like basketballs or-- I don't know-- my coffee cup.
1:29
I'm not used to things behaving as both.
1:32
And it really depends on what experiment you run
1:34
and how you observe the light.
1:36
So when you observe it as a particle,
1:38
and this comes out of Einstein's work
1:40
with the photoelectric effect-- and I won't go into the details
1:43
here, maybe in a future video when
1:44
we start thinking about quantum mechanics--
1:47
you can view light as a train of particles moving
1:54
at the speed of light, which I'll talk about in a second.
1:56
We call these particles photons.
2:00
If you view light in other ways-- and you see it
2:02
even when you see light being refracted by a prism here--
2:07
it looks like it is a wave.
2:10
And it has the properties of a wave.
2:12
It has a frequency, and it has a wavelength.
2:16
And like other waves, the velocity of that wave
2:19
is the frequency times its wavelength.
2:23
Now even if you ignore this particle aspect of light,
2:28
if you just look at the wave aspect of the light,
2:30
it's still fascinating.
2:32
Because most waves require a medium to travel through.
2:36
So for example, if I think about how sound travels through air--
2:40
so let me draw a bunch of air particles.
2:44
I'll draw a sound wave traveling through the air particles.
2:47
What happens in a sound wave is you compress some of the air
2:52
particles and those compress the ones next to them.
2:54
And so you have points in the air that have higher,
2:57
I guess you could say, higher pressure
2:59
and points that have lower pressure,
3:00
and you could plot that.
3:02
So we have high pressure over here.
3:03
High pressure, low pressure, high pressure, low pressure.
3:07
And as these things bump into each other,
3:08
and this wave essentially travels to the right--
3:11
and if you were to plot that you would see this wave
3:13
form traveling to the right.
3:15
But this is all predicated, or this is all
3:17
based on, this energy traveling through a medium.
3:22
And I'm used to visualizing waves in that way.
3:26
But light needs no medium.
3:34
Light will actually travel fastest through nothing,
3:37
through a vacuum.
3:39
And it will travel at an unimaginably fast speed--
3:42
3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second.
3:47
And just to give you a sense of this,
3:49
this is 300 million meters per second.
3:51
Or another way of thinking about it is it
3:54
would take light less than a seventh of a second
3:59
to travel around the earth.
4:00
Or it would travel around the earth more than seven times
4:03
in one second.
4:04
So unimaginably fast.
4:06
And not only is this just a super fast speed,
4:10
but once again it tells us that light
4:12
is something fundamental to our universe.
4:14
Because it's not just an unimaginable fast speed.
4:17
It is the fastest speed not just known to physics, but possible
4:21
in physics.
4:22
So once again something very unintuitive to us
4:25
in our everyday realm.
4:26
We always imagine that, OK, if something
4:29
is going at some speed, maybe if there was an ant riding on top
4:31
of that something and it was moving in the same direction,
4:34
it would be going even faster.
4:35
But nothing can go faster than the speed of light.
4:39
It's absolutely impossible based on our current understanding
4:43
of physics.
4:44
So it's not just a fast speed, it
4:46
is the fastest speed possible.
4:55
And this right here is an approximation.
4:57
It's actually 2.99 something something times 10
5:01
to the eighth meters per second.
5:02
But 3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second
5:04
is a pretty good approximation.
5:07
Now within the visible light spectrum-- and I'll
5:10
talk about what's beyond the visible light spectrum
5:13
in a second-- you're probably familiar with the colors.
5:15
Maybe you imagine them as the colors of the rainbow.
5:18
And rainbows really happen because the light
5:20
from the sun, the white light, is being refracted
5:24
by these little water particles.
5:27
And you can see that in a clearer way when
5:29
you see light being refracted by a prism right over here.
5:33
And the different wavelengths of light-- so white light
5:36
contains all of the visible wavelengths--
5:39
but the different wavelengths get refracted differently
5:42
by a prism.
5:44
So in this case the higher-frequency wavelengths,
5:47
the violet and the blue, get refracted more.
5:50
Its direction gets bent more than the low-frequency
5:53
wavelengths, than the reds and the oranges right over here.
5:59
And if you want to look at the wavelength of visible light,
6:02
it's between 400 nanometers and 700 nanometers.
6:05
And the higher the frequency, the higher the energy of that
6:09
light.
6:09
And that actually goes into when you
6:11
start talking about the quantum mechanics of it--
6:13
that the higher frequency means that each of these photons
6:16
have higher energy.
6:17
They have a better ability to give kinetic energy
6:20
to knock off electrons or whatever else they need to do.
6:23
So higher frequency-- let me write
6:25
that down-- higher frequency means higher energy.
6:35
Now I keep referring to this idea of the visible light.
6:39
And you might say, what is beyond visible light?
6:41
And what you'll find is that light is just
6:43
part of a much broader phenomenon,
6:46
and it's just the part that we happen to observe.
6:49
And if we want to broaden the discussion a little bit,
6:54
visible light is just really part
6:56
of the electromagnetic spectrum.
6:59
So light is really just electromagnetic radiation.
7:09
And everything that I told you about light just now--
7:11
it has a wave property and it has particle properties--
7:15
this is not just specific to visible light.
7:17
This is true of all of electromagnetic radiation.
7:22
So at very low frequencies or very long wavelengths--
7:25
we're talking about things like radio waves,
7:27
the things that allow a radio to reach your car;
7:31
the things that allow your cellphone
7:34
to communicate with cell towers; microwaves, the things that
7:38
start vibrating water molecules in your food
7:40
so that they heat up; infrared, which
7:43
is what our body releases, and that's
7:45
why you can detect people through walls
7:46
with infrared cameras; visible light; ultraviolet light,
7:50
the UV light coming from the sun that'll give you sunburn;
7:53
X-rays, the radiation that allows
7:55
us to see through the soft material and just visualize
7:58
the bones; gamma rays,
7:59
the super high energy that comes from quasars
8:03
and other certain types of physical phenomena-- these
8:05
are all examples of the exact same thing.
8:08
We just happen to perceive certain frequencies
8:11
of this as visible light.
8:14
And you might say, hey, Sal, how come we only
8:15
perceive certain frequencies of this?
8:18
How can we only see these frequencies?
8:23
Literally we can see those frequencies
8:25
with our unaided eye.
8:26
And the reason, or at least my best guess
8:28
of the reason of that, is that's the frequency where
8:30
the sun dumps out a lot of electromagnetic radiation.
8:34
So it's inundating the Earth.
8:36
And if, as a species, you wanted to observe things
8:38
based on reflected electromagnetic energy,
8:42
it is most useful to be able to perceive the things where there
8:46
is the most electromagnetic radiation.
8:48
So it is possible that in other realities or other planets
8:51
there are species that perceive more
8:53
in the ultraviolet range or the infrared range.
8:55
And even on Earth, there are some
8:57
that perform better at either end of the range.
8:59
But we see really well in the part of the spectrum
9:02
where the sun just happens to dump a lot of radiation on us.
9:08
Now I'll leave you there.
9:09
I think that's a pretty good overview of light.
9:11
And if any of this stuff seems kind
9:14
of unintuitive or daunting, or really
9:17
on some level confusing-- this wave-particle duality,
9:20
this idea of a transfer of energy through nothing--
9:25
and it seems unintuitive, don't worry.
9:27
It seems unintuitive even for the best of physicists.
9:30
So you're already at the leading edge of physics thinking.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,rLNM8zI4Q_M,
khan_video_T0zpF_j7Mvo_123,How can the displacement of 14.7m have the same sign when the ball is going upwards or downwards?,Essay,"•
0:00
What do I do in this video now that we have displacement
0:04
as a function of time given constant acceleration and initial velocity
0:09
I want to plot displacement velocity, final velocity, and acceleration
0:14
all those function of time,
0:17
just so we really understand what's happening
0:19
as the ball is going up and then down
0:22
So we know this is our displacement function of time,
0:26
we know what our final veloctiy is going to be,
0:29
as a function of time we talked about in our last video
0:32
the final velocity is going to be the initial velocity
0:35
plus our acceleration times change in time
0:41
right if we start we some initial velocity,
0:43
and you multiply the acceleration with time
0:46
this part tell you how much faster or slower you are going to go
0:49
between initial velocity or that will be your I guess current velocity
0:54
the final velocity at that point in time
0:57
and of course the acceleration we know
1:00
our acceleration is pretty straigth forward
1:03
the acceleration due to gravity is just gonna be negative 9.8 m/s*s
1:09
once again the negative being the convention that
1:11
it is in the downward direction
1:13
our initial velocity is going to be upper direction 19.6m/s
1:19
so let's plot this out a little bit, let's plot these out
1:22
so the first graph I wanna do will be my displacement verses time
1:31
so this axis right over here is going to be time
1:36
and let me just call it change in time, actually I'll just call it time
1:41
let's just call it time and then this axis right over here
1:46
I will call it displacement and we leave some marker here
1:50
so let's say that this is 5m, 10m, 15m and 20m
1:55
and the time, this is zero, this is 1 this is 2 this is 3 &amp; this is 4
2:06
seconds, so this is in second here
2:08
this is meters 5,10,15,20 and then so this is displacement
2:22
displacement graph, and I wanna do at the same time a velocity graph
2:28
let me draw my velocity graph like this, a little bit different
2:32
so this is the velocity will be going up and down, so we have positive
2:38
and negative values here, time will only be positive
2:41
so once again I care about 1s 2s 3s and 4s
2:49
and velocity I'm gonna call this, this is going to be 10m/s
2:55
10m/s this is 20m/s, this will be negative 10m/s
3:01
and this will be negative 20m/s, all of these are in m/s
3:07
this right here is velocity, this axis right here is time
3:13
so this is my velocity graph, and why don't we draw an acceleration graph
3:19
over here, to some degree it's easiest of them all
3:23
so the acceleration graph, so I will just do the fraction here and assume
3:31
that the acceleration is a constant, so this is 1s 2s 3s and 4s
3:37
and let's call this negative 10 and all of these are meters per s square
3:45
so we know our acceleration is 9.8 m/s*s so the acceleration
3:49
the entire time over the four seconds
3:54
the acceleration over the four seconds is going to be negative 9.8
3:59
it's gonna be a constant acceleration the entire time
4:03
let's figure out the displacment and velocity,
4:05
let me draw a table here, in one column I will do change in time
4:14
and you can sometime do that as time
4:17
let's figure out what our final velocity is
4:21
I should say the current velocity of velocity at that time
4:25
and in this column I will figure out what displacement is
4:31
and I will do it in time 0 1 2 3 4 so in 0 zero second gone by
4:40
when 1 second has gone by, when 2s 3s 4s has gone by
4:45
Actually let me call it change in time axis
4:47
this is essentially how many seconds it has gone by
4:50
So this is my change in time, let me make it clear that this graph here
4:55
is acceleration graph acceleration I will put it on the screen
5:01
Alright, so let's fill these things out
5:04
so times zero, what is our velocity?
5:09
well if we use this expression right here time zero or delta t equal zero
5:15
this expression right here is gonna be zero, and it's just going to be
5:18
initial velocity, in the last video we gave our initial velocity
5:22
is going to be 19.6m/s, so it is going to be 19.6m/s
5:32
I will plot that over here, time zero, it's going to be 19.6 m/s
5:38
what is our initial displacement at time zero?
5:41
Our change in time zero, so you look at this up here
5:45
delta t is zero so this expression here is going to be zero
5:51
so we haven't done any displacement yet when no time has gone by
5:55
So we have done no displacement, we are right over there
6:01
now what happen after 1s? 1s has gone by
6:05
what is now our velocity? well our initial velocity right here is 19.6m/s
6:12
that was a given, and our acceleration is negative 9.8m/s*s
6:20
so it's negative right over there and you multiply that by delat t
6:24
in every situation, so in this situation we are gonna multiply it by 1
6:28
delta t is 1, so you have 19.6 minus 9.8 that gives exactly 9.8m/s
6:36
and the unit we got cause we multiply here is second
6:40
so its give us meters per second
6:41
19.6m/s minus 9.8m/s one of these seconds go away multiply by second
6:48
give you 9.8m/s so after 1s our velocity is now half of what it was before
6:55
so we are now going 9.8m/s, let me draw a line here
7:01
9.8m/s, now what is our displacement? so you look up here
7:09
Let me rewrite this displacement formular here with all the infomation
7:13
So we know that displacement is going to be equal to initial veloctiy
7:17
which is 19.6m/s
7:21
now I won't write the units here just for the sake of space
7:22
times change in time, times our, use the same color to see what is what
7:28
times our change in time, plus one half let me be clear one half
7:33
times negative 9.8m/s*s so one half times a is going to be
7:40
I rewrite this right over here cause this is gonna be negative 9.8m/s*s
7:45
times one half, so this is going to be negative 4.9
7:50
All I did is one half times negative 9.8 over here
7:57
It is important that is why the vector quantity is start to matter
8:00
because if you put a positive here you wouldn't have the obeject slowing
8:04
down as you went up, because you will have gravity somehow accelerating
8:07
as it went up, but it's actually slowing it down
8:09
it's pulling it, it's accelerating it in downward direction
8:12
so that's why you have a negative right over there,
8:15
that was out convention at the beginning
8:16
of last video, up is positive, down is negative, so let's focus
8:22
So this part right over here, negative 4.9 m/s*s times delat t square
8:27
times delta t, times delta t square, this will make it a little bit easier
8:32
Although it still, let me get the calculator out
8:34
So when one second has past, I let my trusty TI-85 out now
8:42
when 1s past it's 19.6 times 1,
8:46
well that's just 19.6 minus 4.9 times 1 square
8:50
So that's just minus 4.9, mius 4.9, gives us 14.7 meters
8:58
So 14.7 meters So after 1s, the ball has travel 14.7 meters in the air
9:06
So that's roughly over there, now what happen after 2s?
9:12
I'll do the same agenda, so after 2s,
9:15
our velocity is 19.6 minus 9.8 times 2, times 2 this is 2s has gone by
9:23
well 9.8 times 2, 9.8 times 2 square seconds gives us 19.6 m/s
9:32
so these just cancel out, so we get out velocity now is zero
9:36
So after two seconds our velocity now is zero
9:40
let me make it so this thing should more look like a line
9:47
I don't get a sense, so this is let me just draw the line like this
9:51
so our velocity now is zero after 2 seconds
9:55
what is our displacement?
9:57
So literally we at the point with the ball has no velocity
10:01
exactly two seconds, it kind of gone up,
10:04
and right for that exact moment of time it's stationary
10:09
and then what do we have going on in our displacement?
10:13
We have 19.6 let me get the calculator out for this
10:16
We can do it by hand but for the sake of quickness
10:21
19.6 times 2 minus 4.9 times 2s squared, this is 2s squared
10:36
so that's times four, so that gives us 19.6 meters
10:41
So we have 19, we are at 19.6 meters after 2 seconds
10:49
we are 19.6 meters in the air
10:53
now let's go to 3s, so after 3s, our velocity now
11:01
it's 19.6 m/s minus 9.8 times 3, we could do that in our head but just
11:09
verified it for us, let me get the calculator out
11:11
it's 19.6-9.8*3, that gives us 9.8 m/s, negative 9.8m/s
11:24
So after 3s, our velocity is now negative 9.8 m/s, what is that mean?
11:29
it's now going in downward direction, 9.8 m/s,
11:33
so this is our velocity graph, and what is our displacement?
11:39
So once again, let's get the calculator out
11:41
you are getting the hang of this
11:43
at anytime I encourage you to pause it and try it for yourself
11:46
So now what is this is, Okay I'm looking at the displacement
11:53
Our displacment was delta t with 3s 19.6*3 - 4.9 times
12:03
so this is delat t so this is 3s
12:06
we are talking about delat t, our change in time is 3s so that's square
12:10
So times 9 and that gives us 14.7 meters, so 14.7 meters
12:18
So after 3s we are 14.7m again, the same position with 1s
12:24
but the difference is now we are moving downard
12:27
over here we were moving upwards
12:28
and finally what happen after 4s? Or what's our velocity?
12:32
Let me just get the calculator out
12:34
or you might be figure this out in your head
12:36
Our velocity is going to be 19.6 - 9.8 times 4s
12:48
just minus 19.6 m/s
12:55
So we are going a magnitude of velocity which is the same initially
12:59
threw the ball except now it's going at opposite direction
13:02
it's now going downward, so it's now going downward
13:07
and what is our displacement? get the calculator out
13:11
So we have out displacement is 19.6 times 4, 4s has gone by
13:18
minus 4.9 times 4 square which is 16 times, which is equal to zero!
13:27
the displacement here is zero!
13:29
We are back on the ground
13:32
So if you plot the displacement, you will actually got a parabola
13:38
a downward opening parabola that looks something like this
13:41
I best draw it relatively neatly
13:44
So my check to do it better than that
13:46
Dotted line, dotted line is always easier to adjust than its streamed
13:50
so if you plot displacement verses time it look something like this
13:56
it's velocity just downward sloping line, and the acceleration is constant
14:01
and the whole reason why I wanted to this is I wanted to show you
14:05
that velocity the whole time is decreasing at constant rate
14:08
and that make sense because that's the rate which the velocity increases
14:13
and decreases as the acceleration,
14:15
and the acceleration base on our convention is downward
14:19
so that why it's decreasing, we have a negative slope here
14:22
we have a negative slope of negative 9.8 m/s*s
14:28
and just to think about what's happening for this ball
14:32
I know this video is getting long as it goes
14:34
I'm gonna draw the vectors for velocity
14:38
So I'm gonna do that in orange, or maybe I will do that in blue
14:42
So velocity in blue, so right when we start,
14:45
it has a positive velocity of 19.6m/s,
14:49
so I will draw a big vector like this
14:52
19.6m/s that's velocity, but after 1s is 9.8m/s so half of that
14:58
so then its maybe would look something like this
15:01
9.8m/s, then at the speed right over here has the velocity of zero
15:06
then as you go to 3s, the magnitude of the velocity is 9.8m/s
15:12
but it is now downwards, so it looks like this
15:16
and then finally right when it hits the ground,
15:20
right before it hits the ground it has a negative velocity of 19.6m/s
15:26
So it would look like this, roughly like this
15:32
If I use the same scale over here,
15:35
but what was the acceleration the entire time?
15:38
well the entire time the acceleration is negative
15:40
It's 9.8m/s*s I will do that in orange
15:44
So the acceleration over here
15:46
Negative, now I wanna do that in orange
15:48
The acceleration is negative 9.8m/s*s
15:58
The acceleration is constant the entire time
16:02
So last one is negative 9.8m/s*s
16:05
it does not change depending on where you are
16:07
in the curve when you are near the surface of the earth
16:10
So hopefully that clarify the things a little bit and gives you

khan_video_8aeivxR1GDc_0,Why do some ethnic groups have a higher propensity toward having hypertension?,MCQ,"•
0:02
All right.
0:03
Let's talk about hypertension.
0:05
And the first thing we have to do
0:08
is understand the two main categories, or types,
0:12
of hypertension that are out there.
0:14
So there are two types, primary--
0:20
and this is actually also called essential hypertension.
0:23
You might hear that word, essential.
0:25
And secondary.
0:27
And I'll write that as a two.
0:29
And so the way that this is divided up
0:32
is that primary hypertension is caused by something indirect.
0:40
OK, so what does that mean exactly?
0:43
So I'll give you some examples of what
0:44
the indirect cause could be.
0:46
It could be something like smoking,
0:48
or it could be that someone has obesity or is obese.
0:53
Or it could be that they have hyperlipidemia,
0:57
meaning that they have lots of fats floating around
1:00
in the blood.
1:02
Or let's say they have diabetes.
1:04
That would be another cause, or indirect cause,
1:08
of hypertension.
1:09
And these are all risk factors, right?
1:11
That's another way of thinking about these things.
1:13
These are general risk factors for having hypertension.
1:16
And the other category would be something direct.
1:20
And once I write this down, you'll
1:22
start seeing the difference.
1:23
This would be something like kidney disease.
1:26
So let's say that I have a problem with my kidneys.
1:30
And they, for some reason-- these
1:32
are my kidneys-- they are holding on
1:34
to far too much fluid than they should.
1:36
And that's because they're diseased.
1:38
And so they're holding onto too much fluid.
1:40
And they're causing my volume of blood to go up.
1:43
There causing the volume to go up,
1:45
and the stroke volume is going up as well.
1:48
And if the stroke volume goes up,
1:49
you know that stroke volume is going to cause a higher blood
1:55
pressure, because they're directly related
1:56
to each other-- very direct.
1:58
That would be one example.
2:00
Another example could be-- let's say
2:01
I have what's called an ""aortic coarctation.""
2:07
So this is a very specific problem.
2:11
This would be-- if I have my-- let's say the heart is here.
2:15
And I have the aorta coming off here.
2:18
Normally, it should be nice and open, the way I've drawn it.
2:21
But if you have a coarctation, then you
2:24
might have a pinching in of the vessel.
2:27
So it would start looking like this.
2:29
It would look like that, like a pinch.
2:33
And if you have a pinching in right there, then
2:36
you have increased resistance.
2:41
And if you have increased resistance,
2:42
you know, again, resistance is going
2:44
to relate back to pressure.
2:46
So if you have more resistance, you have higher pressure.
2:49
So these are direct causes of hypertension,
2:54
which is slightly different than the indirect causes
2:56
I wrote above-- the smoking, obesity--
2:58
because there's no clear direct mechanism in any
3:01
of those things.
3:01
They're just more general risk factors.
3:03
So this is how we kind of divvy up the two groups.
3:05
And we say, OK, if you have one or the other,
3:08
then you're in the primary or secondary group.
3:11
So let's figure out, of the two, which is more prevalent.
3:19
And this basically means, which is
3:22
going to affect more people at any point in time.
3:26
So if I was to poll all people with hypertension--
3:29
ask them, hey, what group are you in, primary or secondary--
3:33
most people would say primary, because most of these people
3:38
are going to be smokers or obese or diabetics or people that
3:43
have hyperlipidemia, some of these risk factors
3:46
that we just laid out.
3:47
In fact over, 90% of the people have primary hypertension.
3:55
And only a few people, I would say less than 10%,
3:59
are going to say, nope, I'm actually
4:00
in the secondary group.
4:01
I have a very specific reason for having hypertension.
4:05
So this is actually a very easy way
4:06
of figuring out if people are having hypertension
4:10
from an indirect cause or a direct cause.
4:13
All right.
4:13
So now, let's assume that you follow
4:16
one person over time, one individual.
4:19
And that person used to have normal blood pressure.
4:24
Let's say this is blood pressure over here.
4:26
And I'm going to write it out as Mean Arterial Pressure, MAP.
4:30
Mean Arterial Pressure.
4:32
And we want to maintain a Mean Arterial Pressure, a MAP,
4:37
of a certain number.
4:38
So this would be like a normal blood pressure range, right?
4:40
Something below this dashed line.
4:43
So this is normal.
4:46
But of course, many people have something higher than normal.
4:49
They, over time, might develop higher blood pressure.
4:54
So maybe they start out here and here in the normal range.
4:58
And then they start having high blood pressure.
5:01
And it kind of goes up and down, and up and then down
5:04
and stops there.
5:06
So in this person-- I'm going to connect
5:10
the dots-- they, if you asked them,
5:13
would not have any symptoms for most of the time.
5:16
They would actually say, you know, I feel fine.
5:19
I don't have any symptoms at all.
5:20
In fact, up until this point in time,
5:25
they would say they have no symptoms.
5:29
And the vast majority of people are actually in this group.
5:32
So most people with hypertension,
5:34
if you ask them if they have symptoms from it,
5:36
they would say no, they don't have any symptoms.
5:38
But at some point, they can develop symptoms.
5:41
Not everybody, but you can develop symptoms.
5:44
And when you do, it's usually quite significant.
5:47
So you might have problems with your heart.
5:50
Maybe your heart is having to work harder than it ever
5:53
had to, and you're having some heart failure.
5:55
Or you might have problems with your large vessels
5:59
or medium vessels.
6:01
And primarily, these are the arteries,
6:03
because the arteries are the vessels that
6:05
are seeing those high pressures.
6:06
And those arteries might be getting very stiff.
6:10
Or you might have problems with tiny vessels.
6:12
These are the little arteries, the smallest ones,
6:15
or the arterioles.
6:17
And remember, the smallest arteries and arterioles,
6:19
they're not sitting there naked in your body.
6:23
They're usually within an organ, right?
6:26
So they're usually within the kidney,
6:28
or they could be within the eye.
6:30
So I'll just draw these two.
6:32
So they're usually within some other organ.
6:35
And if you have problems with the smallest arterioles-- let's
6:38
say they're breaking-- then really, what you're saying
6:42
is you're going to have kidney problems or eye problems.
6:45
So these are the kind of problems you can get.
6:48
And because most people are having
6:50
no symptoms-- most people are over here--
6:52
you really want to catch them before they cross over
6:56
from no symptoms to having symptoms.
6:58
And you want to take care of the blood pressure problem
7:01
so that they never develop any symptoms.
7:02
That's the goal.
7:04
Now, unfortunately, some people develop
7:07
what's called ""malignant hypertension.""
7:10
And I'm going to write out for you
7:11
what malignant hypertension means.
7:16
It's a few things.
7:18
And we can actually even draw it on our figure.
7:20
Maybe I'll do that.
7:21
So you have people with malignant hypertension
7:24
that have a rapid rise in their blood pressure.
7:30
And it causes damage to the heart and vessels.
7:41
And finally, the range that we're talking about,
7:45
it's a rapid rise to a really high blood pressure.
7:48
Sometimes we think of these pressures
7:50
being around 240 over 120-- really high blood pressures.
7:54
So on our graph, this could be the person
7:56
that-- unlike the person in white,
7:58
this person maybe had a very quick rise in pressure.
8:04
And then it got very high, maybe got up to 240 over 120.
8:10
And so this would be the third point.
8:13
The rapid rise is the first point.
8:16
And the fact that they're having symptoms is point number two.
8:19
So you can see now how someone with malignant hypertension
8:23
could look on this sort of a graph.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,8aeivxR1GDc,

0:00
In this video, I'm going to do several examples of quadratic
0:03
equations that are really of a special form, and it's really
0:06
a bit of warm-up for the next video that we're going to do
0:10
on completing the square.
0:11
So let me show you what I'm talking about.
0:13
So let's say I have 4x plus 1 squared, minus
0:20
8 is equal to 0.
0:24
Now, based on everything we've done so far, you might be
0:26
tempted to multiply this out, then subtract 8 from the
0:29
constant you get out here, and then try to factor it.
0:33
And then you're going to have x minus something, times x
0:37
minus something else is equal to 0.
0:43
And you're going to say, oh, one of these must be equal to
0:45
0, so x could be that or that.
0:47
We're not going to do that this time, because you might
0:50
see something interesting here.
0:52
We can solve this without factoring it.
0:56
And how do we do that?
0:57
Well, what happens if we add 8 to both
0:59
sides of this equation?
1:02
Then the left-hand side of the equation becomes 4x plus 1
1:06
squared, and these 8's cancel out.
1:09
The right-hand becomes just a positive 8.
1:13
Now, what can we do to both sides of this equation?
1:15
And this is just kind of straight, vanilla
1:18
equation-solving.
1:19
This isn't any kind of fancy factoring.
1:21
We can take the square root of both sides of this equation.
1:28
We could take the square root.
1:29
So 4x plus 1-- I'm just taking the square root of both sides.
1:34
You take the square root of both sides, and, of course,
1:36
you want to take the positive and the negative square root,
1:39
because 4x plus 1 could be the positive square root of 8, or
1:43
it could be the negative square root of 8.
1:45
So 4x plus 1 is equal to the positive or negative
1:50
square root of 8.
1:51
Instead of 8, let me write 8 as 4 times 2.
1:55
We all know that's what 8 is, and obviously the square root
1:58
of 4x plus 1 squared is 4x plus 1.
2:02
So we get 4x plus 1 is equal to-- we can factor out the 4,
2:09
or the square root of 4, which is 2-- is equal to the plus or
2:12
minus times 2 times the square root of 2, right?
2:17
Square root of 4 times square root of 2 is the same thing as
2:19
square root of 4 times the square root of 2, plus or
2:23
minus the square root of 4 is that 2 right there.
2:26
Now, it might look like a really bizarro equation, with
2:29
this plus or minus 2 times the square of 2,
2:32
but it really isn't.
2:34
These are actually two numbers here, and we're actually
2:36
simultaneously solving two equations.
2:38
We could write this as 4x plus 1 is equal to the positive 2,
2:43
square root of 2, or 4x plus 1 is equal to negative 2 times
2:52
the square root of 2.
2:53
This one statement is equivalent to this right here,
2:56
because we have this plus or minus here, this or statement.
2:59
Let me solve all of these simultaneously.
3:01
So if I subtract 1 from both sides of this
3:05
equation, what do I have?
3:07
On the left-hand side, I'm just left with 4x.
3:10
On the right-hand side, I have-- you can't really
3:13
mathematically, I mean, you could do them if you had a
3:15
calculator, but I'll just leave it as negative 1 plus or
3:19
minus the square root, or 2 times the square root of 2.
3:23
That's what 4x is equal to.
3:25
If we did it here, as two separate equations, same idea.
3:28
Subtract 1 from both sides of this equation, you get 4x is
3:32
equal to negative 1 plus 2, times the square root of 2.
3:36
This equation, subtract 1 from both sides.
3:39
4x is equal to negative 1 minus 2, times the
3:44
square root of 2.
3:45
This statement right here is completely equivalent to these
3:52
two statements.
3:53
Now, last step, we just have to divide both sides by 4, so
3:57
you divide both sides by 4, and you get x is equal to
4:02
negative 1 plus or minus 2, times the square
4:06
root of 2, over 4.
4:09
Now, this statement is completely equivalent to
4:11
dividing each of these by 4, and you get x is equal to
4:16
negative 1 plus 2, times the square root 2, over 4.
4:21
This is one solution.
4:22
And then the other solution is x is equal to negative 1 minus
4:27
2 roots of 2, all of that over 4.
4:31
That statement and these two statements are equivalent.
4:35
And if you want, I encourage you to-- let's substitute one
4:38
of these back in, just so you feel confident that something
4:41
as bizarro as one of these expressions can be a solution
4:45
to a nice, vanilla-looking equation like this.
4:48
So let's substitute it back in.
4:50
4 times x, or 4 times negative 1, plus 2 root 2, over 4, plus
4:58
1 squared, minus 8 is equal to 0.
5:03
Now, these 4's cancel out, so you're left with negative 1
5:07
plus 2 roots 2, plus 1, squared, minus
5:12
8 is equal to 0.
5:14
This negative 1 and this positive 1 cancel out, so
5:17
you're left with 2 roots of 2 squared, minus
5:21
8 is equal to 0.
5:24
And then what are you going to have here?
5:28
So when you square this, you get 4 times 2, minus 8 is
5:33
equal to 0, which is true.
5:38
8 minus 8 is equal to 0.
5:40
And if you try this one out, you're going to get the exact
5:42
same answer.
5:44
Let's do another one like this.
5:45
And remember, these are special forms where we have
5:46
squares of binomials in our expression.
5:51
And we're going to see that the entire quadratic formula
5:53
is actually derived from a notion like this, because you
5:55
can actually turn any, you can turn any, quadratic equation
6:00
into a perfect square equalling something else.
6:05
We'll see that two videos from now.
6:06
But let's get a little warmed up just seeing
6:08
this type of thing.
6:09
So let's say you have x squared minus 10x, plus 25 is
6:16
equal to 9.
6:18
Now, once again your temptation-- and it's not a
6:20
bad temptation-- would be to subtract 9 from both sides, so
6:23
you get a 0 on the right-hand side, but before you do that,
6:27
just inspect this really fast. And say, hey, is this just
6:31
maybe a perfect square of a binomial?
6:34
And you see-- well, what two numbers when I multiply them I
6:38
get positive 25, and when I add them I get negative 10?
6:41
And hopefully negative 5 jumps out at you.
6:44
So this expression right here is x minus 5, times x minus 5.
6:52
So this left-hand side can be written as x minus 5 squared,
6:56
and the right-hand side is still 9.
6:59
And I want to really emphasize.
7:01
I don't want this to ruin all of the training you've gotten
7:03
on factoring so far.
7:05
We can only do this when this is a perfect square.
7:08
If you got, like, x minus 3, times x plus 4, and that would
7:12
be equal to 9, that would be a dead end.
7:15
You wouldn't be able to really do anything
7:16
constructive with that.
7:17
Only because this is a perfect square, can we now say x minus
7:21
5 squared is equal to 9, and now we can take the square
7:23
root of both sides.
7:25
So we could say that x minus 5 is equal to plus or minus 3.
7:31
Add 5 to both sides of this equation, you get x is equal
7:36
to 5 plus or minus 3, or x is equal to-- what's 5 plus 3?
7:43
Well, x could be 8 or x could be equal to 5 minus 3, or x is
7:49
equal to 2.
7:51
Now, we could have done this equation, this quadratic
7:54
equation, the traditional way, the way you were
7:58
tempted to do it.
7:59
What happens if you subtract 9 from both
8:01
sides of this equation?
8:03
You'll get x squared minus 10x.
8:07
And what's 25 minus 9?
8:09
25 minus 9 is 16, and that would be equal to 0.
8:16
And here, this would be just a traditional factoring problem,
8:18
the type that we've seen in the last few videos.
8:21
What two numbers, when you take their product, you get
8:23
positive 16, and when you sum them you get negative 10?
8:29
And maybe negative 8 and negative 2
8:31
jump into your brain.
8:33
So we get x minus 8, times x minus 2 is equal to 0.
8:38
And so x could be equal to 8 or x could be equal to 2.
8:43
That's the fun thing about algebra: you can do things in
8:46
two completely different ways, but as long as you do them in
8:49
algebraically-valid ways, you're not going to get
8:52
different answers.
8:55
And on some level, if you recognize this, this is easier
8:57
because you didn't have to do that little game in your head,
8:58
in terms of, oh, what two numbers, when you multiply
9:01
them you get 16, and when you add them you get negative 10?
9:02
Here, you just said, OK, this is x minus 5-- oh, I guess you
9:05
did have to do it.
9:06
You had to say, oh, 5 times 5 is 25, and negative 10 is
9:10
negative 5 plus negative 5.
9:11
So I take that back, you still have to do that little
9:14
game in your head.
9:15
So let's do another one.
9:18
Let's do one more of these, just to really get ourselves
9:22
nice and warmed up here.
9:25
So, let's say we have x squared plus 18x, plus 81 is
9:38
equal to 1.
9:41
So once again, we can do it in two ways.
9:42
We could subtract 1 from both sides, or we could recognize
9:46
that this is x plus 9, times x plus 9.
9:53
This right here, 9 times 9 is 81, 9 plus 9 is 18.
9:58
So we can write our equation as x plus 9
10:01
squared is equal to 1.
10:03
Take the square root of both sides, you get x plus 9 is
10:06
equal to plus or minus the square root of 1,
10:09
which is just 1.
10:10
So x is equal to-- subtract 9 from both sides-- negative 9
10:15
plus or minus 1.
10:16
And that means that x could be equal to-- negative 9 plus 1
10:21
is negative 8, or x could be equal to-- negative 9 minus 1,
10:26
which is negative 10.
10:28
And once again, you could have done this the traditional way.
10:31
You could have subtracted 1 from both sides and you would
10:33
have gotten x squared plus 18x, plus 80 is equal to 0.
10:41
And you'd say, hey, gee, 8 times 10 is 80, 8 plus 10 is
10:44
18, so you get x plus 8, times x plus 10 is equal to 0.
10:50
And then you'd get x could be equal to negative 8, or x
10:54
could be equal to negative 10.
10:57
That was good warm up.

right here, we're gonna use this shoe to illustrate
0:04
some more challenging normal force problems
0:07
and we're gonna take this as an opportunity to discuss
0:09
a lot of the misconceptions that people have about
0:11
the normal force.
0:13
So one misconception is that people forget
0:15
normal force is a contact force.
0:17
You only have a normal force when two surfaces
0:20
are in contact, so when the shoe's in contact with
0:22
the floor, there will be a normal force on the shoe
0:24
and a normal force on the floor.
0:26
Or if the shoe were in contact with the wall,
0:28
there would be a normal force on the wall
0:30
and a normal force on the shoe.
0:32
But if the shoe were just falling through the air,
0:34
here's what happens for a lot of people.
0:36
Let's say the shoe's just falling,
0:37
and you got a question and the question said,
0:39
draw the forces that are exerted on the shoe
0:41
while it's falling through the air.
0:42
People get so used to having normal forces
0:44
that they make a mistake, they do this, they say alright,
0:48
let me draw it over here.
0:50
They say there's a gravitational force and that's just fine.
0:52
There will be a gravitational force, there's always gravity,
0:54
the Earth's always pulling down,
0:56
and it pulls down with an amount mg.
0:58
But they're so used to having normal forces,
1:00
I mean normal forces pop up in so many different questions
1:03
it's almost just like a reflex,
1:05
people just automatically put, whoop, there's a normal force
1:08
there's gotta be a normal force, right?
1:10
There's always a normal force?
1:11
But there isn't always a normal force, if the shoe
1:13
is not in contact with the surface, you don't have a normal
1:16
force, it's not until this shoe makes it to the ground
1:20
or touches another surface that you'll have that
1:22
normal force, so if we stick this shoe right here
1:25
and we let it rest on the ground,
1:27
now you'll have a normal force and that normal force
1:29
will point up, and this is what people wanna say
1:32
and it's true when the surfaces are in contact
1:35
but if they're not in contact,
1:36
you don't have a normal force.
1:38
And then here's another misconception,
1:40
people think the normal force is always equal to mg,
1:43
because again, it's equal to mg
1:45
in so many different scenarios that people just
1:48
wanna say well it's always equal to mg, and again,
1:50
it's just like a reaction.
1:51
People see normal force, they just automatically replace it
1:54
with mg, and that'll be true in the simple case,
1:57
but I'll show you coming up how that's not gonna be true
1:59
and what you do if it's not true.
2:01
So for instance if we wanted to find what's the normal force
2:03
if this shoe has a mass m,
2:06
so let's assume that the shoe has a mass m,
2:08
what would the normal force be?
2:10
We can use Newton's second law,
2:11
we can always use Newton's second law,
2:13
so we'll say that acceleration equals the net force
2:17
divided by the mass, and in this case,
2:21
since these are vertical forces,
2:23
I'm gonna consider the acceleration
2:24
in the vertical direction and the net force
2:26
in the vertical direction.
2:28
And so what is the acceleration for the shoe vertically
2:30
if it's just sitting here in a room, sitting on the ground,
2:33
at rest and not changing it's motion,
2:35
not changing it's velocity, the acceleration's just gonna
2:37
be zero, so the vertical acceleration,
2:40
acceleration, excuse me, should be zero.
2:42
For the net force, I've got an upward normal force,
2:46
so I'm gonna make that positive,
2:48
if fn represents the magnitude of the normal force,
2:50
this would be positive Fn, I'm just gonna put positive here
2:54
even though I don't really need it but to show you
2:56
that it's upward, we're gonna consider upward to be positive
2:58
and then I've got this downward gravitational force,
3:00
and if mg represents the size of the gravitational force,
3:04
I'm gonna put a negative here to represent that that
3:06
gravitational force is down, and then I divide by
3:09
the mass of the shoe and if I do this I get that
3:13
these two forces, this net force divided by the mass
3:16
has to be zero, according to Newton's second law.
3:19
But I can multiply both sides by the mass and if I do that,
3:22
the left hand side is still zero,
3:24
and I'll get that this is equal to the normal force
3:27
minus mg, so I'll have normal force minus mg,
3:32
and if I finally solve for the normal force,
3:35
I'll get that the normal force is gonna equal mg,
3:38
and a lot of people are like yeah I already knew that, duh.
3:42
Normal force is always equal to mg, but it's only equal
3:45
to mg in this case because those were the only two forces,
3:47
look at the assumptions we made.
3:49
Only two forces were the normal force and the
3:51
gravitational force and we assumed that the acceleration
3:54
was zero, if you relax any of those requirements,
3:57
normal force is no longer going to be equal to mg.
4:00
And it was on a horizontal surface,
4:02
if you relax that requirement, again, there's no reason
4:05
to think this has to be in the Y direction,
4:07
you could have normal forces in the X direction.
4:09
So let's slowly, one point at a time,
4:12
try to relax some of these requirements and see what
4:14
that does to the normal force.
4:16
In other words, what if we just added another force?
4:19
What if we let the shoe sit here on the ground
4:22
and I push down on it?
4:23
So I'm pushing down on this shoe, I'm gonna say I'm pushing
4:26
down with a force, I'll just call it F1, so a force
4:31
of magnitude, F1, and it's pointing downward,
4:34
how would that change this now?
4:36
So this is, we're stepping it up, this is gonna be a little
4:38
harder, what do we do?
4:40
Well the acceleration is still zero, let's say it's still
4:42
just sitting there, so we don't have to do anything
4:45
with the left hand side that's still zero,
4:47
multiplying by m still makes that zero,
4:49
but now up here in this force up here,
4:50
I'm gonna have another force, I'm gonna have F1,
4:53
that points down so in my force diagram
4:55
I'd have another force that points down, F1,
4:58
that means I'd have to subtract it when I find
5:01
the net vertical force, I'd have F1,
5:03
this would be a negative F1 right here,
5:06
and when I solve for Fn I'd add mg to both sides
5:09
to cancel it and then I'd add F1 to both sides
5:12
to cancel this F1, this negative F1,
5:14
and I'd get mg plus F1.
5:17
So I get the normal force is gonna be bigger,
5:19
bigger by an amount F2 and that makes sense,
5:22
if you push down on a, oh no F2, wow,
5:25
F1, sorry about that, it's gonna be bigger by an amount F1,
5:28
so if I push down with an extra 10 Newtons of force,
5:32
there's more pressure, right?
5:34
That makes sense, the pressure between the ground
5:36
and the shoe is gonna be greater, you're squashing
5:37
these two surfaces together with greater force,
5:40
so the ground's gotta push up to keep the shoe
5:42
out of the surface, that's what this normal force does,
5:45
it exerts a force to keep the object out of the surface,
5:48
to keep the object from penetrating that surface,
5:51
so if I push down on an object, into a surface,
5:54
that normal force increases and it increases by the amount
5:57
you're pushing down, so that makes sense.
6:00
If you had an upward force, let's say you had an
6:01
upward force, someone's pulling up on the shoe
6:04
while you push down, you're fighting over the shoe,
6:06
you're wrestling over it with somebody because they just,
6:09
they love the shoe, they recognize the beauty of the shoe,
6:12
well crafted shoe, so if there's an F2 pointing up,
6:15
we now have another force in our diagram,
6:17
that force would point up, we would call this F2,
6:20
over here how would this change?
6:22
Again, still acceleration to zero,
6:24
but I'd have an upward force now so I'd have to add
6:26
F2 vertically because that's another force,
6:29
I'd have a plus F2 right here,
6:31
and then over here when I solve for this,
6:34
I add mg to both sides, I add F1 to both sides,
6:37
and I have to subtract F2 from both sides
6:40
so now I'd have Fn is mg plus F1 minus F2,
6:44
this also makes sense, if you pull up on a shoe,
6:47
you're relieving some of the pressure between the shoe
6:50
and the other surface, the shoe and the floor.
6:53
So if I pull up with 20 Newtons I'm gonna reduce
6:56
the normal force by 20 Newtons because I'm relieving
6:58
some of that pressure between the shoe and the floor.
7:01
Let's make it even harder.
7:03
Let's make this thing scary, sometimes you get really
7:06
crazy problems and you don't know what to do, let's say,
7:08
we have another force, let's say this force is gonna be
7:12
a diagonal force, so we're gonna pull this way.
7:17
That was not a well drawn force, let me draw it like this.
7:21
So we got a force this way at an angle.
7:24
Now we're talking, this is F3.
7:28
F3, at an angle of, we'll call it Fi, so the angle from
7:32
this horizontal line here is Fi.
7:37
Now what do we do?
7:38
So I've got this crooked angle in here, now this F3 is
7:41
gonna be pointing this way, so I'll add another force
7:44
to my force diagram, and I can figure out how to include
7:48
this into my vertical force version of Newton's second law,
7:53
I can't include the entire F3 force, here's a mistake
7:56
people make, they wanna just add F3 or subtract F3,
7:58
but I can't do that, this is the vertical form of
8:02
Newton's second law, this is only applying to the vertical
8:04
direction, the Y direction, but F3 is pointing both
8:07
vertically and horizontally.
8:09
So I have to only include the vertical part of F3
8:12
in this formula so what I have to do is say that alright
8:15
F3 is gonna have a vertical component,
8:17
that vertical component, I'll call it F3 Y,
8:20
for F3 in the vertical direction.
8:22
And it's also gonna have a horizontal component.
8:24
I'll just call that F3 X for F3 in the horizontal direction.
8:29
So if I wanna solve for F3 Y, I'll just use the definition
8:32
of sine and I know to use sine because this side is
8:35
the opposite to this angle, I know sine
8:38
relates opposite side, so I'm gonna write this as
8:40
sine of phi is gonna equal the opposite side is F3 Y
8:45
so F3 in the Y direction divided by F3 total,
8:50
the total magnitude of F3, and if I solve this for F3 Y,
8:53
I get F3 in the Y direction is gonna equal F3 times sine
8:59
of Fi, now I can include this in my force, my net force,
9:03
because this points upward, so since it points up,
9:07
this vertical component's gonna add a plus,
9:10
F3 sin theta over here, or sorry not theta,
9:14
it's gonna be F3 sin Fi, and I'll have a plus F3 sin fi
9:20
right here, and when we subtract this F3 sin phi from the
9:24
other side to get it over to here,
9:27
we're gonna get minus F3 sine phi and that makes sense
9:31
because if we pull up, we know we're reducing some
9:34
of the pressure, we'll reduce the normal force,
9:37
so this component, look at this component points up,
9:39
it's reducing some of the pressure
9:41
on the bottom of the shoe, the normal force goes down,
9:44
and so we subtract the F3 sin fi.
9:47
And one more way to step this problem up to the next level
9:50
would be to say that this room isn't really just a room,
9:53
maybe it's an elevator,
9:54
and this elevator is accelerating upward
9:56
with some acceleration A zero, in that case,
10:00
nothing would change on this right hand side.
10:02
Sometimes people think if there's acceleration,
10:04
there's gonna be some new force, but if these are the forces
10:07
those are the forces, the only thing that changes over here
10:10
if this was in an elevator that's accelerating up,
10:13
is that instead of zero, you'd replace this with a zero
10:16
or whatever the acceleration is, that's it,
10:19
that's the only change, you could still solve for fn
10:21
the same way, when you multiply by m it wouldn't be
10:23
zero on the left anymore, you'd have a m a zero,
10:26
and then a plus m a zero when you solve
10:30
for the normal force.
10:32
Alright, I think we've pretty much exhausted
10:34
this example of a shoe on the floor,
10:36
it's probably harder than any example you'll see
10:39
but now you know how to handle any type of force

What I want to do in this video is
0:00
reconcile the more traditional Drake equation
0:00
So this product would give you the average stars
0:00
with the stuff that we derived, or that we came up with.
0:01
This is the average rate of star formation
0:01
are actually the same thing.
0:01
And then the rest of it looks pretty similar.
0:01
We kind of thought through it in the last several videos.
0:01
seems kind of unintuitive, and frankly,
0:01
So the more known Drake equation is this.
0:01
So I don't know what it is.
0:01
The number of detectable civilizations in the galaxy
0:01
is equal to-- and they'll have this.
0:01
What I want to do in this video is
0:01
The number of detectable civilizations in the galaxy
0:02
And this is not the number of stars in the galaxy.
0:02
So times the fraction of stars that have planets.
0:02
it is, but hopefully we'll reconcile to show you
0:03
So that's the average rate of star formation.
0:03
with the traditional Drake equation
0:03
that this, and what we're going to show
0:03
Average rate of star formation, which
0:03
So star-- so let me write this down.
0:03
You multiply that times the average number
0:03
with planet formations per year.
0:03
Maybe it's 10 stars a year, or something on that order.
0:03
of planets capable of sustaining life
0:03
reconcile the more traditional Drake equation
0:05
per year in the galaxy.
0:05
with the stuff that we derived, or that we came up with.
0:06
So the more known Drake equation is this.
0:06
We kind of thought through it in the last several videos.
0:06
for a star that has planets, for a solar system that
99:59:59
has planets.
99:59:59
So essentially, if you multiply this,
99:59:59
this is the average new planets per year
99:59:59
in our galaxy capable of sustaining life.
99:59:59
You multiply that times this, which
99:59:59
is the same exact fraction.
99:59:59
The fraction of those planets that
99:59:59
are capable of sustaining life, that actually, this
99:59:59
is capable of sustaining life, now we're
99:59:59
saying that the fraction that actually do develop life.
99:59:59
And then of the life, we care about the fraction
99:59:59
that actually does become intelligent.
99:59:59
And of the fraction that actually
99:59:59
does become intelligent, we care about the fraction
99:59:59
that eventually becomes detectable.
99:59:59
That can actually communicate.
99:59:59
And then in the traditional Drake equation,
99:59:59
we multiply that times this L over here.
99:59:59
Times the detectable life of the civilization.
99:59:59
So how long is that civilization detectable?
99:59:59
Are they releasing radio waves, or something like it
99:59:59
that a civilization like ours can detect?
99:59:59
Maybe there are other ways to communicate,
99:59:59
and we're just not advanced enough.
99:59:59
Maybe in a few years, we'll discover
99:59:59
in a few decades, or a few hundreds of years,
99:59:59
we'll discover that all the other advanced civilizations
99:59:59
are using a much more sophisticated way
99:59:59
of communicating that doesn't involve electromagnetic waves.
99:59:59
Who knows?
99:59:59
But this is what we're thinking right now.
99:59:59
But anyway, the whole point here is
99:59:59
to reconcile this thing which is less intuitive-- for me
99:59:59
at least-- than with this thing.
99:59:59
Because I started up here with the total number
99:59:59
of stars in the galaxy.
99:59:59
The traditional Drake equation starts
99:59:59
with the average rate of star formation.
99:59:59
So it's like, well, how does the average rate of star formation
99:59:59
gel with the total number of stars,
99:59:59
or civilizations that are now detectable?
99:59:59
What I want to do is diagram that out a little bit,
99:59:59
and I'm going to make a few assumptions.
99:59:59
I'm going to assume that this is kind of constant, that we're
99:59:59
in a steady state.
99:59:59
So this is constant, and we are in a steady state.
99:59:59
The reality is that what would matter
99:59:59
is the rate of star formation maybe 4, 5,
99:59:59
6 billion years ago, I don't know
99:59:59
how long it has to be ago, so that now it
99:59:59
starts to become realistic for real intelligence
99:59:59
and real detectable intelligence to exist.
99:59:59
But let's just assume that this number
99:59:59
is constant for most of the life of the galaxy.
99:59:59
Obviously we're making all sorts of crazy assumptions here,
99:59:59
so why not make another one?
99:59:59
But what I want you to show is that this
99:59:59
is equivalent to the number of stars in the galaxy divided
99:59:59
by the average life of a star, or the average life
99:59:59
of a solar system.
99:59:59
And if n divided by this t sub s,
99:59:59
if that's the same thing as our star, then
99:59:59
essentially we have the same formulas.
99:59:59
And to see that they're the same, imagine this.
99:59:59
Imagine this.
99:59:59
That this year, so this is this year, so this is-- well,
99:59:59
let me say this year.
99:59:59
This year.
99:59:59
Let's say that we have our star.
99:59:59
Let's say that this number is 10.
99:59:59
We have 10 new stars in the galaxy.
99:59:59
So this is-- I'll just say it's 10.
99:59:59
So our star is equal to 10.
99:59:59
So this height over here is 10.
99:59:59
That's what I'm depicting.
99:59:59
So if I were to slide it, I could
99:59:59
show that this is 10 units high, or whatever.
99:59:59
And then last year, there was also 10, so on and so forth.
99:59:59
Now, let's go to whatever-- let's
99:59:59
say that this number, this number right over here
99:59:59
is 10 billion years.
99:59:59
The average star life is 10 billion years.
99:59:59
So let's go back 10 billion years into the past.
99:59:59
So the average life of a star is equal to 10 billion years.
99:59:59
And we're assuming that this is constant.
99:59:59
So 10 billion years ago this year,
99:59:59
there were also 10 new stars came about.
99:59:59
And every year in between you had 10 stars come about.
99:59:59
Now, how many total stars would there be in our galaxy?
99:59:59
Well, any star that came about-- so we could go beyond that.
99:59:59
We could go to stars that were born more than 10 billion years
99:59:59
ago, more than this t sub s years ago.
99:59:59
So you could have a star that was born 10
99:59:59
billion and 1 years ago, on average.
99:59:59
We're talking about on averages here.
99:59:59
On average, that star will not exist anymore,
99:59:59
so that star is not in existence.
99:59:59
The stars that are in existence, once again, on average,
99:59:59
are the ones that were born 10 billion years ago, all the way
99:59:59
to the ones that were born this year.
99:59:59
So you have 10 billion years of star birth,
99:59:59
the ones that are still around.
99:59:59
Each year there's 10 of those years,
99:59:59
so the total number of stars should
99:59:59
be equal to the number of stars that
99:59:59
are born each year-- assuming that that is constant--
99:59:59
times the average lifespan of the stars.
99:59:59
Times the average lifespan of the stars.
99:59:59
And once again, this works because the stars that
99:59:59
were born before this lifespan don't exist anymore.
99:59:59
They've died out, on average.
99:59:59
We care about kind of this area right over here.
99:59:59
10 stars per year times 10 billion years.
99:59:59
And now if you manipulate this a little bit,
99:59:59
you'll see that we'll get the result we want.
99:59:59
Let's solve for r.
99:59:59
So we could just divide both sides by this t.
99:59:59
So you get n star, so the number of stars in our galaxy now,
99:59:59
making a bunch of assumptions, divided
99:59:59
by the average life of the stars is
99:59:59
equal to the average number of new stars per year.
99:59:59
Is equal to the average number of new stars per year,
99:59:59
and we get our result.
99:59:59
If you replace this with the total number of stars divided
99:59:59
by t, you get the exact same result that we had before.
99:59:59
You just change the order a bit.
99:59:59
We can take this divided by t, put it under this n,
99:59:59
take it out up here, and then you get the exact same thing.
99:59:59
So hopefully that reconciles it a little bit for you.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,LRmwUsxNSL0,

0:37
until she got to Mr. Ug's little yellow house.
0:41
The problem with Mr. Ug was that he never seemed to be home.
0:46
So Wind did what she always did, and left him a message so
0:49
that he'd know that she'd been there.
0:51
Hi Mr. Ug, she wrote.
0:54
She hung around a little longer hoping he might come home soon,
0:57
but eventually she gave up and walked back home.
0:59
Past the Beet Peel store, the pine log, and the big rock,
1:03
to her own little house.
1:05
When she got back, she saw that someone had left her a message.
1:08
It said, Hi Wind.
1:10
Mr. Ug must have come by to see her
1:12
while she was out trying to see him.
1:14
She kicked herself for waiting around so long at his house,
1:16
maybe if she'd gotten back sooner,
1:18
she could've caught him while he was still there.
1:20
She erased the message and decided to go back to his place
1:22
since he was obviously heading back there as well.
1:25
Their timing always seemed to be wrong.
1:28
Whenever she went to see him, he seemed to be out visiting her.
1:31
In fact, she never actually met Mr. Ug,
1:33
but she felt like she knew him very well,
1:34
because of the messages they were always leaving each other.
1:37
When she got to his place, she saw
1:39
that he had already read her message,
1:41
erased it, and left again.
1:43
But Wind was used to this kind of coincidence,
1:45
so she simply continued their conversation
1:47
by leaving another message.
1:49
How are you right now, she asked, and turned around
1:51
to go home.
1:53
Her grammar and spelling weren't so good,
1:55
because, after all, there was no school in her little world.
1:58
Mr. Ug didn't always have perfect spelling either,
2:01
but Wind thought that he had a lovely way with words.
2:04
For example, when she got home, she
2:05
found that Mr. Ug had already written a reply to her
2:08
how are you.
2:09
He said, Nomin' life, nom.
2:12
She thought this was a beautiful metaphor,
2:14
and felt lucky to have a neighbor who never answered how
2:17
are you, with something boring like, fine thank you.
2:20
But what she really wanted, more than anything,
2:23
was to actually meet him.
2:25
See his face for the first time.
2:27
She decided to try another tactic.
2:29
She erased his note and left one saying, back soon.
2:32
This way, if Mr. Ug came to visit while she was out,
2:35
he'd know to stay around for a while until she got back.
2:39
The prospect of finally meeting him
2:41
made Wind feel nervous and self conscious about how
2:43
boring her messages always were compared to his.
2:46
So she decided to get artistic and illustrated it
2:48
by drawing a foot with wings on the hill.
2:51
She then rushed back to Mr. Ug's house
2:53
with all the swiftness of Hermes,
2:54
to find that, indeed, he was, once again, not there.
2:57
Though it seemed he had taken up a new project as there
3:00
was a sign up for a Buck Zoo, complete
3:02
with a picture of a fully antlered buck.
3:05
Maybe he was out collecting deer for his zoo,
3:08
but maybe, just maybe, he had gone to visit her
3:10
and saw her sign, and decided to wait until she got back.
3:14
So she dashed out a quick, hello, leaving.
3:16
And then rushed back to her house
3:18
with all the swiftness of Mercury.
3:21
She approached her house, anticipating finally
3:23
saying hello to Mr. Ug in real life, for the first time.
3:26
But found only a message that said, revalue hello.
3:30
It was an interesting message, and gave her something
3:32
to ponder.
3:33
Maybe she was spending too much time trying to greet and talk
3:36
to Mr. Ug, and not enough time on her own projects.
3:39
She thought about how often they seem to cross paths,
3:43
and yet, she'd never actually passed him
3:44
on the path between their houses.
3:46
Maybe there was another path he used.
3:48
Wind had never explored the world to the left of her house,
3:51
but maybe it was about time she stopped obsessing over Mr. Ug
3:54
and went on an adventure.
3:56
Maybe, while Mr. Ug worked on his Buck Zoo,
3:59
she could have a project of her own
4:01
and work on exploring the world.
4:03
So she went left, and discovered a few new places.
4:06
There was a store which sold beef and beer,
4:09
though unfortunately it seemed to have closed long ago.
4:12
And a blue rod, and a lock pie, which didn't sound
4:15
too appetizing to her.
4:17
Before long, however, she found herself somewhere familiar.
4:20
She was back at Mr. Ug's house, and as usual, he was not home.
4:25
But now she knew why they kept missing each other.
4:28
Their little world was a loop, and they
4:30
were taking different paths from one side to the other.
4:33
Wind was very excited by this discovery
4:35
because now she understood her world a little better.
4:38
Best of all, in such a small world, her and Mr. Ug
4:40
were bound to meet eventually.
4:43
So she went home and decided to start another project.
4:46
Sometimes she worried that one of them
4:47
would accidentally fall off the edge of the world,
4:49
and she would never get to meet Mr. Ug.
4:52
After all, she herself had fallen off
4:54
the flat land where she grew up, which
4:56
was how she'd gotten here.
4:57
She'd thought about building a fence along the edge,
5:00
but it had always seemed like too big a project.
5:02
Now that she knew that her world was a loop,
5:04
she realized she could actually finish this project
5:07
and build a fence around the entire world.
5:10
She started with the side below her house,
5:12
and started around towards Mr. Ug's.
5:15
She passed the big rock, and the pine log,
5:17
and the beet peel store, until she
5:19
got to Mr. Ug's little yellow house, her heart fluttering
5:22
at the hope that he might be home this time.
5:24
But she saw to her surprise that Mr. Ug
5:26
was building a fence of his own on the other edge of the world.
5:29
Maybe he had gone to visit her, and saw the beginnings
5:31
of her fence, and decided to help out.
5:33
Wind continued building her fence,
5:35
thinking how sweet it was that Mr. Ug was
5:37
helping with her project.
5:39
She passed the lock pie, and the blue rod,
5:42
and the beef and beer store.
5:44
And when she got back to her home,
5:45
she was pleased to see that her entire world was safe
5:49
and she only had to build a fence along one edge of it.
5:52
Secure in the knowledge that Mr. Ug wasn't going anywhere,
5:55
Wind started pursuing other projects in the following days.
5:58
For example, she got a pet dog which
6:00
helped her feel a bit less lonely,
6:02
and built it a dog house.
6:04
She still wandered over to Mr. Ug's place
6:06
on occasion, just to see how he was doing.
6:08
It seemed that recently he'd gotten religious,
6:10
because he built what appeared to be a small church.
6:13
One day, Wind was out walking her dog
6:15
when the ground started to shake.
6:17
Suddenly, the ground began to split.
6:20
It was an earthquake so powerful that it
6:22
was ripping her world apart.
6:24
Wind quickly got away from the dangerous new edge that
6:27
was being torn through her world,
6:28
but her dog was still on the other side.
6:31
She ran trying to get past the crack,
6:32
but the world was splitting right down the center,
6:34
all the way around.
6:36
She could still hear her dog barking,
6:37
but the sound faded as the two sides of her worlds separated
6:41
and drifted apart.
6:42
Would she ever see her dog again?
6:45
And what about Mr. Ug?
6:47
I hate to end on a cliffhanger, but luckily for you, you
6:50
can figure out the ending to this story yourself.
6:52
Wind lives on not just any loop, but a Mobius strip,
6:55
which you can make easily out of paper.
6:57
Just cut out a strip, and instead of taping it
6:59
into a normal loop, give it a half twist first.
7:01
If you use a marker that bleeds through the paper,
7:03
you can draw Wind's house and see it from the other side.
7:06
But all that's essential here is that you draw wind and her dog.
7:09
Cut a line down the center of the paper, all the way around,
7:12
and you tell me how it ends.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,4mdEsouIXGM,

0:01
So we talked about inhaling and exhaling.
0:03
And I'd mentioned that the key first step for both of them
0:06
is this change in volume, going up in volume
0:09
or going down in volume.
0:10
But I didn't really talk about how that happens exactly,
0:13
so I thought I would jump into that now.
0:16
And let me begin by telling you that in the middle
0:18
of your chest, you have this enormous kind of bone that
0:21
goes down.
0:22
And I'm drawing it out of proportion just
0:24
to make it very clear where this bone is.
0:26
But you can go ahead and feel on your own body
0:29
this bone, which we call either the breastbone,
0:32
or the more technical name is the sternum.
0:35
So I'll write that down here.
0:37
The sternum is this middle bone, and all the ribs on both sides
0:41
attach there.
0:42
So you've got a total of 12 ribs and seven pairs of them.
0:48
Actually, I should say 12 pairs of ribs.
0:51
I don't want you to think there are 12 total.
0:53
We actually have 24 total and seven pairs of the ribs.
0:57
So 14 ribs actually attach directly to this sternum bone.
1:04
So in white, these are the ribs.
1:05
And between the ribs, you actually have muscle.
1:07
So I'm going to draw in some of these muscles between the ribs.
1:11
And these muscles are all going to have their own nerve that
1:16
allows them to contract.
1:18
So these muscles are controlled by your brain,
1:23
and their name-- let me just jot down here
1:26
on the side-- is intercostal muscle.
1:29
And inter just means between, so this is the name of the muscle.
1:33
And costal refers to the ribs.
1:35
So when you see that word costal,
1:37
you'll know we're talking about the ribs.
1:39
So what's between the ribs is these muscles,
1:42
intercostal muscles.
1:44
And they are going to start moving outwards when
1:48
your brain says, hey, I want to take a deep breath.
1:51
So these muscles are going to contract.
1:54
The ribs, I should say, are going to move outwards.
1:57
So these go out.
1:59
And you also have-- let me just make
2:01
a little bit of space on this canvas-- another muscle
2:04
that kind of rides down here and has
2:07
kind of an upside down U shape to it.
2:11
So I'm drawing it kind of like a dome.
2:14
You can think of it as a dome.
2:16
And this dome is the floor-- if you remember,
2:19
we talked about the floor of the thorax.
2:20
So this is, of course, our diaphragm muscle.
2:24
So we've got our diaphragm muscle.
2:25
And this one when it contracts, instead of going out,
2:29
it's going to go down.
2:31
So it's going to kind of flatten out.
2:33
And I can actually draw this.
2:34
If you can now just stick with me for a moment,
2:38
I'm going to erase this dome-like shape.
2:41
And I'm going to draw what it looks like as it contracts.
2:44
So when it contracts, it's actually going to be more flat.
2:47
And this flat diaphragm, as you can see,
2:53
is now further down than it used to be.
2:56
And as it goes down, all of the structures that
2:59
are inside this space-- so the two lungs.
3:01
And of course, I didn't draw the heart here.
3:03
But the heart would be kind of in this cardiac notch.
3:06
If you want, maybe I could even draw that heart here.
3:10
They're all going to kind of physically move down.
3:13
So this is our heart and our lungs.
3:15
They're physically going to be kind of drawn
3:18
downwards and out.
3:20
They are going to also move out as the intercostal muscles move
3:25
out.
3:26
So you have expansion of these lungs.
3:28
That's basically the idea.
3:30
And if you were to kind of zoom in on this to kind of see
3:32
exactly what this expansion looks
3:34
like, when I say you have more volume in the lungs,
3:38
really what I should be saying, if I wanted to be more exact,
3:42
is that all the alveoli-- if these are the alveoli,
3:45
let's say this is another branch.
3:46
And this is another alveoli right here.
3:48
All these alveoli, they are actually expanding.
3:52
And you have about 500 million alveoli.
3:56
If you can just kind of fathom how big a number that is.
3:59
It's an enormous number of alveoli.
4:01
And if I was actually drawing them,
4:02
I would be here drawing forever.
4:05
It would take forever to write out
4:07
this many different alveoli.
4:09
But basically what happens is that when the ribs go out
4:12
and the diaphragm moves down, these alveoli are actually
4:15
being pulled out.
4:18
They're actually being pulled outwards,
4:20
so they are actually going to be getting larger in size.
4:23
They literally look like they've grown in size,
4:26
and this is what they look like.
4:28
And actually, if you were to take an even closer look,
4:31
you'd see that these alveoli have around them
4:35
a bunch of protein.
4:36
The cells around them have a bunch of protein,
4:38
and this protein is called elastin.
4:42
And you can guess what elastin might do.
4:45
It has kind of a similar sound to the word elastic.
4:49
And elastin is basically kind of like a rubber band,
4:52
so you can kind of think of elastin as a rubber band.
4:56
And when the muscles move down and out
5:00
and the alveoli are pulled open--
5:03
let me actually now scroll up, because you can kind of go back
5:06
to the idea of inhaling-- what is happening, then?
5:09
Well, you have a couple things happening.
5:11
One, you have muscles-- I'll just write muscles contracting.
5:17
And when I say muscles, you know I'm
5:19
talking about all those intercostal muscles
5:21
in your diaphragm.
5:22
And as a result of the muscles contracting,
5:24
you have now the alveoli are stretched open.
5:30
So those rubber bands, those elastin proteins,
5:33
are literally physically being stretched opened.
5:40
And keep that in mind, because what's going to happen then
5:44
is when the muscles relax, which is
5:47
what happens when you exhale, what do you
5:51
think is going to happen to that elastin?
5:53
Well, if it's like a rubber band,
5:55
if that's what I'm saying it's going to be like,
5:57
then the alveoli are going to recoil.
6:01
And that's actually the driving force
6:04
for why the volume goes back down.
6:07
So if you have a bunch of rubber bands
6:08
that you're stretching out-- let me actually
6:09
bring up the picture.
6:10
You'll see it really clearly.
6:12
If you're physically kind of using your muscles to help
6:16
pull this stuff open, then the moment
6:18
that you stop pulling open, the moment
6:21
that you stop contracting those muscles now
6:24
that you have a nice big volume, what's going to happen?
6:27
Well, all these elastin molecules
6:30
are going to snap back.
6:32
Let me do it with a different color.
6:33
Let's do this color.
6:34
They're going to snap back like this.
6:38
All that protein is going to want
6:39
to snap back into the original size.
6:43
And when they do, this thing gets smaller.
6:45
So my alveoli goes back to its original size,
6:48
which was much smaller than this.
6:49
Let me actually just quickly show that and show you
6:53
that even though contraction is what opened up things,
6:57
it's the recoil that brings things
6:59
back down to their normal size.
7:02
And let me erase this to make it kind of a neater drawing.
7:05
So you can see it now.
7:06
Inhaling, the way that we actually increase the volume,
7:09
is by pulling things open through contraction.
7:13
And this actually requires energy.
7:16
Remember, you can't contract a muscle
7:18
without spending chemical energy.
7:21
So this takes chemical energy, and we usually
7:24
think of this molecule ATP as the specific type of chemical
7:28
energy we're going to use.
7:30
And to exhale, when you reduce the volume,
7:34
it's going to be driven by this elastic recoil.
7:37
So that's a type of elastic potential energy.
7:43
So this process of inhaling and exhaling
7:48
is really a little different from each other.
7:50
On the one hand, you're using ATP.
7:52
You're actually burning through these molecules.
7:54
And then when you exhale, you're actually
7:56
not using chemical energy anymore.
7:59
You're just using that elastic potential energy,
8:01
kind of the same sort of energy that you
8:03
can imagine you would have if you snap a rubber band.
8:07

0:00
- [Voiceover] So, let's talk a little bit about
0:01
a word you might have heard and that is Ion.
0:04
Let's talk about what it is and then we'll talk about
0:06
trends in the periodic table on,
0:08
on I guess how hard it is to make something an Ion.
0:12
In particular how hard it is
0:13
to make something a positive ion.
0:16
So, an ion is just an atom or a molecule
0:19
that has charge and it'll have charge if the
0:23
protons are not equal to the electrons.
0:25
Neutrons are obviously also constituent of atoms
0:29
but neutrons are neutral.
0:30
What you're gonna get your charge
0:31
from are your protons or electrons.
0:33
So, you're going to have a net charge.
0:34
If your number of, number of protons,
0:38
and this is for an atom or molecule.
0:40
A molecule's just a bunch of,
0:42
a bunch of atoms bonded together.
0:44
If the number of protons does not equal
0:48
the number of electrons.
0:51
And you can have positive ions if the protons are
0:55
more than the number of electrons, protons,
0:56
or positive electrons or negative.
0:58
And you can have negative ions if the number
1:00
of electrons are greater than the number of protons.
1:03
For example, for example, if you just had
1:08
Hydrogen in it's neutral state
1:09
has one proton and one electron,
1:12
but if you were to take one of those electrons away
1:15
then Hydrogen would have a positive charge
1:18
and essentially it would just be,
1:20
in its most common isotope it would just
1:22
be a proton by itself.
1:25
And so, when we talk about a positive ion like this
1:29
where our protons are more than our electrons,
1:30
the number of protons are more than the number of electrons,
1:33
we call these cations, cations.
1:37
Cation, once again, just another word positive ion.
1:41
Likewise, we can have negative ions.
1:45
So, say for example, Fluorine.
1:48
So, Fluorine gains an electron,
1:50
it's going to have a negative charge.
1:54
It's gonna have a negative charge of negative one,
1:56
and a negative ion we call an anion.
2:03
And the way that I remember this is
2:05
a kind of means the opposite or the negation of something.
2:09
So, this is a negative ion.
2:11
We've negating, you can somehow
2:13
think we are negating the ion.
2:16
So, with that out of the way,
2:17
let's think about how hard it will be ionize
2:21
different elements in the periodic table.
2:24
In particular, how hard it is to turn them into cations.
2:28
And to think about that, we'll introduce
2:29
an idea called ionization energy.
2:34
Ionization...
2:37
Ionization energy...
2:41
Energy...
2:42
And this is defined, this is defined as
2:45
the energy required, energy required
2:52
to remove an electron, to remove an electron.
3:01
So, it could've even been called cationization energy
3:04
because you really see energy required to remove
3:07
an electron and make the overall atom more positive.
3:13
So, let's think about the trends.
3:14
And we already have a little bit of background
3:15
on the different groups of the periodic table.
3:18
So, for example, if we were to focus on,
3:22
especially we could look at group one,
3:24
and we've already talked about how Hydrogen's
3:26
a bit of a special case in group one
3:27
but if we look at everything below Hydrogen.
3:29
If we look at the Alkali, if we look
3:32
at the Alkali metals here
3:34
we've already talked about the fact
3:35
that these are very willing to lose an electron.
3:38
Why? Because if they lose an electron
3:40
they get to the electron configuration
3:43
of the noble gas before it.
3:46
So, if Lithium loses an electron
3:49
then it has an outer shell electron configuration of Helium.
3:53
It has two outer electrons and that's kind of,
3:56
we typically talk about the Octet Rule
3:58
but if we're talking about characters like Lithium or Helium
4:01
they're happy with two 'cause you can
4:03
only put two electrons in that first shell.
4:06
But all the rest of 'em, Sodium, Potassium, etc., etc.,
4:10
if you take an electron away from them
4:12
then their outermost shell,
4:13
well, all of them in their outermost shell
4:15
they're going to have the electron configuration
4:17
of the noble gas before it
4:19
and for Sodium on down that outer shell
4:23
is going to have that perfect eight.
4:24
Lithium, if you remove an electron,
4:26
it would get to Helium and it would have
4:27
two electrons in its outer shell.
4:29
So, you can imagine that the ionization energy
4:32
right over here, the energy required to remove electrons
4:38
from your Alkali Metals is very low.
4:42
So, let me just write down this is...
4:44
So, when I say low, I'm talking about low ionization energy.
4:47
Low.
4:49
Now, what happens as we move to the right
4:51
of the periodic table?
4:52
In fact, let's go all the way
4:53
to the right on the periodic table.
4:55
Well, if we go here to the Noble Gases,
4:57
the Noble Gases we've already talked about.
4:59
They're very, very, very stable.
5:01
They don't want no one,
5:02
they don't want their electron configurations messed with.
5:05
So, it would be very hard...
5:06
Neon on down has their eight electrons
5:09
that (mumbling) Octet Rule.
5:11
Helium has two which is full for the first shell,
5:14
and so it's very hard to remove an electron from here,
5:17
and so it has a very high ionization energy.
5:20
Low energy, easy to remove electrons.
5:22
Or especially the first electron,
5:24
and then here you have a high ionization energy.
5:28
I know you have trouble seeing that H.
5:30
So, this is high, high ionization energy,
5:34
and that's the general trend across the periodic table.
5:36
As you go from left to right,
5:38
you go from low ionization energy to high ionization energy.
5:43
Now, what about trends up and down the periodic table?
5:46
Well, within any group, if we,
5:48
even if we look at the Alkali,
5:49
if we look at the Alkali Metals right over here,
5:52
if we're down at the bottom,
5:54
if we're looking at, if we're looking at,
5:55
say, Cesium right over here,
5:58
that electron in the, one, two, three, four, five, six,
6:04
in the sixth shell, that's going to be
6:06
further from that one electron
6:08
that Lithium has and its second shell.
6:10
So, it's going to be, it's going to be further away.
6:12
It's not going to be as closely bound to the nucleus,
6:17
I guess you could say.
6:18
So, this is going to be even,
6:19
that one electron's gonna even easier to remove
6:22
than the one electron in the outermost shell of Lithium.
6:25
So, this one has even lower, even lower,
6:29
even lower...
6:32
And that's even going to be true of the Noble Gases out here
6:35
that Xenon, that it's electrons in its outermost shell,
6:38
even though it has eight valence electrons,
6:41
they're further away from the nucleus,
6:43
and so they're a little, the energy required
6:45
to remove them is still going to be high
6:47
but it's going to be lower than the energy from,
6:51
from say Neon or Helium.
6:53
So, this is low.
6:55
So, once again, ionization energy low to high
6:58
as we go from left to right,
6:59
and low to high as we go from bottom to top.
7:02
Or we could say a general trend
7:03
that if we go from the bottom left to the top right
7:08
we go from low ionization energy,
7:10
very easy to remove an electron
7:12
from these characters right over here
7:14
to high ionization energy,
7:16
very hard to move, remove an electron
7:19
from these characters over here.
7:20
And you can see it if, you could see
7:23
in a trend of actual measured ionization energies
7:26
and I like to see charts like this because
7:28
it kind of show you where the periodic table came from
7:32
when people noticed these kind of periodic trends.
7:34
It's like, hey, it looks like
7:35
there's some common patterns here.
7:37
But on this one in particular we see on this axis
7:40
we have ionization energy and electron volts,
7:43
that's actually, it's literally a,
7:44
this is units of energy.
7:46
You could convert it to Joules if you like.
7:49
Then over here, we're increasing the atomic numbers.
7:51
So, we're (mumbling), we're starting with
7:53
Hydrogen then we go to Helium,
7:55
and we keep, and then we go,
7:58
go from Hydrogen to Helium to Lithium
8:00
and let me show you what's happening right over here.
8:02
So, you go to Hydrogen to Helium.
8:05
So, Helium here is very stable,
8:07
so it's very hard to remove an electron.
8:10
And then you go to Lithium.
8:12
Lithium, as we said, this is an Alkali metal.
8:14
You remove an electron, it gets to a stable state.
8:17
So, it takes very low energy to remove that electron.
8:20
And then as we go from left to right on the periodic table,
8:22
as we go from Alkali Metal to Noble Gases
8:26
we see that the ionization energy increases.
8:29
And there are these little dips here
8:30
which you could think about why these...
8:32
(mumbling) Or theorize why these dips are occurring,
8:35
what you see in this general trend
8:36
as we go from Alkali Metals to Noble Gases.
8:40
Alkali Metals to Noble Gases.
8:43
Alkali Metals to Noble Gases.
8:45
Now, one thing you might be saying is,
8:47
""Hey, look, you had from here to here,
8:50
""that's the same distance as here to here,
8:52
""but now we have a larger distance here.
8:53
""What's going on here?""
8:54
Well, we have to remember now we
8:55
have all of our D block elements.
8:58
So, now, once we get, once we get to the,
9:02
once we get over here we're now adding
9:05
all of the D block elements.
9:08
(mumbling) On the fourth period
9:09
and so we have those, we have those added here,
9:13
so you have D block elements, D block elements,
9:15
and then here you have you F and D block elements.
9:18
And so, you see the general trend
9:20
that your Alkali, your Alkali Metals
9:24
are very low ionization energy.
9:26
Your Noble Gases, very high ionization energy.
9:31
But as they get, as the atoms get larger and larger
9:35
the ionization energy goes lower and lower,
9:37
and sends something like Radon,
9:39
which even though it's Noble Gas
9:40
it's ionization energy because those outermost electrons
9:43
are further away from the nucleus
9:46
or they're quite far away from the nucleus,
9:48
that its ionization energy is actually,
9:52
its ionization energy is
9:54
actually less then that of Hydrogen.

0:00
As we've already talked about, as we exit the 1800s
0:03
and we get into the early 1900s and we approach World War I,
0:07
the various powers of Europe were really
0:09
on this race for empire.
0:10
It was a part of national prestige.
0:12
And it helped build national wealth.
0:15
But of the major powers, Germany and Italy
0:18
were relatively new as unified states.
0:20
The British Empire-- they had been building their empire
0:23
for hundreds of years.
0:24
The Germans, on the other hand, even
0:26
though they have a very old culture going back hundreds--
0:28
or you could argue thousands-- of years, as a unified state,
0:32
they only existed since 1871.
0:35
And that's only after the Franco-Prussian War,
0:37
which allowed the Prussians to unify all of Germany.
0:40
And the Italians only became fully unified in 1870, also due
0:45
to the Franco-Prussian War.
0:46
Because the French had to focus on the Germans,
0:49
had to focus on the Prussians, they
0:50
couldn't protect the Papal States anymore.
0:52
And so that allowed the Italians to unify it under their a rule.
0:56
So by the time we get to 1914, the beginning of World War
1:00
I, these two powers, they were also on their race for empire.
1:03
But they were only about 43 or 44 years old.
1:06
And so they hadn't been able to build
1:08
as extensive of an empire as France
1:10
and, especially, as extensive of an empire as Great Britain.
1:14
But this map right over here shows how far
1:19
their actual empires did extend.
1:22
Italy had control of Libya, Eritrea,
1:26
and parts of what's today Somalia.
1:30
And Germany had control-- it also
1:32
had holdings in Africa, possessions in Africa.
1:36
Togoland, which is modern-day Togo;
1:38
Cameroon, which makes up-- modern-day Cameroon
1:42
is part of German Southwest Africa.
1:45
That's now known as Namibia.
1:46
German East Africa, which is now Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi.
1:51
And Germany also had holdings in the Pacific and even in China.
1:55
These are the Pacific Islands that Germany had possession of.
1:59
It had German New Guinea.
2:00
And it even had control of the town of Tsingtao.
2:05
And that actually is culturally interesting for those
2:08
of you watching this video in 2013.
2:11
Tsingtao is now a very popular Chinese brand of beer.
2:15
One of the more-- I think it's the number
2:17
two in the market Chinese beer.
2:20
And it's associated with China.
2:22
But it was actually started by German settlers in Tsingtao
2:26
in 1903.
2:28
So actually its roots are with the Germans,
2:30
who obviously have a long tradition of producing beers.
2:34
And so Tsingtao-- you could argue it's a Chinese beer.
2:36
It's produced in China.

0:00
- [Voiceover] Alright, this problem is a classic,
0:01
you're gonna see this in basically
0:03
every single physics text book.
0:05
And the problem is this, if you've got two masses
0:07
tied together by a rope, and that rope passes over a pulley,
0:10
what's the acceleration of the masses?
0:13
In other words, what's the acceleration of the 3 kg mass?
0:18
And then what's the acceleration of the 5 kg mass?
0:21
And if you're wondering what the heck is a pulley?
0:26
The pulley is this part right here.
0:28
This right here is the pulley.
0:30
So what a pulley does, a pulley is a little piece of plastic
0:33
or metal that can rotate.
0:35
And it's usually got a groove in it so that a string
0:38
or a rope can pass over it.
0:40
What it does, is it rotates freely so that you can turn
0:44
what's a horizontal tension on one side,
0:46
into a vertical tension on the other.
0:48
Or vice versa.
0:49
It turns vertical forces into horizontal forces.
0:52
It allows you to transfer a force from one direction
0:55
to another direction.
0:56
So that's what these pulleys are useful for.
0:58
And if they can spin freely, and if this pulley
1:01
has basically no mass, if there's no resistance
1:03
to motion at all, then this tension on this side
1:07
is gonna be equal to the tension on this side.
1:10
This vertical tension gets transferred fully undiluted,
1:14
into a horizontal tension and these tension values
1:17
will just be the same if this pulley can spin freely.
1:20
And if its mass is really small so that
1:22
there's no inertial reason why it doesn't wanna spin.
1:26
So that's the problem.
1:28
Let's say you wanted to figure this out.
1:30
What is the acceleration of the 3 kg mass
1:33
with the acceleration of the 5 kg mass?
1:36
Now, I've gotta warn you, there's an easy way to do this,
1:38
and a hard way to do this.
1:40
Now, I'm gonna show you the hard way first.
1:43
Sorry, no one ever wants to hear that.
1:46
But, the reason is that, the easy way won't make any sense
1:50
unless I show you the hard way first.
1:51
It won't make any sense why the easy way works unless
1:54
I show you the hard way.
1:56
And for two, the hard way isn't really all that hard.
1:59
So I'm calling it the hard way,
2:00
but it's not really that bad.
2:01
And for three, sometimes teachers and professors just wanna
2:04
see you do it the hard way, so you should know how
2:05
to do this.
2:07
So what do we do?
2:08
We wanna find acceleration, well you know how
2:09
to find acceleration.
2:11
We're gonna use Newton's second law.
2:13
So we'll say that the acceleration in a given direction
2:15
is gonna equal the net force in that direction,
2:18
divided by the mass.
2:19
Now what do we do?
2:20
What mass are we gonna choose?
2:21
We've got a couple masses here.
2:23
One thing we could do, let's just pick the 5 kg mass.
2:26
Just pick one of them.
2:27
So I'm gonna say that the acceleration of the 5 kg mass
2:30
is the net force on the 5 kg mass, divided by the mass
2:34
of the 5 kg mass.
2:36
And remember, we should always pick a direction as well.
2:38
So do we wanna pick the vertical direction
2:40
or the horizontal direction?
2:42
Well, since this box is gonna be accelerating horizontally,
2:44
and that's what we're interested in, I'm gonna put one more
2:47
sub-script up here, X, to let us know we're picking
2:49
the horizontal direction.
2:52
So I can fill this out now, I can plug stuff in.
2:54
The acceleration of the 5 kg mass in the X direction
2:58
is gonna be equal to.
3:00
Alright what forces do we have to figure out what goes
3:02
up here?
3:03
You always draw a force diagram.
3:06
So what forces do I have on the 5 kg mass?
3:08
I'm gonna have a force of gravity, I'll draw
3:10
that straight down.
3:11
FG, and there's gonna be an equal force,
3:14
normal force upward.
3:16
So this normal force up should be equal to the force
3:19
of gravity and magnitude because this box is probably not
3:23
gonna be accelerating vertically.
3:24
There's no real reason why it should be
3:26
if this table is rigid.
3:28
And there's one more force on this box.
3:30
There's a force to the right.
3:31
That's gonna be the force of tension.
3:34
And if there's no friction on this table,
3:36
then I have no leftward forces here.
3:38
I'm ignoring air resistance since
3:39
we usually ignore air resistance.
3:42
So that's is, the only horizontal force
3:43
I've got is T, tension.
3:45
And I divide by the mass of the 5 kg box, which is 5 kg.
3:50
But we got a problem.
3:51
Look it, we don't know the acceleration of the 5 kg mass,
3:54
and we don't know the tension.
3:56
I can't solve this.
3:58
Normally what you do in this case, is you go to
3:59
the vertical direction, the other direction in other words.
4:02
But that's not gonna help me either.
4:04
That's just gonna tell me that the normal force is gonna
4:06
be equal to the force of gravity.
4:08
And we kind of already knew that.
4:09
So that doesn't help.
4:10
So what do we do?
4:12
Well, you might note, this is only the equation for
4:14
the 5 kg mass.
4:16
And so now I have to do this for the 3 kg mass.
4:18
So let's come over here, let's say that the acceleration
4:21
of the 3 kg mass is gonna be equal to the net force
4:25
on the 3 kg mass, divided by the mass of the 3 kg mass.
4:30
And again, which direction should we pick?
4:33
Well this acceleration over here is gonna be vertical.
4:35
So let's solve this for the vertical direction.
4:37
I'm gonna add one more sub-script, Y, to remind myself.
4:40
And you should do this too so you remember which direction
4:43
you're picking.
4:44
So what forces do I plug in here?
4:46
You figure that out with a force diagram.
4:48
I'm gonna have a force of gravity on this 3 kg mass,
4:52
and then I'm gonna have the same size of friction,
4:55
or sorry, the same as tension, that I had over here.
4:57
So the tension on this side of the rope, it's gonna
4:59
be the same as the tension on this side.
5:01
Assuming this pulley offers no resistance either by its mass
5:05
or friction.
5:06
So assuming that its mass is negligible, there's basically
5:09
no friction, then I'm gonna have a tension.
5:11
That tension is gonna be the same size.
5:14
So I'll draw that coming upward.
5:16
But it's not gonna be as big as the force of gravity is
5:19
on this 3 kg mass.
5:21
I've got the force of gravity here.
5:23
This tension is gonna be smaller, and the reason is,
5:26
this 3 kg mass is accelerating downwards.
5:28
So these forces can't be balanced.
5:30
The upward force of tension has gotta be smaller
5:33
than the force of gravity on this 3 kg mass.
5:36
But this tension here should be the same
5:37
as this tension here.
5:39
So I'll plug those in.
5:40
So let's plug this in.
5:41
A of the 3 kg mass, in the Y direction is gonna be equal to,
5:46
I've got two vertical forces.
5:48
I've got tension up, so I'll make that positive,
5:50
'cause we usually treat up as positive.
5:52
I've got gravity down, and so I'm gonna have negative,
5:55
'cause it's downward force of 3 kg times the acceleration
6:01
on Earth, is 9.8 meters per second squared.
6:07
Now what do we do?
6:07
We divide by 3 kg, 'cause that's the mass.
6:10
But I've still got a problem.
6:11
I don't know this acceleration or this tension.
6:14
So what do I do?
6:16
You might notice, if you're clever you'll say wait,
6:18
I've got my unknown on this side is acceleration
6:21
and tension.
6:22
My unknown on this side is acceleration and tension.
6:24
It seems like I've got two equations, two unknowns,
6:27
maybe we should combine them.
6:28
And that's exactly how you do these.
6:30
So I've got tension in both of these equations.
6:34
Let me solve for tension over here,
6:35
where it's kind of simple.
6:37
And I'll just get the tension equals 5 kg,
6:41
times the acceleration of the 5 kg mass in the X direction.
6:47
So now I know what tension is.
6:48
Tension is equal to this.
6:49
And that tension over on this side is the same as
6:51
the tension on this side.
6:53
So I can take this and I can plug it in for
6:56
this tension right here.
6:57
And let's see what we get.
6:59
We get that the acceleration of the 3 kg mass vertically,
7:02
is gonna equal, alright, I'm gonna have a big mess on top,
7:06
what am I gonna get?
7:07
I'm gonna get, so T is the same as 5AX.
7:11
So I'll plug in 5 kg times the acceleration
7:16
of the 5 kg mass in the X direction.
7:19
And then I get all of this stuff over here.
7:21
So I'll get the rest of this right here.
7:27
I'll just bring that down right there.
7:29
Alright, now what do I have?
7:31
I've got 3 kg on the bottom still, so I have to put
7:33
that here.
7:35
Are we any better off?
7:36
Yeah, we're better, because now my only unknowns
7:38
are acceleration.
7:39
But these are not the same acceleration.
7:41
Look, this acceleration here is the acceleration of
7:43
the 3 kg mass, vertically.
7:46
This acceleration here is the acceleration
7:48
of the 5kg mass horizontally.
7:51
Now here's where I'm gonna have to make an argument,
7:53
and some people don't like this.
7:55
But, it's crucial to figuring out this problem.
7:58
And the key idea is this, if this 3 kg mass moves down,
8:03
let's say one meter, let's say it moves downward one meter.
8:06
Well then this 5 kg mass had better move forward one meter.
8:10
Because if it doesn't, then it didn't provide the one meter
8:14
of rope that this 3 kg mass needed to go downward.
8:17
Which means either the rope broke, or the rope stretched.
8:21
And we're gonna assume that our rope does not break
8:23
or stretch.
8:25
That's kind of a lie.
8:25
All ropes are gonna stretch a little bit under tension.
8:29
We're gonna assume that stretch is negligible.
8:31
So the argument is that if this 3 kg mass moves downward
8:35
a certain amount, this 5 kg mass has to move forward
8:38
by that same amount in order to feed that amount of rope
8:41
for this 3 kg mass to go downward by that amount.
8:44
Otherwise, think about it.
8:45
If this 5 kg mass just sat here and the 3 kg moved,
8:49
or the 3 kg moved farther than the 5 kg mass,
8:53
then this rope is stretching or breaking.
8:54
So if you believe that, if you don't believe it,
8:56
pause it and think about it.
8:57
'Cause you've gotta convince yourself of that.
8:59
If you believe that then you can also convince yourself
9:01
that, well if the 3 kg mass was moving downward
9:04
at a certain speed, let's say two meters per second.
9:07
Then the 5 kg mass had better also be moving forward
9:10
two meters per second because otherwise it wouldn't
9:13
be feeding rope at a rate that this 3 kg needs
9:16
to move downward at that rate.
9:18
And finally, if you believe all that,
9:20
it's not too much harder to convince yourself that
9:22
this 3 kg mass, no matter what
9:25
its acceleration downward must be,
9:27
this 5 kg mass had better have the same magnitude
9:30
of acceleration forward so that it's again,
9:34
feeding the rope so this rope doesn't break,
9:36
or snap, or stretch.
9:38
'Cause we're gonna assume the rope doesn't do that.
9:40
So what I'm saying is that the acceleration of the 3 kg mass
9:44
in the Y direction had better equal the magnitude.
9:48
So these magnitudes have to be the same.
9:50
The sign doesn't have to be the same.
9:53
So this 3 kg mass has a negative acceleration
9:56
just 'cause it points down, and we're assuming up
9:58
is positive, down is negative.
10:00
This 5 kg mass has a positive acceleration 'cause
10:03
it's pointing to the right, and we're assuming rightward
10:05
is the positive horizontal direction.
10:08
So, they can have different signs, but the magnitudes
10:11
had better be the same so that your feeding this rope at
10:13
a rate that the other one needs in order to move.
10:16
And so we can say that the magnitudes are the same.
10:18
In this case, since one is negative of the other,
10:21
I can say that the acceleration of the 3 kg mass
10:23
vertically downward is gonna be equal to, let's say negative
10:28
of the acceleration of the 5 kg mass in the X direction.
10:33
I could have written it the other way.
10:34
I could have wrote that A of the 5 kg mass
10:37
in the X direction is a negative A of the 3 kg mass
10:40
in the Y direction.
10:41
They're just different by a negative sign is all
10:43
that's important here.
10:44
Okay, so this is the link we need.
10:46
This is it.
10:47
So this allows us to put this final equation here
10:49
in terms of only one variable.
10:51
'Cause I know I've got A3Y on this left hand side.
10:54
I know A3Y should always be -A5X.
10:57
If I take this and just plug it in for A3Y right here,
11:02
I'm gonna get -A5X =, well all of this stuff, so I'll
11:10
just copy this.
11:11
Save some time.
11:12
Copy, paste.
11:14
Just equals all of that.
11:15
All I did was plug in what I know A3Y has to be equal to.
11:19
'Cause now look, I've got one equation with one unknown.
11:22
I just need to solve for what A5X is.
11:24
It's on both sides.
11:25
So I'll need to combine these and then isolate
11:28
it on one side.
11:29
So there's gonna be a little bit of algebra here.
11:31
Let's just take this, let's give ourselves some room.
11:35
Move this up just a little bit.
11:36
Okay, so what do we do?
11:38
We're gonna solve for A5X.
11:39
Let me just get rid of this denominator.
11:41
Let me multiply both sides by 3 kg.
11:45
So I'm gonna get -3kg x A5 in the X direction,
11:52
if I multiply both sides by 3 kg,
11:55
and then I get 5 kg x A5 in the X direction.
12:01
And I've still got minus, alright 3 x 9.8 is 29.4 Newtons.
12:08
So we'll just turn this into what it's supposed to be.
12:10
29.4 Newtons.
12:12
So let's combine our A terms now.
12:14
Let's move this negative 3A to the right hand side
12:17
by adding it to both sides.
12:19
And let's add this 29.4 to both sides.
12:22
So I'll get the 29.4 Newtons over here with a positive,
12:26
if I add it to both sides.
12:27
And it'll disappear on the right hand side.
12:29
And then I'll add this term to both sides.
12:31
Add a positive 3 kg x A to both sides.
12:36
It'll disappear on the left, and I'll get 5 kg x A5
12:41
in the X direction + 3 kg x A5 in the X direction.
12:47
Now we're close, look on the right hand side I can combine
12:50
these terms because 5A plus 3A is the same thing as 8A.
12:55
So 29.4 Newtons, .4 = 8 kg x, I'll put the parenthesis here,
13:05
times five.
13:06
85 in the X direction.
13:08
Now I can divide both sides by eight and usually we put
13:12
the thing we're solving for on the left, so I'm just gonna
13:14
put that over here.
13:15
I'll get 29.4 Newtons over 8 kg is equal to
13:22
the acceleration of mass five.
13:24
The 5 kg mass in the X direction.
13:27
And if we calculate that,
13:29
I'll just put that into my calculator.
13:30
29.4 divided by eight.
13:34
I get 3.675.
13:36
So we'll just round.
13:37
We'll just say that's 3.68.
13:40
3.6 whoops, 3.68 and it's positive, that's good.
13:45
We should get a positive because the 5 kg mass has
13:49
a positive acceleration.
13:50
So we get positive 3.68 meters per second squared.
13:55
But that's just of the 5 kg mass.
13:57
How do we get the acceleration of the 3 kg mass?
14:00
Well that's easy.
14:00
It's gotta have the same magnitude of the 5 kg mass.
14:04
All I have to do is take this number now.
14:06
I know what A5X is.
14:08
So if I just plug that in right here,
14:10
well then I know that A3Y is just gonna be equal
14:15
to -3.68 meters per second squared.
14:22
And I'm done, I did it.
14:23
We figured out the acceleration of the 3 kg mass,
14:27
it's negative.
14:28
No surprise, 'cause it's accelerating downward.
14:30
We figured out the acceleration of the 5 kg mass,
14:33
it's positive, not a surprise.
14:34
It was accelerating to the right.
14:36
The way we did it, recapping really quick,
14:38
we did Newton's second law for the 5 kg mass.
14:41
That didn't let us solve.
14:43
We did Newton's second law for the 3 kg mass,
14:46
that didn't let us solve.
14:47
In fact it got really bleak, because it seemed like we
14:49
had three unknowns and only two equations,
14:53
but the link that allowed us to make it so that we only
14:56
had one equation with one unknown, is that we plugged
14:59
one equation to the other first.
15:01
We had to then write the accelerations in terms
15:03
of each other, that's because these accelerations
15:07
are not independent.
15:08
The accelerations have to have the same magnitude.
15:10
And in this case one had the opposite sign.
15:13
So when we plugged that in, we have one equation
15:15
with one unknown, we solve, we get the amount
15:18
of acceleration.
15:19
So that's the hard way to do these problems.
15:21
So in the next video I'll show you the easy way
15:24
to do these problems.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,QKXeZFwFPS0,
teded_A brief history of plural word...s - John McWhorter - 04:27_3,Have you noticed evolution in the English language? Explain your observations (including reasons you think they happened).,open-ended,"There are a lot of ways
this marvelous language of ours,
English, doesn't make sense.
For example, most of the time
when we talk about more
than one of something,
we put an S on the end.
One cat, two cats.
But then, there's that handful of words
where things work differently.
Alone you have a man;
if he has company, then you've got men,
or probably better for him, women too.
Although if there were only one of them,
it would be a woman.
Or if there's more than one goose,
they're geese,
but why not lots of mooses, meese?
Or if you have two feet,
then why don't you read two beek
instead of books.
The fact is that if you
were speaking English
before about a thousand years ago,
beek is exactly what you would have said
for more than one book.
If Modern English is strange,
Old English needed therapy.
Believe it or not,
English used to be an even harder language
to learn than it is today.
Twenty-five hundred years ago,
English and German were the same language.
They drifted apart slowly,
little by little becoming
more and more different.
That meant that in early English,
just like in German,
inanimate objects had gender.
A fork, gafol, was a woman;
a spoon, laefel, was a man;
and the table they were on, bord,
was neither, also called neuter.
Go figure!
Being able to use words
meant not just knowing their meaning
but what gender they were, too.
And while today there
are only about a dozen plurals
that don't make sense,
like men
and geese,
in Old English, it was perfectly normal
for countless plurals to be like that.
You think it's odd that more
than one goose is geese?
Well, imagine if more than one goat
was a bunch of gat,
or if more than one oak tree
was a field of ack.
To be able to talk about any of these,
you just had to know the exact
word for their plural
rather than just adding
the handy S on the end.
And it wasn't always
an S at the end either.
In merry Old English,
they could add other sounds to the end.
Just like more than one child is children,
more than one lamb was lambru,
you fried up your eggru,
and people talked not about breads,
but breadru.
Sometimes it was like sheep is today -
where, to make a plural,
you don't do anything.
One sheep,
two sheep.
In Old English, one house,
two house.
And just like today, we have
oxen instead of oxes.
Old English people had
toungen instead of tongues,
namen instead of names,
and if things stayed the way they were,
today we would have eyen instead of eyes.
So, why didn't things
stay the way they were?
In a word, Vikings.
In the 8th century, Scandinavian marauders
started taking over much of England.
They didn't speak English,
they spoke Norse.
Plus, they were grown-ups,
and grown-ups aren't as good
at learning languages as children.
After the age of roughly 15,
it's almost impossible
to learn a new language
without an accent
and without slipping up here and there
as we all know from what language
classes are like.
The Vikings were no different,
so they had a way of smoothing away
the harder parts of how English worked.
Part of that was those crazy plurals.
Imagine running up against a language
with eggru
and gat
on the one hand,
and then with other words,
all you have to do is add 's'
and get days
and stones.
Wouldn't it make things easier
to just use the 's' for everything?
That's how the Vikings felt too.
And there were so many of them,
and they married so
many of the English women,
that pretty soon, if you
grew up in England,
you heard streamlined English
as much as the real kind.
After a while nobody remembered
the real kind any more.
Nobody remembered that once you said doora
instead of doors
and handa instead of hands.
Plurals made a lot more sense now,
except for a few hold-outs like children
and teeth
that get used so much
that it was hard to break the habit.
The lesson is
that English makes a lot
more sense than you think.
Thank the ancestors of people
in Copenhagen and Oslo for the fact
that today we don't ask
for a handful of pea-night
instead of peanuts.
Although, wouldn't it be fun,
if for just a week or two,
we could?",TED-Ed,Social Studies,A brief history of plural word...s - John McWhorter - 04:27,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwJHuEa9Jc,data/teded/crawled_data/videos/A brief history of plural word...s - John McWhorter - 04:27,,

0:00
In the last video, we talk about how seasons on Earth
0:03
are not caused by how close Earth
0:06
is to the sun in its orbit.
0:08
And we also hint at the fact that it's actually
0:10
caused by the tilt of the earth.
0:12
And so in this video, I want to show you
0:14
how the tilt of the earth causes the seasons to happen.
0:19
So let's draw-- so I'm going to try
0:21
to draw as many diagrams as possible here.
0:23
Because at least for my brain they
0:25
help me visualize what's actually going on.
0:27
So we could imagine a top view first.
0:30
So let's have a top view.
0:32
That is the sun right over there.
0:35
And let me draw the earth's orbit.
0:37
So Earth's orbit maybe looks something like that.
0:41
Let me draw it almost, it is almost circular.
0:43
So I'll draw it as something that's
0:45
pretty close to a circle right over here.
0:47
And I'm going to draw Earth at different points in its orbit.
0:50
And I'm going to try to depict the tilt
0:53
of its rotational axis.
0:55
And obviously, this is not drawn anywhere near close to scale.
0:58
Earth is much further away from the sun,
1:00
and much, much smaller than the sun as well.
1:04
So I'll draw the earth at that point.
1:05
And at this point, the earth will
1:07
be tilted away from the sun.
1:09
So Earth's tilt does not change if you
1:12
think about the direction, or at least
1:13
over the course of a year, if we think
1:15
about relatively small periods of time.
1:17
It does not change relative to the direction
1:19
that it's pointing at in the universe.
1:22
And we'll talk about that in a second.
1:24
So let's say right over here we are pointed away from the sun.
1:28
So we're up and out of this page.
1:32
So if I wanted to put some perspective on an arrow
1:35
it would be up and-- actually it would be more like
1:39
up and out of this page.
1:42
So that's the direction.
1:43
If you were to come straight out of the North Pole.
1:44
And if you were to go straight out of the South Pole
1:46
you'd go below that circle right over there.
1:49
And if I wanted to draw the same position,
1:50
but if we're looking sideways along the plane,
1:53
the orbital plane, or the plane of Earth's orbit.
1:58
So if we're looking at it from that direction.
2:00
So let me do it this way.
2:02
If we're looking at directly sideways,
2:06
this is the sun right over here, and this
2:12
is Earth at that position.
2:18
This is Earth right over there.
2:20
If I were to draw an arrow pointing straight out
2:24
of the North Pole it would look something like this.
2:31
So this arrow and this arrow they
2:32
are both popping straight out of the North Pole.
2:35
And so when we talk about the tilt of the earth,
2:37
we're talking about the tilt of its orbital axis,
2:40
kind of this pole that could go straight between the South
2:43
Pole and the North Pole.
2:44
The angle between that and a pole that would actually
2:46
be at a 90-degree angle, or perpendicular,
2:49
to the plane of its orbit.
2:51
And so compared to if it was just straight up and down,
2:55
relative to the plane of the orbit.
2:57
So this right here is the angle of Earth's tilt.
3:00
Let me draw that a little bit bigger
3:02
just so it becomes a little bit clearer.
3:04
So if this is the plane of the orbit,
3:07
we're looking sideways along the plane of the orbit.
3:10
And this is Earth right over here.
3:15
My best attempt to draw a circle.
3:17
That is Earth.
3:19
Earth does not rotate.
3:20
Its axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the plane
3:24
of the orbit.
3:25
So this is how Earth would orbit.
3:27
This is how Earth would rotate if it was.
3:30
Earth rotates, Earth's rotational axis
3:33
is at an angle to that vertical relative
3:36
to the plane of its orbit, I guess you could say it.
3:39
It rotates at an angle like this.
3:42
So this would be the North Pole.
3:43
That is the South Pole.
3:47
And so it rotates like this.
3:52
And that angle relative to being vertical with respect
3:58
to the orbital plane, this angle right here for Earth
4:02
right now is 23.4 degrees.
4:14
And if we're talking about relatively short periods
4:17
of time, like our lifespans, that is constant.
4:20
But it is actually changing over long periods of time.
4:24
That is changing between-- and these are rough numbers--
4:27
it is changing between 22.1 degrees and 24.5 degrees,
4:36
if my sources are correct.
4:38
But that gives a rough estimate of what it's changing between.
4:41
But I want to make it clear, this
4:42
is not happening overnight.
4:44
The period to go from roughly a 22-degree angle to a 24
4:47
and 1/2-degree angle and back to a 22-degree angle is 41,000
4:52
years.
4:58
And this long-term change in the tilt, this
5:01
might play into some of the long-term climactic change.
5:04
Maybe it might contribute, on some level,
5:07
to some of the ice ages that have formed over Earth's past.
5:11
But for the sake of thinking about our annual seasons
5:13
you don't have to worry too much,
5:14
or you don't have to worry at all really
5:16
about this variation.
5:17
You really just have to know that it is tilted.
5:19
And right now it is tilted at an angle of 23.4 degrees.
5:24
Now you might say OK, I understand what the tilt is.
5:27
But how does that change the seasons
5:29
in either the Northern or that Southern Hemisphere?
5:33
And to do that, I'm going to imagine the earth when
5:36
the Northern Hemisphere is most tilted away from the sun,
5:40
and when it is most tilted towards the sun.
5:42
So remember this tilt, the direction this arrow points
5:45
into relative to the rest of the universe,
5:47
if we assume that this tilt is at 23.4%,
5:50
it's not changing throughout the year.
5:52
But depending on where it is in the orbit
5:54
it's either going to be tilting away from the sun,
5:56
as it is in this example right over here.
5:58
Or it will be tilting towards the sun.
6:03
I'll do the towards the sun in this magenta color,
6:06
or it would be tilting towards the sun.
6:08
So six months later when the earth is over here,
6:10
it's going to, relative to the rest of the universe,
6:14
it will be tilted in that same direction, up out of this page
6:21
and to the right.
6:26
Just like it was over here.
6:27
But now that it's on the other side of the sun that
6:30
makes it tilt a little bit more towards the sun.
6:32
If I were to draw it right over here,
6:36
it is now tilted towards the sun.
6:42
And what I want to think about is how much sunlight
6:47
will different parts of the planet receive.
6:49
And I'll focus on the Northern Hemisphere.
6:51
But you can make a similar argument
6:53
for the Southern Hemisphere.
6:54
I want to think about how much sunlight they receive when it's
6:57
tilted away or tilted towards the sun.
7:00
And so let's think about those two situations.
7:03
So first of all, let's think about this situation
7:05
here where we are tilted away from the sun.
7:07
So let me zoom in a little bit.
7:10
So this is the situation, where we're tilted away from the sun.
7:15
So if this is the vertical, so let me draw it.
7:18
I could actually just use this diagram.
7:20
But let me make it.
7:21
So we're tilted away from the sun like this.
7:24
I'm going to do this in a different color.
7:26
So if we have an arrow coming straight out of the North Pole
7:29
it would look like this.
7:33
And we are rotating around like that.
7:37
So we're out of the page on the left-hand side,
7:40
and then into the page on the right-hand side.
7:42
And so we're rotating towards the east, constantly.
7:45
So this arrow is in the direction of the east.
7:50
So when we're at this point in Earth's orbit, and actually
7:52
let me copy and paste this.
7:54
And I'm going to use the same exact diagram
7:56
for the different seasons.
7:58
So let me copy.
8:01
And then let me paste this exact diagram.
8:03
I'll do it over here for two different points.
8:09
So when we are here in Earth's orbit
8:13
where is the sunlight coming from?
8:14
Well, it's going to be coming from the left, at least the way
8:17
I've drawn the diagram right over here.
8:19
So the sunlight is coming from the left in this situation.
8:29
And so if you think about it, what part of the earth
8:33
is being lit by sunlight?
8:34
Or what part of the earth is in daylight,
8:36
the way I've drawn it right over here?
8:38
Well, the part that is facing the sun.
8:41
So all of this right over here is going to be in daylight.
8:46
As we rotate whatever part of the surface of the earth
8:49
enters into this yellow part right over here
8:51
will be in daylight.
8:53
But let's think about what's happening
8:55
at different parts of the earth.
8:55
So let me draw the equator, which separates our Northern
8:58
and Southern Hemispheres.
8:59
So this is the equator.
9:05
And then let me go into the Northern Hemisphere.
9:07
And I want to show you why when the North Pole is pointed away
9:10
from the sun why this is our winter.
9:13
So when we're pointed away from the sun--
9:15
Well, if we go to the Arctic Circle-- so let
9:17
me go right over here.
9:20
Let me go to some point in the Arctic Circle.
9:23
As it goes, as the earth rotates every 24 hours,
9:27
this point on the globe will just rotate around just
9:31
like that.
9:32
It will just keep rotating around just like that.
9:34
And so my question is, that point in the Arctic
9:36
Circle, as it rotates will it ever see sunlight?
9:39
Well, no, it will never see sunlight.
9:41
Because the North Pole is tilted away from the sun.
9:45
So what I'm drawing, what I'm shading here in purple,
9:49
that part of the earth, when it's completely tilted away,
9:52
will never see sunlight.
9:54
Or at least it won't see sunlight
9:55
while it's tilted away, while it's in this position,
9:58
or in this position in the orbit.
10:01
I won't say never, because once it becomes summer
10:03
they will be able to see it.
10:04
So no sunlight, no day, I guess you could say, no daylight.
10:10
If you go to slightly more southern latitudes,
10:14
so let's say you go over here.
10:15
So maybe that's the latitude of something like, I don't know,
10:18
New York or San Francisco or something like that.
10:21
Let's think about what it would see as the earth rotates
10:23
every 24 hours.
10:25
So this would be daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight,
10:28
then nighttime, nighttime, nighttime, nighttime,
10:30
nighttime.
10:31
This is now going behind the globe nighttime, nighttime,
10:33
nighttime, nighttime, nighttime, daylight, daylight, daylight,
10:36
daylight.
10:37
So if you just compare this.
10:38
So let me do the daylight in orange.
10:43
And then nighttime I will do in this bluish purplish color.
10:48
So night time over here.
10:50
So if you go to really northern latitudes,
10:52
like the Arctic Circle, they don't get any daylight
10:55
when we are tilted away from the earth.
10:57
And if we go to slightly still northern latitudes,
11:01
but not as north as the Arctic Circle, it does get daylight.
11:04
But it gets a lot less daylight.
11:05
It spends a lot less time in the daylight
11:08
than in the night time.
11:09
So notice if you say that this circumference represents
11:14
the positions over 24 hours, it spends much less time
11:17
in the daylight than it does in the nighttime.
11:24
So because, while the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away
11:28
from the earth, the latitudes in the northern hemisphere
11:32
are getting less daylight.
11:37
They are also getting less energy from the sun.
11:40
And so that's what leads to winter,
11:42
or just being generally colder.
11:45
And to see what happens in the summer
11:46
let's just go the other side.
11:48
So now we're going to the other side of our orbit
11:51
around the sun.
11:51
This is going to be six months later.
11:53
And notice the actual direction, relative to the rest
11:55
of the universe, has not changed.
11:57
We're still pointed in that same direction.
11:59
We still have a 23.4 degree tilt relative to, I guess,
12:04
being straight up and down.
12:06
But now once we're over here the light from the sun
12:08
is going to be coming from the right.
12:15
Just like that.
12:16
And now, if on this diagram at least,
12:18
this is the side of the earth that
12:21
is going to be getting the sunlight.
12:24
And let me draw the equator again,
12:27
or my best attempt to draw the equator.
12:29
I'll draw the equator in that same color
12:31
actually, in that green color.
12:34
So this separates the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere.
12:38
And now let's think about the Arctic Circle.
12:41
So let's say I'm sitting here in the Arctic Circle.
12:43
As the day goes on, as 24 hours go around,
12:46
I'll keep rotating around here.
12:47
But notice the whole time I am inside of the sun.
12:51
I'm getting no nighttime.
12:55
There is no night in the Arctic Circle
12:58
while we are tilted towards the sun.
13:00
And if we still do that fairly northern latitude,
13:03
but not as far as the Arctic Circle,
13:05
maybe in San Francisco or New York, or something like that .
13:09
If we go to that latitude, notice how much time
13:12
we spend in the sun.
13:13
So maybe we just enter.
13:15
So this is right at sunrise.
13:18
And then as the day goes on we're
13:21
in sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight,
13:23
sunlight, sunlight.
13:25
Then we hit sunset.
13:27
Then we hit nighttime, nighttime,
13:29
then we hit nighttime, and then we get sunrise again.
13:32
And so when you look at the amount of time
13:34
that something in the Northern Hemisphere
13:36
spends in the daylight versus sunlight,
13:38
you'll see it spends a lot more time in the daylight when
13:41
the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun.
13:45
So this is more day, less night.
13:53
So it is getting more energy from the sun.
13:56
So when it is tilted towards the sun
13:57
it is getting more energy from the sun.
14:00
So things will generally be warmer.
14:02
And so you are now talking about summer
14:08
in the Northern Hemisphere.
14:09
And the arguments for the Southern Hemisphere
14:11
are identical.
14:12
You could even play it right over here.
14:14
When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun,
14:16
then the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun.
14:19
And so for example, the South Pole
14:21
will have all daylight and no nighttime.
14:23
And southern latitudes will have more daylight than nighttime.
14:26
And so the south will have summer.
14:28
So this is summer in the south, in the Southern Hemisphere.
14:31
And it's winter in the north.
14:32
And then down here the Southern Hemisphere
14:34
is pointed away from the sun.
14:36
So this is winter in the Southern Hemisphere.
14:40
And you might be saying, hey Sal, what about you haven't
14:43
talked a lot about spring and fall.
14:45
Well let's think about it.
14:46
Well, if we're talking about the Northern Hemisphere,
14:48
this over here, we decided, was winter
14:51
in the Northern Hemisphere.
14:52
And we're going to rotate around the sun.
14:55
And at some point, we're going to get over here.
14:58
And then because of this tilt we aren't
15:02
pointed away or towards the sun.
15:04
We're kind of pointed I guess sideways
15:07
relative to the direction of the sun.
15:09
But this doesn't favor one hemisphere over the other.
15:13
So when we're over here in-- and this will actually
15:16
be the spring now- when we're in the spring,
15:21
both hemispheres are getting the equal amount of daylight
15:24
and sunlight, or for a given latitude
15:26
above or below the equator, they're
15:28
getting the same amount.
15:29
And the same thing is true over here
15:31
when we get to-- so this is spring.
15:33
This is the summer in the Northern Hemisphere.
15:35
Now this will be the fall in the Northern Hemisphere.
15:39
And once again, we're tilted in this direction.
15:42
And so the Northern Hemisphere isn't
15:44
tilted away or towards the sun.
15:48
And so both hemispheres are going
15:50
to get the same amount of radiation from the sun.
15:53
So you really see the extremes in the winters and the summers.
15:56
Now one thing I do want to make clear,
15:58
and I started off with just the length of day and nighttime.
16:01
Because frankly, that's maybe a little bit, or at least
16:03
in my brain, a little bit easier to visualize.
16:05
But that by itself does not account
16:07
for all of the difference between summer and winter.
16:10
Another cause, and actually this is probably the biggest cause,
16:14
is if you think about the total amount of sun.
16:16
So let's talk about the Northern Hemisphere winter.
16:19
And let's say there's a certain amount of sunlight
16:21
that is reaching the earth.
16:26
So this is the total amount of sunlight
16:28
that's reaching the earth at any point in time.
16:32
You see that much more of that is hitting the Southern
16:35
Hemisphere than the Northern Hemisphere here.
16:37
All of these, if you imagine it, all
16:40
of these rays right over here are
16:42
hitting the Southern Hemisphere.
16:45
So a majority of the rays are hitting the Southern
16:47
Hemisphere.
16:48
And much fewer are hitting the Northern Hemisphere.
16:50
So actually a smaller amount of the radiation period,
16:53
at even a given period in time, not even talking
16:55
about the amount of time you are facing the sun.
16:58
But at any given moment in time more energy
17:01
is hitting the Southern Hemisphere than the Northern.
17:04
And the opposite is true when the tilt is then
17:08
towards the sun.
17:09
And now a disproportionate amount of the sun's energy
17:16
is hitting the Northern Hemisphere.
17:19
So if you draw a bunch of, if you just
17:21
think that this is all of the energy from the sun, most
17:24
of it, all of these rays up here,
17:25
are hitting the Northern Hemisphere.
17:27
And only these down here are hitting the Southern
17:31
Hemisphere.
17:31
And on top of that, what makes it even more extreme
17:34
is that the actual angle, and of course, this is to some degree
17:37
is due to the fact that where the angle of the sun
17:40
relative to the horizon, or where you are on Earth.
17:44
But even more than that if you are on,
17:46
let's say that this is the land, and we're
17:50
talking about the winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
17:53
So let's say you're talking about,
17:55
let's say we're up over here at this northern latitude.
18:00
And we're just looking at the sun here.
18:04
And over here, you could see even
18:06
when we are closest to the sun the sun is not directly
18:09
overhead.
18:10
When we're closest to the sun the sun
18:12
still is pretty low on the horizon.
18:14
So it may be right over here when
18:16
we're closest to the sun in the winter the sun might
18:19
be right over here.
18:21
But if you look at that same latitude in the summer
18:26
when it is closest to the sun, the sun
18:30
is more close to being directly overhead.
18:33
It still won't be directly overhead.
18:35
Because we are still at a relatively northern latitude.
18:39
But the sun is going to be much higher in the sky.
18:45
And these are all related to each other.
18:46
It's kind of connected with this idea
18:48
that more energy is hitting one hemisphere or the other.
18:52
But also, when you have a, I guess
18:55
you could say, a steeper angle from the rays
18:58
of the sun with the earth, it's actually
19:00
going to be dissipated less by the atmosphere.
19:02
And let me just make it clear how this is.
19:05
So in the summer-- so let's say that that's the land.
19:10
And let's say that-- let me draw the atmosphere in white--
19:16
so all of this area right over here, this is the atmosphere.
19:18
And obviously there's not a hard boundary for the atmosphere.
19:21
But let's just say this is the densest part of the atmosphere.
19:24
In the summer, when the sun is higher in the sky,
19:32
the rays from the sun are dissipated by less atmosphere.
19:35
So they have to get through this much atmosphere.
19:38
And they're bounced off.
19:39
And they heat some of that atmosphere.
19:41
And they're absorbed before they get to the ground.
19:44
In the winter when the sun is lower in the sky,
19:49
so maybe the sun is out here.
19:51
Let me draw it a little bit.
19:53
So when the sun is lower in the sky relative to this point,
19:57
you see that the rays of sunlight
19:59
have to travel through a lot more atmosphere.
20:04
So they get dissipated much more before they
20:07
get to this point on the planet.
20:09
So all in all it is the tilt that
20:11
is causing the changes in the season.
20:13
But it's causing it for multiple reasons.
20:16
One is when you're tilted, we'll say
20:18
when you're tilted towards the sun,
20:20
you're getting more absolute hours of daylight.
20:23
Not only are you getting more absolute hours of daylight,
20:26
but at any given moment, most or more of the sun's total rays
20:30
that are hitting the earth are hitting the Northern
20:32
Hemisphere as opposed to the Southern Hemisphere.
20:35
And the stuff that's hitting the places that have summer,
20:40
it has to go through less atmosphere.
20:42
So it gets dissipated less.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,05qDIjKevJo,

Beth: Looking into the space of this diner
0:06
through these glass windows makes me feel really aware
0:09
of the sound of my own footsteps on the sidewalk.
0:13
Steven: We're in the Art Institute of Chicago,
0:14
and we're looking at Edward Hopper's ""Nighthawks,"" from 1942,
0:18
this classic American painting that's usually seen as an expression
0:22
of wartime alienation of the notion of separation.
0:26
It really is about separation.
0:27
Look at the warm light in that diner,
0:30
and compare it to the exterior.
0:32
You get a sense of the quiet conversation
0:34
that might be taking place inside,
0:35
but we have no access to that.
0:37
In fact, there's not even a doorway to let us into this restaurant.
0:41
Beth: There's an immediate implication that we are alone.
0:43
It almost starts to feel frightening.
0:46
Steven: There's a way that the painting functions
0:48
as a kind of prison that amplifies or intensifies
0:51
not only the sense of silence, but also the way
0:54
in which light fills this space.
0:56
Look at the way in which the warm light of that interior
0:59
filters out onto the sidewalk, creating a series of shadows
1:02
and areas of light that seem to lay over each other
1:05
and create this complex set of rays on the sidewalk,
1:08
and the way in which the light hits the glass as it turns
1:11
around the corner of this building,
1:13
leading us to that sharp diagonal across the street
1:17
where that lonely cash register stands as the only recognizable object.
1:21
Beth: But, you can imagine life around it at another time of the day,
1:25
but now it's all eerily silent.
1:28
It makes us look up at those windows for some sign of life,
1:32
but we don't see anything.
1:34
Steven: We can see blinds that have been pulled down
1:36
by somebody at some point, that seem, now, completely abandoned.
1:40
We can imagine, perhaps, the inhabitant is asleep,
1:42
but there's no presence, no [unintelligible] life.
1:44
Beth: Then, we just want to know,
1:46
what are these figures doing together?
1:48
Did that couple come in together?
1:50
Did they meet here?
1:51
Why is the male figure sitting alone?
1:53
Why has he wandered into this diner so late at night?
1:56
What are they talking about?
1:58
It's all very open.
2:00
There's not a clear narrative here at all.
2:02
Steven: The only clarity is the sense of isolation,
2:04
the sense of alienation.
2:05
I find this especially interesting.
2:08
If you think about the year in which this was painted, 1942,
2:11
the height of the 2nd World War,
2:13
in some ways, the cities were emptied out.
2:15
There were a lot of people that had gone overseas.
2:17
Beth: It was a time of great fear and anxiety in America.
2:20
Steven: That's right. This was really the height
2:22
of the violence of the war.
2:23
Nobody knew which way the war was going to turn at this point.
2:26
Beth: These are subjects that preoccupied Hopper
2:28
for his entire career, images of lonliness and isolation
2:33
in the new urban spaces.
2:36
Steven: This is also a rendering
2:37
that is particularly American.
2:39
It's generalized.
2:40
We don't know precisely where we are.
2:42
Hopper lived in Greenwich Village,
2:44
and certainly the brick buildings behind us
2:46
are reminiscent of the architecture that we might find in the village,
2:49
but this is not a specific street corner.
2:51
This is not a specific cafe.
2:53
It is a kind of stripping away of everything that's nonessential,
2:57
so that we're left with a kind of idealized rendering
3:01
of these forms of this American experience.
3:04
Beth: There's a sense of that in the geometry
3:07
of the composition, the horizontal line of the counter
3:11
that the two figures in the background lean against,
3:14
those very geometric forms of the coffee urns,
3:18
the rectangular shape of that doorway.
3:20
Steven: Well, there's this conflict between these figures
3:24
going about their ordinary lives and the strict geometry
3:27
of the space that he's imposed in this imposed in this image.
3:29
I have to say that I love the fact
3:31
that those coffee urns are so specific.
3:33
You can even see the glass straws,
3:35
and see how much coffee is left in them.
3:37
There is that sign just above this cafe
3:40
that's advertising cigars for 5 cents.
3:43
There's this specific turn of the cash register
3:45
across the street, that is there are signifiers
3:49
of a kind of everyday American experience,
3:52
even as this painting has been emptied out.
3:54
He's left these few clues that really place us
3:58
in a particular place, in a particular time, in our experience.
4:02
Beth: How about the napkin holders, and the sa-
4:05
Steven: (laughs)
4:06
Beth: and the salt and pepper shakers,
4:08
and the mugs of coffee, and the glass of water?
4:11
There's a kind of love and attention to those very dinery objects here.
4:17
That's really compelling.
4:19
Steven: Absolutely.
4:20
You have those cherry-topped stools that spin.
4:23
You see the cherry of the counter.
4:25
Beth: There's a kind of specificity,
4:27
but at the same time, a generalizing that's happening.
4:30
Steven: That's right.
4:31
He's given us enough specific so that we know we've been there,
4:35
and yet, this could be anywhere.

0:00
What do I do in this video now that we have displacement
0:04
as a function of time given constant acceleration and initial velocity
0:09
I want to plot displacement velocity, final velocity, and acceleration
0:14
all those function of time,
0:17
just so we really understand what's happening
0:19
as the ball is going up and then down
0:22
So we know this is our displacement function of time,
0:26
we know what our final veloctiy is going to be,
0:29
as a function of time we talked about in our last video
0:32
the final velocity is going to be the initial velocity
0:35
plus our acceleration times change in time
0:41
right if we start we some initial velocity,
0:43
and you multiply the acceleration with time
0:46
this part tell you how much faster or slower you are going to go
0:49
between initial velocity or that will be your I guess current velocity
0:54
the final velocity at that point in time
0:57
and of course the acceleration we know
1:00
our acceleration is pretty straigth forward
1:03
the acceleration due to gravity is just gonna be negative 9.8 m/s*s
1:09
once again the negative being the convention that
1:11
it is in the downward direction
1:13
our initial velocity is going to be upper direction 19.6m/s
1:19
so let's plot this out a little bit, let's plot these out
1:22
so the first graph I wanna do will be my displacement verses time
1:31
so this axis right over here is going to be time
1:36
and let me just call it change in time, actually I'll just call it time
1:41
let's just call it time and then this axis right over here
1:46
I will call it displacement and we leave some marker here
1:50
so let's say that this is 5m, 10m, 15m and 20m
1:55
and the time, this is zero, this is 1 this is 2 this is 3 &amp; this is 4
2:06
seconds, so this is in second here
2:08
this is meters 5,10,15,20 and then so this is displacement
2:22
displacement graph, and I wanna do at the same time a velocity graph
2:28
let me draw my velocity graph like this, a little bit different
2:32
so this is the velocity will be going up and down, so we have positive
2:38
and negative values here, time will only be positive
2:41
so once again I care about 1s 2s 3s and 4s
2:49
and velocity I'm gonna call this, this is going to be 10m/s
2:55
10m/s this is 20m/s, this will be negative 10m/s
3:01
and this will be negative 20m/s, all of these are in m/s
3:07
this right here is velocity, this axis right here is time
3:13
so this is my velocity graph, and why don't we draw an acceleration graph
3:19
over here, to some degree it's easiest of them all
3:23
so the acceleration graph, so I will just do the fraction here and assume
3:31
that the acceleration is a constant, so this is 1s 2s 3s and 4s
3:37
and let's call this negative 10 and all of these are meters per s square
3:45
so we know our acceleration is 9.8 m/s*s so the acceleration
3:49
the entire time over the four seconds
3:54
the acceleration over the four seconds is going to be negative 9.8
3:59
it's gonna be a constant acceleration the entire time
4:03
let's figure out the displacment and velocity,
4:05
let me draw a table here, in one column I will do change in time
4:14
and you can sometime do that as time
4:17
let's figure out what our final velocity is
4:21
I should say the current velocity of velocity at that time
4:25
and in this column I will figure out what displacement is
4:31
and I will do it in time 0 1 2 3 4 so in 0 zero second gone by
4:40
when 1 second has gone by, when 2s 3s 4s has gone by
4:45
Actually let me call it change in time axis
4:47
this is essentially how many seconds it has gone by
4:50
So this is my change in time, let me make it clear that this graph here
4:55
is acceleration graph acceleration I will put it on the screen
5:01
Alright, so let's fill these things out
5:04
so times zero, what is our velocity?
5:09
well if we use this expression right here time zero or delta t equal zero
5:15
this expression right here is gonna be zero, and it's just going to be
5:18
initial velocity, in the last video we gave our initial velocity
5:22
is going to be 19.6m/s, so it is going to be 19.6m/s
5:32
I will plot that over here, time zero, it's going to be 19.6 m/s
5:38
what is our initial displacement at time zero?
5:41
Our change in time zero, so you look at this up here
5:45
delta t is zero so this expression here is going to be zero
5:51
so we haven't done any displacement yet when no time has gone by
5:55
So we have done no displacement, we are right over there
6:01
now what happen after 1s? 1s has gone by
6:05
what is now our velocity? well our initial velocity right here is 19.6m/s
6:12
that was a given, and our acceleration is negative 9.8m/s*s
6:20
so it's negative right over there and you multiply that by delat t
6:24
in every situation, so in this situation we are gonna multiply it by 1
6:28
delta t is 1, so you have 19.6 minus 9.8 that gives exactly 9.8m/s
6:36
and the unit we got cause we multiply here is second
6:40
so its give us meters per second
6:41
19.6m/s minus 9.8m/s one of these seconds go away multiply by second
6:48
give you 9.8m/s so after 1s our velocity is now half of what it was before
6:55
so we are now going 9.8m/s, let me draw a line here
7:01
9.8m/s, now what is our displacement? so you look up here
7:09
Let me rewrite this displacement formular here with all the infomation
7:13
So we know that displacement is going to be equal to initial veloctiy
7:17
which is 19.6m/s
7:21
now I won't write the units here just for the sake of space
7:22
times change in time, times our, use the same color to see what is what
7:28
times our change in time, plus one half let me be clear one half
7:33
times negative 9.8m/s*s so one half times a is going to be
7:40
I rewrite this right over here cause this is gonna be negative 9.8m/s*s
7:45
times one half, so this is going to be negative 4.9
7:50
All I did is one half times negative 9.8 over here
7:57
It is important that is why the vector quantity is start to matter
8:00
because if you put a positive here you wouldn't have the obeject slowing
8:04
down as you went up, because you will have gravity somehow accelerating
8:07
as it went up, but it's actually slowing it down
8:09
it's pulling it, it's accelerating it in downward direction
8:12
so that's why you have a negative right over there,
8:15
that was out convention at the beginning
8:16
of last video, up is positive, down is negative, so let's focus
8:22
So this part right over here, negative 4.9 m/s*s times delat t square
8:27
times delta t, times delta t square, this will make it a little bit easier
8:32
Although it still, let me get the calculator out
8:34
So when one second has past, I let my trusty TI-85 out now
8:42
when 1s past it's 19.6 times 1,
8:46
well that's just 19.6 minus 4.9 times 1 square
8:50
So that's just minus 4.9, mius 4.9, gives us 14.7 meters
8:58
So 14.7 meters So after 1s, the ball has travel 14.7 meters in the air
9:06
So that's roughly over there, now what happen after 2s?
9:12
I'll do the same agenda, so after 2s,
9:15
our velocity is 19.6 minus 9.8 times 2, times 2 this is 2s has gone by
9:23
well 9.8 times 2, 9.8 times 2 square seconds gives us 19.6 m/s
9:32
so these just cancel out, so we get out velocity now is zero
9:36
So after two seconds our velocity now is zero
9:40
let me make it so this thing should more look like a line
9:47
I don't get a sense, so this is let me just draw the line like this
9:51
so our velocity now is zero after 2 seconds
9:55
what is our displacement?
9:57
So literally we at the point with the ball has no velocity
10:01
exactly two seconds, it kind of gone up,
10:04
and right for that exact moment of time it's stationary
10:09
and then what do we have going on in our displacement?
10:13
We have 19.6 let me get the calculator out for this
10:16
We can do it by hand but for the sake of quickness
10:21
19.6 times 2 minus 4.9 times 2s squared, this is 2s squared
10:36
so that's times four, so that gives us 19.6 meters
10:41
So we have 19, we are at 19.6 meters after 2 seconds
10:49
we are 19.6 meters in the air
10:53
now let's go to 3s, so after 3s, our velocity now
11:01
it's 19.6 m/s minus 9.8 times 3, we could do that in our head but just
11:09
verified it for us, let me get the calculator out
11:11
it's 19.6-9.8*3, that gives us 9.8 m/s, negative 9.8m/s
11:24
So after 3s, our velocity is now negative 9.8 m/s, what is that mean?
11:29
it's now going in downward direction, 9.8 m/s,
11:33
so this is our velocity graph, and what is our displacement?
11:39
So once again, let's get the calculator out
11:41
you are getting the hang of this
11:43
at anytime I encourage you to pause it and try it for yourself
11:46
So now what is this is, Okay I'm looking at the displacement
11:53
Our displacment was delta t with 3s 19.6*3 - 4.9 times
12:03
so this is delat t so this is 3s
12:06
we are talking about delat t, our change in time is 3s so that's square
12:10
So times 9 and that gives us 14.7 meters, so 14.7 meters
12:18
So after 3s we are 14.7m again, the same position with 1s
12:24
but the difference is now we are moving downard
12:27
over here we were moving upwards
12:28
and finally what happen after 4s? Or what's our velocity?
12:32
Let me just get the calculator out
12:34
or you might be figure this out in your head
12:36
Our velocity is going to be 19.6 - 9.8 times 4s
12:48
just minus 19.6 m/s
12:55
So we are going a magnitude of velocity which is the same initially
12:59
threw the ball except now it's going at opposite direction
13:02
it's now going downward, so it's now going downward
13:07
and what is our displacement? get the calculator out
13:11
So we have out displacement is 19.6 times 4, 4s has gone by
13:18
minus 4.9 times 4 square which is 16 times, which is equal to zero!
13:27
the displacement here is zero!
13:29
We are back on the ground
13:32
So if you plot the displacement, you will actually got a parabola
13:38
a downward opening parabola that looks something like this
13:41
I best draw it relatively neatly
13:44
So my check to do it better than that
13:46
Dotted line, dotted line is always easier to adjust than its streamed
13:50
so if you plot displacement verses time it look something like this
13:56
it's velocity just downward sloping line, and the acceleration is constant
14:01
and the whole reason why I wanted to this is I wanted to show you
14:05
that velocity the whole time is decreasing at constant rate
14:08
and that make sense because that's the rate which the velocity increases
14:13
and decreases as the acceleration,
14:15
and the acceleration base on our convention is downward
14:19
so that why it's decreasing, we have a negative slope here
14:22
we have a negative slope of negative 9.8 m/s*s
14:28
and just to think about what's happening for this ball
14:32
I know this video is getting long as it goes
14:34
I'm gonna draw the vectors for velocity
14:38
So I'm gonna do that in orange, or maybe I will do that in blue
14:42
So velocity in blue, so right when we start,
14:45
it has a positive velocity of 19.6m/s,
14:49
so I will draw a big vector like this
14:52
19.6m/s that's velocity, but after 1s is 9.8m/s so half of that
14:58
so then its maybe would look something like this
15:01
9.8m/s, then at the speed right over here has the velocity of zero
15:06
then as you go to 3s, the magnitude of the velocity is 9.8m/s
15:12
but it is now downwards, so it looks like this
15:16
and then finally right when it hits the ground,
15:20
right before it hits the ground it has a negative velocity of 19.6m/s
15:26
So it would look like this, roughly like this
15:32
If I use the same scale over here,
15:35
but what was the acceleration the entire time?
15:38
well the entire time the acceleration is negative
15:40
It's 9.8m/s*s I will do that in orange
15:44
So the acceleration over here
15:46
Negative, now I wanna do that in orange
15:48
The acceleration is negative 9.8m/s*s
15:58
The acceleration is constant the entire time
16:02
So last one is negative 9.8m/s*s
16:05
it does not change depending on where you are
16:07
in the curve when you are near the surface of the earth

Voiceover:Artemis seeks knowledge of
0:02
the width of Orion's belt,
0:04
which is a pattern of stars in the Orion constellation.
0:08
She has previously discovered the distances
0:10
from her house to Alnitak, 736 lights years,
0:16
and to Mintaka, 915 light years,
0:20
which are the endpoints of Orion's belt.
0:23
She knows the angle between these
0:26
stars in the sky is three degrees.
0:29
What is the width of Orion's belt?
0:31
That is, what is the distance
0:32
between Alnitak and Mintaka?
0:36
And they want us to the answer in light years.
0:39
So let's draw a little diagram
0:40
to make sure we understand what's going on.
0:42
Actually, even before we do that,
0:43
I encourage you to pause
0:44
this and try this on your own.
0:46
Now let's make a diagram.
0:48
Alright, so let's say that this is Artemis'
0:50
house right over here.
0:52
This is Artemis' house.
0:53
I'll say that's A for Artemis' house.
0:57
And then...
0:58
Alright, let me say H...
1:00
Let me say this is home.
1:01
This is home right over here.
1:03
And we have these 2 stars.
1:04
So she's looking out into the night sky
1:07
and she sees these stars,
1:09
Alnitak, which is 736 light years away,
1:14
and obviously I'm not going to draw this to scale.
1:17
So this is Alnitak.
1:21
And Mintaka.
1:25
So let's say this is Mintaka right over here.
1:28
Mintaka.
1:31
And we know a few things.
1:32
We know that this distance between her home
1:35
and Alnitak is 736 light years.
1:40
So this distance right over here.
1:42
So that right over there.
1:44
Everything we'll do is in light years.
1:45
That's 736.
1:47
And the distance between
1:48
her house and Mintaka is 915 light years.
1:54
So it would take light 915 years
1:57
to get from her house to Mintaka,
1:58
or from Mintaka to her house.
2:01
So this is 915 light years.
2:04
And what we wanna do is figure out
2:05
the width of Orion's belt,
2:07
which is the distance between Alnitak and Mintaka.
2:11
So we need to figure out this distance
2:15
right over here.
2:17
And the one thing that they did give us
2:21
is this angle.
2:23
They did give us that angle right over there.
2:26
They said that the angle between
2:28
these stars in the sky is three degrees.
2:30
So this is three degrees right over there.
2:33
So how can we figure out the distance
2:36
between Alnitak and Mintaka?
2:38
Let's just say that this is equal to X.
2:40
This is equal to X.
2:42
How do we do that?
2:43
Well if we have two sides
2:45
and an angle between them,
2:47
we could use the law of cosines
2:50
to figure out the third side.
2:55
So the law of cosines,
2:56
so let's just apply it.
2:58
So the law of cosines tells us
3:02
that X squared is going to be equal
3:05
to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
3:09
So it's going to be equal to 736 squared,
3:14
plus 915 squared, minus two times 736,
3:28
times 915, times the cosine of this angle.
3:37
Times the cosine of three degrees.
3:41
So once again,
3:43
we're trying to find the length of
3:44
the side opposite the three degrees.
3:46
We know the other two sides,
3:48
so the law of cosines, it essentially...
3:51
Sorry, I just had to cough off camera
3:54
because I had some peanuts and my throat was dry.
3:56
Where was I?
3:56
Oh, I was saying,
3:58
if we know the angle and we know the two sides
4:00
on either side of the angle,
4:01
we can figure out the length of the side opposite
4:03
by the law of cosines.
4:04
Where it essentially starts off not too
4:06
different than the Pythagorean theorem,
4:08
but then we give an adjustment
4:09
because this is not an actual right triangle.
4:12
And the adjustment...
4:13
So we have the 736 squared, plus 915 squared,
4:16
minus two times the product of these sides,
4:19
times the cosine of this angle.
4:21
Or another way we could say, think about it is,
4:23
X, let me write that,
4:28
X is to equal to the square root of all
4:31
of this stuff.
4:33
So, I can just copy and paste that.
4:37
Copy and paste.
4:40
X is going to be equal to the square root of that.
4:44
And so let's get our calculator to calculate it.
4:48
And let me verify that I'm in degree mode.
4:51
Yes, I am indeed in degree mode.
4:53
And so let's exit that.
4:55
And so I wanna calculate the square root of
4:58
736 squared, plus 915 squared,
5:06
minus two times 736, times 915,
5:15
times cosine of three degrees.
5:19
And we deserve a drum roll now.
5:22
X is 100, if we round...
5:24
Let's see, what did they want us to do?
5:25
Round your answer to the nearest light years.
5:27
So to the nearest light year
5:28
is going to be 184 light years.
5:31
So X is approximately equal to 184 light years.
5:40
So it would take light 184 years
5:43
to get from Mintaka to Alnitak.
5:47
And so hopefully this actually shows you
5:49

in fact all of trigonometry,

0:00
- [Voiceover] We should talk a little more
0:01
about Newtons's Third Law,
0:02
because there are some deep misconceptions
0:04
that many people have about this law.
0:06
It seems simple, but it's not nearly
0:08
as simple as you might think.
0:09
So people often phrase it as,
0:11
for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction.
0:14
But that's just way too vague to be useful.
0:16
So a version that's a little better,
0:18
says that for every force, there's an equal
0:21
and opposite force.
0:23
So this is a little better.
0:24
The equal sign means that these forces
0:26
are equal in magnitude.
0:28
And this negative sign means they're just different
0:31
by the direction of the vector.
0:33
So these are vectors, so this says that this pink
0:35
vector F, has the opposite direction,
0:38
but equal in magnitude to this green vector F.
0:41
But to show you why this is still a little bit too vague,
0:44
consider this, if this is all you knew about
0:46
Newtons's Third Law, that for every force,
0:48
there's an equal and opposite force,
0:50
you might wonder, if you were clever,
0:52
you might be like, wait a minute,
0:54
if for every force F, right, there's got to be
0:59
a force that's equal and opposite.
1:03
Well why doesn't that just mean
1:04
that every force in the universe cancels?
1:07
Shouldn't every force just cancel then, at that point?
1:09
Doesn't that just mean that there's
1:12
no acceleration that's even possible?
1:15
Because if I go and exert a force F on something,
1:17
if there's gonna be a force negative F,
1:19
doesn't that mean that no matter what force I put forward,
1:22
it's just gonna get cancelled?
1:24
And the answer no, and the reason it's no
1:26
is because these two forces
1:28
are exerted on different objects.
1:30
So you have to be careful.
1:31
So the reason I say that this statement
1:33
of Newtons's Third Law is still a little bit too vague,
1:35
is because this is really on different objects.
1:38
So if this is the force on object A,
1:41
exerted by object B, then this force over here
1:45
has to be the force on object B, exerted by object A.
1:53
In other words, these forces down here are exerted
1:55
on different objects.
1:56
I'm gonna move this over to this side.
1:58
I'm gonna move this over to here.
2:00
Let's draw two different objects
2:02
to show explicitly what I mean.
2:04
So if there was some object A,
2:07
so I put some object A in here.
2:09
Just wanna make sure there's an object A.
2:11
Let's say this is object A, and it had
2:13
this green force exerted on it, F.
2:16
So this object right here is A.
2:19
Well, there's gonna be another object, object B.
2:23
We'll just make it another circle.
2:26
So we'll make it look like this.
2:29
So here's object B.
2:31
And it's gonna have this pink force,
2:34
F, negative F exerted on it.
2:35
So I'm gonna call this object B.
2:37
Now we're okay, now we know these forces can't cancel,
2:41
and the reason these forces can't cancel,
2:43
is cause they're on two different objects.
2:45
But when you just say that Newtons's Third Law,
2:46
is that every force has an equal and opposite force,
2:48
it's not clear that it has to be on different objects.
2:51
But it does have to be on different objects.
2:53
So these Newtons force law pairs,
2:55
often times is called force pairs,
2:57
or Newton's third law partner forces,
3:00
are always on different objects.
3:02
So the convention I'm using is that the first letter
3:05
represents the object that the force is on.
3:09
So this A represents that this green force F
3:11
this green force F, is on A and it's exerted by B.
3:18
And this shows that it's exerted on B,
3:20
because the first letter's on the first one,
3:23
and it's exerted by the second object, A.
3:27
So this pink force is exerted on B.
3:30
This green force is exerted on A.
3:32
They're equal and opposite, they do not cancel,
3:34
they cannot cancel because they're not on the same object.
3:38
So that's why these don't cancel.
3:40
And they are the same magnitude,
3:41
even if the two objects are not the same size.
3:43
This is another misconception,
3:45
if object A is a planet, a big planet.
3:48
Or maybe a star, this is yellow, it looks like a star.
3:50
Let's say this is some big star,
3:53
and this is some smaller planet orbiting that star.
3:55
This is not to scale, unless this planet was enormous.
3:59
So this is some planet, but this planet could be
4:02
hundreds, thousands of times, millions of times
4:05
less massive than this star but it would still
4:08
exert the same force.
4:10
So if this star is pulling on the planet
4:11
with this pink force negative F,
4:15
then this planet has to be pulling on the star
4:17
with this green force F and they have to have
4:19
the same magnitude, even if they are different sizes.
4:23
So people quote Newtons's Third Law,
4:24
but sometimes they don't really believe it.
4:27
If I told you this planet was a million times
4:28
less massive than this star, people would want to say
4:31
that well, then the star obviously pulls more on the planet,
4:36
than the planet pulls on the star.
4:37
But that's not true according to Newtons's Third Law.
4:40
And Newtons's Third Law says that they have to be the same,
4:43
even if they're different sizes.
4:44
So if this was the earth and this was the moon,
4:46
the earth pulls on the moon, just as much
4:48
as the moon pulls on the earth.
4:50
And you might still object, you might say,
4:51
wait that makes no sense, I know the star just basically
4:54
sits there and the planet gets whipped around in a circle.
4:58
How come this planet's getting whipped around
5:00
and the star's just staying put?
5:02
That's because, just because the forces are equal,
5:04
that doesn't mean that the result is equal.
5:06
In other words, the forces could be equal,
5:08
but the accelerations don't have to be equal.
5:11
Acceleration is gonna be the net force divided by the mass.
5:15
So even if the force is the same,
5:18
you divide by that mass, you'll get
5:19
a different acceleration and that's why the result of
5:22
the force does not have to be the same,
5:24
even though the forces do have to be the same,
5:27
because of Newtons's Third Law.
5:29
Another misconception people sometimes make,
5:31
is they think there might be a delay in the creation
5:33
of this Newtons's Third Law partner force.
5:36
And people think, maybe if I exert this first force
5:39
fast enough, I can catch the universe sleeping,
5:42
and there might be some sort of delay
5:43
in the creation of this other force.
5:45
But that's not true, Newtons's Third Law is universal.
5:48
No matter what the situation,
5:49
no matter what the acceleration or non acceleration,
5:52
or motion or no motion, whether one object
5:54
is bigger or smaller, if their Newtons's Third Law
5:57
partner forces, they are equal they are opposite
6:00
and they are always equal and opposite,
6:02
at every given moment in time.
6:03
So even if I came in all guns a blazing,
6:06
Chuck Norris style, trying to dropkick some wall.
6:09
That does not look like the correct form for a drop kick.
6:12
But even if I came in, flying at this wall,
6:15
as soon as I start to make contact with the wall,
6:18
I'm gonna exert a force on the wall,
6:20
and the wall has to exert a force back.
6:22
So I'd exert a force on the wall to the right.
6:26
And this would be the force on the wall, by my foot.
6:30
There'd have to be an equal and opposite force
6:32
instantly transmitted backwards, on my foot.
6:36
So this would be the force on my foot, by the wall.
6:39
This happens instantaneously, there is no delay.
6:42
You can't kick this wall fast enough,
6:43
for this other force to not be generated instantaneously.
6:46
As soon as your foot starts to exert any force on the wall
6:49
what so ever, the wall is gonna start exerting
6:51
that same force back on your foot.
6:54
So Newtons's Third Law is universal,
6:56
but people still have trouble identifying
6:58
these third law partner forces.
7:00
So one of the best ways to do it,
7:01
is by listing both objects,
7:03
as soon as you list both objects,
7:05
well to figure out where the partner force is,
7:06
you can just reverse these labels.
7:09
So I know over here, if one of my forces
7:11
is the force on the wall by my foot,
7:14
to find the partner force to this force,
7:16
I can just reverse the labels and say it's gotta be
7:18
the force on my foot, by the wall, which I drew over here.
7:22
So this is a great way to identify
7:24
the third law partner forces,
7:25
cause it's not always obvious
7:27
what force is the partner force.
7:29
So to show you how this can be tricky,
7:30
consider this example.
7:32
Say we got the ground and a table.
7:34
So this example drives people crazy for some reason.
7:38
If I've got a box sitting on a table,
7:40
we'll call it box A.
7:42
Box A is gonna have forces exerted on it.
7:44
One of those forces is gonna be the gravitational force.
7:47
So the force of gravity is gonna pull straight down
7:49
on box A, and if I were to ask you,
7:51
what force is the third law partner force to this force
7:54
of gravity, I'm willing to bet a lot of people might say,
7:58
well there's an upwards force on box A,
8:00
exerted by the table.
8:02
And that's true.
8:04
And if this box A is just sitting here,
8:06
not accelerating, these two forces are going
8:08
to be equal and opposite.
8:09
So it's even more tempting to say that these two forces
8:12
are equal and opposite because of the third law,
8:15
but that's not true.
8:16
These two forces are equal and opposite
8:18
because of the second law.
8:19
The second law says if there's no acceleration,
8:21
then the net force has to be zero,
8:23
the forces have to cancel.
8:25
And that's what's happening here.
8:26
These forces are equal and opposite,
8:27
they're canceling on box A.
8:29
Which is a way to know that they are not third law
8:31
partner forces, cause third law partner forces
8:34
are always exerted on different objects.
8:36
They can never cancel if they're third law partner forces.
8:40
So what's going on over here?
8:41
We've got two forces that are canceling,
8:43
that are equal and opposite, but they're not third law
8:45
partner forces, they're partner forces are somewhere else.
8:49
I haven't drawn their partner forces yet.
8:50
So let's try to figure out what they're partner forces are.
8:53
So let's get rid of this, let's come back to here,
8:55
let's slow it down to figure out what the partner force is,
8:58
name the two objects interacting.
9:00
So this force of gravity, I shouldn't be vague,
9:02
I should call it the force on object A,
9:05
our box A exerted by, well you can't just say gravity.
9:09
Gravity is not an object.
9:11
So the object that is exerting
9:12
this gravitational force on A, is the earth.
9:15
So this force really, this gravitational force,
9:17
if I wanna be careful, is the force on object A
9:19
exerted by the earth.
9:21
Now it's easy to figure out where the partner force is.
9:23
The partner force can be found just
9:25
by reversing these labels.
9:26
So instead of the force on A by the earth,
9:28
there's gotta be an equal and opposite force,
9:30
which is the force on the earth, by box A.
9:33
So opposite means it has to point up.
9:35
So it has to be an upward force.
9:37
And that upward force has to be exerted on the earth,
9:40
by box A, and this is kind of weird,
9:42
because you may not have realized it,
9:44
but if the earth is pulling down on a box, or you,
9:48
that means you are pulling up on the earth.
9:50
And this might seem ridiculous,
9:52
I mean if you jump up, you jump up, you fall back down,
9:55
you move around, but the earth just sits there.
9:57
If your forces are equal, how come the earth doesn't
9:59
move around like you do.
10:01
And again, it's because just because
10:03
the forces are the same, the acceleration
10:05
doesn't have to be the same.
10:06
The mass of the earth is so big,
10:08
compared to your mass, there's basically no acceleration.
10:11
Even though the forces on you
10:13
and the forces on the earth are the same.
10:16
So these two are third law partner forces.
10:19
These two are joined together forever.
10:22
They have to be equal, no matter what happens,
10:25
these two forces will always be equal.
10:27
I don't care if this box is accelerating
10:29
or not accelerating, or that there's motion or no motion.
10:33
Whether it's hitting a wall, sitting on a table,
10:35
falling through space, these two forces must
10:38
always be equal and opposite, because of the third law.
10:41
So how about this other force,
10:42
this force that the table was exerting.
10:45
So this is, the force on A by the table.
10:48
So if I wanna label it correctly,
10:50
I'd call it the force on box A, exerted by the table.
10:54
Now finding the third law partner force is easy,
10:56
I can just reverse these labels,
10:57
and I'd get that there must be,
10:59
instead of an upwards force, a downwards
11:01
force on the table, by A.
11:03
So I'm gonna have another force here on the table.
11:05
It's gonna be a downward force.
11:07
Downward force on the table by A,
11:09
that's the third law partner force to this upward
11:12
force that the table is exerting.
11:14
These two forces are also third law partner forces.
11:18
these forces are going to be equal
11:20
and opposite no matter what happens.
11:22
This force on box A by the table.
11:25
And this force on the table by box A
11:27
must be equal no matter what happens,
11:30
but the force on box A by the table,
11:32
does not have to be equal and opposite
11:34
to the force on A by the earth.
11:36
It happens to be equal and opposite,
11:38
in a case where there's no acceleration.
11:40
If we stuck this whole situation into an elevator,
11:43
or a rocket that had some huge acceleration upwards,
11:47
even if there's acceleration upwards,
11:50
these partner forces have to be equal.
11:52
So the force on A by the table,
11:53
and the force on the table by A will have to be equal.
11:56
Similarly the force on the earth by A,
11:58
and the force on A by the earth have to be equal.
12:00
But no longer will these two forces have to be equal,
12:03
cause they're not partner forces.
12:05
They might be equal and opposite in some circumstances,
12:08
but they don't always have to be equal and opposite.
12:10
If we're accelerating upwards,
12:11
this upward force on the box,
12:13
must be bigger than the downwards force on the box.
12:15
So these won't be equal.
12:17
Recapping quickly, Newtons's Third Law is a statement
12:19
about the forces on two different objects.
12:22
And because it's about two different objects,
12:23
those forces can never cancel.
12:25
To find the Newtons's Third Law partner force,
12:28
just reverse the label after you've identified
12:30
the two objects that are interacting.
12:32
The third law partner forces have to be equal in magnitude,
12:36
even if one object is larger than the other,
12:38
or has more charge or any property that might
12:41
seem like it would convey more force, than another object.
12:44
If those are the two objects interacting,
12:46
their forces must be of equal magnitude
12:47
and opposite directions, the forces instantaneously
12:51
generated this partner forces.
12:53
And be careful, some forces might seem like partner forces,
12:58
and might be equal and opposite,
12:59
but they're not necessarily third law partner forces.
13:02
They made just be equal and opposite for other reasons.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,VfpKzwrhmqQ,
khan_video_gL3HxBQyeg0_140,How would you work backwards to find the radius or diameter using the volume?,Essay,"•
0:00
Let's find the volume of a few more solid figures
0:02
and then if we have time, we might
0:04
be able to do some surface area problems.
0:06
So let me draw a cylinder over here.
0:08
So that is the top of my cylinder.
0:11
And then this is the height of my cylinder.
0:14
This is the bottom right over here.
0:16
If this was transparent, maybe you
0:18
could see the back side of the cylinder.
0:20
So you could imagine this kind of looks like a soda can.
0:23
And let's say that the height of my cylinder, h, is equal to 8.
0:30
I'll give it some units.
0:31
8 centimeters, that is my height.
0:34
And then let's say that the radius of one
0:37
of the top of my cylinder of my soda can,
0:40
let's say that this radius over here is equal to 4 centimeters.
0:45
So what is the volume here?
0:47
What is the volume going to be?
0:51
And the idea here is really the exact same thing
0:54
that we saw in some of the previous problems.
0:55
If you can find the surface area of one side
0:58
and then figure out how deep it goes,
1:00
you'll be able to figure out the volume.
1:02
So what we're going to do here is figure out
1:04
the surface area of the top of this cylinder,
1:08
or the top of the soda can.
1:10
And then we're going to multiply it by its height.
1:12
And that'll give us a volume.
1:13
This will tell us essentially, how many
1:15
square centimeters fit in this top.
1:17
And then if we multiply that by how many centimeters
1:20
we go down, then that'll give us the number
1:23
of cubic centimeters in this cylinder or soda can.
1:27
So how do we figure out this area up here?
1:30
Well the area at the top, this is just
1:32
finding the area of a circle.
1:33
You could imagine drawing it like this.
1:36
If we were to just look at it straight on,
1:38
that's a circle with a radius of 4 centimeters.
1:42
The area of a circle with a radius 4 centimeters, area
1:45
is equal to pi r squared.
1:48
So it's going to be pi times the radius squared,
1:51
times 4 centimeters squared, which is equal to 4 squared,
1:55
is 16, times pi.
1:58
And our units now are going to be centimeters squared.
2:03
Or another way to think of these are square centimeters.
2:06
So that's the area.
2:07
The volume is going to be this area times the height.
2:11
So the volume is going to be equal to 16 pi
2:16
centimeters squared, times the height, times 8 centimeters.
2:29
And so, when you do multiplication,
2:32
the associative property, you can kind of
2:34
rearrange these things, and the commutative property.
2:36
It doesn't matter what order you do it
2:38
if it's all multiplication.
2:39
So this is the same thing as 16 times 8.
2:42
Let's see.
2:43
8 times 8 is 64.
2:44
16 times 8 is twice that.
2:45
So it's going to be 128 pi.
2:50
Now you have centimeter squared times centimeters.
2:53
So that gives us centimeters cubed.
2:56
Or 128 pi cubic centimeters.
2:59
Remember, pi is just a number.
3:01
We write it as pi, because it's kind
3:03
of a crazy, irrational number, that if you were to write it,
3:06
you could never completely write pi.
3:08
3.14159 keeps going on, never a repeat.
3:13
So we just leave it as pi.
3:14
But if you wanted to figure it out, you can get a calculator.
3:17
And this would be 3.14 roughly, times 128.
3:20
So it would be close to 400 cubic centimeters.
3:25
Now, how would we find the surface area?
3:28
How would we find the surface area of this figure over here?
3:32
Well, part of the surface area of the two surfaces, the top
3:34
and the bottom.
3:35
So that would be part of the surface area.
3:39
And then the bottom over here would also
3:41
be part of the surface area.
3:44
So if we're trying to find the surface area,
3:51
it's definitely going to have both of these areas here.
3:54
So it's going to have the 16 pi centimeters squared twice.
3:57
This is 16 pi.
3:59
This is 16 pi square centimeters.
4:01
So it's going to have 2 times 16 pi centimeters squared.
4:06
I'll keep the units still.
4:08
So that covers the top and the bottom of our soda can.
4:11
And now we have to figure out the surface
4:13
area of this thing that goes around.
4:15
And the way I imagine it is, imagine
4:16
if you're trying to wrap this thing with wrapping paper.
4:19
So let me just draw a little dotted line here.
4:22
So imagine if you were to cut it just like that.
4:24
Cut the side of the soda can.
4:25
And if you were to unwind this thing that
4:30
goes around it, what would you have.
4:32
Well, you would have something.
4:34
You would end up with a sheet of paper
4:36
where this length right over here
4:40
is the same thing as this length over here.
4:42
And then it would be completely unwound.
4:45
And then these two ends-- let me do it
4:47
in magenta-- these two ends used to touch each other.
4:52
And-- I'm going to do it in a color that I haven't used yet,
4:54
I'll do it in pink-- these two ends used
4:57
to touch each other when it was all rolled together.
4:59
And they used to touch each other right over there.
5:02
So the length of this side and that side
5:05
is going to be the same thing as the height of my cylinder.
5:09
So this is going to be 8 centimeters.
5:11
And then this over here is also going to be 8 centimeters.
5:14
And so the question we need to ask
5:16
ourselves is, what is going to be this dimension
5:21
right over here.
5:23
And remember, that dimension is essentially,
5:24
how far did we go around the cylinder.
5:28
Well, if you think about it, that's
5:29
going to be the exact same thing as the circumference
5:32
of either the top or the bottom of the cylinder.
5:36
So what is the circumference?
5:37
The circumference of this circle right
5:39
over here, which is the same thing as the circumference
5:41
of that circle over there, it is 2 times the radius times pi.
5:47
Or 2 pi times the radius.
5:49
2 pi times 4 centimeters, which is equal to 8 pi centimeters.
5:57
So this distance right over here is the circumference
6:00
of either the top or the bottom of the cylinder.
6:02
It's going to be 8 pi centimeters.
6:06
So if you want to find the surface
6:07
area of just the wrapping, just the part that
6:09
goes around the cylinder, not the top or the bottom,
6:13
when you unwind it, it's going to look like this rectangle.
6:16
And so its area, the area of just that part,
6:19
is going to be equal to 8 centimeters times 8 pi
6:22
centimeters.
6:23
So let me do it this way.
6:24
It's going to be 8 centimeters times 8 pi centimeters.
6:31
And that's equal to 64 pi.
6:35
8 times 8 is 64.
6:36
You have your pi centimeters squared.
6:40
So when you want the surface area of the whole thing,
6:42
you have the top, you have the bottom,
6:44
we already threw those there.
6:45
And then you want to find the area of the thing around.
6:47
We just figured that out.
6:48
So it's going to be plus 64 pi centimeters squared.
6:54
And now we just have to calculate it.
6:56
So this gives us 2 times 16 pi, is going to be equal to 32.
7:02
That is 32 pi centimeters squared, plus 64 pi.
7:09
Let me scroll over to the right a little bit.
7:12
Plus 64 pi centimeters squared.
7:15
And then 32 plus 64 is 96 pi centimeters squared.
7:23
So it's equal to 96 pi square centimeters, which
7:26
is going to be a little bit over 300 square centimeters.
7:30
And notice, when we did surface area,
7:32
we got our answer in terms of square centimeters.
7:35
That makes sense, because surface area,
7:38
it's a two-dimensional measurement.
7:40
Think about how many square centimeters can we
7:42
fit on the surface of the cylinder.
7:45
When we did the volume, we got centimeters cubed,
7:48
or cubic centimeters.
7:49
And that's because we're trying to calculate
7:51
how many one by one by one centimeter
7:58
cubes can we fit inside of this structure.
8:01
And so that's why it's cubic centimeters.
8:03
Anyway, hopefully that clarifies things up a little bit.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,gL3HxBQyeg0,
khan_video_GwoX_BemwHs_67,"at 0:01, would ideal gas law apply to plasma?",MCQ,"•
0:00
Let's do some more problems
0:02
that involve the ideal gas equation.
0:04
Let's say I have a gas in a container
0:06
and the current pressure is 3 atmospheres.
0:14
And let's say that the volume of the container is 9 liters.
0:27
Now, what will the pressure become
0:29
if my volume goes from 9 liters to 3 liters?
0:39
So from the first ideal gas equation video,
0:42
you can kind of have the intuition, that you have a bunch of
0:44
-- and we're holding-- and this is important.
0:47
We're holding the temperature constant,
0:50
and that's an important thing to realize.
0:52
So in our very original intuition
0:58
behind the ideal gas equation we said,
1:00
look, if we have a certain number of particles
1:03
with a certain amount of kinetic energy,
1:05
and they're exerting a certain pressure on their container,
1:09
and if we were to make the container smaller,
1:14
we have the same number of particles.
1:15
n doesn't change.
1:17
The average kinetic energy doesn't change,
1:19
so they're just going to bump into the walls more.
1:21
So that when we make the volume smaller,
1:23
when the volume goes down, the pressure should go up.
1:30
So let's see if we can calculate the exact number.
1:32
So we can take our ideal gas equation:
1:34
pressure times volume is equal to nRT.
1:41
Now, do the number of particles change
1:43
when I did this situation when I shrunk the volume? No!
1:48
We have the same number of particles.
1:50
I'm just shrinking the container,
1:51
so n is n, R doesn't change, that's a constant,
1:55
and then the temperature doesn't change.
1:56
So my old pressure times volume is going to be equal to nRT,
2:02
and my new pressure times volume
2:04
-- so let me call this P1 and V1.
2:07
That's V2.
2:16
V2 is this, and we're trying to figure out P2.
2:20
P2 is what?
2:22
Well, we know that P1 times V1 is equal to nRT,
2:29
and we also know that since temperature
2:33
and the number of moles of our gas stay constant,
2:36
that P2 times V2 is equal to nRT.
2:39
And since they both equal the same thing, we can say that
2:44
the pressure times the volume,
2:46
as long as the temperature is held constant, will be a constant.
2:48
So P1 times V1 is going to equal P2 times V2.
2:55
So what was P1?
2:57
P1, our initial pressure, was 3 atmospheres.
3:03
So 3 atmospheres times 9 liters
3:10
is equal to our new pressure times 3 liters.
3:15
And if we divide both sides of the equation by 3,
3:18
we get 3 liters cancel out,
3:24
we're left with 9 atmospheres.
3:33
And that should make sense.
3:35
When you decrease the volume by 2/3
3:39
or when you make the volume 1/3 of your original volume,
3:42
then your pressure increases by a factor of three.
3:46
So this went by times 3, and this went by times 1/3.
3:50
That's a useful thing to know in general.
3:53
If temperature is held constant,
3:55
then pressure times volume are going to be a constant.
3:58
Now, you can take that even further.
4:01
If we look at PV equals nRT,
4:06
the two things that we know don't change
4:08
in the vast majority of exercises we do is
4:11
the number of molecules we're dealing with,
4:13
and obviously, R isn't going to change.
4:15
So if we divide both sides of this by T,
4:18
we get PV over T is equal to nR,
4:22
or you could say it's equal to a constant.
4:25
This is going to be a constant number for any system
4:27
where we're not changing the number
4:29
of molecules in the container.
4:30
So if initially we start with pressure one, volume one,
4:38
and some temperature one that's going to be
4:40
equal to this constant.
4:41
And if we change any of them, if we go back to pressure two,
4:45
volume two, temperature two, they should still be
4:49
equal to this constant, so they equal each other.
4:51
So for example, let's say I start off
4:55
with a pressure of 1 atmosphere.
4:59
and I have a volume of-- I'll switch units here
5:06
just to do things differently-- 2 meters cubed.
5:09
And let's say our temperature is 27 degrees Celsius.
5:19
Well, and I just wrote Celsius because I want you to
5:22
always remember you have to convert to Kelvin,
5:24
so 27 degrees plus 273 will get us exactly to 300 Kelvin.
5:32
Let's figure out what the new temperature is going to be.
5:41
Let's say our new pressure is 2 atmospheres.
5:46
The pressure has increased.
5:47
Let's say we make the container smaller, so 1 meter cubed.
5:52
So the container has been decreased by half
5:54
and the pressure is doubled by half.
6:02
Let me make the container even smaller.
6:07
Actually, no. Let me make the pressure even larger.
6:10
Let me make the pressure into 5 atmospheres.
6:12
Now we want to know what the second temperature is,
6:16
and we set up our equation.
6:18
And so we have 2/300 atmosphere meters cubed per Kelvin
6:27
is equal to 5/T2, our new temperature,
6:32
and then we have 1,500 is equal to 2 T2.
6:40
Divide both sides by 2.
6:41
You have T2 is equal to 750 degrees Kelvin,
6:46
which makes sense, right?
6:48
We increased the pressure so much
6:50
and we decreased the volume at the same time that
6:53
the temperature just had to go up.
6:55
Or if you thought of it the other way,
6:56
maybe we increased the temperature
6:58
and that's what drove the pressure to be so much higher,
7:00
especially since we decreased the volume.
7:04
I guess the best way to think about
7:05
is this pressure went up so much,
7:08
it went up by factor of five,
7:09
it went from 1 atmosphere to 5 atmospheres,
7:12
because on one level we shrunk the volume by a factor of 1/2,
7:17
so that should have doubled the pressure,
7:19
so that should have gotten us to two atmospheres.
7:21
And then we made the temperature a lot higher,
7:24
so we were also bouncing into the container.
7:25
We made the temperature 750 degrees Kelvin,
7:27
so more than double the temperature,
7:30
and then that's what got us to 5 atmospheres.
7:33
Now, one other thing that you'll probably hear about
7:37
is the notion of what happens
7:39
at standard temperature and pressure.
7:41
Let me delete all of the stuff over here.
7:44
Standard temperature and pressure.
7:46
Let me delete all this stuff that I don't need.
7:51
Standard temperature and pressure.
7:54
And I'm bringing it up because even though it's called
7:58
standard temperature and pressure, and sometimes called STP,
8:03
unfortunately for the world, they haven't really standardized
8:07
what the standard pressure and temperature are.
8:13
I went to Wikipedia and I looked it up.
8:15
And the one that you'll probably see in most physics classes
8:18
and most standardized tests is standard temperature
8:21
is 0 degrees celsius, which is,
8:24
of course, 273 degrees Kelvin.
8:26
And standard pressure is 1 atmosphere.
8:29
And here on Wikipedia, they wrote it as 101.325 kilopascals,
8:38
or a little more than 101,000 pascals.
8:40
And of course, a pascal is a newton per square meter.
8:44
In all of this stuff,
8:45
the units are really the hardest part to get a hold of.
8:47
But let's say that we assume that
8:49
these are all different standard temperatures and pressures
8:52
based on different standard-making bodies.
8:55
So they can't really agree with each other.
8:56
But let's say we took this
8:57
as the definition of standard temperature and pressure.
9:00
So we're assuming that temperature is equal to 0 degrees Celsius,
9:06
which is equal to 273 degrees Kelvin.
9:10
And pressure, we're assuming, is 1 atmosphere,
9:14
which could also be written as 101.325 or 3/8 kilopascals.
9:21
So my question is if I have an ideal gas
9:26
at standard temperature and pressure,
9:29
how many moles of that do I have in 1 liter?
9:35
No, let me say that the other way.
9:37
How many liters will 1 mole take up?
9:40
So let me say that a little bit more.
9:42
So n is equal to 1 mole.
9:45
So I want to figure out what my volume is.
9:49
So if I have 1 mole of a gas,
9:50
I have 6.02 times 10 to 23 molecules of that gas.
9:55
It's at standard pressure, 1 atmosphere,
9:58
and at standard temperature,
9:59
273 degrees, what is the volume of that gas?
10:03
So let's apply PV is equal to nRT.
10:06
Pressure is 1 atmosphere,
10:10
but remember we're dealing with atmospheres.
10:11
1 atmosphere times volume-- that's what we're solving for.
10:16
I'll do that and purple--
10:17
is equal to 1 mole times R times temperature, times 273.
10:27
Now this is in Kelvin; this is in moles.
10:31
We want our volume in liters.
10:38
So which version of R should we use?
10:41
Well, we're dealing with atmospheres.
10:44
We want our volume in liters, and of course,
10:47
we have moles and Kelvin, so we'll use this version, 0.082.
10:50
So this is 1, so we can ignore the 1 there, the 1 there.
10:54
So the volume is equal to 0.082 times 273 degrees Kelvin,
11:01
and that is 0.082 times 273 is equal to 22.4 liters.
11:19
So if I have any ideal gas,
11:21
and all gases don't behave ideally ideal,
11:24
but if I have an ideal gas and it's at standard temperature,
11:27
which is at 0 degrees Celsius, or the freezing point of water,
11:30
which is also 273 degrees Kelvin,
11:32
and I have a mole of it,
11:33
and it's at standard pressure, 1 atmosphere,
11:37
that gas should take up exactly 22.4 liters.
11:42
And if you wanted to know
11:43
how many meters cubed it's going to take up,
11:46
well, you could just say 22.4 liters times--
11:50
now, how many meters cubed are there
11:53
-- so for every 1 meter cubed, you have 1,000 liters.
11:57
I know that seems like a lot, but it's true.
11:59
Just think about how big a meter cubed is.
12:02
So this would be equal to 0.0224 meters cubed.
12:09
If you have something at 1 atmosphere,
12:11
a mole of it, and at 0 degrees Celsius.
12:14
Anyway, this is actually a useful number to know sometimes.
12:17
They'll often say, you have 2 moles
12:22
at standard temperature and pressure.
12:25
How many liters is it going to take up?
12:27
Well, 1 mole will take up this many,
12:29
and so 2 moles at standard temperature and pressure
12:32
will take up twice as much,
12:33
because you're just taking PV equals nRT and just doubling.
12:35
Everything else is being held constant.
12:38
The pressure, everything else is being held constant,
12:41
so if you double the number of moles,
12:43
you're going to double the volume it takes up.
12:44
Or if you half the number of moles,
12:46
you're going to half the volume it takes up.
12:47
So it's a useful thing to know that
12:49
in liters at standard temperature and pressure,
12:51
where standard temperature and pressure
12:53
is defined as 1 atmosphere and 273 degrees Kelvin,
12:56

0:00
This exercises is from chapter 12 of the Kotz, Treichel in
0:03
Townsend and Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity book, and
0:06
I'm doing it with their permission.
0:09
So they tell us you place 2 liters of water in an open
0:13
container in your dormitory room.
0:15
The room has a volume of 4.25 times 10 to the fourth liters.
0:20
You seal the room and wait for the water to evaporate.
0:24
Will all of the water evaporate
0:26
at 25 degrees Celsius?
0:28
And then they tell us at 25 degrees Celsius, the density
0:31
of water is 0.997 grams per milliliter.
0:36
And its vapor pressure is 23.8 millimeters of mercury.
0:44
And this is actually the key clue to tell you how to solve
0:47
this problem.
0:47
And just as a bit of review, lets just think about what
0:49
vapor pressure is.
0:53
Let's say it's some temperature, and in this case
0:54
we're dealing at 25 degrees Celsius.
0:57
I have a bunch of water, and let me do
0:59
that in a water color.
1:00
I have a bunch of water molecules
1:03
sitting here in a container.
1:08
At 25 degrees Celsius, they're all bouncing around
1:12
in every which way.
1:15
And every now and then one of them is going to have enough
1:17
kinetic energy to kind of escape the hydrogen bonds and
1:21
all the things that keep liquid water in its liquid
1:23
state, and it will escape.
1:25
It'll go off in that direction, and
1:26
then another one will.
1:27
And this'll just keep happening.
1:29
The water will naturally vaporize in a room.
1:32
But at some point, enough of these molecules have vaporized
1:38
over here that they're also bumping back into the water.
1:42
And maybe some of them can be captured back
1:44
into the liquid state.
1:46
Now, the pressure at which this happens
1:50
is the vapor pressure.
1:51
As you can imagine, as more and more these water molecules
1:55
vaporize and go into the gaseous state, more and more
1:58
will also create pressure, downward pressure.
2:01
More and more will also be colliding with the
2:03
surface of the water.
2:04
And the pressure at which the liquid and the vapor states
2:09
are in equilibrium is the vapor pressure.
2:12
And they're telling us right now.
2:13
It is 23.8 millimeters of mercury.
2:18
Now, what we need to do to figure out this problem is
2:21
say, OK, if we could figure out how many molecules need to
2:26
evaporate, how many molecules of water need to evaporate to
2:29
give us this vapor pressure, we can then use the density of
2:33
water to figure out how many liters of water that is.
2:37
So how do we figure out how many molecules-- let me write
2:40
this down-- how many molecules of water need to evaporate to
2:59
give us the vapor pressure of 23.8 millimeters of mercury?
3:14
So what, I guess, law or formula-- and I never like to
3:18
just memorize formulas, but we've given this formal in the
3:21
past and it's probably one of the top most useful formulas
3:25
in chemistry, or really all of science-- what formula or law
3:30
deals with pressure?
3:33
They give us the volume of the room because that's where the
3:36
pressure will be inside of.
3:37
So we have pressure, the equilibrium vapor pressure.
3:41
We have a volume of a room right over here.
3:45
We know the temperature of the room right over there.
3:49
And we're trying to figure out the number of molecules that
3:52
need to evaporate for us to get that pressure in that
3:57
volume at that temperature.
3:59
So what deals with pressure, volume, number of molecules--
4:04
let's say in moles, so I'll write a lower case n-- number
4:08
of molecules, and temperature?
4:10
Well, we've seen this many, many times.
4:12
It's the Ideal Gas Law.
4:13
Pressure times volume is equal to the number of moles of our
4:20
ideal gas-- in this case we're going to use water as our
4:24
ideal gas, or vapor as our ideal gas-- times the
4:29
universal gas constant times temperature.
4:32
And this should never seem like some bizarre formula to
4:35
you because it really, really makes sense.
4:37
If your pressure goes up, then that means that either the
4:42
number of molecules have gone up, and we're assuming the
4:44
volume is constant.
4:45
That means either the number of molecules have gone up,
4:48
which makes sense-- more things bouncing onto the side
4:50
of the container.
4:51
Or your temperature has gone up-- the same number of
4:53
things, but they're bumping with higher kinetic energy.
4:56
Or if your pressure stays the same and your volume goes up,
5:01
then that also means that your number of molecules went up,
5:04
or your temperature went up.
5:05
Because you now have a bigger container.
5:06
In order to exert the same pressure you need either more
5:09
molecules or more kinetic energy for the molecules you
5:12
have.
5:12
And you could keep playing around with this, but I just
5:14
want to make it clear this isn't some mysterious formula.
5:16
The first time I was exposed to this I kind of did view it
5:18
as some type of mysterious formula.
5:20
But it's just relating pressure, volume, number of
5:22
molecules and temperature.
5:23
And then this is just the universal gas constant.
5:29
So let's just get everything into the right units here.
5:32
And then what we're trying to solve for, we want to figure
5:34
out the number of molecules of water.
5:36
So we want to solve for n.
5:40
And if we know the number of moles of water, we can figure
5:44
out the number of grams of water.
5:46
And then given the density of water we can figure out the
5:48
number of milliliters of water we are dealing with.
5:52
So let's just rewrite the Ideal Gas Law by dividing both
5:57
sides by the universal gas constant and temperature.
6:00
So that you get n is equal to pressure times volume, over
6:07
the universal gas constant times temperature.
6:10
Now, the hardest thing about this is just making sure you
6:13
have your units right and you're using the right ideal
6:15
gas constant for the right units, and we'll
6:17
do that right here.
6:18
So what I want to do, because the universal gas constant
6:24
that I have is in terms of atmospheres, we need to figure
6:27
out this vapor pressuree- this equilibrium pressure between
6:30
vapor and liquid-- we need to write this down in terms of
6:33
atmospheres.
6:35
So let me write this down.
6:36
So the vapor pressure is equal to 23.8
6:47
millimeters of mercury.
6:51
And you can look it up at a table if you don't have this
6:55
in your brain.
6:55
One atmosphere is equivalent to 760 millimeters of mercury.
7:06
So if we wanted to write the vapor pressure as
7:09
atmospheres-- let me get my calculator out, get the
7:12
calculator out, put it right over there-- so it's going to
7:15
be 23.8 times 1 over 760, or just divided by 760.
7:24
And we have three significant digits, so
7:27
it looks like 0.0313.
7:31
So this is equal to 0.0313 atmospheres.
7:40
That is our vapor pressure.
7:41
So let's just deal with this right here.
7:43
So the number of molecules of water that are going to be in
7:46
the air in the gaseous state, in the vapor state, is going
7:49
to be equal to our vapor pressure.
7:51
That's our equilibrium pressure.
7:55
If more water molecules evaporate after that point,
7:59
then we're going to have a higher pressure, which will
8:01
actually make them favor more of them going into the liquid
8:04
state, so we'll go kind of past the equilibrium, which is
8:06
not likely.
8:07
Or another way to think about it-- more water molecules are
8:10
not going to of evaporate at a faster rate than they are
8:12
going to condense beyond that pressure.
8:15
Anyway, the pressure here is 0.0313 atmospheres.
8:22
The volume here-- they told us right over here-- so that's
8:26
the volume-- 4.25.
8:28
4.25 times 10 to the fourth liters.
8:35
And then we want to divide that by-- and you want to make
8:37
sure that your universal gas constant has the right units,
8:40
I just looked mine up on Wikipedia-- 0.08-- see
8:46
everything has three significant digits.
8:48
So let me just allow that more significant digits and we'll
8:51
just round at the end.
8:52
0.082057, and the units here are liters atmospheres per
9:07
mole at kelvin.
9:12
And this makes sense.
9:13
This liter will cancel out with that liter.
9:14
That atmospheres cancels out with that atmospheres.
9:17
I'm about to multiply it by temperature
9:19
right here in kelvin.
9:21
We'll cancel out there.
9:22
And then we'll have a 1 over moles in the denominator.
9:24
A 1 over moles in the denominator will just be a
9:27
moles because you're going to invert it again.
9:29
So that gives us our answer in moles.
9:31
And so finally our temperature-- and you've got
9:33
to remember you've got to do it in kelvin.
9:35
So 25 degrees Celsius-- let me right it over here-- 25
9:39
degrees Celsius is equal to, you just add 273 to it, so
9:44
this is equal to 298 kelvin.
9:52
So times 298 kelvin.
9:56
And now we just have to calculate this.
9:58
So let's do that.
10:02
So let me clear this out.
10:04
So we have-- let me use my keyboard-- so 0.0313
10:10
atmospheres times 4.25 times 10 to the fourth.
10:21
That e just means times 10 to the fourth.
10:24
That's just the way that it works on this calculator.
10:27
And then divided by 0.082057 divided by-- actually, just to
10:39
make it clear, let me show you that I'm dividing by this
10:41
whole thing, so let me insert some parentheses right here.
10:50
So in the denominator we also are multiplying by 298.
10:53
And let me close the parentheses.
10:58
And then we get 54.4.
11:02
We only have three significant digits.
11:03
So this is equal to 54.4 moles.
11:10
And we could see this liters cancels out with that liters.
11:13
Kelvin cancels out with kelvin.
11:15
Atmospheres with atmospheres.
11:16
You have a 1 over mole in the denominator.
11:18
So then 1 over 1 over moles is just going to be moles.
11:24
Now, this is going to be 54.4 moles of water vapor in the
11:29
room to have our vapor pressure.
11:32
If more evaporates, then more will condense-- we will be
11:36
beyond our equilibrium.
11:37
So we won't ever have more than this amount
11:40
evaporate in that room.
11:41
So let's figure out how much liquid water that actually is.
11:47
Let me do it over here.
11:48
So 54.4 moles-- let me write it down-- moles of H2O.
11:59
That's going to be in its vapor form and
12:00
its going to evaporate.
12:01
But let's figure out how many grams that is.
12:04
So what is the molar mass of water?
12:08
Well, it's roughly 18.
12:10
I actually figured it out exactly.
12:11
It's actually 18.01 if you actually use the exact numbers
12:16
on the periodic table, at least one that I used.
12:18
So we could say that there's 18.01 grams of H2O for every 1
12:28
mole of H2O.
12:30
And obviously, you can just look up the atomic weight of
12:33
hydrogen, which is a little bit over 1, and the atomic
12:36
weight of oxygen, which is a little bit below 16.
12:38
So you have two of these.
12:40
So 2 plus 16 gives you pretty close to 18.
12:43
So this right here will tell you the grams of water that
12:47
can evaporate to get us to that equilibrium pressure.
12:51
So let's get the calculator out.
12:53
So we have the 54.4 times 18.01 is equal to 970-- well,
13:05
we only have three significant digits-- so 900, if your round
13:07
this 0.7, it becomes 980.
13:10
So this is 980 grams of H2O needs to evaporate for us to
13:17
get to our equilibrium pressure,
13:19
to our vapor pressure.
13:20
So let's figure out how many milliliters of water this is.
13:24
So they tell us the density of water right here.
13:27
0.997-- let me do this in a darker color-- 0.997 grams per
13:33
millileter.
13:34
Or another way you could view this is for everyone 1
13:39
milliliter you have 0.997 grams of water
13:49
at 25 degrees Celsius.
13:52
So for every milliliter-- this is grams per milliliter-- we
13:55
want milliliters per gram because we want this and this
13:58
to cancel out.
13:59
So we're essentially just going to divide 980 by 0.997.
14:04
So what is that?
14:05
Get the calculator out.
14:06
So we have 980-- not cover up our work-- divided by 0.997 is
14:16
equal to 980-- we'll just round this-- 983.
14:21
So this is equal to 983.
14:25
This and this canceled out, or that and that canceled out.
14:29
So 983 milliliters of H2O.
14:32
So we've figured out, using the Ideal Gas Law, that at 25
14:38
degrees Celsius, which was 298 kelvin, that 983 milliliters
14:44
of H2O will evaporate to get us to our
14:47
equilibrium vapor pressure.
14:50
Nothing more will evaporate, because beyond that if we have
14:53
higher pressure than that, then you'll also have more
14:57
vapor going to the liquid state.
14:58
Because you'll have more stuff bouncing here.
15:01
So if this much volume of water evaporates, we'll have
15:07
the state where just as much is evaporating as just as much
15:11
is condensing.
15:11
So you will never get to a higher pressure than that at
15:16
that temperature.
15:18
So going back to the question, we figured out that 983
15:21
milliliters of water will evaporate.
15:23
The question was is that we placed 2 liters of water in an
15:26
open container.
15:28
So we just figured out that only 983 milliliters of that--
15:31
so that's a little bit less than a liter.
15:34
So this is a little bit less than 1,000 milliliters, and
15:40
this is 1 liter.
15:41
So a little bit less than half of this will evaporate for us
15:47
to get to our vapor pressure.
15:48
So to answer our question-- will all of the water
15:50
evaporate at 25 degrees Celsius?
15:52
No-- if we're assuming the room is sealed-- well, no, all
15:55
of it will not.
15:56
Only a little bit less than half of it will.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,-QpkmwIoMaY,

0:00
I've been wanting to make a video on a couple of terms
0:03
that people have really thrown around for a while now.
0:06
And I think it really hits the core of some of the issues
0:09
we're dealing with now with the credit debacle but it's
0:11
kind of at a deeper level.
0:13
So the things I want to go over are the ideas of savings,
0:20
consumption, and investment.
0:28
And you hear these a lot.
0:29
Everyone obviously says, I've invested in the stock market
0:31
or I've invested in a house and I really want to give you
0:34
a framework for how I think about these ideas.
0:38
And frankly, I haven't seen them depicted this way in any
0:44
economics book, although they've kind of touched on
0:46
this, but I think this is really how you should think
0:48
about these things.
0:49
So if you save money, and I think we all know what that
0:52
means, that's money that you didn't spend, there's a couple
0:54
of things that you can do with it.
0:56
You can either consume your money or you
0:58
could invest your money.
1:00
So, let's just think about a bunch of different situations
1:02
and think about whether those things are consumption or
1:07
investment.
1:08
So let's say, I have $100,000 that I'm dealing with.
1:15
So let's say, I take that $100,000
1:17
and I build a factory.
1:23
And I think that that factory is going to be able to
1:26
produce-- I'll make up some product-- it'll be able to
1:29
produce cars more efficiently and cheaper than any other car
1:33
factory out there.
1:35
Well, I think we'd all agree that this is an investment.
1:39
And why is it an investment?
1:42
Because I'm taking this $100,000 and I'm putting it to
1:46
some use that is creating, hopefully, more value than my
1:50
original $100,000.
1:52
In fact, I'm expecting some type of a return on this
1:55
investment.
1:55
And I've made a bunch of videos on what a return on
1:58
investment is, and you can usually quantify it.
2:00
If I take a $100,000 and I build this factory and this
2:03
factory spits out $50,000 a year, it's probably creating
2:08
at least $50,000 a year value, assuming that nothing corrupt
2:12
is happening in our system.
2:13
In fact, it's normally creating more than $50,000 a
2:16
year of value.
2:16
It may be creating a $100,000 a year of value and $50,000 of
2:20
that may be going to the person who's doing the
2:22
production and then the other half of the value is actually
2:25
going to the consumer of whatever
2:27
this factory is making.
2:28
And you have to think about it, because if all of the
2:30
value went to the person who produced the factory then
2:33
there's not a huge incentive for someone to use his
2:35
products anymore.
2:36
But anyway, that's not the topic of discussion.
2:38
We're just trying to get at a mental framework on what
2:41
consumption is versus investment.
2:43
So I think we all agree that if I were to build a factory
2:46
that this is-- let's say I'll do everything in green as
2:49
investment.
2:51
So building a factory is an investment.
2:55
Now let's say that I'm homeless
3:00
and I have this $100,000.
3:01
And because I'm homeless, I don't have a place to go and
3:05
eat dinner and rest and relax.
3:08
Because I don't have that, I can't get a job and I can't
3:11
become a productive member of society.
3:13
So maybe, I'm going to use this $100,000 to buy a simple
3:17
house that meets all of my needs.
3:19
Let's say build a simple house, and I'll do that in a
3:22
neutral color.
3:31
This is my other use of this $100,000, instead of building
3:34
a factory, I'm going to build a simple house.
3:36
And this house, it provides shelter for me and my family,
3:39
it allows us that security that now my kids can go to
3:43
school and they can themselves become
3:45
more productive citizens.
3:46
I now have an address.
3:49
I have a place to take a shower, that allows me to go
3:51
get a job and I can now create value for society as a whole,
3:55
instead of being on the corner and begging
3:58
for money from people.
4:00
I would argue that this is also an investment.
4:02
Why is it?
4:03
Because I'm taking this $100,000, that maybe I had or
4:06
someone gave to me, and it's generating a return.
4:10
And what is that return?
4:11
Well, with a factory, it's maybe a
4:12
little easier to quantify.
4:13
But at minimum, it's this work that I'm able to do because I
4:17
now have a house.
4:17
Because I have the security, I have the address.
4:19
I have the shelter.
4:20
I'm able to relax.
4:21
It's that security and it's also the return that probably
4:24
my kids are going to be able to now contribute to society.
4:27
Maybe if they grew up homeless, they would have
4:29
never been able to contribute.
4:30
And now that they have a roof over their head, and are able
4:33
to go to school, et cetera, they are going to be able to
4:35
give some economic value back to society.
4:38
It's hard to value, maybe I didn't have any job before and
4:40
now I have a job and I can contribute
4:42
$30,000 a year to society.
4:45
Maybe I'm working at someone's factory.
4:47
Maybe I'm providing some other-- maybe
4:49
I'm a farmer now.
4:50
Whatever, I'm providing some source of value.
4:52
And maybe my kids-- if they never got an education, they
4:54
would have maybe added $10,000 of value per year to people
4:59
and now they can add $20,000 of value.
5:01
So that difference would also be some of the return on this
5:03
investment.
5:04
So I also consider this to be an investment.
5:09
Now, my question to you is, let's say that I already had a
5:12
house-- so this is an investment.
5:15
Let's say I already had a house and my family is happy
5:17
and we have everything we need.
5:20
We have food on the table and my kids go to school and I'm
5:23
able to get a job and all of that exists.
5:26
But let's say, I still have a $100,000 and I use that
5:30
$100,000-- I'll do it in yellow-- to put in some
5:40
granite counter tops.
5:44
I have some money left over, let's say, I'm going to add a
5:46
bathroom to my house and I will put the latest hardwood
5:55
floors, so that my family will be impressed.
6:00
You can imagine.
6:01
And maybe I add 2,000 square feet.
6:04
You normally can't get all that for a $100,000 but I
6:06
think you'll bear with me.
6:08
So I'm essentially doing some major home improvements.
6:11
So my question to you is-- is this an investment or is this
6:15
consumption?
6:16
Now, in our everyday world, with most people we deal with,
6:20
they will call this investment in my house.
6:22
And why are they saying that?
6:23
Because they say, by spending a $100,000 in the house in
6:26
this way, that maybe-- if you watch the Home and Garden
6:30
channel, they're doing this all the time-- that if you
6:32
pour this a $100,000 into your house, that maybe the value of
6:36
your house is going to increase by $150,000.
6:39
Or someone else, all of a sudden, is going to perceive
6:41
the value of your house as being $150,000.
6:44
They'll say, well, you got a $50,000 return on investment.
6:48
I'd argue that that is not investment.
6:50
That it's speculation.
6:52
You are, essentially, piling money into this stuff-- and
6:56
I'll do this in red, consumption is red.
7:02
What's happening here truly economically?
7:05
When you add granite, or you add an extra bathroom or
7:08
hardwood floors or this extra 2,000 square feet, is it
7:11
making anyone who's living in that house more productive?
7:14
Is it making you harder working; is it making you more
7:16
likely to invent the cure for cancer, or more likely to
7:20
invent a way of getting cheap energy, or
7:26
produce more widgets?
7:27
No, it's just, if anything, providing more things for you
7:31
to have to take care of, that you're not going to be able to
7:34
focus as much on your work.
7:35
Or more energy is going to have to be extended to
7:37
maintain this type of place, to heat and cool a 2,000
7:41
square foot house.
7:42
So if anything, by actually pouring the $100,000 here,
7:46
you're actually creating something that is going to
7:47
suck more out of society.
7:49
In fact, in no way is this going to contribute to the
7:52
collective wealth of society.
7:53
The last two examples I gave contribute to the collective
7:56
wealth society, some of which you share, and that is your
7:59
return on the investment.
8:00
But as a whole, this is an investment into society.
8:02
And it's going to make the pie bigger.
8:07
This right here, does not make the pie bigger.
8:09
It might make you a little bit happier, make your ego feel a
8:12
little bit better, let your pride grow, and your self
8:15
righteousness grow, and show other people that you've
8:18
arrived, but it's not going to increase
8:21
the wealth of society.
8:22
And when you say that you've invested, you are really just
8:24
saying I've speculated.
8:26
What you're saying is-- by paying this $100,000, you're
8:29
going to find, essentially, a greater fool out there.
8:33
They could have done the same thing, they could have bought
8:34
your house, spent $100,000 and done this, if this is what
8:38
would have made them happy.
8:39
But what you're saying is, essentially, that you're going
8:42
to find somebody out there who's willing to pay $150,000
8:45
extra for something that should
8:47
have only cost $100,000.
8:48
And in fact, if anything, if you use this at all, the value
8:51
of this is going to go down.
8:52
So you're just somehow assuming that the granite
8:56
counter tops that you choose are going to be the taste that
8:58
someone else would like or that the hardwood floors are
9:00
going to be the taste someone else would like.
9:01
I would actually argue that when you customize your house
9:04
in this way, you are creating $100,000 of consumption to
9:08
your taste.
9:09
And I'd be surprised if someone else, truly, is
9:12
willing to pay more than $100,000 unless they're being,
9:15
in some way, irrational or they can finance this because
9:18
it's part of the mortgage.
9:22
Anyway, this is, I think, just the big picture: investment
9:27
adds value to society.
9:29
A simple house adds value to society.
9:31
Consumption is something where people might call it an
9:36
investment because it's kind of speculation.
9:38
One might find some other guy willing to emotionally pay
9:41
more for something.
9:42
But it's money that's burned; it's not creating more value
9:46
for society.

for the modern world?

Now who's the defendant today?
Khan!""
""I see Your Honor is familiar 
with Genghis Khan,
the 13th century warlord whose military
campaigns killed millions
and left nothing 
but destruction in their wake.""
""Objection. First of all,
it's pronounced Genghis Kahn.""
""Really?""
""In Mongolia, yes.
Regardless, he was one of the greatest
leaders in human history.
Born Temüjin, he was left fatherless
and destitute as a child
but went on to overcome constant strife
to unite warring Mongol clans
and forge the greatest empire
the world had seen,
eventually stretching from the Pacific
to Europe's heartland.""
""And what was so great 
about invasion and slaughter?
Northern China lost 2/3 of its population.""
""The Jin Dynasty had long harassed 
the northern tribes,
paying them off to fight each other
and periodically attacking them.
Genghis Khan wasn't about 
to suffer the same fate
as the last Khan who tried 
to unite the Mongols,
and the demographic change may reflect
poor census keeping,
not to mention that many peasants
were brought into the Khan's army.""
""You can pick apart numbers all you want,
but they wiped out entire cities,
along with their inhabitants.""
""The Khan preferred enemies 
to surrender and pay tribute,
but he firmly believed in loyalty
and diplomatic law.
The cities that were massacred were ones
that rebelled after surrendering,
or killed as ambassadors.
His was a 
strict understanding of justice.""
""Multiple accounts show his army's 
brutality going beyond justice:
ripping unborn children 
from mothers' wombs,
using prisoners as human shields,
or moat fillers to support siege engines,
taking all women from conquered towns--""
""Enough! How barbaric!""
""Is that really so much worse 
than other medieval armies?""
""That doesn't excuse 
Genghis Khan's atrocities.""
""But it does make Genghis Khan 
unexceptional for his time

In fact, after his unification
of the tribes abolished bride kidnapping,
women in the Mongol ranks 
had it better than most.
They controlled domestic affairs,
could divorce their husbands,
and were trusted advisors.
Temüjin remained with 
his first bride all his life,
even raising her possibly 
illegitimate son as his own.""
""Regardless, Genghis Khan's 
legacy was a disaster:
up to 40 million killed across Eurasia
during his descendents' conquests.
10% of the world population.
That's not even counting 
casualties from the Black Plague
brought to Europe by 
the Golden Horde's Siege of Kaffa.""

dying of the Plague,
they catapulted infected bodies

of the empire Genghis Khan founded.""
""Benefits?""
""The Mongol Empire practiced
religious tolerance among all subjects,
they treated their soldiers well, promoted
based on merit, rather than birth,
established a vast postal system,
and inforced universal rule of law,
not to mention their 
contribution to culture.""
""You mean like Hulagu Khan's 
annihilation of Baghdad,
the era's cultural capital?
Libraries, hospitals and palaces burned,
irrigation canals buried?""
""Baghdad was unfortunate,
but its Kalif refused to surrender,
and Hulagu was later punished 
by Berke Khan for the wanton destruction.
It wasn't Mongol policy 
to destroy culture.
Usually they saved doctors, scholars
and artisans from conquered places,
and transferred them 
throughout their realm,
spreading knowledge across the world.""
""What about the devastation of Kievan Rus,
leaving its people in the Dark Ages
even as the Renaissance 
spread across Western Europe?""
""Western Europe was hardly 
peaceful at the time.
The stability of Mongol rule
made the Silk Road flourish once more,
allowing trade and cultural exchange
between East and West,
and its legacy forged Russia and China
from warring princedoms
into unified states.
In fact, long after the Empire,
Genghis Khan's descendants could be found
among the ruling nobility 
all over Eurasia.""

further tyrants.""

You may be related.""

from Genghis Khan.

Which of the following timelines has those events in the correct order?",multiple-choices,"Hi, I’m John Green. This is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to talk
about World War II. Finally, a war with some
color film! So, here at Crash Course we try to make
history reasonably entertaining, and fortunately,
World War II was hilarious...said no one ever.

I have to imagine the world more complexly?
Me from the Past, as long as you have that
eighth rate soup-strainer, I’m not even
going to acknowledge your existence.
[theme music]
Right, so you’ve probably heard a lot about
World War II from movies and books, The History
Channel, before it decided that Swamp People
were History, the incessant droning of your
grandparents, etc. We’re not gonna try to
give you a detailed synopsis of the war today.
Instead, we’re going to try to give a bit
of perspective on how the most destructive
war in human history happened, and why it
still matters globally.
So one of the reasons history classes tend
to be really into wars is that they’re easy
to put on tests. They start on one day and
they end on another day. And they’re caused
by social, political, and economic conditions
that can be examined in a multiple choice
kind of manner. Except, not really.
Like, when did World War II start? In September
1939, when the Nazis invaded Poland? I’d
say no - it actually started when Japan invaded
Manchuria in 1931, or at the very latest when
the Japanese invaded China in 1937, because
they didn’t stop fighting until 1945. Then again,
you could also argue 1933, when Hitler took power, or
1941, when America started fighting. It’s complicated.
But anyway, in China the fighting was very
brutal, as exemplified by the infamous rape
of Nanking, which featured the slaughter of
hundreds of thousands of Chinese people and
is still so controversial today that:
1. It affects relations between Japan &amp;amp; China
and
2. Even though I have not described it in
detail, you can rest assured that there will be angry
comments about my use of the word “slaughter.”
But the World War II we know the most about
from movies and TV is primarily the war in
the European theater, the one that Adolf Hitler
started. Hitler is the rare individual who
really did make history - specifically he
made it worse - and if he hadn’t existed,
it’s very unlikely that World War II would’ve
ever happened. But he did exist, and after
coming to power in 1933, with the standard
revolutionary promises to return the homeland
to its former glory, infused with quite a
bit of paranoia and anti-Semitism, Germany
saw rapid re-militarization and eventually,
inevitably, war.
In the beginning, it was characterized by
a new style of combat made possible by the
mechanized technology of tanks, airplanes,
and especially, trucks. This was the Blitzkrieg,
a devastating tactic combining quick movement
of troops, tanks, and massive use of air power
to support infantry movements. And in the
very early years of the war, it was extremely
effective. The Nazis were able to roll over
Poland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands,
and then all of France, all within about 9 months
between the fall of 1939 and the summer of 1940.
So after knocking out most of central Europe,
the Nazis set their sights on Great Britain,
but they didn’t invade the island, choosing
instead to attack it with massive air strikes.
I mean, you look at this poster and think,
“Man, the Queen wants me to finish my term
paper, so I can do it,” but when this poster
was first produced in 1939, it was to quell
terror in the face of bombardment.
The Battle of Britain was a duel between the
Royal Air Force and the Luftwaffe, and while
the RAF denied the Nazis total control of
British airspace, the Nazis were still able
to bomb Great Britain over and over again
in what’s known as the Blitz. STAN, NO.
NO JOKES this time. Yes, the Blitz.
Meanwhile, Europeans were also fighting each
other in North Africa. The Desert campaigns
started in 1940 and lasted through 1942 - this
is where British general “Monty” Montgomery
outfoxed German general Irwin “the Desert
Fox” Rommel. It’s also the place where
Americans first fought Nazis in large numbers.
But most importantly, it’s where Indiana
Jones discovered the Ark of the Covenant.
Okay, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.
1941 was a big year for World War II. First,
the Nazis invaded Russia, breaking a non-aggression
pact that the two powers had signed in 1939.
This hugely escalated the war, and also made
allies of the most powerful capitalist countries
and the most powerful communist one, an alliance
that would stand the test of time and never end... until
like three seconds after the defeat of the Nazis.
The Nazi invasion of Russia opened the war
up on the so-called Eastern Front, although
if you were Russian, it was the Western Front,
and it led to millions of deaths, mostly Russian.
Also, 1941 saw a day that would ""live in infamy""
when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, hoping
that such an audacious attack would frighten
the United States into staying neutral, which
was a pretty stupid gamble because:
1. The U.S. was already giving massive aid
to the Allies and was hardly neutral and
2. The United States is not exactly famed
for its pacifism or political neutrality.
1941 also saw Japan invading much of Southeast
Asia, which made Australia and New Zealand
understandably nervous. As part of the British
commonwealth, they were already involved in
the war, but now they could fight the Japanese
closer to home. And shut up about how I never
talk about you Australians. I just gave you
1.5 sentences.
But by the time the Americans and Australians
started fighting the Japanese, it was already
a World War. Sometimes this meant fighting
or starving or being bombed; other times,
it meant production for the war - you don’t
think of Argentina as being a World War II
powerhouse, for instance, but they were vital
to the Allies, supplying 40% of British meat
during World War II. Thanks, Thought Bubble.
So, not to sound jingoistic, but the entry
of the U.S. into the war really did change
everything, although I doubt the Nazis could’ve
taken Russia regardless. No one conquers Russia
in the wintertime, unless you are - wait for
it - the Mongols.
Okay, we’re going to skip most of the big
battles of 1942 - like the Battle of Midway,
which effectively ended Japan’s chance of
winning the war - and focus on the Battle
of Stalingrad. The German attack on Stalingrad,
now known as Volgograd because Stalin sucks,
was one of the bloodiest battles in the history
of war, with more than two million dead. The
Germans began by dropping more than 1,000
tons of bombs on Stalingrad, and then the
Russians responded by “hugging” the Germans,
staying as close to their front lines as possible
so that German air support would kill Germans
and Russians alike.
This kind of worked, although the Germans
still took most of the city. But then, a Soviet
counterattack left the sixth army of the Nazis
completely cut off. And after that, due partly
to Hitler’s overreaching megalomania and
partly to lots of people being scared of him,
the sixth army slowly froze and starved to
death before finally surrendering. And of
the 91,000 Axis POWs from Stalingrad, only
about 6,000 ever returned home.
Stalingrad turned the war in Europe and by
1944, the American strategy of “island hopping”
in the Pacific was taking GIs closer and closer
to Japan. Rome was liberated in June by Americans
and Canadians; and the successful British,
Canadian, and American D-Day invasion of Normandy
was the beginning of the end for the Nazis.
Oh, it’s time for the Open Letter?
An Open Letter to Canada. But first, let’s
see what’s in the secret compartment today.
Oh, it’s Canadian mittens. I wanna thank
the Canadian Crash Course fans, who sent us
these mittens. Canadians are just so nice,
Stan. Like, all we ever do on this show is
make fun of them, and they’re just like, “It’s so
kind of you to mention us. Here’s some mittens!”
Dear Canada, We’re not always nice to you here on
Crash Course, but you are awesome. I’m pointing,
but you can’t tell because I’m wearing
mittens. 45,000 Canadians died fighting for
the Allies in World War II, which means that, per capita,
Canada lost more people than the United States.
You fought with the Royal Air Force to defend
Great Britain from the beginning of the war
and you were there on D-Day, successfully
invading Juno Beach. And, as many of you have
pointed out in comments, you defeated the
United States in the War of 1812, meaning
that, arguably, Canada, you are the greater
military power.
Plus, you have lumberjacks, and excellent
beer, and hockey, and universal healthcare,
and Justin Bieber. I’m jealous! That's what
it is - I'm jealous!
Best Wishes, John Green.
So, by the end of 1944, the Allies were advancing
from the West and the Russian Red Army was
advancing from the East and then, the last-ditch
German offensive at the battle of the Bulge
in the winter of 1944-1945 failed. Mussolini
was executed in April of 1945. Hitler committed
suicide at the end of that month. And, on
May 8, 1945 the Allies declared victory in
Europe after Germany surrendered unconditionally.
Three months later, the United States dropped
the only two nuclear weapons ever deployed
in war, Japan surrendered, and World War II
was over.
The war had a definite cause: unbridled military
expansion by Germany, Japan, and, to a small
extent, Italy. Now, it’s easy to claim that
Hitler was crazy or evil, and, in fact, he
was certainly both, but that doesn’t explain
the Nazis decision to invade Russia, and it
sure doesn’t explain Japan’s decision
to bomb Pearl Harbor.
And there are many possible explanations beyond
mere evil; but the most interesting one, to
me, involves food. Hitler had a number of
reasons for wanting to expand Germany’s
territory, but he often talked about Lebensraum
or living space for the German people. German
agriculture was really inefficiently organized
into lots of small farms, and that meant that
Germany needed a lot of land in order to be
self-sufficient in food production.
The plan was to take Poland, the Ukraine,
and Eastern Russia, and then resettle that
land with lots of Germans, so that it could
feed German people. This was called the Hunger
Plan because the plan called for 20 million
people to starve to death. Many would be the
Poles, Ukrainians, and Russians who’d previously
lived on the land. The rest would be Europe’s
Jews, who would be worked to death.
Six million Jews were killed by the Nazis,
many by starvation, but many through a chillingly
planned effort of extermination in death camps.
These death camps can be distinguished from
concentration camps or labor camps in that
their primary purpose was extermination of
Jews, Roma people, communists, homosexuals,
disabled people, and others that the Nazis
deemed unfit. Some historians believe that
the Nazis opened the death camps because the
Jews weren’t dying as fast as The Hunger
Plan had intended.
This was a sickening plan, but it made a kind
of demented sense. Rather than becoming more
involved in global trade, as the British had,
the Germans would feed themselves by taking
land and killing the people who’d previously
lived there.
Similarly, Japan, at the beginning of the
war, was suffering from an acute fear of food
shortage because its agricultural sector was
having trouble keeping up with population
growth. And the Japanese too, sought to expand
their agricultural holdings by, for instance,
resettling farmers in Korea.
So while it’s tempting to say that World
War II was about the Allies fighting for democratic
ideals against the totalitarian militaristic
imperialism of the fascist Axis powers, it
just doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. For instance,
a hugely important Allied power, Stalin’s
Soviet Union, was, like, the least democratic
place, ever. Stan just said that was hyperbole,
but it’s not. Stalin’s Soviet Union is
tied with all of the other completely undemocratic
countries for last place on the democracy
scale. It’s a big community there, at last
place, but they’re definitely in there somewhere.
And, by far, the biggest imperialists of the
war were the British. They couldn’t have
fed or clothed themselves - or resisted the
Nazis - without their colonies and commonwealth.
So, why is World War II so important? Well
first, it proved the old Roman adage homo homini
lupus: Man is a wolf to man. This is seen most clearly
in the Holocaust, but all the statistics are staggering.
More than a million Indian British subjects
died, mainly due to famine that could have
been avoided if the British had redistributed
food. And their failure to do so helped convince
Indians that the so-called superior civilization
of the British was a sham. More than a million
Vietnamese died, mainly due to famine. 418,000
Americans. More than a million noncombatants
in both Germany and Japan. And 20 million
people in the Soviet Union, most of them civilians.
These civilians were targeted because they
helped sustain the war, mostly through industrial
and agricultural production. In a total war,
when a nation is at war, not just its army,
there is no such thing as a non-military target.
From the firebombing of Dresden to Tokyo to
Hiroshima, the line between soldier and civilian
blurred.
And then, of course, there is the Holocaust,
which horrifies us because the elements of
Western progress - record-keeping, industrial
production, technology - were used to slaughter
millions. World War II saw modern industrial
nations, which represented the best of the
Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution,
descend into once unimaginable cruelty.
And what makes World War II such a historical
watershed is that in its wake, all of us - in
the West or otherwise - were forced to question
whether Western dominance of this planet could,
or should, be considered progress.

Thanks for that report.we will be talking to you obviously throughout this news cast
0:07
i wanna bring somebody in now i am really excited about having
0:10
in this show. He is totally different from most of the people
0:15
that we talk to. He gained his fame on Youtube of all places
0:18
where people go to see how he explains things
0:21
that many of us frankly don't understand. so, let's start with the basics
0:24
Sal Khan, thanks for being with us from Khan Academy by the way.
0:31
Basic question, explain to our
0:33
viewers, explain to the million people out there. what is actually
0:36
broken that we need to fix. Right! right now
0:41
we have so many, stock market goes down every day and people having for
0:45
closures and banks are stopping lending. so
0:49
it is really hard for the people to keep track what is the problem. Are these causes of the problems
0:51
or they the actual problems. so i think we did a step back to a durdle diagram here
0:59
let's put it up, durdle diagram here and i think there is
1:01
this basic fundamental question here that we all have to ask
1:05
is what does the financial system do? they make a lot of money. hopefully,
1:09
they add some value to our economy and this diagram essentially
1:13
explains what the financial system does. so in a
1:16
capitalist economy you have a lot of people with capital that could be land, that could be gold
1:19
that could be animals,that could be cash
1:26
and what you need to do in order to make the economy grow is to
1:29
invest that capital into projects, build factories
1:33
plough seeds,hire people and what the financial system
1:37
does. the banks and the markets, they take that capital
1:41
and hopefully they allocate it on projects that put people to
1:46
work, hire people, grow our GDP. The problem right now
1:50
is, as opposed to financial system putting more capital
1:54
into the real world, it's more concerned with
1:58
self-preservation at the moment. they are in a kind of survival mode and because they
2:00
are in survival mode, you don't have this flow of capital going from
2:06
whoever has it to the financial system and then to the projects.you pretty much have everything
2:10
just going back into the financial system because it's
2:13
essentially in survival mode. so, i see
2:17
the financial system in the middle why is that piece broken
2:22
Draw that one up first. sure, and here i am going to
2:27
attempt to get everyone to a five-minute MBA
2:30
but essentially what i have drawn here are balance sheet for some banks
2:34
and it might sound like a complicated term but a balance sheet is, i think something
2:38
that most people are fairly familiar with when they talk about the home equity so
2:42
if i will draw a balance sheet for someone's house it would look something like this
2:46
so the asset would be your house
2:51
whatever its worth and then your liability and would call 'A' for asset
2:53
and then your liability would be the mortgage
2:56
your liability would be the loan. now if your house is
3:02
worth of a million dollars and your loan let's say you owe
3:06
$8,000 in your loan whatever is leftover is your
3:10
equity, that's the balance sheet which most people are
3:14
fairly familiar with. The corporations have exact same notion
3:18
and i think it's the important point to realise when people talk about the stock market and
3:22
what does it mean a company starts to go to zero. when you
3:26
buy a stock in a company you essentially are not buying a share in all of its assets,
3:29
you are buying a share in its equity so,if you look at the
3:35
two banks and i would talk about more what is broken
3:38
but a bank has assets and a bank has liabilities
3:43
for which you take some of the assets and you subtract the liabilities what's leftover
3:47
is essentially is the equity and you buy stock in a bank or in any company
3:51
you essentially are taking a share of that so what's broken here
3:55
is through the housing bubble a lot of these banks in order to
3:58
facilitate this whole securitization, i can go into more detail what that is
4:03
essentially accumulated these assets on their balance sheets and this
4:07
has been the central focus of the entire bailout plan and
4:11
there has been a lot of talk about Toxic CDOs and what are they
4:14
i just wanna show what they do to a bank's balance sheet and why it's so important
4:18
that we figure out what these things are worth because what you see here i drew
4:24
the kind of height on this left hand side of the asset, the height's right hand side
4:27
is liability, what's leftover is equity. if these Toxic CDOs
4:31
are worth nothing if this disappeared and then all of a sudden
4:36
your assets are less than your liabilities.
4:39
if you house is worth less than your mortgage then you have no equity
4:43
in that situation your stock would be worthless and in that situation there is no reason why
4:47
anyone should be lending to you because you are essentially throwing good money after bad
4:51
so essentially, the situation the banks find themselves in is the same
4:56
as the as one homeowners would have found themselves in as a result of that.
5:00
pretty much, as homeowner you have an asset which is worth less than your liability. what you do
5:03
you try to get someone to bail you out and buy your asset for more than its worth
5:09
or you just claim bankruptcy. that's all for now, we gonna comeback
5:12
in just a little bit and continue our conversation. we will also be bringing you
5:15
you something that is very exclusive to this particular hour
5:19
on the CNN the story of kerbal, who is kerbal
5:23
he may just be the only person which administration used
5:26
as their source for going to war in Iraq or certainly
5:30
as much as anyone else. was he right? no,
5:33
who is he? no one knows upto now, an exclusive interview
5:37
with kerbal,stay with us we will be right back
5:52
twitter.com/ricksanchezcnn
5:54
so many of you… 23000 i believe when we last checked
5:58
are talking to us, watching this newscast as well as on Myspace and facebook
6:02
infact we have somebody on My space righ now. she is watching our show and just wanna us to know this
6:06
she says my son is 17 and excited about college. i am worried that
6:09
we won't be able to get a loan to send him now. My husband hours have been cut from work as well.
6:14
This absolutely affects all of America And that's why we are doing
6:18
what we are trying to do for you. let's go back now and bring in Sal, if we can, Sal Khan
6:23
He explained to us a few moments ago what it is, that is
6:26
actually the problem, what it is that is broken
6:30
Now,let's take the next step let's try and understand because everyone seems
6:35
to be wondering i don't understand this bailout/rescue plan the government has been in
6:38
what is the government actually doing, explain that to us
6:43
so we can understand like a fifth grader. Right, so the main problem
6:48
as to picture wise, no one is lending to each other so what the government at least said
6:50
what they wanted to do is try to get the lending start again so their bailout plan
6:55
was essentially, let's buyout these Toxic CDOs because if i am a
7:00
good bank they didn't get involved in this. if the bank is holding
7:04
these Toxic CDOs. i am not sure if bank a) should be bankrupt if the Toxic CDOs are
7:08
worth nothing or b) may be there are good for the money
7:11
so there is a lot of uncertainty of what these are of worth. the government at least what they said
7:16
it would do if they went in it will essentially reverse these auctions
7:20
and bought these assets. then that all of a sudden would give confidence in these banks.
7:25
and there wouldn't be uncertainty as to whether you can loan the money
7:28
and may be that will free up the credit the whole system again
7:32
well,will it work? probably not, if you think about what's going to happen psychologically
7:37
so bank A let’s say, if you just switch
7:42
these Toxic CDOs and if you just turn that back into cash because the government just bought it
7:46
for exactly what the bank A says it's worth
7:49
so if you just turn this into cash, the question is the bank A all of a sudden is going to start lending
7:55
and a couple of things to think about because of the size of the Toxic CDOs there are
7:58
other things on its balance sheet and frankly, a lot of these things are starting to
8:03
get a little bit Toxic. Nobody is talking about them right now because if you have a debt continuing
8:07
how you gonna notice the milks
8:10
going bad so essentially, you have a lot of assets
8:13
on your balance sheet right here and if you are a prudent bank manager you are going to see
8:16
you gonna say i will just keep that cash because if turn Toxic
8:21
because the economy might be turning slow or for whatever reason. i should just hold on to that cash
8:26
so that i don't go bankrupt so everyone is in complete survival mode even the good banks
8:30
if somehow you would give them capital and process
8:34
new version of the plan then essentially they will inject equity. so buy stock, if you buy stock
8:36
you will essentially make this pile bigger and put some cashier here
8:44
but even this guy, the good bank is not so clear to me
8:47
that he will actually start lending everyone is in survival mode this isn't the time
8:50
to make new loans and take on new roles
8:52
so it seems like when govt. went in and they decided what we gonna do, we gonna go and help these guys out. as soon as we will help them out
8:58
everybody will realize now they have the government backing so other people would be
9:02
interested in helping them. more people would give them their money
9:06
that hasn't worked. the people and other investors haven't
9:12
gone into that. when we come back, i wanna hear your idea
9:15
of what perhaps the government should have done or could still do
9:19
to rescue this. It’s unique it’s different and you and i have talked about this but
9:24
i wanna you to be able to show to our viewers. also kerbal
9:27
the story we would have been telling you, this is going to be CNN exclusive to this hour
9:32
about one particular individual who no one has ever talked to before, he speaks German
9:35
and Arabic. you will hear his conversation here
9:39
in next 10 minutes. be right back
9:55
now we understand what actually is broken. we got a sense that government tried
10:01
to do to fix it but it doesn't seem to be working because people/
10:04
investors and regular folks don't seem to be buying into it.
10:08
let's bring in Sal Khan once again from Khan Academy and talk about
10:12
what may be done either a) would have been the original plan
10:16
it would have worked a lot better or b) something we can still do now and that's.
10:21
so the big picture, going back to the big picture, in the financial system
10:24
no one is lending through. every bail-out plan so far as governement
10:29
keeps injecting money either through loans
10:31
either through buying assets may be more than the worth or may be buying stocks.
10:36
and the logic here is that may that will start up the lending
10:39
but most probably any new money
10:42
you put into the system, for the large degree it's going to go into the survival mode
10:44
or it's gonna go to essentially make up mistakes which already have been made
10:49
so one idea and this actually came from a friend of mine Tard Plusky
10:53
it sounded crazy when he first said it but actually sounds like really good idea is, take that
10:57
$700 billion, remember the problem isn't you are not trying to save
11:01
the financial system, you are trying to save the pipe, the goal from the capital to projects
11:06
so why not take the 700 billion and capitalize the brand new
11:10
financial system and one thing
11:14
that Tard has pointed out 700 billion is astronomical amount of money
11:18
that's more than the book value of the equity. book equity is this piece, right here
11:22
on the balance sheet then JP Morgan,Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs,
11:25
Washington Mutual, wachovia and Bank of America combine
11:30
so government could overnight create banks bigger than those banks and i don't think they should concentrate on these five or six banks
11:36
so in other way, you are saying why try and put money
11:40
into something that is so absolutely messed up. if they have dead
11:44
let them die. create a new system altogether and that won't be a problem too
11:46
because those banks we own by the government, do we want them back? no
11:53
and this is the solution and first of all just to make the point clear the policies' current solution
11:58
involves government ownership, in this plan what you could do
12:01
government can capitalize the banks may be 20 or 30 banks around the country with the $700b and then each of
12:07
those banks could have 300 million shares and they give one share to every American
12:12
new banks, totally new banks.. interesting
12:16
Sal Khan, we will keep you on we gonna be talking about this throughout the hour
12:20
obviously, we are trying to get the people who can explain some of these things
12:25
what's the market doing right now let's have a look as we past weekend.
12:29
down 71 a lot better than what we were looking at an hour ago
12:32
may be you were heard Sal in some piece
12:35
hopefully, we gonna come back to that hopefully but obviously one of the key stories we have been serving throughout the day. the story of Kerbal
12:42
the man who have been the source, the influence of the invasion of Iraq
12:47
as we expected Sal Khan is a bit of heard, that’s thing kind of differently. doesn't it?
12:51
a lot of you have comments and questions including this one let's go and pick some
12:58
this one comes from Sanchfan he watches this show a lot like everyday
13:02
he says keep Khan talking look the market is going up
13:07
fairly it had been, I didn’t notice that.
13:10
we were so engaged in conversation let's do this for a quick i wanna just step away from this for a moment
13:15
Khan, tell us if you could if we bring it back to the basics
13:19
how we are being affected by ushering of the news everyday. the credit crunch
13:24
and the situation of the market. sure, if we don't unclock the credit system
13:28
we know it's gonna unlever their debt. so we gonna have deleverage
13:32
that's essentially everyone on winding their loans. Deleverage, and this is
13:35
i think is the critical point because there is a lot of misinformation out there that actually
13:39
contracts the money supply. so a lot of people out there are worried about inflation
13:44
these deficits that lead to inflation. but when you have deleverage, this has happened in Japan
13:47
this is what happened in thirties, the money supply contracts. that's our printing press
13:51
the leverages are printing press and that affect the credit system and that's gonna lead to deflation

so i think a lot of people are worried about we gonna see inflation
14:00
or we gonna see the deflation and if we don't fix the problem we gonna see
14:04
like Japan saw deflation
14:07
what deflation means concretely to me and you. Things get cheaper,
14:12
the opposite of inflation. unfortunately, may be salaries go down.
14:17
but on the plus side,a lot of assets like people buying houses
14:20
would get cheaper that probably won't be a good thing in a short term
14:24
yeah exactly, now i can understand what the situation is right now.thank you Sal Khan

khan_video_4-fEvpVNTlE_30,9:49 - so the reaction is more likely to go in the forward direction right?,Essay,"•
0:01
Let's say we had the reaction
0:02
molecule A plus molecule B is in dynamic equilibrium
0:09
with molecules C plus D.
0:12
Which just means that the rate of the forward reaction
0:15
is going at the same rate as the backward reaction,
0:18
or the reverse reaction.
0:19
There will be some equilibrium concentrations
0:22
of A, B, C, and D,
0:24
and we can figure out what the equilibrium constant is
0:25
if we want.
0:26
And I'll say it again.
0:28
I've said it like four times so far.
0:29
The fact that the forward reaction rate
0:32
is the same as the backward reaction rate
0:34
doesn't mean that all of the concentrations are the same.
0:36
The concentrations themselves of each of the molecules
0:38
could be very different.
0:40
They're just not changing anymore
0:41
because the forward and backward rates are the same.
0:43
Now, given this, given that we're at equilibrium now,
0:48
what's going to happen if I add more A to the system?
0:51
So remember, it was in equilibrium.
0:54
The concentrations were constant.
0:57
But now all of a sudden, i'm adding more A to the system.
1:00
So now, the odds of an A and a B particle,
1:04
even though I'm not adding
1:05
any more B molecule to the system,
1:07
the odds are slightly higher
1:09
that an A and a B are going to collide
1:11
in just the right way,
1:13
so the forward reaction is going to be more likely.
1:16
So if we add more A to the system,
1:18
you're going to have more A's.
1:20
They're going to bump with more B's,
1:22
so the B's are actually going
1:23
to go down a little bit, right?
1:25
Because more B's are going to be consumed.
1:27
And even more important,
1:29
the C's and D's are going to definitely be increased.
1:33
And the way it would really happen,
1:35
you would add more A.
1:36
Those A's would bump into some more B's,
1:39
and so this forward reaction, all of a sudden,
1:42
it's rate would go faster than this backward reaction.
1:44
So the reaction would go in that direction.
1:46
Then you would have more C's and D's
1:48
and maybe some of those are more likely to bump
1:49
and go back in this direction.
1:51
Eventually, you would reach a new equilibrium.
1:54
But the bottom line is you'll be left with more A,
1:57
a little bit less B
1:59
because you didn't add more B.
2:01
So more B's going to be used to consume
2:04
with those extra A's you just added.
2:05
And then those are going to produce more C's and D's
2:08
in equilibrium.
2:09
And you can imagine, if you added more A and more B,
2:12
let's say if you added more B as well,
2:15
then the reaction is going
2:19
to go in the forward direction even more.
2:22
I don't think this is an amazing insight of the world.
2:27
I think this is kind of obvious,
2:28
that if you stress this reaction
2:31
by adding more on this side,
2:33
that naturally it's going to move in the direction
2:36
that relieves the stress.
2:38
So if you add more A,
2:39
you're going to have more A's bumping with B's
2:41
and go in that direction
2:43
and maybe consume a little bit more B's.
2:44
If you add more of both,
2:45
the whole thing's going to go in that direction. Likewise
2:47
-- let me rewrite the reaction.
2:49
I'll do it in a different color.
2:52
A plus B, dynamic equilibrium, C plus D.
2:57
If I add more C
3:01
-- I think you get the point here--
3:04
what's going to happen?
3:05
Well, that's going to drive A and B up,
3:07
and it's maybe going to consume a little bit extra D.
3:10
And then if you added more C and D,
3:13
then, of course, it's going to produce a lot more A and B.
3:18
And this idea, it seems pretty common sense,
3:22
but there's a fancy name for it, and it's called Le
3:25
-- let me put a capital L-- Chatelier's principle.
3:31
Chatelier's principle.
3:35
If you've watched enough of these videos,
3:37
you know I have to be careful with my spelling.
3:40
And all it says is that
3:44
when you stress a reaction that's in equilibrium,
3:48
the reaction will favor the side
3:50
or one side of the reaction to relieve that stress.
3:54
When they say stress the reaction,
3:55
that's like adding more A,
3:56
so the reaction's going to move towards
3:58
the forward direction to relieve the stress
4:00
-- the quote, unquote stress--
4:02
of that more A.
4:05
I mean, that's not stress in its traditional way
4:08
of thinking about stress,
4:09
but that is a kind of stress.
4:10
You're somehow changing it relative to it.
4:12
It was nice and comfortable
4:13
before in a nice, stable environment.
4:15
So given Le Chatelier's principle,
4:17
let's think of some other situations.
4:18
Let's say if I had A plus B plus some heat,
4:24
and that produces some C plus D.
4:35
And maybe it produces some E as well.
4:38
So if I were to add heat to this system,
4:41
what would happen?
4:43
So in order for the reaction to progress
4:47
in the forward direction, you need heat.
4:50
The more heat you have,
4:51
the more likely you're going
4:53
to progress in the forward direction.
4:54
So Le Chatelier's principle will say
4:58
we're stressing this reaction by adding heat,
5:00
so the reaction will favor the direction
5:03
that relieves that stressor.
5:05
And so to relieve that stressor,
5:07
you have more of this input,
5:08
so you're going to consume more A.
5:11
So the stable concentration of A
5:13
once we reach equilibrium will go down.
5:15
B will go down because they're going to be consumed more.
5:18
The forward reaction is happening more.
5:20
And then C, D, and E would go up.
5:23
Now, if you did the opposite.
5:24
Let me erase what I just did.
5:26
Let's say instead of adding heat,
5:34
you were to take away heat.
5:36
So let's say you were to take away heat.
5:40
Let me make sure my cursor's right.
5:42
So if you took heat away from the reaction,
5:45
what will be favored?
5:46
Well, then you're going to be favoring it
5:49
in the other direction
5:50
because there'll be less heat here.
5:53
I mean, all of this is together.
5:54
There'll be less heat for this reaction to occur,
5:57
so this rate will start dominating this rate over here,
6:01
right? If you take away heat,
6:02
the rate of this reaction will slow down,
6:04
this one will be bigger,
6:05
and so you'll have more movement of concentration
6:07
in that direction,
6:09
or the reverse reaction will be favored.
6:12
Now, let's think of another stressor
6:14
-- pressure.
6:15
Now, imagine that we had--
6:17
we mentioned the Haber process before,
6:19
and this is the reaction for the Haber process.
6:22
Nitrogen gas plus 3 moles of hydrogen gas
6:27
in equilibrium with 2 moles of ammonia gas.
6:33
Now, what's going to happen
6:37
if I apply pressure to this system?
6:38
I'm going to apply pressure.
6:42
So if you think about what happens with pressure,
6:48
everything all of a sudden is getting squeezed,
6:52
although the volume isn't necessarily decreasing,
6:54
but something is somehow
6:56
making all the molecules want to be
6:58
or forcing them to be closer together.
6:59
Now, when things are getting closer together,
7:02
the stress of the pressure could be relieved
7:05
if we end up with fewer molecules.
7:08
Think about it this way.
7:11
PV is equal to nRT.
7:14
We learned this multiple times, right?
7:16
And let's say we could write P is equal to nRT/V.
7:23
Now, if we increase the pressure,
7:31
how can we relieve that?
7:33
Remember, Le Chatelier's principle says that
7:37
whatever's going to happen
7:38
is going to relieve the stressor.
7:40
The reaction is going to go in the direction
7:41
that it relieves it.
7:42
Well, if we lower the number of molecules,
7:46
then that will relieve the pressure, right?
7:48
You'll have fewer things bouncing against each other.
7:51
So if we lower the number of molecules
7:52
where you can kind of view it
7:55
-- I mean, I shouldn't have written it this way,
7:58
because it's not quite an equation,
7:59
but I want you to think of it that way.
8:00
Let me erase this.
8:03
This probably wasn't the best intuition.
8:09
If I have a container
8:11
-- nope, too shocking.
8:13
If I-- nope, same thing.
8:16
If I have a container
8:19
and I'm applying pressure to it,
8:21
and in one option I could have 2 molecules--
8:27
let's say I could have 4 molecules in some volume.
8:34
And in another situation, let's say they get merged
8:37
and I only have 2 molecules, right?
8:40
In either of these, the reaction can go between these,
8:43
these 4 could merge to make 2 molecules.
8:46
Actually, let me use this example up here.
8:48
Let's say this nitrogen molecule
8:51
is this blue one here.
8:52
Actually, let me do it in a more different color.
8:53
This brown one right here,
8:55
it can merge with 3 hydrogen. It could produce this.
8:57
So this is another way of writing this reaction,
9:01
maybe in a more visual way.
9:02
Now, if I'm applying pressure,
9:04
if I'm applying pressure to this system,
9:06
so pressure I just imagine is
9:09
kind of more force per area from every direction,
9:12
which of these situations is more likely
9:16
to relieve the situation?
9:17
Well, the situation
9:19
where we have fewer molecules bumping around
9:21
because it's easier to kind of apply
9:24
or I guess squeeze them together than
9:27
when you have more molecules bumping around.
9:29
I'm doing this very hand wavy,
9:30
but I think it gives you the intuition.
9:32
So if you apply pressure to the system,
9:34
if pressure goes up, you're applying--
9:38
this doesn't mean the pressure goes down.
9:40
This means pressure is applying to the system.
9:41
But the pressure is going up,
9:43
what side of the reaction is going to be favored?
9:45
The reaction's going to
9:46
be favoring the side of that has fewer molecules.
9:49
And this side has 2 molecules,
9:51
although they'll be bigger molecules obviously,
9:54
because it's not like we're losing mass
9:56
in one direction or the other,
9:57
as opposed to this situation
9:58
where we have 4 molecules, right?
10:00
1 mole of nitrogen gas and 3 moles of hydrogen.
10:04
And just to bring this all back to the whole idea
10:08
that we saw earlier with the kinetic equilibrium,
10:13
let's just imagine a reaction like this.
10:15
And to show that it works with Le Chatelier's principle
10:18
is consistent with everything
10:20
we've learned with equilibrium constants.
10:23
So let's say we had the reaction 2 moles,
10:27
or the coefficient of two,
10:29
2 A's in the gaseous form plus B in the gaseous form
10:34
is in equilibrium with C in the gaseous form.
10:38
And let's say initially where our first equilibrium,
10:42
our concentration of A is 2 molar,
10:46
or our molarity is 2,
10:48
our concentration of B is 6 molar concentration,
10:55
and then our concentration of C is 8 molar.
10:59
So what's the equilibrium constant here?
11:02
The equilibrium constant here is the product,
11:07
concentration of C,
11:08
that's 8 molar divided by 2 molar squared,
11:14
because of this, 2 squared times 6.
11:19
Which is equal to 8/24, which is equal to 1/3.
11:25
Now, let's say we were to add more A,
11:28
and I'm not going to say exactly how much.
11:30
We could actually get quite complicated
11:32
with the mathematics,
11:33
but let's say after adding more A,
11:34
we have a new concentration.
11:36
Now, let's say our concentration of A is 3 molar.
11:40
You might say, hey, Sal, didn't you add 1 molar?
11:43
No.
11:44
I actually added probably more than 1 molar.
11:47
What happens is, whatever I added,
11:49
that'll push the reaction towards the right direction,
11:52
or towards the forward direction,
11:54
and so some of it will get consumed
11:56
and go in that direction,
11:57
but whatever's left over is here.
11:59
So I might have added more than 1 molar concentration
12:02
to this system.
12:04
But whatever was extra beyond the 1 was consumed,
12:07
and I'm just left with this equilibrium concentration of 3.
12:10
So I didn't necessarily add 1.
12:13
I could've added more than that.
12:14
And let's say that our new equilibrium for C is 12 molar,
12:20
which is consistent with what we say.
12:23
We should be producing
12:24
-- if we add some A,
12:27
then our concentration of C should go up,
12:30
and the intuition is that
12:32
the concentration of B should go down a little bit,
12:34
because a little bit more B is going to be consumed,
12:36
because it's going to be colliding with
12:38
-- or it's more likely to collide with--
12:40
more A particles or A molecules.
12:42
So let's see what B's new concentration is.
12:45
So remember, the equilibrium constant stays constant.
12:51
So our equilibrium constant is now going to
12:54
be equal to the concentration of C, right?
12:57
That was the reaction.
12:58
So it's 12 molar
12:59
-- whoops--
13:02
I don't have to write the units here
13:04
-- divided by our new concentration of A, that's 3.
13:08
But remember the reaction.
13:10
The coefficient on A is 2.
13:12
So it's 3 squared
13:14
times the new concentration for B, right?
13:20
There's no coefficient here
13:21
so I don't have to worry about any exponents.
13:23
And let's just solve this.
13:25
So you get 1/3 is equal to 12 over 9B.
13:31
So if we just cross-multiply,
13:34
we get 9 times the concentration of B
13:39
is equal to 3 times 12, which is 36.
13:44
And so divide both sides by 9.
13:47
The new concentration of B is 4, or 4 molar.
13:52
So B is equal to 4 molar.
13:57
So that makes sense.
13:58
We added some more A to the reaction.
14:00
So we started with 2 molar of A,
14:03
6 molar of B, 8 molar of C.
14:06
When we added more A, at the end, we added a bunch.
14:10
It went in that direction,
14:11
maybe it went back and forth a little bit,
14:12
but it stabilized at 3 molar of A, 12 molar of C,
14:17
so C went up, so that definitely went up.
14:20
And notice, our stable equilibrium concentration of B
14:25
actually went down,
14:27
and this is consistent with what we were saying,
14:29
that the reaction moves in that direction,
14:30
more C gets produced,
14:32
a little bit of B gets consumed.
14:33
So anyway, hopefully you're fairly comfortable now
14:36
with the whole notion of stressing a reaction
14:39
and Le Chatelier's principle.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,4-fEvpVNTlE,
khan_video_a9QtIfPIQl4_30,Was the Chinese Civil War of 1946-1949 a continuation of the Civil War of 1927-1936?,Essay,"•
0:00
For those of you who are just starting
0:02
to learn about the history of China
0:04
in the first half of the 20th century,
0:07
it can be a little bit confusing.
0:09
So the goal of this video is really to give you an overview,
0:13
to give you a scaffold, of the history of the first half
0:17
of the 20th century in China.
0:19
So as we go into the early 1900s,
0:22
you have the end of imperial dynastic rule in China.
0:27
This is a big deal.
0:28
China has been ruled by various dynasties
0:31
for multiple thousands of years.
0:34
But as you get into the 1900s, the dynastic rule,
0:38
in particular the Qing Dynasty, was getting weaker and weaker.
0:43
It had suffered at the hands of the Japanese
0:45
during the first Sino-Japanese War at the end of the 1800s.
0:50
There was growing discontent amongst the opposition
0:53
that the dynasty, that the emperors,
0:55
were not modernizing China enough.
0:57
Remember, this is the early 1900s.
0:59
The rest of the world was becoming a very, very modern
1:01
place.
1:02
China in the 1800s had suffered at the hands of Western powers
1:06
who were essentially exerting their own imperial influence
1:10
in China.
1:11
Many people felt that this was because China was not
1:14
as modernized economically, politically,
1:17
technologically as it needed to be.
1:20
And so you fast-forward to 1911.
1:22
You have what is known as the Wuchang Uprising, which
1:26
led to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty.
1:30
By 1912, a Republic of China was established in Nanjing.
1:35
So Nanjing right over here was where it was established.
1:38
Beijing was, of course, the seat of dynastic rule in China.
1:43
And the first provisional president
1:45
of the Republic of China was Dr. Sun Yat-sen, right over here.
1:51
And he actually did not directly participate
1:53
in this final uprising that finally
1:55
led to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty.
1:59
He was actually in Denver at the time, Denver, Colorado.
2:02
But he was a leading or one of the leading figures in the run
2:05
up to this uprising, one of the leading figures
2:07
who was providing opposition and had tried
2:10
multiple times to overthrow the dynasty.
2:13
Now along with Sun Yat-sen, he was essentially in cahoots
2:17
with Yuan Shikai, who was a general in the old dynasty.
2:21
And he has his own fascinating history.
2:24
And Sun Yat-sen struck a deal with Yuan Shikai,
2:27
who was very politically ambitious.
2:30
Yuan Shikai said, hey, if I can get the emperor Puyi, who
2:33
was the last emperor of China, if I can get him to officially
2:37
abdicate, I want to become the president.
2:40
So Sun Yat-sen agrees to this.
2:43
So Yuan Shikai becomes the president
2:48
of the Republic of China.
2:50
But that wasn't enough for him.
2:52
He declares himself emperor in 1915,
2:56
which you could imagine did not make many people happy
2:58
because they were tired of having emperors.
3:01
And by 1916, he abdicates and he passes away, actually.
3:06
And this actually begins a period
3:09
of extremely fragmented rule for China.
3:13
Even under imperial rule, the Chinese military
3:16
was not one consolidated body.
3:18
The military was controlled by various warlords
3:21
in various regions that all had allegiance to the emperor.
3:25
Once you have Yuan Shikai abdicating and then dying
3:29
in 1916, and even prior to that, when
3:31
he declared himself emperor, people
3:33
did not want to pledge allegiance to Yuan Shikai.
3:37
And so you had what is known as the beginning of the Warlord
3:40
Era in China.
3:42
And this is a fragmented period where you did not
3:44
have any centralized leadership.
3:47
This map over here shows kind of the rough picture
3:51
of what the Warlord Era looked like.
3:53
Each of these regions were controlled
3:55
by a different warlord who was in charge
3:57
of a different military.
3:59
When this was going on during the Warlord Era,
4:02
especially as we go back to the early '20s, in 1921
4:05
in particular, Sun Yat-sen hasn't given up.
4:09
He goes to the south in Guangzhou
4:12
and sets up, essentially, a revolutionary government,
4:16
essentially a desire from there to try
4:19
to consolidate power in China again and reestablish
4:23
the Republic of China.
4:25
So he goes there.
4:27
But unfortunately he passes away in 1925 from cancer.
4:32
And the hands or the power of the movement that he started,
4:38
which is now being referred to as the Kuomintang-- Let me
4:42
write that down.
4:53
Essentially, the power there passes on
4:56
to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.
5:00
And Chiang Kai-shek, the reason why
5:01
we say the power essentially goes to him
5:03
is because he was in control of the major part
5:05
of the military forces of the Kuomintang.
5:09
And this is essentially the very nascent early stages
5:13
of what would essentially be the Chinese Civil
5:15
War because in the period from 1921 until Sun Yat-sen's death,
5:22
you actually had a lot of collaboration
5:24
between the Chinese nationalists, the Kuomintang,
5:27
and the Soviet Union, and the Chinese Communist Party.
5:31
They were trying to collaborate in order
5:33
to think about how China would unify.
5:36
But then once Sun Yat-sen dies and the power of the Kuomintang
5:41
essentially goes into the hands of Generalissimo Chiang
5:44
Kai-shek, he starts to consolidate power.
5:48
And right from the get-go, he doesn't
5:50
antagonize the communists.
5:51
But by 1927, he's starting to consolidate,
5:56
he's starting to merge these various factions
6:01
in the rest of China.
6:02
So he's able to consolidate power.
6:04
But he also starts to go after the communists.
6:08
So Chiang Kai-shek, by '27, also starts
6:11
to go after the communists.
6:13
And the communists are saying, hey, we
6:14
are the ones that really represent the spirit of what
6:18
Sun Yat-sen represented, while the Kuomintang
6:21
under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek said, no, no, no.
6:23
We represent what Sun Yat-sen represented when he first
6:28
established the Republic of China.
6:31
And so in 1927, you have the beginning of the Chinese Civil
6:36
War.
6:37
This is when the Kuomintang, as part of its efforts
6:39
to consolidate power, not only tries
6:41
to consolidate power of the warlords,
6:43
but also goes after the Communist Party.
6:46
Now while all of this is happening,
6:48
as we get into the early 1930s, Japan once again
6:53
is trying to exert its imperial, its military,
6:56
might on the Chinese mainland.
6:58
They had already captured Formosa,
7:00
which is now known as Taiwan, and Korea
7:03
during the first Sino-Japanese War at the end of the 1800s.
7:07
And then in 1931, the Japanese start to encroach on Manchuria.
7:16
And this would essentially become a multi-year occupation
7:19
and infiltration of Japan into China.
7:23
And this continues all the way until 1937,
7:26
when it becomes an official all-out war
7:29
between the Japanese and the Chinese.
7:32
And I have a map here that shows kind
7:35
of the maximum Japanese control over this period.
7:40
And so in east Asia between the Chinese and the Japanese,
7:43
World War II was really just part of the Sino-Japanese War.
7:49
The Japanese had already encroached
7:51
on the mainland of China well before World War
7:56
II had officially begun.
7:58
Now while all this is happening, Japan
8:01
is encroaching into Manchuria, in 1934, you have to remember,
8:04
the Kuomintang, the Nationalist Party under Chiang Kai-shek
8:08
is going after the communists.
8:11
And in 1934, he almost has them, or he does.
8:16
The communists are nearly defeated.
8:20
They're surrounded by the Nationalist Party.
8:22
And this becomes what is a fairly famous event
8:25
in Chinese history, the famous Long March, where
8:28
the Chinese Communist Party, their military,
8:31
is marched through extremely tough terrain
8:34
all the way to the northwest of China.
8:38
So this right over here is a map of the Long March.
8:42
The Chinese Communist Party seemed to be on the ropes
8:46
here in 1934.
8:48
And it was during this Long March
8:50
that Mao Zedong really started to exert and show leadership.
8:55
The leadership during this Long March,
8:57
during this retreat to the northwest of China,
9:00
is really what allowed Mao Zedong to eventually take
9:02
control of the Chinese Communist Party.
9:06
Now as we fast forward, we know that the Sino-Japanese War--
9:10
you could view this as one theater, eventually, of World
9:12
War II-- eventually the US goes in on the side
9:16
of the Allies against Japan after Pearl Harbor.
9:19
And then in 1945, you have the attacks
9:25
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic weapons,
9:27
which essentially ends the Pacific theater.
9:30
It's defeat for Japan, and Japan has lost World War II.
9:36
And at this point, full-scale civil war
9:38
between the two parties break out again.
9:40
The Civil War started in 1927, and then it kept continuing.
9:45
But then once there was a common enemy in Japan that was clearly
9:48
aggressively trying to take over more and more of China's
9:53
people, resources, exert its imperial influence,
9:56
then you had the two parties kind of go into a low-grade war
9:59
and say, hey, we need to fight these Japanese.
10:01
But once World War II ended in 1945,
10:04
once the Japanese were defeated, then you
10:06
had full-scale civil war break out
10:08
again between the Chinese Communist
10:10
Party and the Kuomintang.
10:12
And this is probably one of the biggest comebacks in history.
10:14
This was the Chinese Communist Party that in 1934 and 1935
10:18
looked like they were on the ropes.
10:20
They were forced into, essentially, retreat.
10:23
They were able to come back.
10:25
And in 1949-- and there's a lot of theories
10:28
as to why they were able to pull this off.
10:31
That they were able to get much more of the support
10:33
from the rural population.
10:35
They were more savvy about getting support generally
10:37
than the Kuomintang.
10:38
But we could talk about that in a future video.
10:41
But by 1949, they were able to defeat
10:44
Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang,
10:46
force the Kuomintang to retreat to Taiwan,
10:53
establish government in Taiwan.
10:56
And ever since then, you had the establishment
10:58
by the Chinese Communist Party in 1949

You have reached the first checkpoint
0:02
in the 'Journey to cryptography'-series.
0:04
And now I want to talk about what's next,
0:07
because I'm working on a new series.
0:09
However, this one won't end here.
0:11
If anything, we are kind of at the beginning still.
0:14
So I'm going to do 3 different checkpoint videos.
0:17
This one is on 'Advanced Lessons'.
0:20
However, I also want to eventually talk about Tests and Challenges,
0:24
and what we can do with more interactive explorations
0:27
and computer science lessons as it applies to cryptography.
0:31
But for now, let's talk about Advanced Lessons.
0:33
When I say 'Advanced', I don't necessarily mean 'harder lessons',
0:37
I mean 'more detailed'.
0:39
Let me give you a conceptual idea
0:41
for what I think this series could be and future series.
0:45
I like to think of each series as the trunk of a tree,
0:48
where I took you from prehistoric times
0:51
to around the 20th century, which is here,
0:53
with a few different threads.
0:55
And these ideas kind of branch apart.
0:59
Once you get to the 20th and 21st centuries,
1:01
they start getting highly specific.
1:04
And way down here on the leaves are current research questions,
1:09
which over here might be
1:11
problems related to prime number distribution
1:13
and over here some very specific work being done
1:18
on randomized algorithms or hash functions,
1:21
and way up here we might have new public key protocols
1:27
- because RSA was just the first -
1:29
or we also have encryption standards such as DES and AES.
1:33
We would have a whole new branch on quantum cryptography.
1:37
So as you can see, there are so many different things
1:40
that branch out of this series
1:41
and I couldn't possibly do justice to them all.
1:44
So I think of this video as living right here.
1:46
At kind of a junction point.
1:49
Now I can branch off with help of the community
1:52
and possibly other video creators
1:54
to fill out this tree gradually over time.
1:58
Specifically with the help of the community.
2:01
I am really excited about the Q&A community
2:04
and the work being done to improve
2:06
how people can help people on Khan Academy.
2:09
So, for example,
2:11
in terms of where one of these branches can go,
2:15
I've noticed clusters of questions
2:17
kind of leading into a common branch.
2:20
For example, under 'the pseudo-random number generator',
2:23
I have two questions here: one by Sonny and one by Drakain.
2:26
Drakain's question is:
2:27
""Why has he suggested that time in milliseconds...
2:31
...is a suitable random seed?...
2:33
This is a huge no-no in security. ...
2:35
The time it is on your machine...
2:38
...is the time it is on my machine,...
2:40
...give or take 100 milliseconds...
2:42
(which can be brute-force attacked)""
2:44
And again, this is a great question too
2:46
because it speaks to the need that
2:48
I didn't present a cryptographically secure pseudo-random generator.
2:53
So the middle square's method is back here
2:56
in early 20th century, but up until today,
2:59
we are not using the middle square's method
3:02
and that's a whole interesting branch.
3:05
It is these sorts of questions which cluster together
3:08
and really drive new content.
3:12
I want to show you a really interesting example
3:14
of how this has happened already.
3:16
This is a question Samuel asked on the 'One time pad'-video
3:20
he said: ""wouldn't a computer be able to test all the possibilities very fast?""
3:24
and Chuck Patrol basically asked the same question.
3:28
I see this happening a lot.
3:30
Similar questions all speak to the need of a new video.
3:33
So I went and created a video on 'perfect secrecy'
3:37
which really nails down
3:39
how you can't beat randomness in the world of encryption.
3:43
Out of this video, Dawn made a really great comment.
3:48
What they did, was basically summarise my video in two sentences.
3:52
So, this is what I want to try to do more of
3:55
in filling out these branches:
3:56
take questions, make new content,
3:58
and have this feed-back loop and see what we can do.
4:03
Now what I would really love,
4:05
is for you to ask questions below this video
4:08
which arise after watching the entire series.
4:12
Not specific details about certain video's,
4:14
- those can go with the videos -
4:16
but new questions, which are opening new can of worms.
4:19
And what I think will be fun to do, is:
4:22
Your question will lead to answers,
4:26
by both me and the rest of the community,
4:30
so we'll have multiple answers.
4:32
And what I can do is take this body of answers,
4:35
and out of this draft up a rough script
4:40
for more advanced videos on specific topics
4:43
that sub-sets of the community care about
4:47
So hopefully, out of the discussion below,
4:49
over time we can grow a bunch of new videos!
4:53
I want to be clear: this is an ongoing process.
4:56
This will not happen tomorrow or next week.
4:59
I hope it can happen months, even years from now.
5:02
We can still be building out new videos after the series
5:05
and these videos can be a collaborative effort
5:08
between myself and the community
5:10
and perhaps other video creators down the road.
5:13
So, let me know what you think below,
5:15
and let's get started!",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,A9Km337z15k,
khan_video_CQYELiTtUs8_207,"According to Newton's First Law of Motion, what does ""except insofar"" and ""force impressed"", want's to reflect his Doctrine?",Essay,"•
0:00
In this video, I want to talk a little bit
0:02
about Newton's First Law of Motion.
0:06
And this is a translation from Newton's Principia from Latin
0:09
into English.
0:10
So the First Law, ""Every body persists
0:13
in a state of being at rest, or moving uniformly
0:20
straightforward, except insofar as it is compelled
0:24
to change its state by force impressed.""
0:27
So another way to rephrase what they're saying
0:30
is, that if there's something-- every body persists--
0:33
so everything will stay at rest, or
0:35
moving with a constant velocity, unless it
0:39
is compelled to change its state by force.
0:42
Unless it's acted on by a force, especially an unbalanced force.
0:45
and I'll explain that in a second.
0:47
So if I have something that's at rest, so completely at rest.
0:50
So I have-- and this is something
0:53
that we've seen before.
0:56
Let's say that I have a rock.
0:59
Let's say that I have a rock someplace
1:03
and it's laying on a field of grass,
1:08
I can keep observing that rock.
1:10
And it is unlikely to move, assuming
1:11
that nothing happens to it.
1:13
If there's no force applied to that rock,
1:15
that rock will just stay there.
1:17
So the first part is pretty obvious.
1:20
So, ""Every body persists in a state of being at rest""--
1:23
I'm not going to do the second part--
1:25
""except insofar as there's some force being applied to it.""
1:28
So clearly a rock will be at rest,
1:30
unless there's some force applied to it, unless someone
1:33
here tries to push it or roll it or do something to it.
1:37
What's less intuitive about the first law is the second part.
1:41
""Every body persists in,"" either, ""being in a state
1:44
of rest or moving uniformly straight forward,
1:48
except insofar as it is compelled
1:50
to change its state by force impressed.""
1:52
So this Newton's first law-- and I
1:55
think I should do a little aside here,
1:56
because, this right here is Newton.
2:00
And if this is Newton's first law,
2:01
why do I have this huge picture of this guy over here?
2:04
Well, the reason is is because Newton's first law is really
2:07
just a restatement of this guy's law of inertia.
2:10
And this guy, another titan of civilization
2:14
really, this is Galileo Galilei.
2:19
And he is the first person to formulate the law of inertia.
2:22
And Newton just rephrased it a little bit and packaged it
2:25
with his other laws.
2:26
But he did many, many, many other things.
2:28
So you really have to give Galileo
2:30
credit for Newton's first law.
2:32
So that's why I made him bigger than here.
2:34
But I was in the midst of a thought.
2:36
So we understand if something is at rest,
2:38
it's going to stay at rest, unless there's
2:39
some force that acts on it.
2:41
And in some definitions, you'll see
2:42
unless there's some unbalanced force.
2:44
And the reason why they say unbalanced
2:46
is, because you could have two forces that act on something
2:49
and they might balance out.
2:50
For example, I could push on this side of the rock
2:53
with a certain amount of force.
2:55
And if you push on this side of the rock
2:56
with the exact same amount of force, the rock won't move.
3:00
And the only way that it would move if there's a lot more
3:03
force on one side than on the other side,
3:05
so if you have an unbalanced force.
3:07
So if you have a ton of-- and maybe the rock
3:09
is a bad analogy.
3:10
Let's take ice, because ice is easier to move, or ice on ice.
3:14
So there's ice right here.
3:16
And then, I have another block of ice
3:17
sitting on top of that ice.
3:19
So once again, we're familiar with the idea,
3:21
if there's no force acting on it that ice won't move.
3:25
But what happens if I'm pushing on the ice
3:29
with a certain amount of force on that side,
3:31
and you're pushing on the ice on that side
3:32
with the same amount of force?
3:34
The ice will still not move.
3:36
So this right here, this would be a balanced force.
3:41
So the only way for the ice to change its condition, to change
3:47
its restful condition is if the force is unbalanced.
3:50
So if we add a little bit of force on this side,
3:53
so it more than compensates the force pushing it this way,
3:57
then you're going to see the ice block start to move,
4:00
start to really accelerate in that direction.
4:04
But I think this part is obvious.
4:05
This, you know, something that's at rest
4:07
will stay at rest, unless it's being acted on
4:09
by an unbalanced force.
4:11
What's less obvious is the idea that something
4:14
moving uniformly straightforward, which
4:16
is another way of saying something
4:18
having a constant velocity.
4:22
What he's saying is, is that something
4:24
that has a constant velocity will continue
4:26
to have that constant velocity indefinitely,
4:29
unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force.
4:33
And that's less intuitive.
4:34
Because everything in our human experience--
4:37
even if I were to push this block of ice,
4:41
eventually it'll stop.
4:42
It won't just keep going forever, even
4:44
assuming that this ice field is infinitely long, that ice
4:47
will eventually stop.
4:48
Or if I throw a tennis ball.
4:54
That tennis ball will eventually stop.
4:59
It'll eventually grind to a halt.
5:01
Or if I roll a bowling ball, or if I, anything.
5:04
We've never seen, at least in our human experience,
5:06
it looks like everything will eventually stop.
5:09
So this is a very unintuitive thing to say,
5:11
that something in motion will just
5:12
keep going in motion indefinitely.
5:14
Everything in human intuition says if you want something
5:17
to keep going in motion, you have to keep
5:19
putting more force, keep putting more energy into it
5:22
for it to keep going.
5:23
Your car won't go forever, unless you keep,
5:25
unless the engine keeps burning fuel to drive and consuming
5:29
energy.
5:30
So what are they talking about?
5:31
Well, in all of these examples-- and I
5:33
think this is actually a pretty brilliant insight from all
5:36
of these fellows is that-- all of these things
5:39
would have gone on forever.
5:41
The ball would keep going forever.
5:42
This ice block would be going on forever,
5:44
except for the fact that there are unbalanced
5:47
forces acting on them to stop them.
5:50
So in the case of ice, even though ice on ice
5:52
doesn't have a lot of friction, there
5:54
is some friction between these two.
5:56
And so you have, in this situation,
5:58
the force of friction is going to be
6:00
acting against the direction of the movement of the ice.
6:03
And friction really comes from, at an atomic level--
6:06
so if you have the actual water molecules in a lattice
6:10
structure in the ice cube, and then here are
6:12
the water molecules in a lattice structure on the ice,
6:17
on the actual kind of sea of ice that it's traveling on--
6:20
they do kind of bump and grind into each other.
6:22
Although they're both smooth, there are imperfections here.
6:25
They bump and grind.
6:26
They generate a little bit of heat.
6:28
And they'll, essentially, be working against the movement.
6:32
So there's a force of friction that's being applied to here.
6:34
And that's why it's stopping.
6:35
Not only a force of friction, you also
6:37
have some air resistance.
6:38
The ice block is going to be bumping
6:40
into all sorts of air particles.
6:42
It might not be noticeable at first,
6:44
but it's definitely going to keep it from going on forever.
6:47
Same thing with the ball being tossed to the air.
6:49
Obviously, at some point, it hits
6:51
the ground because of gravity.
6:52
So that's one force acting on it.
6:54
But even once it hits the ground,
6:55
it doesn't keep rolling forever, once again,
6:57
because of the friction, especially if there's grass
7:01
here.
7:02
The grass is going to stop it from going.
7:04
And even while it's in the air, it's going to slow down.
7:06
It's not going to have a constant velocity.
7:08
Because you have all of these air particles
7:10
that are going to bump into it and exert
7:15
force to slow it down.
7:17
So what was really brilliant about these guys
7:19
is that they could imagine a reality where
7:22
you didn't have gravity, where you did not
7:24
have air slowing things down.
7:27
And they could imagine that in that reality,
7:30
something would just keep persisting in its motion.
7:33
And the reason why Galileo, frankly, was probably good
7:36
at thinking about that is that he
7:37
studied the orbits of planets.
7:41
And he could, or at least he's probably
7:43
theorized that, hey, maybe there's no air out there.
7:45
And that maybe that's why these planets can just
7:47
keep going round and round in orbit.
7:49
And I should say their speed, because their direction is
7:54
changing, but their speed never slows down,
7:56
because there's nothing in the space
7:58
to actually slow down those planets.
8:01
So anyway, hopefully you found that as fascinating as I do.
8:04
Because on some level, it's super-duper obvious.
8:06
But on a whole other level, it's completely not obvious,
8:08
especially this moving uniformly straightforward.
8:10
And just to make the point clear,
8:12
if gravity disappeared, and you had no air,
8:16
and you threw a ball, that ball literally
8:18
would keep going in that direction
8:20
forever, unless some other unbalanced force acted
8:24
to stop it.
8:26
And another way to think about it-- and this
8:28
is an example that you might see in everyday life-- is,
8:32
if I'm in an airplane that's going at a completely
8:38
constant velocity and there's absolutely
8:40
no turbulence in the airplane.
8:42
So if I'm sitting in the airplane right over here.
8:45
And it's going at a constant velocity, completely smooth,
8:51
no turbulence.
8:52
There's really no way for me to tell whether that airplane is
8:55
moving without looking out the window.
8:57
Let's assume that there's no windows in that airplane.
8:59
It's going at a constant velocity.
9:01
And there's no turbulence.
9:02
And let's say, I can't hear anything.
9:06
So I can't even hear the engines.
9:07
There's no way for me to sense that the plane is moving.
9:10
Because from my frame of reference,
9:12
it looks completely identical to if I
9:15
was in that same plane that was resting on the ground.
9:18
And that's another way to think about it.
9:20
That it's actually very intuitive
9:22
that they're similar states, moving at a constant velocity
9:25
or being at rest.
9:27
And you really can't tell whether you
9:29
are one or the other.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,CQYELiTtUs8,

0:00
- [Instructor] In other videos,
0:01
we talk about how 10 to 15,000 years ago.
0:04
You have the emergence of agriculture
0:07
primarily around river valleys,
0:10
and it's no surprise that agriculture
0:12
first came about around river valleys
0:14
because the rivers would flood,
0:17
making the soil around them fertile.
0:19
They would provide fresh water for crops
0:22
and for the people who would live near them.
0:24
Later on, the rivers could be useful for
0:26
transporting things like crops,
0:29
and so it's not surprising that our
0:31
first significant civilizations also emerged
0:33
where the first agriculture emerged.
0:37
And our first civilizations we'll see
0:38
in ancient Egypt along the Nile.
0:41
We will see it in the Indus Valley along the Indus River.
0:45
We'll see it in China along the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers,
0:49
and we'll also see it in Mesopotamia
0:51
along the Tigress and Euphrates Rivers.
0:56
And what we're gonna focus on in
0:58
this video in particular is Mesopotamia.
1:03
Now, the word Mesopotamia literally come from
1:05
meso, between, and potamos.
1:07
I'm probably not pronouncing it right, rivers.
1:10
So it's the area between rivers is literally
1:13
what Mesopotamia is referring to.
1:15
And it's primarily modern day Iraq.
1:19
Now the reason why this is particularly interesting
1:21
and it's called the cradle of civilization,
1:24
is not only is it one of or perhaps
1:27
the first place that agriculture developed,
1:29
it was at the crossroads of many other early civilizations.
1:33
Notice it's right in between
1:35
the Indus Valley civilization here,
1:37
and then the ancient Egyptians,
1:39
and other civilizations that were emerging in the area.
1:42
And so it's not surprising that this was
1:44
a geography that had significant developments
1:47
in terms of technology, in terms of architecture,
1:50
in terms of religion, in terms of writing.
1:54
And the first civilization we believe
1:57
that emerged in Mesopotamia are the Sumerians.
2:01
Sumerians.
2:04
And Sumeria and Sumerians, it's most associated with
2:07
this region right over here of, let me circle it,
2:12
this region right over here of southern Mesopotamia.
2:17
And we currently think that this civilization
2:19
started to emerge around 4000 BCE.
2:22
You can see it on this timeline here in orange,
2:25
and they developed things as basic as the wheel.
2:30
The first wheel that was ever discovered
2:31
was 3500 BCE in Sumeria.
2:35
They're famous for their architectural structures.
2:37
This is a picture here of a ziggurat,
2:39
which was at the center of many of
2:41
these Sumerian and as we'll see Mesopotamian cities.
2:44
This would require an incredible amount of labor to produce,
2:47
and at the top of these they had temples to their Gods
2:50
and their Gods, they had a polytheistic religion,
2:53
and their Gods took human form.
2:58
Also amongst the Sumerians is where we think
3:02
one of the first written languages developed.
3:05
It wasn't the first.
3:06
You also have the Egyptian hieroglyphics
3:07
and written language emerged amongst
3:09
the Harappans and the Indus Valley civilization
3:12
and amongst the Chinese,
3:14
but it was one of the first languages.
3:16
This right over here is an example of a cuneiform tablet.
3:20
This is a cuneiform tablet written in the script.
3:24
Cuneiform developed by these ancient Sumerians.
3:30
Now, when you talk about Mesopotamia,
3:32
you'll talk about Sumerians,
3:33
but we'll also talk about other civilizations that emerge.
3:36
In particular, let me write them all down.
3:38
You have the Sumerians.
3:39
You'll also hear something called Akkadian,
3:41
and as we'll see, Akkadian is both a language
3:45
and an empire that will emerge.
3:48
In Mesopotamia over the roughly 3,000 years BCE,
3:54
the two primary languages are Akkadian,
3:58
which is considered a Semitic language.
4:01
It's related to modern Semitic languages,
4:03
like Arabic and Hebrew,
4:06
and the reason why they're called Semitic is
4:08
because they're spoken or they're reported to be spoken
4:10
by the descendants of Shem, who was Noah's son,
4:14
in the Hebrew bible.
4:16
So, you have the language Akkadian, which is Semitic,
4:19
and then you have the other language, which is Sumerian.
4:21
And as we get into the third millennium BCE,
4:26
the Sumerians start to have a lot of
4:28
interaction with Akkadian speaking people,
4:31
and Akkadian speaking people are initially associated
4:33
primarily with northern Mesopotamia,
4:37
and we believe the first empire, true empire,
4:41
perhaps the first empire in the world emerged from Acadia,
4:45
and it was called the Akkadian Empire.
4:47
And if we scroll down over here,
4:52
we can see how the Akkadian Empire spread.
4:56
We believe that the town of Akkad,
4:58
which the Akkadian Empire is named for,
5:00
some place in this region right over here,
5:03
and the first significant ruler
5:04
who really spread that empire was Sargon,
5:07
often referred to as Sargon the Great.
5:10
And you can see, you can see that
5:13
that would have been established around
5:15
the middle of the 23rd, or actually the 24th century BCE.
5:21
So around 2350, you have Sargon establishing
5:24
what might be the first Dynastic empire in the world,
5:27
the Akkadian Empire,
5:29
and he was able to take control of
5:31
both northern and southern Mesopotamia,
5:33
so even the Sumerians were under
5:35
the control of the Akkadians.
5:37
As we'll see over time,
5:38
you have a lot of mixing between the Akkadian language,
5:41
the Sumerian language.
5:42
Akkadian gets written in the Cuneiform script,
5:46
and starting at around this period,
5:47
Sumerian starts to die as a spoken language
5:50
and Akkadian really becomes dominant.
5:52
Now, the Akkadians rule for a little over 100 years,
5:57
and then you have several other empires.
6:00
It can get confusing.
6:01
The way I have structured this timeline is
6:03
this top line right over here is southern Mesopotamia
6:05
and this bottom line right over here is northern Mesopotamia
6:09
so this orange shows you where the Sumerians were reigning.
6:12
Some people think that they might
6:14
have been the first empire.
6:15
This bottom line here, you can see the Akkadian speakers,
6:17
but they were fragmented until you have Sargon the great
6:20
establishing the Akkadian Empire.
6:22
Now, you briefly then have a short-term neo-Sumerian empire,
6:28
but the next significant empire that's often talked about
6:31
when associated with Mesopotamia is the Babylonian Empire.
6:36
So Babylon, the Babylonian Empire
6:38
was centered at Babylon, right over here,
6:40
and it really became a significant empire
6:44
under the ruler Hammurabi.
6:47
And Hammurabi is perhaps most known,
6:49
you can see how he was able to spread the empire.
6:52
The dark brown is what he had with
6:55
this empire when he took rule,
6:57
and the light brown is what he was able to spread it to,
7:00
so once again, both north and south,
7:01
and he's perhaps most famous for
7:03
his famous code of Hammurabi, which is depicted here,
7:07
and it wasn't the first written code,
7:09
but it was one of the earliest,
7:11
and you could view it as almost a proto-constitution,
7:14
and it was based on things that the Sumerians had before,
7:17
but they've even influenced things like biblical laws,
7:20
things that come down to modern codes of law today.
7:24
Now, after the Babylonians,
7:26
the other significant empire that would have control over
7:30
significant portions of Mesopotamia is the Assyrian Empire.
7:34
And the Assyrian Empire is named for their,
7:37
I guess you could say their home base, the town of Assur.
7:41
You can see it in this map here,
7:43
where we showed the Akkadian Empire.
7:45
And both the Babylonians and the Assyrians
7:47
were Akkadian speaking, so at this point now,
7:49
and as we get into the later Assyrian period,
7:52
we'll start to have Aramaic be a more significant language,
7:54
another Semitic language, but as you can see here,
7:57
the Assyrian Empire at its peak controlled
7:59
much of the modern day Middle East.
8:03
Now, the Assyrian Empire would eventually collapse
8:06
in the seventh century BCE,
8:09
and it would be taken over by the Neobabylonian Empire.
8:12
I have a map of that right over here,
8:16
which also controlled much of the modern middle east.
8:19
Probably the most famous ruler of the Neobabylonian Empire
8:22
was Nebuchadnezzar II from the Hebrew bible famous for
8:26
taking the early Jewish people captive,
8:31
the famous Babylonian captivity,
8:33
but eventually they would be overthrown,
8:35
and they would be overthrown in the sixth century BCE
8:39
by the Persians and Cyrus the Great,
8:43
and that'll actually be the end of
8:44
the Babylonian captivity according to biblical accounts.
8:48
But the big picture is that Mesopotamia is called
8:50
the cradle of civilization for a good reason.
8:54
Not only do we have these technological
8:56
and architectural advancements,
8:58
their religion, their writing has influenced civilization
9:01
since, for the last five, six, 7,000 years.
9:08
Well, I'd say definitely the last 5,000 years,
9:11
and a lot of these ideas that came out of Mesopotamia,
9:14
like written codes of law and the technologies
9:17
and all the rest follow with us today.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,9GQdh2eGP-Y,
teded_Gyotaku: The ancient Japanese art of printing fish - K. Erica Dodge - 03:38_0,What was the original purpose for gyotaku?,multiple-choices,"Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby
How big was that fish you caught?
This big?
This big?
This big?
Without photographic evidence,
there's nothing that proves you caught a whopper,
and that's been true since the dawn of fishing.
In fact, hundreds of years ago,
long before photography could capture the moment,
Japanese fishermen invented their own way
to record trophy catches.
They called it Gyotaku.
Gyotaku is the ancient art of printing fish
that originated in Japan
as a way to record trophy catches
prior to the modern day camera.
Gyo means fish
and taku means impression.
There are several different stories about
how Gyotaku came about,
but it basically started with fishermen
needing a way to record the species and size
of the fish they caught over 100 years ago.
Fishermen took paper, ink, and brushes
out to sea with them.
They told stories of great adventures at sea.
Since the Japanese revered certain fish,
the fishermen would take a rubbing from these fish
and release them.
To make the rubbing,
they would paint the fish with non-toxic sumi-e ink
and print them on rice paper.
This way they could be released
or cleaned and sold at market.
The first prints like this were for records only
with no extra details.
It wasn't until the mid 1800's
that they began painting eye details
and other embellishments onto the prints.
One famous nobleman, Lord Sakai, was an avid fisherman,
and, when he made a large catch,
he wanted to preserve the memory
of the large, red sea bream.
To do so, he commissioned a fisherman to print his catch.
After this, many fisherman would bring
their Gyotaku prints to Lord Sakai,
and if he liked their work,
he would hire them to print for him.
Many prints hung in the palace during the Edo period.
After this period, Gyotaku was not as popular
and began to fade away.
Today, Gyotaku has become a popular art form,
enjoyed by many.
And the prints are said to bring good luck to the fishermen.
But the art form is quite different than it used to be.
Most artists today learn on their own by trial and error.
Before the artist begins to print,
the fish needs to be prepared for printing.
First, the artist places the fish
on a hollowed out surface.
Then the artist spreads the fins out
and pins them down on the board to dry.
They then clean the fish with water.
When it comes time to print,
there are two different methods.
The indirect method begins with pasting moist fabric or paper
onto the fish using rice paste.
Then, the artist uses a tompo,
or a cotton ball covered in silk,
to put ink on the fabric or paper to produce the print.
This method requires more skill
and great care needs to be taken
when pulling the paper off the fish
so the paper doesn't tear.
In the direct method,
the artist paints directly on the fish,
and then gently presses the moist fabric or paper into the fish.
With both of these methods,
no two prints are exactly alike,
but both reveal dramatic images of the fish.
For the final touch,
the artist uses a chop, or a stamp,
and signs their work,
and can hold it up to say,
""The fish was exactly this big!""",TED-Ed,Social Studies,Gyotaku: The ancient Japanese art of printing fish - K. Erica Dodge - 03:38,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_mG-Ka4mv8,data/teded/crawled_data/videos/Gyotaku: The ancient Japanese art of printing fish - K. Erica Dodge - 03:38,,
khan_article_xb500ddbc_11,Why couldn't the U.S. just stop sending ships to the place which the Germans declared a war zone and tell Mexico to not side with the Germans?,Essay,"Gentlemen of the Congress:

I have called the Congress into extraordinary session because there are serious, very serious, choices of policy to be made, and made immediately, which it was neither right nor constitutionally permissible that I should assume the responsibility of making.

On the 3d of February last I officially laid before you the extraordinary announcement of the Imperial German Government that on and after the 1st day of February it was its purpose to put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every vessel that sought to approach either the ports of Great Britain and Ireland or the western coasts of Europe or any of the ports controlled by the enemies of Germany within the Mediterranean. That had seemed to be the object of the German submarine warfare earlier in the war, but since April of last year the Imperial Government had somewhat restrained the commanders of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then given to us that passenger boats should not be sunk and that due warning would be given to all other vessels which its submarines might seek to destroy, when no resistance was offered or escape attempted, and care taken that their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their lives in their open boats. The precautions taken were meagre and haphazard enough, as was proved in distressing instance after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business, but a certain degree of restraint was observed The new policy has swept every restriction aside. Vessels of every kind, whatever their flag, their character, their cargo, their destination, their errand, have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board, the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of belligerents. Even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of Belgium, though the latter were provided with safe-conduct through the proscribed areas by the German Government itself and were distinguished by unmistakable marks of identity, have been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or of principle.

I was for a little while unable to believe that such things would in fact be done by any government that had hitherto subscribed to the humane practices of civilized nations. International law had its origin in the at tempt to set up some law which would be respected and observed upon the seas, where no nation had right of dominion and where lay the free highways of the world. By painful stage after stage has that law been built up, with meagre enough results, indeed, after all was accomplished that could be accomplished, but always with a clear view, at least, of what the heart and conscience of mankind demanded. This minimum of right the German Government has swept aside under the plea of retaliation and necessity and because it had no weapons which it could use at sea except these which it is impossible to employ as it is employing them without throwing to the winds all scruples of humanity or of respect for the understandings that were supposed to underlie the intercourse of the world. I am not now thinking of the loss of property involved, immense and serious as that is, but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of the lives of noncombatants, men, women, and children, engaged in pursuits which have always, even in the darkest periods of modern history, been deemed innocent and legitimate. Property can be paid for; the lives of peaceful and innocent people can not be. The present German submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare against mankind.

It is a war against all nations. American ships have been sunk, American lives taken, in ways which it has stirred us very deeply to learn of, but the ships and people of other neutral and friendly nations have been sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way. There has been no discrimination. The challenge is to all mankind. Each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it. The choice we make for ourselves must be made with a moderation of counsel and a temperateness of judgment befitting our character and our motives as a nation. We must put excited feeling away. Our motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the nation, but only the vindication of right, of human right, of which we are only a single champion.

When I addressed the Congress on the 26th of February last, I thought that it would suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms, our right to use the seas against unlawful interference, our right to keep our people safe against unlawful violence. But armed neutrality, it now appears, is impracticable. Because submarines are in effect outlaws when used as the German submarines have been used against merchant shipping, it is impossible to defend ships against their attacks as the law of nations has assumed that merchantmen would defend themselves against privateers or cruisers, visible craft giving chase upon the open sea. It is common prudence in such circumstances, grim necessity indeed, to endeavour to destroy them before they have shown their own intention. They must be dealt with upon sight, if dealt with at all. The German Government denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all within the areas of the sea which it has proscribed, even in the defense of rights which no modern publicist has ever before questioned their right to defend. The intimation is conveyed that the armed guards which we have placed on our merchant ships will be treated as beyond the pale of law and subject to be dealt with as pirates would be. Armed neutrality is ineffectual enough at best; in such circumstances and in the face of such pretensions it is worse than ineffectual; it is likely only to produce what it was meant to prevent; it is practically certain to draw us into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness of belligerents. There is one choice we can not make, we are incapable of making: we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated. The wrongs against which we now array ourselves are no common wrongs; they cut to the very roots of human life.

With a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step I am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves, but in unhesitating obedience to what I deem my constitutional duty, I advise that the Congress declare the recent course of the Imperial German Government to be in fact nothing less than war against the Government and people of the United States; that it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it, and that it take immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough state of defense but also to exert all its power and employ all its resources to bring the Government of the German Empire to terms and end the war.

What this will involve is clear. It will involve the utmost practicable cooperation in counsel and action with the governments now at war with Germany, and, as incident to that, the extension to those governments of the most liberal financial credits, in order that our resources may so far as possible be added to theirs. It will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible. It will involve the immediate full equipment of the Navy in all respects but particularly in supplying it with the best means of dealing with the enemy's submarines. It will involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the United States already provided for by law in case of war at least 500,000 men, who should, in my opinion, be chosen upon the principle of universal liability to service, and also the authorization of subsequent additional increments of equal force so soon as they may be needed and can be handled in training. It will involve also, of course, the granting of adequate credits to the Government, sustained, I hope, so far as they can equitably be sustained by the present generation, by well conceived taxation....

While we do these things, these deeply momentous things, let us be very clear, and make very clear to all the world what our motives and our objects are. My own thought has not been driven from its habitual and normal course by the unhappy events of the last two months, and I do not believe that the thought of the nation has been altered or clouded by them I have exactly the same things in mind now that I had in mind when I addressed the Senate on the 22d of January last; the same that I had in mind when I addressed the Congress on the 3d of February and on the 26th of February. Our object now, as then, is to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the observance of those principles. Neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of the world is involved and the freedom of its peoples, and the menace to that peace and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic governments backed by organized force which is controlled wholly by their will, not by the will of their people. We have seen the last of neutrality in such circumstances. We are at the beginning of an age in which it will be insisted that the same standards of conduct and of responsibility for wrong done shall be observed among nations and their governments that are observed among the individual citizens of civilized states.

We have no quarrel with the German people. We have no feeling towards them but one of sympathy and friendship. It was not upon their impulse that their Government acted in entering this war. It was not with their previous knowledge or approval. It was a war determined upon as wars used to be determined upon in the old, unhappy days when peoples were nowhere consulted by their rulers and wars were provoked and waged in the interest of dynasties or of little groups of ambitious men who were accustomed to use their fellow men as pawns and tools. Self-governed nations do not fill their neighbour states with spies or set the course of intrigue to bring about some critical posture of affairs which will give them an opportunity to strike and make conquest. Such designs can be successfully worked out only under cover and where no one has the right to ask questions. Cunningly contrived plans of deception or aggression, carried, it may be, from generation to generation, can be worked out and kept from the light only within the privacy of courts or behind the carefully guarded confidences of a narrow and privileged class. They are happily impossible where public opinion commands and insists upon full information concerning all the nation's affairs.

A steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a partnership of democratic nations. No autocratic government could be trusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants. It must be a league of honour, a partnership of opinion. Intrigue would eat its vitals away; the plottings of inner circles who could plan what they would and render account to no one would be a corruption seated at its very heart. Only free peoples can hold their purpose and their honour steady to a common end and prefer the interests of mankind to any narrow interest of their own.

Does not every American feel that assurance has been added to our hope for the future peace of the world by the wonderful and heartening things that have been happening within the last few weeks in Russia? Russia was known by those who knew it best to have been always in fact democratic at heart, in all the vital habits of her thought, in all the intimate relationships of her people that spoke their natural instinct, their habitual attitude towards life. The autocracy that crowned the summit of her political structure, long as it had stood and terrible as was the reality of its power, was not in fact Russian in origin, character, or purpose; and now it has been shaken off and the great, generous Russian people have been added in all their naive majesty and might to the forces that are fighting for freedom in the world, for justice, and for peace. Here is a fit partner for a league of honour.

One of the things that has served to convince us that the Prussian autocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very outset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities and even our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel, our peace within and without our industries and our commerce. Indeed it is now evident that its spies were here even before the war began; and it is unhappily not a matter of conjecture but a fact proved in our courts of justice that the intrigues which have more than once come perilously near to disturbing the peace and dislocating the industries of the country have been carried on at the instigation, with the support, and even under the personal direction of official agents of the Imperial Government accredited to the Government of the United States. Even in checking these things and trying to extirpate them we have sought to put the most generous interpretation possible upon them because we knew that their source lay, not in any hostile feeling or purpose of the German people towards us (who were, no doubt, as ignorant of them as we ourselves were), but only in the selfish designs of a Government that did what it pleased and told its people nothing. But they have played their part in serving to convince us at last that that Government entertains no real friendship for us and means to act against our peace and security at its convenience. That it means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors the intercepted Zimmermann note to the German Minister at Mexico City is eloquent evidence.

We are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that in such a government, following such methods, we can never have a friend; and that in the presence of its organized power, always lying in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose, there can be no assured security for the democratic governments of the world. We are now about to accept gage of battle with this natural foe to liberty and shall, if necessary, spend the whole force of the nation to check and nullify its pretensions and its power. We are glad, now that we see the facts with no veil of false pretence about them, to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples, the German peoples included: for the rights of nations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life and of obedience. The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.

Just because we fight without rancour and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.

I have said nothing of the governments allied with the Imperial Government of Germany because they have not made war upon us or challenged us to defend our right and our honour. The Austro-Hungarian Government has, indeed, avowed its unqualified endorsement and acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopted now without disguise by the Imperial German Government, and it has therefore not been possible for this Government to receive Count Tarnowski, the Ambassador recently accredited to this Government by the Imperial and Royal Government of Austria-Hungary; but that Government has not actually engaged in warfare against citizens of the United States on the seas, and I take the liberty, for the present at least, of postponing a discussion of our relations with the authorities at Vienna. We enter this war only where we are clearly forced into it because there are no other means of defending our rights.

It will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity towards a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us -- however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts. We have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship -- exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions towards the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy, who live amongst us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it towards all who are in fact loyal to their neighbours and to the Government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.

It is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts -- for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free. To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.",Khan Academy Article,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_article_questions,,xb500ddbc
khan_video_UYShebe44Xs_9,"Do negative externality taxes not seem like an extremely efficient way for the government to produce revenue, as opposed to income and capital gains taxes?",Essay,"•
0:00
In the last video, we first thought about externalities,
0:04
the negative externalities
0:05
of having plastic bags around.
0:07
It causes litter, it might damage animals
0:09
and the environment in some way.
0:11
We're assuming ... And we assumed in that video
0:14
that we were able to calculate the actual
0:16
external cost of a plastic bag.
0:19
This two cents a bag is the impact on
0:21
litter in the environment.
0:22
Then we were able to figure out
0:24
that if we factor this in,
0:25
instead of just having the regular
0:27
marginal cost cover the suppliers,
0:28
if we added that marginal cost curve
0:30
to the external cost,
0:32
we would get a supplier plus
0:33
external costs, marginal cost curve,
0:36
and then we'd get what is actually
0:37
the optimal price and quantity of plastic bags
0:42
so that we actually do not eat into
0:44
our surplus by creating all of this
0:45
negative surplus where the total cost
0:49
of the bags are higher than
0:50
the total benefit.
0:52
One thing that we did not touch on
0:53
in that video, is how does this actually happen?
0:56
If we just let things be,
0:59
and we just had the supplier's
1:00
marginal cost curve
1:01
and we have the consumer's demand curve,
1:04
in this case, the consumers were the supermarkets,
1:06
then the equilibrium price that'll be
1:08
reached will be right over here
1:09
because although we're theoretically
1:12
saying that there's this cost over here,
1:14
the cost won't be factored in
1:17
into the markets.
1:18
So if you are the benevolent emperor
1:21
in this society, what do you do?
1:23
What do you do to get the quantity
1:26
closer to this point right over here
1:28
than what the equilibrium quantity
1:30
will be when you don't factor in
1:31
the external cost?
1:33
There's a bunch of options here.
1:34
You could just ban plastic bags ...
1:37
ban plastic bags,
1:41
you could put a quota on plastic bags,
1:44
you could put a quota, so saying that
1:47
more than a certain amount of bags
1:50
could not be produced, or
1:52
you could tax plastic bags,
1:54
or you could tax plastic bags.
1:57
Let's think about which of these will
1:59
result in the most surplus,
2:01
the most benefit to society in aggregate.
2:05
One core assumption we're going to make
2:06
is that this is an accurate assessment
2:10
of the external cost per bag.
2:13
If you were to just ban plastic bags
2:15
as this benevolent emperor,
2:16
maybe seemingly or hopefully
2:18
benevolent emperor of this society right here,
2:20
if you just banned plastic bags,
2:22
what would happen?
2:23
Well, then this market just won't exist.
2:25
All of this surplus that could have existed,
2:27
won't exist anymore,
2:29
so you would actually be destroying surplus.
2:32
You could say, ""No, no, no ... plastic bags
2:33
are horrible. They should just be outright banned.
2:35
There's no amount of benefit for which
2:37
plastic bags are worth using,""
2:40
but in that case, you're actually arguing
2:41
this point right over here.
2:43
You'd be arguing that, ""No, it's not
2:45
2 cents a bag, it's 10 cents a bag,""
2:46
of negative externality, and because of that,
2:50
you would have this curve shift up even more
2:52
and then there's no positive quantity there
2:54
and maybe a ban would be all right.
2:56
But if the 2 cents is the externality,
2:58
the negative externality,
3:00
and if you were to ban plastic bags,
3:02
then you would actually be removing,
3:04
you would be removing this surplus from society.
3:07
That doesn't seem like a good option.
3:10
Now what about a quota?
3:12
You kind of look at the study right over here
3:15
and you say, ""Look, the optimal amount
3:17
of plastic bags is 1.9 million bags per week,
3:20
so I will just say that that's most
3:22
that the market can produce.""
3:24
But when you say that, that's assuming
3:26
that you really do understand what this
3:28
demand curve looks like.
3:30
I just drew a straight line here
3:31
just out of simplicity, and
3:32
assuming that you really do understand
3:33
what this marginal cost curve looks like.
3:36
Throughout this [unintelligible],
3:38
we've been assuming that we kind of do
3:39
understand those things, but
3:40
in the real world, it's actually very hard
3:43
to know exactly what the marginal cost
3:45
of the curve looks like,
3:46
and it's also hard to know exactly
3:47
what the marginal benefit curve,
3:49
or the demand curve looks like,
3:51
especially because they're always changing.
3:53
There's always more competitors,
3:54
less competitors, more substitute products,
3:56
more R&D, things are getting more efficient,
3:58
less efficient; and so it's very hard
4:00
to know what the true equilibrium
4:03
quantity should be.
4:05
A quota is difficult.
4:07
We don't have quite the right information.
4:10
A tax is interesting.
4:12
A tax says, ""Look, regardless of
4:14
what the marginal cost curve really is,
4:16
we're just going to shift it up by 2 cents.""
4:19
We saw that when we first talked about taxes.
4:21
When we first talked about taxes, we talked about
4:24
they're introducing a dead weight loss
4:26
because you're not producing as much quantity
4:28
as you would have otherwise, or
4:30
as much quantity isn't being consumed.
4:32
But here, a tax could actually prevent
4:34
a dead weight loss because if you have
4:36
a 2 cent tax, essentially adding the cost
4:40
of the negative externality in the form of a tax
4:43
on top of the supplier's cost right over here,
4:46
you are going to cause the equilibrium quantity
4:48
to be the quantity where you're not
4:51
generating all of this negative surplus,
4:53
and it's just a positive side effect,
4:56
and once again, this is all assuming
4:57
that this is the right number,
4:58
but it would be a positive side effect
5:00
that you would also generate some revenue
5:02
for the government.
5:03
What's good about the tax in this circumstance
5:05
right over here, you're not assuming anything
5:07
about what the marginal cost curve looks like
5:09
or what the demand curve looks like.
5:12
As long as you're assuming that this
5:13
is the right number,
5:14
the tax will always shift whatever
5:18
the marginal cost curve is,
5:19
it'll always shift it to the right point
5:21
to intersect wherever the demand curve is
5:26
at this equilibrium point,
5:28
that gives us an equilibrium price
5:29
and an equilibrium quantity.
5:30
So if this is the right number and
5:32
you put a 2 cent tax per bag,
5:34
a 2 cent tax per bag,
5:37
then this is probably going to be the best option
5:40
in terms of optimizing the total surplus.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,UYShebe44Xs,

Let's say we have a cup of water.
0:03
Let me draw the cup.
0:06
This is one side of the cup, this is the bottom of the cup,
0:11
and this is the other side of the cup.
0:15
Let me say that it's some liquid.
0:16
It doesn't have to be water, but some arbitrary liquid.
0:19
It could be water.
0:21
That's the surface of it.
0:23
We've already learned that the pressure at any point within
0:26
this liquid is dependent on how deep
0:30
we go into the liquid.
0:32
One point I want to make before we move on, and I
0:35
touched on this a little bit before, is that the pressure
0:39
at some point isn't just acting downwards, or it isn't
0:43
just acting in one direction.
0:44
It's acting in all directions on that point.
0:46
So although how far we go down determines how much pressure
0:50
there is, the pressure is actually acting in all
0:53
directions, including up.
0:54
The reason why that makes sense is because I'm assuming
0:58
that this is a static system, or that the fluids in this
1:02
liquid are stationary, or you even could imagine an object
1:05
down here, and it's stationary.
1:07
The fact that it's stationary tells us that the pressure in
1:09
every direction must be equal.
1:12
Let's think about a molecule of water.
1:13
A molecule of water, let's say it's roughly a sphere.
1:20
If the pressure were different in one direction or if the
1:24
pressure down were greater than the pressure up, then the
1:28
object would start accelerating downwards,
1:30
because its surface area pointing upwards is the same
1:32
as the surface area pointing downwards, so the force
1:36
upwards would be more.
1:37
It would start accelerating downwards.
1:39
Even though the pressure is a function of how far down we
1:43
go, at that point, the pressure is
1:45
acting in every direction.
1:48
Let's remember that, and now let's keep that in mind to
1:51
learn a little bit about Archimedes' principle.
1:54
Let's say I submerge a cube into this liquid, and let's
2:01
say this cube has dimensions d, so every side is d.
2:17
What I want to do is I want to figure out if there's any
2:19
force or what is the net force acting on this
2:22
cube due to the water?
2:25
Let's think about what the pressure on this cube is at
2:27
different points.
2:29
At the depths along the side of the cube, we know that the
2:32
pressures are equal, because we know at this depth right
2:35
here, the pressure is going to be the same as at that depth,
2:38
and they're going to offset each other, and so these are
2:40
going to be the same.
2:41
But one thing we do know, just based on the fact that
2:44
pressure is a function of depth, is that at this point
2:47
the pressure is going to be higher-- I don't know how much
2:50
higher-- than at this point, because this point is deeper
2:54
into the water.
2:55
Let's call this P1.
2:59
Let's call that pressure on top, PT, and let's call this
3:03
point down here PD.
3:06
No, pressure on the bottom, PB.
3:11
What's going to be the net force on this cube?
3:17
The net force-- let's call that F sub N-- is going to be
3:22
equal to the force acting upwards on this object.
3:27
What's the force acting upwards on the object?
3:29
It's going to be this pressure at the bottom of the object
3:35
times the surface area at the bottom of the object.
3:38
What's the surface area at the bottom of the object?
3:41
That's just d squared.
3:42
Any surface of a cube is d squared, so the bottom is
3:45
going to be d squared minus-- I'm doing this because I
3:54
actually know that the pressure down here is higher
3:56
than the pressure here, so this is going to be a larger
3:58
quantity, and that the net force is actually going to be
4:01
upwards, so that's why I can do the minus confidently up
4:04
here-- the pressure at the top.
4:07
What's the force at the top?
4:09
The force at the top is going to be the pressure on the top
4:14
times the surface area of the top of the cube,
4:16
right, times d squared.
4:20
We can even separate out the d squared already at that point,
4:24
so the net force is equal to the pressure of the bottom
4:30
minus the pressure of the top, or the difference in pressure
4:33
times the surface area of either the top or the bottom
4:37
or really any of the sides of the cube.
4:39
Let's see if we can figure what these are.
4:41
Let's say the cube is submerged h units or h meters
4:45
into the water.
4:48
So what's the pressure at the top?
4:51
The pressure at the top is going to be equal to the
4:55
density of the liquid-- I keep saying water, but it could be
4:58
any liquid-- times how far down we are.
5:02
So we're h units down, or maybe h meters, times gravity.
5:08
And what's the pressure the bottom?
5:10
The pressure at the bottom similarly would be the density
5:15
of the liquid times the depth, so what's the depth?
5:18
It would be this h and then we're another d down.
5:24
It's h plus d-- that's our total depth-- times gravity.
5:29
Let's just substitute both of those back into our net force.
5:31
Let me switch colors to keep from getting monotonous.
5:35
I get the net force is equal to the pressure at the bottom,
5:40
which is this.
5:42
Let's just multiply it out, so we get p times h times g plus
5:52
d times p times g.
5:58
I just distributed this out, multiplied this out.
6:00
That's the pressure at the bottom, then minus the
6:06
pressure at the top, minus phg, and then we learned it's
6:13
all of that times d squared.
6:17
Immediately, we see something cancels out.
6:20
phg, phg subtract.
6:23
It cancels out, so we're just left with--
6:25
what's the net force?
6:27
The net force is equal to dpg times d squared, or that
6:36
equals d cubed times the density of the
6:42
liquid times gravity.
6:45
Let me ask you a question: What is d cubed?
6:50
d cubed is the volume of this cube.
6:51
And what else is it?
6:54
It's also the volume of the water displaced.
6:56
If I stick this cube into the water, and the cube isn't
6:59
shrinking or anything-- you can even imagine it being
7:03
empty, but it doesn't have to be empty-- but that amount of
7:05
water has to be moved out of the way in order for
7:08
that cube to go in.
7:11
This is the volume of the water displaced.
7:15
It's also the volume of the cube.
7:24
This is the density-- I keep saying water, but it could be
7:28
any liquid-- of the liquid.
7:30
This is the gravity.
7:32
So what is this?
7:33
Volume times density is the mass of the liquid displaced,
7:38
so the net force is also equal to the
7:42
mass of liquid displaced.
7:47
Let's just say mass times gravity, or we could say that
7:52
the net force acting on this object is-- what's the mass of
7:55
the liquid displaced times gravity?
7:57
That's just the weight of liquid displaced.
8:05
That's a pretty interesting thing.
8:08
If I submerge anything, the net force acting upwards on
8:12
it, or the amount that I'm lighter by, is equal to the
8:15
weight of the water being displaced.
8:18
That's actually called Archimedes' principle.
8:20
That net upward force due to the fact that there's more
8:24
pressure on the bottom than there is on the top, that's
8:27
called the buoyant force.
8:28
That's what makes things float.
8:30
I'll leave you there to just to ponder that, and we'll use
8:35
this concept in the next couple of videos to actually
8:37
solve some problems. I'll see you soon.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,vzID7ds600c,
khan_video_ntxMOKXHlfo_18,When might a government fiscal be good (or at least necessary) ?,MCQ,"•
0:00
Two words you'll hear thrown a lot in macroeconomic circles
0:04
are monetary policy and fiscal policy.
0:11
And they're normally talked about in the context of ways
0:15
to shift aggregate demand in one direction or another
0:19
and often times to kind of stimulate aggregate demand,
0:21
to shift it to the right.
0:23
And what I want to do in this video
0:24
is focus on what these two different tools who
0:27
are, who are the actors, and how do
0:28
they go about actually shifting the aggregate demand curve.
0:32
So monetary policy-- this is literally
0:35
deciding how much money to print.
0:37
So it's literally printing money--
0:39
either deciding to print more of it or deciding to print less.
0:43
It tends to be done in the United States--
0:45
especially in most large countries-- it's
0:47
done by the central bank, which is sometimes directly
0:52
part of the government.
0:54
Sometimes it's quasi-independent.
0:56
In the US, it's a quasi-- The US central bank, which
0:59
is the Federal Reserve, is quasi-independent.
1:02
And in future videos we'll talk more
1:04
about the governance structure of the Federal Reserve.
1:08
Most of the major appointees are made by the US government.
1:12
All of its excess profits goes back to the US Treasury,
1:15
so in that way it's part of the US government.
1:18
But it's set up to be-- also has some influence
1:20
from private industry.
1:22
The member banks have a stake in what's going on.
1:26
It often coordinates amongst member banks.
1:28
So you have your Federal Reserve as a central bank
1:31
in the United States.
1:31
It's quasi-independent, but it's been
1:34
given the right to print money.
1:36
And I'll just draw it here as physical dollars,
1:38
but most of the money that is going to print actually
1:40
is electronic money.
1:42
And the way this affects the aggregate demand curve,
1:45
the Federal Reserve doesn't just print money
1:47
and go out and start buying things with that money.
1:49
Well, it does buy things, but it doesn't
1:51
go out and buy goods and services.
1:52
What it does with this is it essentially lends it out,
1:55
so it's essentially buying debt.
2:02
And if buying debt seems like a weird thing to say, buying debt
2:05
it is the same thing as lending money.
2:10
If I buy a treasury bond, so if I'm buying debt,
2:13
I'm buying a treasury bond means I'm implicitly
2:16
lending that money.
2:17
If I buy the bond directly from the government,
2:19
that means I'm lending that money to the US government.
2:22
If I directly buy a bond from a US corporation,
2:26
I'm essentially lending that money to the corporation.
2:29
They're going to give me interest payments
2:30
in the form of coupons, and then they're
2:32
going to pay back that money at some future date.
2:34
So this is essentially lending money.
2:36
And what this does is it's increasing the supply of money
2:39
that's out there to be lent.
2:41
And so if we think of the market for money-- so let's
2:45
see, now we're thinking microeconomic terms
2:47
for the market for money.
2:51
If this is the price of money, which is really
2:53
just the interest rate as a percentage,
2:59
and this right over here is the supply of money.
3:04
And I'll just draw-- so this might be our supply curve.
3:08
That's supply.
3:10
And this is the demand curve.
3:14
And let's say right over here, this is short-term money.
3:17
And we won't focus on the different durations and all
3:19
of that.
3:19
But let's say we're sitting right over here
3:21
at a clearing interest rate of 5%.
3:24
So it makes sense.
3:25
So this is right here.
3:26
This is our demand curve.
3:28
So all of the people who will get more than 5% benefit out
3:31
of the money-- maybe they have an investment where they could
3:34
get 10% on the money or 8% or 5.1%--
3:37
they're all willing to borrow that money and then invest it
3:40
in whatever they want to do.
3:41
Or this might even be consumption,
3:42
people who are saying, hey, 5%.
3:44
That's worth it for me to go out and buy
3:46
that thing that makes me whatever happy.
3:48
But from an investment point of view it makes even more sense.
3:49
If I'm going to get an 8% return on my money-- that's
3:52
my benefit-- it makes sense for me to borrow it at 5%.
3:55
It makes sense all the way up to 5.0001%.
3:58
I'd actually borrow it.
3:59
And so in the Federal Reserve, or any central bank,
4:02
prints money and it buys debt.
4:04
It goes out into debt markets and it usually
4:06
buys the safest kind of debt, but that
4:07
affects all of the debt markets.
4:09
It goes out and buys debt market.
4:11
They're essentially shifting the supply curve of money
4:14
to the right.
4:15
They shift the supply curve to the right.
4:17
And so at any given interest rate
4:19
you could say that there is more money.
4:22
And so the supply curve might look something like that.
4:26
And this is interesting because assuming the demand has not
4:28
shifted, what you now have is a different clearing
4:32
price, a different equilibrium price, for the money.
4:35
Maybe this is now at 3%.
4:40
And you also have more money being lent and borrowed.
4:43
So if this was the old quantity of money
4:44
that was lent and borrowed-- I'm just
4:47
going to make up a number here.
4:48
Let's say that this is $100 billion in some time period.
4:54
And now we're at $120 billion.
4:59
So now by essentially printing money, buying debt, increasing
5:02
the supply of money two things happen.
5:04
Interest rates went down.
5:06
And so now you have all of these characters
5:08
out here who before, they weren't going to borrow money
5:11
at 5% because their benefit on that money
5:14
was between 5% and 3%.
5:16
Maybe it's 4% or 3.5%.
5:19
It didn't make sense for them to borrow at 5%
5:21
and invest it and only get a 4% return or a 3% return.
5:25
But now that interest rates have gone down,
5:27
now it does make sense for them to borrow the money,
5:30
all the way down to someone who has some type of project
5:32
or investment that has a 3% return.
5:34
They also say, hey, I'm neutral.
5:36
Now I could borrow at 3%, and then I could invest it.
5:39
But definitely the person with 3.1% or 3.2%,
5:41
if they have investments that give them that much,
5:43
they would definitely want to borrow.
5:45
And we could assume that all this incremental borrowing--
5:48
so this little example that I did right over here--
5:49
all this incremental $20 billion of borrowing
5:52
is going to be spent.
5:53
People will borrow money not to just sit
5:56
but stuff it into their mattresses.
5:58
They'll borrow that money to go invest it in some way,
6:01
to spend it.
6:02
And so what this will do, all of this
6:03
will shift aggregate demand to the right.
6:06
Right here, we're talking in microeconomic terms,
6:08
but then if we think about aggregate supply and demand--
6:11
so this is aggregate.
6:14
Let me write aggregate right over here.
6:17
This is price.
6:18
This is real GDP.
6:21
This is our aggregate demand.
6:26
And then our short run aggregate supply might look something
6:29
like this.
6:34
And so if we're shifting aggregate demand
6:36
to the right where there's going to be more demand for goods
6:39
and services, these people are going to borrow this money
6:41
and spend it.
6:42
You're going to essentially stimulate the economy.
6:47
So this shifts to the right.
6:49
You have a situation where real GDP will go from this state
6:53
to this state right over here.
6:55
So it was expansionary.
6:56
And obviously, if the Federal Reserve decides
6:58
to print less money or if they even
7:01
decide to essentially soak up the money that's in the market
7:04
by selling some of the debt that they own,
7:07
so that they're sucking dollars out of it,
7:09
then the opposite effect would happen.
7:11
Now fiscal policy is essentially the government
7:14
directly going out there and demanding goods and services
7:17
from the economy.
7:19
You have the government.
7:21
It has two sources of revenue that it can spend.
7:25
It has money from taxes.
7:27
It has tax revenue.
7:28
And then it can go out and borrow money.
7:30
And so it also has access to debt markets.
7:34
And when the government borrows money,
7:36
they're essentially issuing treasury bills,
7:38
if you're talking about the US Treasury Bills and Treasury
7:40
Bonds.
7:40
If you were to buy those from the US government,
7:42
you're essentially lending money to the government
7:44
to finance their debt.
7:47
And so they can take these two sources of money,
7:49
and then if they decide to spend more-- and let's
7:53
say that they're going to hold taxes fixed.
7:55
So they're not going to take out any demand from the economy.
7:57
They might ratchet up debt and then ratchet up spending.
8:03
And then this government is directly
8:05
going out there and demanding more goods and services.
8:09
So that could also shift the aggregate demand curve
8:12
to the right.
8:12
So these are two different levers, two different tools,
8:15
that have been used in governments
8:17
all around the world to shift aggregate demand one way
8:20
or another or an attempt to shift aggregate demand one
8:23
way or the other.
8:23
Monetary policy is more indirect.
8:25
Printing money, using that to increase the supply of money
8:28
that's out there to be lent, that lowers interest rates.
8:32
And then because it lowers interest rates,
8:35
there's more willingness to borrow and invest that money.
8:38
Fiscal policy, you're directly going out there and just buying
8:42
more goods and services by usually ratcheting up
8:45
your debt.
8:46
Or fiscal policy could go the other way.
8:47
If you're trying to restrain the economy, you could lower
8:49
your debt, lower your spending, or you
8:51
could do some other combination. s",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,ntxMOKXHlfo,

0:00
Ever since the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 to 1871,
0:04
the Germans recognized that they were
0:06
likely to face another war with France.
0:08
That was the war that allowed Germany to unify.
0:10
They humiliated France.
0:12
They were able to capture some very valuable territory
0:15
from France, in particular Alsace and Lorraine,
0:17
which is very mineral rich.
0:19
And so the Germans were plotting too, well,
0:21
what are we going to do if we get into another war with them?
0:23
At the same time, once France and Russia had this alliance,
0:26
Germany fully recognized if there is a war with France,
0:29
it's likely to not be just with France.
0:31
It's likely to be a two front war.
0:33
On the Western Front, they'll be in conflict with France.
0:37
And on the Eastern Front, they'll
0:38
be in conflict with Russia.
0:40
And so to deal with this eventuality--
0:42
this is all the scheming that Germany
0:43
did in the decades going up to World War
0:46
I-- they came up with the Schlieffen Plan.
0:49
And I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it.
0:57
Named for Alfred von Schlieffen, he
0:59
was chief of the German Empire's general staff
1:02
from 1891 to 1905.
1:05
And it was based on how do you deal with a two front war?
1:09
And the general ides here were that Russia
1:13
had a large and almost inexhaustible army.
1:15
But because it was so large it would take a long time for it
1:18
to mobilize.
1:23
And the Germans are actually able to approximate it
1:25
correctly because this is how long it
1:27
did take the Russians to mobilize
1:28
at the beginning of World War I. They estimated that it would
1:31
take them about six weeks.
1:34
So the Schlieffen Plan called for enough German troops
1:38
on the Eastern Front, initially, in order
1:40
to keep the Russians at bay.
1:43
But then the main fighting force of the Germans,
1:45
while the Russians are mobilizing,
1:48
is to go after France and try to essentially knock France out
1:51
of commission, so that they're not facing a two front
1:53
war anymore.
1:55
And then have those troops go back
1:56
to fight against the Russians.
1:58
And the way that they wanted to do it
2:00
is by rolling through Belgium in a wheel like pattern like this.
2:04
And the reason why they wanted to do this wheel like pattern
2:07
is that they correctly predicted that the French were
2:10
very eager to get this territory right over here.
2:13
And the French actually had a plan--
2:14
they called it Plan 17- for going
2:16
after Alsace and Lorraine.
2:17
It was an offensive plan.
2:19
And the view is if the French army is
2:20
going in that direction, if the German army
2:23
rolls through Belgium and is able to get them from the rear,
2:25
they could put the French army out of commission.
2:28
So in early August 1914, the Germans,
2:32
once they declared war on France and on Russia,
2:35
the Germans tried to put the Schlieffen Plan into action.
2:39
And they frankly, almost succeeded.
2:42
So through August and early September,
2:46
the Germans were able to essentially roll
2:49
through Belgium and keep the combined, mainly French forces,
2:56
but there was also some assistance from British,
2:59
to keep them on their heels.
3:01
And this happened all the way until early September
3:04
when they get near the Marne, or a little bit
3:06
past the Marne River in France.
3:10
And it was here that the Sixth French Army--
3:13
and when we talk about armies we're
3:16
talking about huge numbers of troops.
3:17
The Sixth French Army had over 200,000 troops in it.
3:21
When we're talking about the Battle of the Marne--
3:23
which I'm about to talk to you.
3:24
We're talking about the first Battle of the Marne.
3:27
We're talking about a battle that
3:29
involves two million troops.
3:32
So these are battles that are occurring on an epic scale.
3:35
Just each of these armies-- this army
3:37
or this one, or even the German armies-- we're
3:41
talking about tens to hundreds of thousands of troops.
3:44
In general, an army characterize you're
3:47
talking about over 50,000, 60,000 troops.
3:51
So what happens as you go to early September, especially
3:54
September 5, 1914, the Sixth French Army
3:59
recognizes a mistake that the First German Army made.
4:04
By trying to roll around like this,
4:07
they exposed their right flank.
4:09
So right over here would be the right flank of the German army.
4:13
And just as most mammals, our flanks
4:17
are our weak spot, that area between your ribs
4:21
and your hips, the same thing is true for armies.
4:24
The front of the army tends to be
4:26
where you have the strongest forces.
4:28
And then you have your supply routes going back.
4:31
So if you can outflank an army-- and that's
4:33
what a lot of military strategy is designed around--
4:36
you can hit an army in its weaker points.
4:38
So by September 5, the First German Army recognized this,
4:43
but it was too late.
4:44
By September 6, they were essentially
4:48
being confronted by the Sixth French Army.
4:51
And by essentially turning to meet them
4:57
they created an opening between them and the Second German
5:00
Army.
5:00
And that opening was able-- the French and the British
5:04
were able to take advantage of that to essentially put
5:06
the Germans on their heels after a month of advancing.
5:10
And so right over here, you have the various French armies.
5:16
And they were assisted by the British expeditionary force.
5:22
And so from the Battle of the Marne, which
5:25
was essentially, most historians would say, between September 6,
5:28
or September 5, September 6 and September 12,
5:31
they were able to put the Germans on the retreat.
5:35
The Germans retreated past the Aisne River.
5:37
And then once you get into November
5:39
and the end of the year of 1914, the Germans essentially
5:43
entrenched themselves.
5:44
They were literally building deep trenches
5:48
in northern France and a little bit of western Belgium.
5:51
And what I have right over here-- let
5:53
me see if I can draw it.
5:54
What I have right over here, what the boundaries are
5:57
eventually happened after the Germans
6:00
suffered, essentially, their first big defeat.
6:03
They had to retreat and they had to literally retrench.
6:06
And this is what the borders would then be like.
6:10
And these were literally trenches getting dug here.
6:14
This first stage of the war was hugely dynamic.
6:17
You had armies moving fairly rapidly
6:19
over a period of weeks and months.
6:22
But then once the Germans retrenched,
6:23
you have roughly this position being static for the next three
6:27
years and the famous trench warfare of the Western front
6:30
that you might have seen movies on.
6:33
And I want to emphasize this was a big deal.
6:35
The first Battle of the Marne-- sometimes
6:37
it's called the Miracle of the Marne--
6:41
if the French, with British help,
6:43
were not able to push the Germans back,
6:45
they might have accomplished the Schlieffen Plan
6:47
and actually maybe would have won World War I,
6:50
or at least been able to win the Western front fairly quickly.
6:53
And then been able to deal with the Russians
6:55
a little bit better.
6:56
But because of the Miracle at the Marne--
6:59
which was hugely bloody.
7:00
We're talking about 500,000 casualties on both sides.
7:03
We're talking 100,000 to 200,000 dead on both sides.
7:07
But because of that, that was able to hold off the Germans.
7:10
But it got the Western front into this ugly three year
7:13
long trench warfare.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,7AOOlxbZN3E,

0:00
As we enter into 1917, the United States
0:04
has been able to maintain its neutrality in World War
0:07
I. In fact, President Wilson has just won a re-election based
0:10
on the platform that he kept us out of war.
0:14
And to large degree, he was able to keep the US out of war
0:17
because the German Empire had pulled back
0:19
from its unrestricted submarine warfare.
0:22
After the sinking of the Lusitania
0:23
and how angered America had gotten,
0:25
they said, OK, we're not going to attack
0:27
passenger vessels anymore.
0:28
We're only going to attack things that are definitely
0:31
British, non-passenger vessels.
0:34
But as we go into January 1917, the British blockade
0:39
on the Central Powers was having its effect.
0:41
And the Central Powers were getting desperate,
0:43
in particular Germany.
0:45
And so they are eager to essentially do
0:47
the same to the British.
0:49
Once again, go with the unrestricted submarine warfare.
0:53
But the Germans knew that if they
0:55
were to go back to this, that it's likely that the US would
0:58
enter the war on the side of the Allies.
1:01
So knowing that was likely to happen.
1:03
They said, well, how could we slow the US down.
1:05
And the thinking was, well, maybe we could somehow
1:07
enlisted the help of Mexico which at the time
1:10
was not the best terms with the United States.
1:13
And so Arthur Zimmerman who was the German Foreign Secretary,
1:19
the equivalent of the United States Secretary of State.
1:21
The Foreign Minister, Arthur Zimmerman
1:24
sends an encoded a telegram to the Mexicans.
1:28
And it's encoded, especially because it
1:30
has to go over lines that are controlled by the Americans.
1:34
And in it, he actually proposes an alliance
1:38
to slow the Americans down.
1:41
So this is what he wrote.
1:42
So this is a coded telegram.
1:44
And then, it was actually intercepted
1:46
by British intelligence and decoded and then shared
1:49
with the Americans, and then that
1:51
was also then made public to the American public.
1:55
And so this is why it's fascinating to actually read
1:57
this stuff.
1:57
This is January 1917.
2:00
This is the Germans talking to the Mexicans.
2:02
""We intend to begin on the first of February
2:05

2:09
We shall endeavor in spite of this
2:11
to keep the United States of America neutral.

2:16
we make Mexico a proposal alliance
2:18
on the following basis-- make war together, make peace
2:22
together, generous financial support, and an understanding
2:26
on our part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost
2:32
territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.
2:37
The settlement in detail is left to you.
2:39
You will inform the President--"" they're
2:41
talking about the president of Mexico.
2:42
""--of the above most secretly as soon as the outbreak of war
2:46
with the United States of America is certain and add
2:50
the suggestion that he should, on his own initiative,
2:53
invite Japan to immediate adherence and at the same time
2:56
mediate between Japan and ourselves.
2:59
Please call the President's attention to the fact
3:02
that the ruthless employment of our submarines
3:06
now offers the prospect of compelling England
3:09
in a few months to make peace.
3:12
Signed Zimmerman.""
3:14
Now, the Mexicans, when they read this,
3:15
they really didn't take it too seriously.
3:17
They didn't think that they could seriously
3:19
engage the US in a war.
3:20
They couldn't seriously take back
3:21
or occupy these territories.
3:23
So they didn't really think much of it.
3:24
The real effect of this telegram was
3:26
to make the American public angry.
3:30
They were going to go back into the unrestricted submarine
3:32
warfare.
3:33
And the Germans, themselves, talk about ruthless-- ""ruthless
3:36
employment of our the submarines.""
3:40
So when people talk about, what were the causes.
3:42
What brought the US into war?
3:44
The ones that are typically cited
3:46
are the unrestricted submarine warfare.
3:49
The sinking of the Lusitania.
3:50
The Zimmerman telegram that was trying
3:52
to get Mexico to somehow get into a war with the US
3:56
and reclaim these territories.

This is Prime Minister Lloyd George of the UK,
0:29
Vittorio Orlando of Italy,
0:30
Georges Clemenceau of France,
0:33
President Woodrow Wilson of the United States.
0:36
They come to the Paris Peace Conference
0:37
with very different outlooks of
0:39
what the peace should look like.
0:41
We already learned about
0:42
President Wilson's ""Fourteen Points"".
0:44
It was very idealistic.
0:45
It talked about making the world
0:46
safe for democracy, how people should
0:49
determine their own fate,
0:50
how we should have the self-determination,
0:53
the end of empires, free trade,
0:55
creating a League of Nations so that
0:57
you can avoid things like World War I again.
1:00
The European side was not quite
1:02
as idealistic, especially the French.
1:04
As you can imagine, the U.S. lost a lot
1:07
of soldiers in World War I, but
1:08
the French lost a significant fraction
1:10
of their adult males in World War I.
1:12
The ugly western front was fought
1:14
in their country, so they were much more
1:17
eager to make Germany pay for what it's done.
1:21
The terms of the treaty with Germany,
1:23
the Treaty of Versailles,
1:25
and the Treaty of Versailles,
1:27
it's important to note, is only one of
1:28
several treaties that came out of the
1:30

1:31
It tends to get the most attention
1:33
because it was a treaty with Germany,

Treaty of Versailles, and many people
1:37
blame it for being part of the cause

The Treaty of Versailles was the treaty
1:51
with Germany .
1:52
You have other treaties; with the Austrians and now since
1:54
the Austro-Hungarian empire is being broken up,
1:56
the Hungarians, the Ottomans, so on and so forth.
1:59
The Treaty of Versailles did several things.
2:02
First, this was kind of in line
2:04
especially with the French-thinking, is
2:06
it assigned the guilt to Germany ...
2:08
So war guilt.
2:10
War guilt for Germany.
2:14
And depending on where you view,
2:16
you could view this as a fairly strong thing.
2:17
The argument for saying Germany is
2:19
responsible for the war is in
2:21
late July, early August of 1914,
2:25
it didn't take much for Germany
2:27
to declare war on Russia, then on France,
2:29
and then invade Belgium.
2:31
This was literally a matter of days.
2:33
It was pretty clear that Germany was
2:34
already mobilized to do this,
2:36
it was eager to do this,
2:37
and it did do this without much provocation.
2:40
At that point, it was really just based on
2:42
Russian mobilization.
2:43
Those who would argue this was a little strong,
2:45
would say Germany definitely played a role
2:48
in the war, in maybe escalating the war,
2:50
but it didn't start the war.
2:52
You have the assassination of
2:54
the Archduke of Franz Ferdinand,
2:57
of Austro-Hungary.
2:59
It was supported by elements in Serbia.
3:04
Then you have the Austro-Hungarians who
3:05
put out these very hard terms to
3:08
the Serbians, bring these people to justice
3:10
immediately, otherwise we're declaring war.
3:12
It seemed like they wanted to declare war.
3:14
They do declare war in July of 1914.
3:16
The Russians, they don't let that be
3:18
a little regional conflict,
3:19
the Russians decide to start mobilizing,
3:22
giving the Germans the pretext to
3:26
justify their invasions,
3:27
to kind of trigger this blank check
3:29
that they've given the Austro-Hungarians.
3:31
There's a lot of blame that could go around,
3:34
but the Treaty of Versailles places it
3:36
with Germany.
3:37
This justifies the rationale to make
3:40
Germany pay for the war.
3:42
This leads to reparations ...
3:45
Reparations for Germany,
3:46
which is essentially is like,
3:47
""Look, Germany, you don't have to pay
3:49
the ally powers for all of their lost,
3:51
especially their losses to their
3:53
economy due to the fact that you
3:55
are guilty of starting of this war guilt.""
4:01
The reparations were not just in
4:02
paper currency, the reparations were
4:05
in gold, in resources.
4:07
It was a very tangible reparations.
4:10
It's an interesting question because
4:11
these reparations are often referred to
4:14
when people talked to,
4:15
these were disabling reparations.
4:17
They brought the German economy down.
4:19
It is an open question. They were large.
4:22
In modern dollars, the estimates I've seen,
4:24
they were approximately
4:25
$400 billion in 2013 money.
4:31
That is a very, very large number,
4:33
but it's not a huge number for
4:34
a reasonably-sized economy like Germany.
4:37
Although the economy was in bad shape
4:38
at the end of World War I.
4:40
It's not clear whether it by itself
4:43
would have debilitated their economy.
4:46
More likely, or if you were to think
4:48
it's a cause, it's more the humiliation of it,
4:50
that generations of Germans,
4:52
many of them; 10, 20, 30 years in the future,
4:54
had nothing to do with World War I,
4:56
would be continuing to pay
4:57
reparations to the allies.
5:00
So there's a question of its impact on
5:01
the economy and there's just the question
5:05
of how humiliating it was.
5:10
As we go, the reparations only last
5:12
for about 10 years and
5:14
Germany pays the equivalent of about
5:16
$60 billion in modern terms,
5:18
$60 billion in 2013 dollars.
5:20
That's equivalent to about $5 billion
5:22
in 1920 money.
5:25
On top of the reparations,
5:27
the allies were not interested in
5:29
fighting another war with Germany,
5:31
although ironically, by having very harsh
5:33
terms of the treaty, they might have
5:34
triggered the next war in World War II,
5:37
The Rise of Hitler.
5:38
Since they didn't want to have another
5:40
war with Germany, they essentially limited
5:41
the German army to 100,000 men,
5:44
which is a very small army,
5:46
as we've seen in many of the battles.
5:48
You had battles with 400,000 or 500,000 men,
5:51
so this is pretty much just like a
5:53
police force, it's not really an army.
5:56
They weren't allowed any longer to have
5:57
submarines, U-boats, any kind of
6:01
heavy military equipment, artillary,
6:03
heavy artillary, military airplanes,
6:06
battleships of any kind.
6:09
It was really just a scaffold of an army
6:11
so that there wouldn't be another,
6:14
or they hoped there would not be,
6:16
another German invasion.
6:18
On top of that, Germany was stripped of territory.
6:23
... Territory ...
6:24
Some of that was directly in Germany.
6:27
Poland was carved out of part of
6:33
the German empire.
6:34
This is the new Poland that's carved out
6:36
out of the Paris Peace Conference.
6:38
You see right over here, it cuts Germany
6:40
into two pieces.
6:41
East Prussia is still part of Germany,
6:43
but it's all by itself right out here.
6:45
Poland is cut out,
6:46
Germany loses Alsace-Lorraine, which
6:48
it captured in 1871 after the
6:50
Franco-Prussian war.
6:52
Mineral-rich region, the French had been
6:54
eager to get it back.
6:55
The Germans, actually that was one of their
6:57
arguable justification why they wanted
6:59
to premptively attack France,
7:00
because they knew that France was
7:02
eager to capture it back
7:03
at some point in the future.
7:05
On top of that, Germany lost its colonies.
7:09
Germany was nowhere near as big of an
7:11
empire as the British or even the French,
7:13
it was actually a fairly new country
7:14
formed in 1871, but it did have an empire.
7:19
It had colonies in southwest Africa,
7:22
I'll do this in darker colors,
7:23
actually throughout Africa and had colonies
7:27
in the Pacific.
7:29
It even had a colony in China.
7:34
All of that was then given over to
7:37
the allies.
7:40
The big idea, from the Treaty of Versailles,
7:42
is that, most historians would say it
7:44
was really kind of sticking it to
7:46
the Germans.
7:47
The Germans felt it was humilating
7:48
and one could argue that it led to
7:51
some of the extremism that we'll see
7:53
in the next few decades of Germany.
7:55
The one win that Woodrow Wilson was able
7:57
to get out the Treaty of Versailles,
7:59
is it did set up the League of Nations.
8:01
The League of Nations.
8:05
The irony here is that the US does not
8:08
ratify the Treaty of Versailles because
8:09
it's suspicious of these kind of
8:11
extra national organizations.
8:13
It actually wasn't happy with some of the
8:14
territorial distribution, that it was
8:16
just giving it from empire to another
8:18
as opposed to having self-determination.
8:21
The US was not actually a signatory,
8:23
it did not actually sign the treaty.
8:26
It did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles.
8:28
Regardless of that, the Treaty of Versailles
8:30
had a huge impact in sticking it to the Germans.
8:34
On top of that, the Paris Peace Conference,
8:36
as we've already said,
8:37
had various treaties with the other
8:39
central powers and some of the,
8:42
and I'm not going to go into detail
8:43
on what happened, especially
8:44
the Ottoman Empire, that's worth another video,
8:46
but the big effect on the Austro-Hungarian
8:50
Empire is that it essentially is not
8:51
an empire anymore.
8:52
It was split up into various countries.
8:54
Austria was set up as a separate country.
8:57
Actually the Treaty of Versailles,
8:59
in the Treaty of Versailles,
9:00
Germany is forbidden from in any way
9:03
merging with Austria, a German-speaking country.
9:06
You have Hungary becoming a separate state.
9:11
You have a new state of Czechoslovakia.
9:14
You have a new state of Yugoslavia.
9:18
All of a sudden, the trigger of
9:23
World War I, the desire of having this
9:24
unified southern Slavik state is now
9:26
becoming a reality.
9:28
You have Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia ...
9:32
and Slovenia are taken out of
9:33
the Austro-Hungarian empire.
9:36
You have a major redrawing of the map
9:38
of Europe.
9:39
Some of these new nations here
9:41
in eastern Europe are out of
9:44
the old Russian empire.
9:45
They were able to declare their independence,
9:47
some of it short-lived before becoming
9:49
satellite states or becoming part of
9:50
the USSR, but they had their
9:53
short-lived independence after the fall
9:56
of the Russian empire.
9:57
The map of Europe is dramatically changed
10:00
due to the Paris Peace Conference,
10:01
the Treaty of Versailles,
10:02
the fall of the Russian empire,

Despite the fact that Wilson had just won reelection in 1916
0:04
based on a platform of keeping the United States out of war,
0:07
by April of 1917, the administration
0:13
had decided that Germany had gone too far.
0:16
And in particular, had gone too far
0:17
with the unrestricted submarine warfare.
0:20
So this right over here is a picture
0:22
of President Wilson on April 2, 1917, giving a war
0:28
message to Congress as to why the US needs
0:31
to declare war on Germany.
0:34
And April 4, Congress passes the resolution to declare war.
0:39
And then the President approves it on April 6.
0:42
So by early April, the United States was at war with Germany.
0:47
Which is a good time to start thinking about,
0:49
why did all of this happen.
0:51
Now, the things that are typically
0:52
cited, and these are the things that
0:54
are inflamed public opinion in the US and that many of which
0:57
were cited by President Woodrow Wilson.
1:00
And in this tutorial that this is
1:01
part of on khanacademy.org, I put
1:03
the entire text of his speech, which I highly recommend
1:06
reading to see all of the things the President Wilson
1:09
cited in his speech.
1:10
But just as a summary of that, the things that tend to get
1:13
cited most often are the unrestricted submarine warfare
1:17
on the part of Germany.
1:22
And particular cases or the most cited
1:24
example of that is the sinking of the Lusitania.
1:27
The Germans had stopped doing that for a little
1:29
under two years.
1:30
But then, as we enter into 1917, they began doing it again.
1:35
And it also made the Americans quite angry
1:38
to realize that the Germans were trying
1:40
to incite the Mexicans against them.
1:42
So you have the Zimmerman telegram.
1:47
Zimmerman telegram is also a reason
1:50
that the Wilson administration, and why people in general,
1:53
were fairly angry about things.
1:56
Now, on top of that, there were atrocities
2:00
committed by the Germans in their march
2:02
through Belgium as they were trying
2:04
to execute on the Schlieffen Plan.
2:07
So Belgian atrocities.
2:10
And these were earlier in the war in 1914, which immediately
2:13
made many Americans not like what's going on.
2:16
Belgian atrocities.
2:18
And to put on top of that, the British
2:20
were able to leverage the Belgian atrocities to fairly,
2:24
to execute a fairly effective propaganda campaign in America.
2:31
Now on top of that-- and this is something
2:33
that Wilson speaks very strongly about in his speech--
2:36
is the notion of fighting for democracy.
2:44
And what you have here, in the First World War, the Central
2:47
Powers.
2:48
You're talking about the German Empire,
2:49
you're talking about the Austro-Hungarians.
2:51
These are monarchies.
2:52
These are emperors who are controlling it.
2:54
And even though the UK, the United Kingdom,
2:56
was nominally a kingdom, it was really a democracy.
3:00
At least for those who could vote.
3:02
We're not talking about the entire British Empire.
3:04
So UK is functionally a democracy, democratic.
3:09
And so was the Third French Republic.
3:13
And so was France.
3:15
So there's this argument that the US
3:16
is fighting for the representation of people.
3:22
Now, there is a more cynical argument
3:24
that some people have made.
3:25
And I think it's reasonable to give that to due time.
3:28
And one of the cynical arguments,
3:30
or more cynical arguments, is that the US
3:32
had close financial and trade ties to Britain,
3:34
not to mention cultural ties.
3:36
Financial ties to the British.
3:41
On top of that, you had very successful British propaganda.
3:45
One, talking about the atrocities in Belgium,
3:48
which did actually happen.
3:49
But the British were able to exploit
3:51
this as a propaganda machine.
3:53
Successful propaganda.
3:54
But they also spread rumors that after the sinking
3:57
of the Lusitania that the Germans
3:59
had their school children celebrating.
4:01
And these were all made up propaganda.
4:07
And then, more cynical view of why
4:10
the US entered the war-- and this is true
4:12
of probably most wars-- is that there
4:14
was a lot of lobbying on the part of war profiteers.
4:20
In fact, in ""Little Orphan Annie,"" Daddy Warbucks,
4:23
the name, the reason why his last name is Warbucks
4:25
is because he made his fortune as a war profiteer
4:29
during World War I. And war profiteers,
4:31
these are people who might be selling arms to the Allies.
4:35
Or who might sell arms to the US government
4:37
if the US were to get into a war that might somehow
4:39
supply the troops.
4:40
And it includes, potentially, folks on Wall Street.
4:43
There were significant lending to the Allies,
4:46
and mainly the Allies, not the Central Power.
4:49
And so the view is if the Allies win,
4:50
those loans are going to be made good.
4:53
And I had the entire text of the speech
4:56
from Senator George Norris who was one of five senators,
5:00
or sorry, one of six senators to vote against the resolution
5:04
to go to war.
5:04
There were 50 representatives who also voted against it.
5:09
This is a little excerpt but also in this tutorial,
5:11
I have the full text of his speech.
5:12
And I highly, highly, highly recommend reading that
5:15
along with Wilson's text of his speech to Congress in his war
5:20
message.
5:21
But I'll just read this part because it does, I think,
5:23
point out that the US, from the beginning,
5:26
did have biases that were more pro-British.
5:30
And so this is part of his speech.
5:31
""The reason given by the President
5:33
in asking Congress to declare war against Germany
5:36
is that the German government has declared certain war zones,
5:39
within which by the use of submarines,
5:41
she sinks, without notice, American ships
5:43
and destroys American lives.
5:45
The first war zone was declared by Great Britain.
5:49
She gave us and the world notice of it
5:51
on the 4th day of November 1914.
5:54
The zone became effective November 5, 1914.
5:58
This zone, so declared by Great Britain,
6:00
covered the whole of the North Sea.
6:02
The first German war zone was declared
6:04
on the 4th day of February, 1915,
6:07
just three months after the British war zone was declared.
6:10
Germany gave 15 days notice of the establishment
6:13
of her zone, which became effective
6:15
on the 18th day of February, 1915.
6:18
The German war zone cover the English Channel
6:21
and the high seawaters around the British Isles.
6:24
It is unnecessary to cite authority
6:26
to show that both of these orders declaring military zones
6:30
were illegal and contrary to international law.
6:34
It is sufficient to say that our government has officially
6:37
declared both of them to be illegal
6:40
and has officially protested against both of them.
6:43
The only difference is that, in the case of Germany
6:46
we have persisted in our protest,
6:48
while in the case of England, we have submitted.""
6:51
And I encourage you, once again, to read
6:54
the text of both Wilson's speech and Senator Norris' speech
7:00
and come up to your, with your own decisions.

We know the US is running a relatively large trade
0:03
deficit relative to China in 2009.
0:06
We imported $260 billion more than we exported to China.
0:13
And we know from the last few videos
0:15
that the way that China is keeping their currency
0:18
from appreciating because of this trade imbalance
0:20
is that they're going out there, printing money, and using
0:23
that yuan to buy dollar assets.
0:27
And we see over here in 2006, 2007, 2008,
0:31
major increases in US assets.
0:34
But what's a little bit more interesting
0:36
is that, in 2009, we didn't have a huge increase.
0:39
It's pretty large by any standard, but not large enough
0:42
to offset the actual trade imbalance.
0:44
So how did China keep its currency peg?
0:47
Even better, let's actually look at-- because this isn't just
0:50
the Chinese government.
0:51
These are just ownership of US assets by Chinese nationals.
0:56
But we can actually look at the major foreign holders
0:59
of treasury securities.
1:01
This actually comes from the Treasury's own website.
1:04
And it tells us how much different central banks,
1:08
how many the treasury securities they are actually holding.
1:12
And you can see China is the biggest holder.
1:16
If you go to November of 2009, it has $929 billion.
1:21
This is the People's Bank of China.
1:23
It has $929 billion worth of US treasuries.
1:29
But what's interesting here, it is the largest holder,
1:31
but as we go from November of 2009 to November of 2010
1:35
their holdings actually went down.
1:38
Not by a ton.
1:39
They're still right around $900 billion.
1:41
But they went down.
1:43
So given the fact that we have this trade deficit, given
1:45
the fact that they want to peg their currency,
1:48
and that they want to print money, and go
1:49
buy other people's assets, how did this happen?
1:52
How did the number of treasuries actually go down?
1:56
And actually how were they able to reduce the amount of all US
2:00
assets that they bought?
2:03
Now, the treasury answer is they don't
2:05
have to just buy treasuries.
2:06
They could by other US assets, but even over here we
2:09
saw that they didn't buy a ton of other US assets.
2:12
And a clue to what's happening here,
2:15
and this isn't exactly what's necessarily happening,
2:17
it's far more complicated than I could explain in one video,
2:20
is that we do see other countries whose US Treasury
2:23
holdings are increasing dramatically
2:25
over the course of 2010.
2:27
In particular, you see the United Kingdom.
2:31
Their holdings have grown from $155 billion to $500 billion
2:36
over the course of 2010.
2:38
And this is relative.
2:39
The United Kingdom does not have a significant trade imbalance
2:43
one way or the other with the United States.
2:45
And we actually see we actually see that it's currency really
2:49
didn't change much over the course of 2010.
2:52
It's been about the same.
2:54
And this looks more dramatic than it really is.
2:57
So the answer, and it could be much more complicated
3:00
than this, is that China has decided to somewhat diversify
3:03
from buying US treasuries, and in particular US assets.
3:07
And maybe they're diversifying to the pound sterling,
3:10
maybe they're diversifying to the Euro.
3:12
And so they will start buying, say, British assets.
3:17
But the British don't want their currency
3:19
to appreciate too much because then they'll
3:21
suffer trade consequences.
3:23
Their goods will be too expensive.
3:25
And so the British Central Bank would then
3:27
want to maybe, so that their currency does not
3:29
appreciate relative to the dollar,
3:31
they'll want to go and buy American assets.
3:35
And that's what it looks like is actually happening.
3:37
And maybe one other small point is that the Chinese government
3:40
has slowly allowed its currency to appreciate.
3:43
But the appreciation isn't as dramatic
3:46
as this chart makes it look.
3:47
This is 6.8 yuan to the dollar at the beginning of 2010

Dr. Steven Zucker: We're on the first floor
0:04
of Orsanmichele, which is this extraordinarily
0:07
complicated and important building.
0:09
It's a grainary and it's odd to think
0:11
of a grainary right in the middle of town.
0:13
Dr. Beth Harris: Well, we don't often
0:15
think about granaries.
0:17
Granaries were a place to store grain.
0:20
Dr. Zucker: But this was incredibly important
0:21
because there were years when a town
0:23
might be under siege and you couldn't get to the fields,
0:26
or there might be bad harvests.
0:27
Dr. Harris: Right, so right here on the first floor
0:29
of Orsanmichele, there was a grain market
0:32
and it was open.
0:33
Dr. Zucker: And then upstairs there were
0:35
the storage areas and those are huge spaces.
0:38
Dr. Harris: So this was, at one point,
0:39
the church and then became a grainary
0:42
and there was an image of the Madonna
0:45
that was located here that was believed to have
0:47
miraculous powers and at some point it burned
0:50
and then another image of the Virgin was created
0:53
Dr. Zucker: Was endued with the same powers
0:56
and I think we're up to the third version.
0:58
This was by Bernardo Daddi, but it's surrounded
1:01
by this extraordinary alter,
1:03
which was by [Orcania], who we generally
1:05
think of as a painter.
1:07
Dr. Harris: It's an amazing tabernacle
1:09
housing this miraculous image of the Virgin,
1:12
so we have to imagine that this space was once open.
1:16
Dr. Zucker: Okay, so the walls that are there now
1:17
we're not there originally.
1:18
This was really a part of the city.
1:20
The city, in a sense, flowed through it.
1:22
I think it's important to think about this place
1:24
as an intersection of the spiritual,
1:27
it was a church, and of the sort of everyday
1:30
business of the city, that is it was a grainary.
1:32
In even it's location, it's midway between
1:36
the great cathedral the Duomo and
1:38
of the town hall, the Signoria.
1:40
Dr. Harris: It's here that the first Renaissance
1:42
sculptures were created for the niches
1:45
on the outside of this building.
1:47
It's in this context that the first, really,
1:50
humanist Renaissance sculptures are born.
1:53
Dr. Zucker: Let's go upstairs
1:54
because sculptures that used to be in the niches
1:56
are now all protected upstairs in the area
1:58
that used to hold the grain.
2:00
Dr. Harris: We just climbed up a long flight of stairs
2:03
and we entered a large open space,
2:06
filled with the sculptures, the monumental figures,
2:10
that stood on the outside of Orsanmichele
2:13
in the niches.
2:15
Dr. Zucker: So, now if you go outside,
2:16
you see casts of the originals, which are here
2:19
because it's safer from the elements.
2:21
Dr. Harris: To protect them.
2:22
Dr. Zucker: Yeah.
2:23
Dr. Harris: In the very early 15th century
2:24
the guilds of Florence each were responsible
2:27
for completing a figure for a niche
2:31
on the outside of Orsanmichele
2:33
and the guilds each commissioned a sculptor
2:35
of their choice and we're sitting in front
2:39
of Donatello's Saint Mark, which was commissioned
2:42
by the Linen Drapers Guild.
2:44
Donatello gives us this classical figure.
2:47
Dr. Zucker: So, what is classical about it?
2:49
I mean, the first things your eyes see,
2:51
of course, is this incredible contrapposto
2:52
that comes through even under that heavy cloth.
2:55
I mean, look at the way, for instance,
2:57
that his right engaged leg, the drape falls down
3:01
to almost as if that's the fluting of the column.
3:03
Dr. Harris: And we can see his left knee
3:04
pressing through the drapery, so Donatello
3:07
is really reviving contrapposto,
3:09
which hasn't been seen in western art
3:12
in a thousand years.
3:14
Dr. Zucker: But it's so beautifully handled.
3:16
You have the sense of the absolute stability
3:19
of this figure and yet the sense of his movement.
3:22
Dr. Harris: The thing that's most impressive
3:24
is the psychological intensity of this figure,
3:26
which is really overwhelming.
3:29
There's a sense, almost as though,
3:31
along with the contrapposto, he's going to move
3:34
and he's going to speak.
3:36
There's a real sense of the dignity of Mark here
3:40
and I think by extension, that sense that one has
3:43
in the Florentine Renaissance of the dignity of man,
3:45
of human beings.
3:47
Dr. Zucker: There's a kind of intensity.
3:48
There's a kind of focus.
3:49
There's a kind of deep human sense of understanding
3:53
in that face, in the just little bit
3:56
of the furrow of the brow that you can see
3:58
and the way that the head is cocked slightly
4:01
and it's off-center in terms of the shoulders,
4:04
turning back around and there's an interior
4:07
awareness, a kind of interior intelligence
4:10
that comes through so starkly.
4:12
Dr. Harris: At the same time, without a halo.
4:16
Dr. Zucker: Yeah.
4:16
Dr. Harris: I have no doubt that this is
4:18
someone who sees something that ordinary human beings
4:22
don't see, when you look at his eyes,
4:24
he is, in a way, seeing past us.
4:26
Dr. Zucker: So, isn't that the core
4:28
of the story of the Florentine experience
4:30
in the 15th century?
4:32
You have this intensely devout culture
4:35
and yet at the same time, you have a culture
4:37
that is beginning to really celebrate human experience,
4:40
the individual and the idea of the rational.

0:00
Welcome back.
0:01
So I was trying to rush and finish a problem in the last
0:05
two minutes of the video, and I realize that's just bad
0:08
teaching, because I end up rushing.
0:09
So this is the problem we were going to work on, and you'll
0:11
see a lot of these.
0:12
They just want you to become familiar with the variables in
0:17
Newton's law of gravitation.
0:19
So I said that there's two planets, one is Earth.
0:23
Now I have time to draw things, so that's Earth.
0:27
And then there's Small Earth.
0:28
And Small Earth-- well, maybe I'll just call it the small
0:32
planet, so we don't get confused.
0:34
It's green, showing that there's probably
0:37
life on that planet.
0:40
Let's say it has 1/2 the radius, and 1/2 the mass.
0:45
So if you think about it, it's probably a
0:46
lot denser than Earth.
0:48
That's a good problem to think about.
0:49
How much denser is it, right?
0:51
Because if you have 1/2 the radius, your volume is much
0:55
less than 1/2.
0:56
I don't want to go into that now, but that's something for
0:58
you to think about.
0:58
But my question is what fraction, if I'm standing on
1:01
the surface of this-- so the same person, so Sal, if I'm on
1:06
Earth, what fraction is the pull when I'm on this small
1:13
green planet?
1:15
So what is the pull on me on Earth?
1:18
Well, it's just going to be-- my weight on Earth, the force
1:23
on Earth, is going to be equal to the gravitational constant
1:28
times my mass, mass of me.
1:35
So m sub m times the mass of Earth divided by what?
1:41
We learned in the last video, divided by the distance
1:44
between me and the center of the mass of Earth.
1:45
Really, my center of mass and the center of mass of Earth.
1:49
But this is between the surface of the Earth, and I'd
1:52
like to think that I'm not short, but it's negligible
1:56
between my center of mass and the surface, so we'll just
1:58
consider the radius of the Earth.
2:00
So we divide it by the radius of the Earth squared.
2:08
Using these same variables, what's going to be the force
2:11
on this other planet?
2:13
So the force on the other planet, this green planet--
2:16
I'll do it in green-- and we're calling it the small
2:20
planet, it equals what?
2:23
It equals the gravitational constant again.
2:26
And my mass doesn't change when I go from one planet to
2:29
another, right?
2:31
Its mass now is what?
2:33
We would write it m sub s here, right?
2:37
This is the small planet.
2:39
And we wrote right here that it's 1/2 the mass of Earth, so
2:41
I'll just write that.
2:42
So it's 1/2 the mass of Earth.
2:48
And what's its radius?
2:49
What's the radius now?
2:51
I could just write the radius of the small planet squared,
2:54
but I'll say, well, we know.
2:54
It's 1/2 the radius of Earth, so let's put that in there.
2:57
So 1/2 radius of Earth.
3:00
We have to square it.
3:02
Let's see what this simplifies to.
3:04
This equals-- so we can take this 1/2 here-- 1/2G mass of
3:12
me times mass of Earth over-- what's 1/2 squared?
3:18
It's 1/4.
3:19
Over 1/4 radius of Earth squared.
3:26
And what's 1/2 divided by 1/4?
3:30
1/4 goes into 1/2 two times, right?
3:32
Or another way you can think about it is if you have a
3:33
fraction in the denominator, when you put it in the
3:35
numerator, you flip it and it becomes 4.
3:38
So 4 times 1/2 is 2.
3:39
Either way, it's just math.
3:41
So the force on the small planet is going to be equal to
3:45
1/2 divided by 1/4 is 2 times G, mass of me, times mass of
3:53
Earth, divided by the radius of Earth squared.
3:56
And if we look up here, this is the same
4:01
thing as this, right?
4:05
It's identical.
4:07
So we know that the force that applied to me when I'm on the
4:10
surface of the small planet is actually two times the force
4:15
applied on Earth, when I go to Earth.
4:19
And that's something interesting to think about,
4:20
because you might have said initially, wow, you know, the
4:24
mass of the object matters a lot in gravity.
4:27
The more massive the object, the more it's
4:29
going to pull on me.
4:31
But what we see here is that actually, no.
4:33
When I'm on the surface of this smaller planet, it's
4:36
pulling even harder on me.
4:37
And why is that?
4:38
Well, because I'm actually closer to its center of mass.
4:41
And as we talked about earlier in this video, this object is
4:45
probably a lot denser.
4:46
You could say it's only 1/2 the mass, but it's much less
4:50
than 1/2 of the volume, right?
4:51
Because the volume is the cube of the radius and all of that.
4:55
I don't want to confuse you, but this is just something to
4:56
think about.
4:57
So not only does the mass matter, but the
4:59
radius matters a lot.
5:01
And the radius is actually the square, so it actually
5:03
matters even more.
5:06
So that's something that's pretty
5:09
interesting to think about.
5:10
And these are actually very common problems when they just
5:14
want to tell you, oh, you go to a planet that is two times
5:16
the mass of another planet, et cetera, et cetera, what is the
5:21
difference in force between the two?
5:23
And one thing I want you to realize, actually, before I
5:25
finish this video since I do have some extra time, when we
5:29
think about gravity, especially with planets and
5:30
all of that, you always feel like, oh, it's
5:33
Earth pulling on me.
5:36
Let's say that this is the Earth, and the Earth is huge,
5:41
and this is a tiny spaceship right here.
5:45
It's traveling.
5:48
You always think that Earth is pulling on
5:50
the spaceship, right?
5:51
The gravitational force of Earth.
5:53
But it actually turns out, when we looked at the formula,
5:57
the formula is symmetric.
5:57
It's not really saying one is pulling on the other.
5:59
They're actually saying this is the force
6:01
between the two objects.
6:03
They're attracted to each other.
6:04
So if the Earth is pulling on me with the force of 500
6:13
Newtons, it actually turns out that I am pulling on the Earth
6:16
with an equal and opposite force of 5 Newtons.
6:18
We're pulling towards each other.
6:20
It just feels like the Earth is, at least from my point of
6:23
view, that the Earth is pulling to me.
6:25
And we're actually both being pulled towards the combined
6:29
center of mass.
6:30
So in this situation, let's say the Earth is pulling on
6:33
the spaceship with the force of-- I don't know.
6:37
I'm making up numbers now, but let's say
6:40
it's 1 million Newtons.
6:43
It actually turns out that the spaceship will be pulling on
6:46
the Earth with the same force of 1 million Newtons.
6:51
And they're both going to be moved to the combined system's
6:55
center of mass.
6:56
And the combined system's center of mass since the Earth
7:00
is so much more massive is going to be very close to
7:02
Earth's center of mass.
7:03
It's probably going to be very close to
7:05
Earth's center of mass.
7:06
It's going to be like right there, right?
7:07
So in this situation, Earth won't be doing a lot of
7:12
moving, but it will be pulled in the direction of the
7:15
spaceship, and the spaceship will try to go to Earth's
7:18
center of mass, but at some point, probably the
7:20
atmosphere, or the rock that it runs into, it won't be able
7:24
to go much further and it might crash
7:27
right around there.
7:28
Anyway, I wanted just to give you the sense that it's not
7:31
necessarily one object just pulling on the other.
7:33
They're pulling towards each other to their
7:35
combined center of masses.
7:36
It would make a lot more sense if they had just two people
7:40
floating in space, they actually would have some
7:42
gravity towards each other.
7:43
It's almost a little romantic.
7:47
They would float to each other.
7:48
And actually, you could figure it out.
7:52
I don't have the time to do it, but you could use this
7:55
formula and use the constant, and you could figure out,
7:58
well, what is the gravitational attraction
8:00
between two people?
8:01
And what you'll see is that between two people floating in
8:04
space, there are other forms of attraction that are
8:06
probably stronger than their
8:09
gravitational attraction, anyway.
8:11
I'll let you ponder that and I will see

0:00
As we've already talked about, as we exit the 1800s
0:03
and we get into the early 1900s and we approach World War I,
0:07
the various powers of Europe were really
0:09
on this race for empire.
0:10
It was a part of national prestige.
0:12
And it helped build national wealth.
0:15
But of the major powers, Germany and Italy
0:18
were relatively new as unified states.
0:20
The British Empire-- they had been building their empire
0:23
for hundreds of years.
0:24
The Germans, on the other hand, even
0:26
though they have a very old culture going back hundreds--
0:28
or you could argue thousands-- of years, as a unified state,
0:32
they only existed since 1871.
0:35
And that's only after the Franco-Prussian War,
0:37
which allowed the Prussians to unify all of Germany.
0:40
And the Italians only became fully unified in 1870, also due
0:45
to the Franco-Prussian War.
0:46
Because the French had to focus on the Germans,
0:49
had to focus on the Prussians, they
0:50
couldn't protect the Papal States anymore.
0:52
And so that allowed the Italians to unify it under their a rule.
0:56
So by the time we get to 1914, the beginning of World War
1:00
I, these two powers, they were also on their race for empire.
1:03
But they were only about 43 or 44 years old.
1:06
And so they hadn't been able to build
1:08
as extensive of an empire as France
1:10
and, especially, as extensive of an empire as Great Britain.
1:14
But this map right over here shows how far
1:19
their actual empires did extend.
1:22
Italy had control of Libya, Eritrea,
1:26
and parts of what's today Somalia.
1:30
And Germany had control-- it also
1:32
had holdings in Africa, possessions in Africa.
1:36
Togoland, which is modern-day Togo;
1:38
Cameroon, which makes up-- modern-day Cameroon
1:42
is part of German Southwest Africa.
1:45
That's now known as Namibia.
1:46
German East Africa, which is now Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi.
1:51
And Germany also had holdings in the Pacific and even in China.
1:55
These are the Pacific Islands that Germany had possession of.
1:59
It had German New Guinea.
2:00
And it even had control of the town of Tsingtao.
2:05
And that actually is culturally interesting for those
2:08
of you watching this video in 2013.
2:11
Tsingtao is now a very popular Chinese brand of beer.
2:15
One of the more-- I think it's the number
2:17
two in the market Chinese beer.
2:20
And it's associated with China.
2:22
But it was actually started by German settlers in Tsingtao
2:26
in 1903.
2:28
So actually its roots are with the Germans,
2:30
who obviously have a long tradition of producing beers.
2:34
And so Tsingtao-- you could argue it's a Chinese beer.
2:36
It's produced in China.

OK, so you probably already knew that.

Are there invisible fairies that hold the plane aloft?
0:32
All right, men.
0:33
We've got a busy morning and lots of flights to carry.
0:36
Or is it science?
0:39
Well, you can guess that the answer is indeed science.
0:43
That's ridiculous.
0:45
What?
0:47
So to discuss how an airplane flies,
0:50
we first have to talk about the forces
0:52
on an airplane which push it around
0:54
in all sorts of different directions.
0:56
Now we're going to focus on airplanes today
0:59
because they're awesome, but most of these forces
1:03
apply to any other vehicle.
1:05
The first force acts on all these vehicles-- really,
1:09
it acts on everything.
1:11
It's the weight force, which points down
1:14
towards the center of Earth.
1:17
Weights is equal to the mass of the airplane-- m
1:21
right here-- times the acceleration due to gravity.
1:25
Here on Earth, g is equal to 9.81 meters per second squared.
1:31
Now that's only for Earth.
1:33
The acceleration due to gravity really
1:36
depends on the mass of the planet that your are on.
1:39
The larger the planet, the higher the gravity.
1:41
So 9.81 meters per second squared here on Earth.
1:45
The moon, however-- it's smaller than Earth.
1:48
So the acceleration due to gravity is only 1/6
1:51
that on Earth-- 1.6 meters per second squared.
1:56
This is why astronauts can bounce high on the moon,
1:59
but not on Earth.
2:02
This isn't nearly as much fun.
2:04
Obviously, there has to be another force
2:06
opposing the weight and pushing the airplane up.
2:09
This force is called lift.
2:13
Lift operates perpendicular to the airplane's wings, which are
2:18
right here in this side view.
2:20
Now, if these are our only two forces,
2:22
our aircraft will be able to go up and down,
2:25
but it won't go anywhere.
2:27
So we have to have a force that pushes the airplane forward,
2:31
and this is called thrust.
2:36
All vehicles have thrust, otherwise
2:38
they wouldn't go anywhere like our airplane.
2:41
Why didn't you buy a car with thrust?
2:43
I'm sorry.
2:44
We can at least roll down the hill.
2:47
On an aircraft, this thrust is produced by engines.
2:51
There are two main types of engines.
2:54
We have propellers, like this little guy right here.
2:57
And jet engines, like our first model.
3:01
Whatever the type of engines, they all
3:03
work by the same principle.
3:05
Let's draw a little side view of an engine here.
3:09
The engines accelerate air out the back this direction.
3:14
And by Newton's third law, there's
3:17
an equal and opposite reaction, and that's
3:20
the thrust force pushing the aircraft forward.
3:24
This is really the same thing that happens when you blow up
3:26
a balloon and you let it go.
3:28
The air come out the back and the balloon moves forward.
3:32
We have a force that opposes the thrust.
3:36
It's called drag.
3:37
It points opposite the direction of flight.
3:41
The major type of drag is pressure drag,
3:43
which is the force caused by the air smacking into the airplane.
3:48
So we try to minimize this type of drag
3:50
by making the airplane as aerodynamic as possible.
3:54
That means that it has smooth lines
3:57
in the air flows nice and cleanly over the front here.
4:00
You can feel the pressure drag when you stick your hand
4:02
out the window of a moving car.
4:04
Uh, honey, honey.
4:06
Your hand-- your hand, please.
4:08
When your hand this horizontal, it's aerodynamic
4:11
and you really don't feel a lot of drag.
4:13
But if you slowly turn your hand vertical,
4:15
you really feel the drag increasing.
4:19
So these are our four forces on the airplane,
4:22
but perhaps you're thinking--
4:24
So this really cool and everything,
4:26
but how do we increase and decrease the airplanes lift
4:29
to move up and down?
4:30
That's a great question.
4:32
Let's look at the equation for the magnitude
4:34
of lift per unit wing area.
4:36
We'll call that L. L equals 1/2 times rho times
4:42
cl times v squared.
4:46
That simple.
4:48
OK, OK, I'll tell you what each of these things mean.
4:51
So rho-- it's not a P. It's the Greek letter, rho.
4:55
Rho is the density of the air, which
4:57
is a measure of the number of air
4:59
molecules in a certain volume.
5:01
Density of the air varies with altitude and temperature,
5:06
so you go higher up.
5:08
There, the air is thinner, and so the density is lower.
5:12
If we want to simplify things, we generally
5:13
use the standard density, which is 1.2754 kilograms per meters
5:21
cubed.
5:23
v here is the speed of the aircraft,
5:26
or how fast it's traveling.
5:28
And cl is something called the coefficient of lift.
5:32
It's a number that gives us some information
5:35
about the shape of the aircraft's wings-- these things
5:38
right here.
5:39
The coefficient of lift changes with the angle of attack.
5:44
Angle of what?
5:45
Aircraft can pitch up and down, and even if they're pitched up,
5:50
they're still traveling in a horizontal direction like that.
5:55
Now the angle formed here by the horizontal direction of travel
6:00
and the direction of the aircraft's nose
6:03
is called the angle of attack, and we
6:06
denote that with the Greek letter alpha.
6:10
So we can make a little plot here of that.
6:12
We're going to put coefficient of lift up on the y-axis,
6:16
and the angle of attack down on the x-axis.
6:20
So as the airplane starts to pitch up--
6:23
if I can get a little hand here-- thank you.
6:27
As the aircraft starts to pitch up, the coefficient of lift
6:30
increases.
6:31
This is a good thing because we have more lift.
6:35
As we continue to increase, we eventually
6:37
reach a point where we keep pitching up
6:40
but the lift starts decreasing.
6:43
This is something called stall, and it's not a good thing.
6:49
So we generally avoid try to pitching up this much.
6:53
There's a similar equation for the drag per unit wing area,
6:56
D. D equals 1/2 rho.
7:01
Not cl-- that wouldn't make any sense.
7:03
cd, as you can guess, is the coefficient of drag times
7:08
the velocity squared.
7:10
The coefficient of drag is-- it's
7:12
another number that tells us something about the wings,
7:15
and it also varies with the angle of attack.
7:18
So as the angle of attack increases--
7:21
oh, thank you-- the coefficient of drag increases as well.
7:26
Thank you very much.
7:28
This is because as the aircraft is pitching up,
7:33
there is more wing area perpendicular to the flow.
7:38
Now, this reminds me of something
7:41
that we talked about earlier.
7:44
Exactly.
7:45
This is very similar to whenever you hold your hand
7:49
out the window of a car.
7:51
And so, that's pretty much everything
7:55
you need know about how an aircraft flies.
7:59
So the next time you're on an airplane or you just see one,
8:03
you can really know exactly what it is that's keeping it up
8:05
in the air.
8:07
Nope.
8:08
No, it's not them either.

Voiceover: Bitcoin is a new virtual currency system
0:03
that's been gathering a lot of attention recently,
0:05
and I thought I would do a series of videos
0:07
where I really dive into the innards of bitcoin
0:10
and explain how it works in detail,
0:12
and my plan for this first video in this series
0:15
is to describe some of those mechanics
0:18
at a high level.
0:19
And then what I'll do in subsequent videos
0:21
is dive a bit deeper into all of the underlying aspects
0:24
that I have touched upon within this first video.
0:27
And my hope is that by the end of this video series,
0:29
you'll know not only what a bitcoin is,
0:31
but you'll also understand the mechanics
0:33
of how transactions are initiated.
0:35
You'll see how verification occurs
0:38
for those transactions,
0:38
and you'll also learn what it means for someone
0:41
to really engage in a process
0:43
known as ""bitcoin mining"",
0:44
and that may be a term that you've heard
0:46
if you've had any interest in bitcoin recently.
0:49
I do want to point out, also,
0:50
that the bitcoin scheme is fairly involved.
0:53
It requires some time to really cover
0:56
all of the relevant details,
0:58
and to me the best way to really wrap your head
1:00
around a scheme like bitcoin
1:02
is to really suspend belief for a bit
1:04
and get exposed to all of these relevant details.
1:08
Now, undoubtedly, you'll have a lot of questions
1:10
along the way,
1:11
but my hope is that by the end of this video series,
1:13
all of the relevant stones will have been overturned
1:16
and your questions will have been
1:17
appropriately answered,
1:18
but it might take some time to get there,
1:21
and in part, that's because I'll try to describe things
1:23
in a way that's sensible
1:25
and that might involve leaving some details out
1:28
until I can explain enough pieces of the scheme
1:31
and then add in those details in as I go along
1:33
so that you're not inundated
1:34
with too many minor points and nuances
1:38
along the way,
1:39
but you get a feel for the overall system
1:41
as I go through things.
1:42
With that, let me go ahead and just dive right in.
1:44
First of all, I do want to point out
1:46
that bitcoin has been described, really,
1:48
as a decentralized currency
1:51
because there's no real central bank or entity
1:54
that's involved in generating or transacting bitcoins,
1:57
and, in fact, what happens in the content of a bitcoin
2:00
is all the transactions really require
2:02
what's known as a peer-to-peer network,
2:04
a network of just individual hosts that essentially
2:08
collectively agree on different aspects
2:09
of how the protocol is implemented and used.
2:15
Bitcoin itself is also referred to sometimes
2:17
as a cryptocurrency,
2:19
and by a cryptocurrency,
2:19
I mean that we use a lot of cryptographic techniques
2:22
in order to facilitate or to really enable
2:25
bitcoin transactions to take place,
2:27
and I'll do separate videos
2:28
on some of these techniques,
2:29
but just take it at face value right now,
2:31
that it's decentralized
2:33
and is a type of cryptocurrency.
2:35
I also want to point out that the term ""bitcoin"" itself
2:38
can in fact be a bit confusing,
2:40
and in many ways, bitcoin transactions
2:42
don't really resemble traditional coin transactions
2:46
so much as they represent really entries
2:49
in some type of a global ledger,
2:51
and by that, I mean let's say you have
2:54
a transaction taking place,
2:56
and let's say the transaction is taking place
2:58
within, or among two parties,
3:00
and we'll call them Alice and Bob,
3:03
which are traditional names that are used
3:04
in many cryptographic protocols
3:06
to describe the parties involved,
3:08
and imagine that Alice wants to transfer,
3:12
or really wants to assign,
3:13
a certain number of bitcoins that she possesses
3:15
over to Bob,
3:17
and you can think of this transaction, really,
3:19
as an entry in a ledger of some sort,
3:24
and I also want to point out before proceeding
3:26
that even though I've used terms
3:28
like Alice and Bob,
3:29
what I really mean in the context of bitcoin
3:32
is not the actual identities in the physical sense,
3:36
but really that Alice and Bob are identities
3:39
in the bitcoin system,
3:41
and these identities are just,
3:42
in actual implementation,
3:44
are just collections of numbers
3:46
that do not have to be tied
3:49
with Alice and Bob's real-world identities.
3:52
In that capacity, you can think of bitcoin at any,
3:55
it really is effectively being,
3:57
of being pseudonyms,
3:59
rather than real names,
4:00
and the idea is that bitcoin really becomes more
4:02
of a pseudonymous protocol,
4:03
where people are addressed by their pseudonyms,
4:06
and that provides some level of privacy
4:09
to users that want to transact
4:10
using the bitcoin system.
4:13
Now, in a transaction between Alice and Bob,
4:15
what Alice will basically do
4:16
is specify a few different numbers.
4:18
She has to specify how many bitcoins
4:21
she wants to allocate to Bob.
4:22
Let's say Alice started off with 50 bitcoins of her own.
4:25
She might decide that she wants to give,
4:27
let's say, 30 of these bitcoins over to Bob,
4:31
and let's say she wants to have
4:33
some number of bitcoins returned back to her,
4:35
so you have to specify,
4:36
or Alice has to specify, rather,
4:37
how much change she's going to get,
4:39
so in this case, let's say her change is going to be
4:40
18 bitcoins for herself,
4:43
and then the remaining 2 bitcoins are going to be
4:45
a transaction fee,
4:47
and we'll talk about what a transaction fee means
4:50
a little later,
4:51
and I think I'll also dive into it in future videos,
4:54
but it's basically an incentive for other nodes
4:56
in the bitcoin network to help Alice
4:58
in essentially validating some of the details
5:00
of this transaction for Bob.
5:04
Now, Alice will take these transaction details
5:07
and apply what's known as a digital signature
5:12
to these transaction details,
5:13
and a digital signature is basically
5:14
the mathematical analog of a traditional signature.
5:18
It really binds Alice's identity to the details
5:21
of this transaction.
5:23
And by Alice's identity, again,
5:24
I mean her identity within the bitcoin system,
5:27
and this binding is really done
5:28
in a cryptographically strong way.
5:31
Now, the details of this transaction
5:33
once it takes place,
5:34
are going to be broadcast out,
5:36
so Alice is going to take these transaction details
5:38
and effectively just broadcast them out
5:40
to all the nodes in the peer-to-peer network
5:45
that represent bitcoin nodes.
5:47
Now, Bob, when he receives information
5:50
about this transaction,
5:51
he receives it over the peer-to-peer network.
5:53
He'll probably sandy check
5:55
some part of the transaction.
5:56
For example, he might check that the numbers
5:58
work out correctly,
5:59
that Alice, let's say, started off with 50 bitcoins
6:02
and is not trying to transfer
6:03
more than 50 bitcoins to him, and so on and so forth.
6:06
He's going to have some mathematical assurance
6:08
because of some of the cryptography involved
6:11
that some of these claims are accurate,
6:13
that Alice, let's say, has the bitcoins
6:15
that she's claimed to possess,
6:17
and that she's expressed an interest
6:19
to assign those bitcoins to him,
6:21
but what he won't know yet is whether
6:23
Alice has really tried to transfer those same bitcoins
6:26
to anyone else over the course of time
6:28
or maybe just prior to that point.
6:31
the way that we handle that situation,
6:33
and by the way, I should point out
6:34
that this concept of Alice trying to, let's say,
6:37
spend coins twice,
6:39
in the context of digital cash
6:41
and electronic currency systems,
6:42
this concept is known as double spending,
6:45
and it's something you have to worry about
6:47
when you have virtual currencies
6:49
because it's very easy for someone to just copy
6:51
the numbers that represent this transaction
6:53
and try to use them elsewhere.
6:57
The way we basically handle
6:58
and reduce the risk of double spending
7:00
is through a specific set of nodes
7:03
in this peer-to-peer network
7:05
who are known as bitcoin miners.
7:08
You might have heard this term bitcoin miners,
7:10
and the bitcoin miners are basically
7:12
specific individuals,
7:14
specific nodes within this peer-to-peer network,
7:17
and what they basically do is they take
7:19
all of the transactions that they see,
7:21
and remember,
7:21
they're listening to all of these transactions,
7:23
and not just Alice and Bob's,
7:24
but other transactions that are taking place,
7:26
and they'll take those transactions,
7:27
and ultimately, they will take those transactions
7:29
and will compile them
7:31
into what's known as a transaction block.
7:34
So it's basically a recording
7:35
of all the previously unrecorded transactions.
7:40
If you think of a single transaction
7:42
let's say, as a ledger item,
7:44
you could think of a transaction block
7:45
as representing, let's say, an entire page
7:47
in a ledger book.
7:50
These bitcoin miners will also include in this block,
7:54
in addition to all these unrecorded transactions,
7:55
they will also include in this block
7:57
a special transaction that's meant just for themselves
8:01
to basically reward themselves for the effort
8:04
of doing this mining.
8:06
Now, a transaction block will also contain
8:09
an encoding of the previous transaction block,
8:11
so there's going to be some level of continuity,
8:14
and then bitcoin miners will also include
8:16
a specially-crafted sequence of numbers
8:19
associated with these transactions,
8:21
and this sequence of numbers is known
8:23
as a proof of work,
8:26
and it's called a proof of work
8:27
because it's sometihng that's really hard to generate,
8:30
something that requires a lot of effort to do,
8:31
and that kind of makes it hard for just anybody
8:34
to get involved with bitcoin mining willy-nilly,
8:36
but it requires that they really exhibit or exert
8:39
some computational effort,
8:42
basically in exchange for getting this extra reward
8:45
of a payment,
8:45
and also in exchange for getting
8:47
this transaction fee that they're going to be promised
8:50
by Alice to engage in this sort of work.
8:54
I'll talk about what proof-of-work protocols are
8:55
in a separate video in more detail.
8:57
Now, because each transaction block
8:59
contains information about previous transactions,
9:03
really what you end up having
9:04
is not just a single block.
9:06
You ultimately have what you can think of as a chain
9:09
of transactions,
9:11
and you can call this a transaction block chain.
9:15
The idea is as soon as a bitcoin miner
9:17
is able to construct a transaction block chain
9:19
containing all these unrecorded transactions,
9:21
and this proof of work,
9:22
it'll broadcast the details of that chain out
9:26
to all of the nodes, all of the peers
9:29
on that peer-to-peer network for bitcoin.
9:33
And then once the newly-broadcast chain
9:36
gets kind of verified and meets the right properties,
9:39
the nodes on the network
9:40
are just going to go ahead and start using it,
9:42
and they're going to start appending
9:43
new transaction blocks to that chain.
9:46
They're going to take anything
9:47
that hasn't yet been processed
9:48
and start incorporating it into the transaction chain
9:51
that was broadcast out by the node
9:54
who came up with the proof of work correctly.
9:57
Now, this transaction block chain,
9:58
really what we're going to be doing
10:01
in the context of bitcoin
10:02
is the nodes are only going to consider
10:05
the transaction block chain that reflects
10:08
the greatest amount of work to generate its contents,
10:10
and again, there's this proof of work that I mentioned
10:12
that is used to kind of determine
10:14
or identify what the, what work was involved
10:17
in coming up with the transaction block chain.
10:20
The one that's the longest is going to be considered
10:22
sacrosanct within the bitcoin system.
10:24
Future miners are supposed to only work
10:26
off the chain that has the most work put into it.
10:30
Now, what's remarkable here
10:32
is that the whole process is decentralized.
10:34
There is no bank or no centrally-trusted entity
10:38
that was actually involved in the transaction.
10:40
Hopefully this first video gave you
10:42
a bit of description, a flavor, if you will,
10:44
for the high-level mechanics of the bitcoin system.
10:47
There are a lot of stones I have left unturned,
10:50
and what I'll do in subsequent videos
10:52
is start covering those details,
10:54

0:00
Welcome back.
0:01
We just finished this problem with the pulleys and the
0:03
inclined plane.
0:04
And I just wanted to do one final thing on this problem
0:06
just because I think it's interesting.
0:08
And then we can move onto what seems like
0:11
a pretty fun problem.
0:12
So the last thing I want to figure out is, we figured out
0:14
that this 20 kilo-- actually, the whole system will
0:17
accelerate up and to the right at 4.13
0:20
meters per second squared.
0:22
And then the second part of this question is, what is the
0:24
tension in this rope or this wire?
0:28
And at first you might say, this is complicated.
0:30
You know, this thing isn't static anymore.
0:32
The thing is actually accelerating.
0:34
How do I do it?
0:35
Well this is how you think about it.
0:36
Just pick one part of the system.
0:39
Let's say that all we could see was this 20 kilogram mass.
0:43
So let's say all we could see was this 20 kilogram mass.
0:48
And we know it's suspended from a wire.
0:50
And we also know that this 20 kilogram mass is not
0:54
accelerating as fast as it would if
0:56
the wire wasn't there.
0:57
It's accelerating only at 4.13 meters per second.
1:01
If the wire wasn't there, it'd be accelerating at 9.8 meters
1:04
per second, the acceleration of gravity.
1:06
So the wire must be exerting some upward
1:09
force on the object.
1:10
And that is the force of tension.
1:13
That is what's slowing-- that's what's moderating its
1:17
acceleration from being 9.8 meters per second squared to
1:21
being 4.13 meters per second squared.
1:24
So essentially, what is the net force on this object?
1:27
On just this object?
1:29
Well the net force is-- and you can ignore what I said
1:32
before about the net force in all the other places.
1:36
But we know that the object is accelerating downwards.
1:42
Well, we know it's 20 kilograms. So that's its mass.
1:44
And we know that it's accelerating downwards at 4.13
1:46
meters per second squared.
1:51
So the net force, 20 times-- see, times 20 is 82-- let's
2:00
just say 83 Newtons.
2:03
83 Newtons down.
2:05
We know that the net force is 83 Newtons down.
2:08
We also know that the tension force plus the force of
2:16
gravity-- and what's the force of gravity?
2:18
The force of gravity is just the weight of the object.
2:20
So the force of tension, which goes up, plus the weight of --
2:24
the force of gravity is equal to the net force.
2:29
And the way I set this up, tension's going to be a
2:31
negative number.
2:33
Just because I'm saying positive numbers are
2:36
downwards, so a negative number would be upwards.
2:39
So tension will be what is 83 minus 196?
2:46
Minus 196 is equal to minus 113 Newtons.
2:54
And the only reason why I got a negative number is because I
2:57
used positive numbers for downwards.
2:59
So minus 113 Newtons downwards, which is the same
3:02
thing as 113 Newtons upwards.
3:06
And so that is the tension in the rope.
3:09
And you could have done the same thing on this side of the
3:11
problem, although it would have been-- well, yeah.
3:14
You could have done the exact same thing on
3:15
this side of the problem.
3:16
You would've said, well what would it have accelerated
3:17
naturally if there wasn't some force of tension on this rope
3:20
going backwards?
3:22
And then you're saying, oh, well, we know it would have
3:24
gone in this direction at some acceleration, but instead it's
3:26
going in the other direction.
3:27
So you use that.
3:29
You figure out the net force, and then you say the tension
3:31
plus all of these forces have to equal the net force.
3:33
And then you should solve for the tension.
3:36
And it would be the same tension.
3:38
Now we will do a fun and somewhat simple, but maybe
3:44
instructive problem.
3:46
So I have a pie.
3:49
This is the pie.
3:54
This is parallel.
3:55
And I have my hand.
3:58
You can tell that my destiny was really to be a great
4:02
artist. This is my hand.
4:04
And I'm holding a pie, and I'm looking to smash this pie into
4:10
this individual's face.
4:19
I actually was a, I was the newspaper cartoonist in high
4:24
school, so I have some minor-- but anyway.
4:28
Let's make it a bald man.
4:30
Well anyway, I shouldn't be focusing on the drawing.
4:36
He has a moustache.
4:41
Anyway, I'm looking to throw this pie into this guy's face.
4:45
And the problem is, I need to figure out how fast do I need
4:49
to accelerate this pie for it to not fall down?
4:52
Right?
4:52
Because what's happening?
4:53
Well there's the force of gravity on this pie.
4:56
There's a force of gravity on this pie and if I don't
4:58
accelerate it fast enough, it's just going to slide down.
5:01
And I'll never be able to, It'll never
5:03
reach the guy's face.
5:04
So I don't want this pie to slide down at all.
5:06
How fast do I have to push on it?
5:09
Well, we know that the coefficient of friction-- you
5:11
don't know this, but I know that the coefficient of
5:13
friction between my hand and the pie, the coefficient of
5:17
friction is equal to 0.8.
5:23
So given that, how fast do I have to accelerate it?
5:26
Well let's see what's happening.
5:28
So we have the force of gravity pulling down.
5:30
So let's say that the mass of the pie is m.
5:35
m equals mass.
5:38
So what is the force of gravity
5:40
pulling down on the pie?
5:41
Well the force of gravity is just equal to m times 9.8.
5:47
Right?
5:48
The force of gravity is equal to m times 9.8.
5:51
In order for this pie to not move down, what do we know
5:55
about the net forces on that pie?
5:57
Well we know the net forces on that pie have to be 0.
6:02
So what would be the offsetting force?
6:04
Well, it would be the force of friction.
6:05
So we would have a force of friction acting upwards.
6:08
Right?
6:08
Because the force of friction always acts opposite to the
6:11
direction that the thing would move otherwise.
6:14
So essentially, our force of friction has to be greater
6:20
than, roughly, greater than or equal to.
6:23
Because if it's greater than, it's not like the pie is going
6:24
to move up.
6:25
Friction by itself will never move something, it'll just
6:28
keep something from being moved.
6:29
But let's just figure out the minimum.
6:31
I won't do the whole inequalities.
6:33
The force of friction has to be equal similarly, to 9.8
6:37
times the mass of the pie.
6:42
So if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, what is the
6:46
force that I have to apply?
6:50
Well, the force I have to apply in this case is going to
6:52
be the normal force, right?
6:53
That's normal to the bottom of the pie.
6:58
Right?
7:00
My hand is now like the surface of the ramp.
7:03
So this is the normal force.
7:05
And we know that the force of friction is equal to the
7:09
coefficient of friction times the normal force.
7:11
I'm going to switch colors because this is getting
7:12
monotonous.
7:15
And the force of friction, we know has to be
7:17
9.8 times the mass.
7:20
So 9.8 meters per second times the mass.
7:23
9.8m is the force of friction.
7:25
And that has to equal to coefficient of friction times
7:27
the normal force.
7:28
And remember, the normal force is essentially the force that
7:31
I'm pushing the pie with.
7:33
And we know this is 0.8, so we have 9.8 times the mass--
7:38
that's not meters, that's the mass-- is equal to 0.8 times
7:43
the normal force.
7:45
So you have the normal force is equal to 9.8 times the mass
7:51
divided by 0.8.
7:54
What's 9.8 divided by 0.8?
7:56
9.8 divided by 0.8 is equal to 12.25.
8:05
So the normal force that I have to apply is
8:08
12.25 times the mass.
8:12
So that's the force I'm applying.
8:14
It's time the mass.
8:15
We don't know the mass of the pie.
8:17
So how fast am I accelerating the pie?
8:19
Well, force is equal to mass times acceleration.
8:22
This is the force, 12.25m-- that's the force-- is equal to
8:29
the mass times the
8:31
acceleration of the pie, right?
8:32
And it's the same pie that we're dealing with the whole
8:34
time, so it's still m.
8:35
And you can take out m from both sides of the equation.
8:39
So the acceleration, the rate at which I have to change the
8:42
velocity, or the acceleration that I have to apply to the
8:45
pie is 12.25 meters per second squared.
8:53
And so actually, I have to apply more than 1g, right?
8:58
Because g is the force of gravity.
9:01
And gravity accelerates something at 9.8 seconds-- 9.8
9:05
meters per second squared.
9:06
So I have to do something at 12-- I have to push and
9:09
accelerate the pie at 12.25 meters per second squared.
9:13
So it's something a little over 1g in order for that pie
9:16
to not fall and in order for my normal force to provide a
9:19
force of friction so that the pie can reach
9:22
this bald man's face.

teded_How ancient art influenced modern art - Felipe Galindo - 04:51_0,How many years ago do you think the modern art movement originated?,multiple-choices,"The term modern art sounds like it
means art that is popular at the moment,
but in fact, modern art is a style
that originated over 150 years ago,
and includes artists that by now
have attained classic status,
such as Picasso, Matisse, and Gauguin.
And what's even more ironic is that
the movement they pioneered,
considered revolutionary
and even scandalous at the time,
was inspired largely by an object
of a traditional and ancient design.
As far back as the Renaissance,
the primary European art movements
emphasized conventional representation
and adherence to classical forms.
But that began to change 
in the late 19th century
as artists like Van Gogh and Cézanne
expanded the boundaries of painting.
Soon, a movement arose that sought
to create an entirely new style of art,
and one way of doing so was to look
beyond Western civilization.
For example, Paul Gauguin moved
to the island of Tahiti in the 1890s.
There, he found inspiration in the island's
inhabitants, landscape, and culture
to create artwork that intertwined
European themes and Polynesian lore.
Others looked the cultures 
of the Islamic world,
but the most influential inspiration
would come from Sub-Saharan Africa.
As European empires expanded
deeper into the African continent,
its artifacts and artworks made their way
into the hands of museums and collectors.
One such collector was Henri Matisse,
who showed his friend Picasso 
a mask he had acquired
made by the Dan tribe of the Ivory Coast.
The mask awoke Picasso's curiosity,
leading him to visit the Trocadéro 
Ethnographic Museum in Paris in 1907.
Founded to house acquisitions 
from colonial conquests,
the museum boasted 
a collection of African art,
with stylized figures 
and masks made of wood
and decorated with simple colors 
and materials.
The visit was a revelation for Picasso,
who proclaimed that African masks
were what painting was all about.
At this time, Picasso had been working
on a painting of five nude women
in a style that would later come
to be known as Cubism.
And while three of these ladies
show facial features
found in ancient Iberian art,
a nod to Picasso's Spanish heritage,
the faces of the two on the right
closely resemble African masks.
Created in 1907 after hundreds
of sketches and studies,
""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon""
has been considered 
the first truly 20th century masterpiece,
breaking with many previously 
held notions in art.
It was at once aggressive and abstract,
distorted yet primal in its raw geometry,
a new artistic language with new forms,
colors, and meanings.
And these avant-garde qualities
caused a sensation
when the painting was first exhibited
almost ten years later.
The public was shocked,
critics denounced it as immoral,
and even Picasso's own friends
were simultaneously surprised,
offended,
and mesmerized at his audacity.
More artists soon followed 
in Picasso's footsteps.
Constantin Brâncuși 
and Amedeo Modigliani in Paris,
as well as the German Expressionists,
all drew on the aesthetics 
of African sculptures in their work.
Others looked to a different continent
for their inspiration.
British sculptor Henry Moore based many
of his semi-abstract bronze sculptures
on a replica of a chacmool,
a distinctive reclining statue
from the Toltec-Maya culture.
Pre-Columbian art was also a major
influence for Josef Albers.
He created a series of compositions,
such as the geometrical series
Homage to the Square,
that were inspired by pyramids
and local art
he encountered
on his frequent visits to Mexico.
Inspiration from ancient cultures
initiated one of the most revolutionary 
movements in art history,
but were these artists playing the role
of explorers or conquistadors,
appropriating ideas and profiting
from cultures they considered primitive?
Questions like this deserve scrutiny,
as artists continue to redefine standards.
Perhaps not too long from now,
the bold innovations of modern art
will seem like stale orthodoxies,
ready to be overturned by a new set
of radical trailblazers
drawing inspiration from another
unlikely source.",TED-Ed,Social Studies,How ancient art influenced modern art - Felipe Galindo - 04:51,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9RrO0dtu5M,data/teded/crawled_data/videos/How ancient art influenced modern art - Felipe Galindo - 04:51,,
khan_video_Z_ddImEdmCQ_22,Won't the electric field of the negative charge be pointing outwards?,MCQ,"•
0:00
- [Instructor] Okay, so we know that electrical charges
0:02
create electric fields in the region around them
0:05
but people get confused by electric field problems
0:07
so you got to get good at at least two things here
0:09
if you wanna proficient at dealing with electrical field.
0:13
You should get good at determining the direction
0:16
of the electric field that's created by a charge.
0:19
If you've got some charge
0:20
and you wanna know which way does that charge
0:22
create an electric field,
0:23
you should get really good at that.
0:25
And if you know the direction of the field,
0:27
you should get good at finding the direction
0:29
of the electric force exerted on a charge.
0:32
If there's some charge floating around
0:34
in an electric field,
0:35
you should be able to say,
0:36
oh, okay, I can determine the electric force.
0:38
Not too bad.
0:39
If you get good at these two things,
0:40
these problems are gonna be way easier
0:42
and the whole process is gonna make a lot more sense.
0:45
Let's figure out how to do this.
0:46
How do you do these things?
0:47
We'll do the first one first.
0:48
Let's try to tackle this one.
0:49
Let's try to figure out how do you determine
0:51
the direction of the electric field
0:52
that's created by a charge.
0:54
Let's say we didn't know, this is what the electric field
0:56
look like around a positive charge.
0:59
I just gave this to you
0:59
but how do we know that this is what the electric field's
1:02
supposed to look like?
1:03
What we can do is this.
1:04
We can say that we know the definition of electric field
1:07
is that it's the amount of electrical force
1:10
exerted per charge.
1:12
In other words, if you took some test charge,
1:14
think of this Q as the test charge
1:16
and we usually just make this a positive test charge
1:19
so this is easier to think about.
1:20
If you took some positive test charge into some region
1:23
let's do that, let's put some positive test charge in here.
1:26
We take this test charge, we move it around.
1:27
All we have to do to figure out
1:29
the direction of the electric field,
1:31
since this Q would be positive,
1:32
we can just figure out what direction
1:34
is the electric force on that positive test charge.
1:37
In other words, the direction of the electric field E
1:40
is gonna be the same direction as the electric force
1:43
on a positive test charge.
1:45
Because if you know about vector equations,
1:47
look at this electric fields vector,
1:49
this electric forces vector.
1:50
This electric field is just gonna adopt
1:52
the same direction as the electric force
1:55
as long as this Q is positive.
1:56
If this Q were negative it would flip the sign
1:59
of this electric force
2:00
and then the E would point the opposite direction.
2:02
But if we keep our test charge positive
2:04
then we know, okay, the electric field's
2:06
just gonna point the same direction
2:08
as the electrical force on that positive test charge.
2:11
Here's what I mean.
2:12
We take our positive test charge.
2:14
We move it around.
2:14
If I wanna know the electric field at this spot right here,
2:17
I just ask myself,
2:19
which way does the electrical force
2:20
point on that test charge?
2:22
The electric force would point to the right
2:24
since it's being repelled
2:26
by this other positive charge over here.
2:28
I know that the electric force points to the right,
2:30
these charges repel each other.
2:32
And since the electric force points to the right,
2:33
that means the electric field in this region
2:35
also points to the right.
2:37
It might not have the same magnitude.
2:39
The electric force might be 20 newtons
2:41
and the electric field might be 10 newtons per coulomb
2:44
but they have the same direction.
2:45
And I can move this charge somewhere else,
2:47
let's say I move it over here.
2:48
Which way would the electric force point?
2:50
Well, these positive charges are still repelling.
2:52
I'd still have an electric force to the right.
2:54
That electric force would be smaller
2:56
but it would still point to the right
2:57
and that means the electric field
2:59
also still points to the right,
3:00
it would be smaller as well
3:02
but it would still point to the right.
3:03
And if we wanna determine the electric field elsewhere,
3:05
we can move our positive test charge,
3:06
I'll move it over to here.
3:08
I'll ask which way is the electric force
3:10
on this positive test charge?
3:11
That would be in this direction
3:13
since these positive charges are repelling each other,
3:16
they're pushing each other away
3:17
so this positive always gets pushed away
3:19
from this other positive charge.
3:21
And so, that also means that the electric field
3:23
is pointing in that direction as well.
3:25
We keep doing this.
3:26
I can move this somewhere else.
3:27
I can move this positive charge down here.
3:29
The charges repel so the electric force
3:30
would point downward.
3:31
And that means the electric field would also point down.
3:34
If you keep doing this,
3:35
if you keep mapping what's the direction
3:37
of the electric force on a positive test charge?
3:39
Eventually, you realize oh, it's always just gonna point
3:42
radially out away from this other positive charge.
3:46
And so we know the electric field
3:47
from a positive charge is just gonna point
3:49
radially outward, that's why we drew it like this.
3:52
Because this positive charge would push
3:54
some positive test charge radially away from it
3:57
since it would be repelling it.
3:59
Positive charges create electric fields
4:01
that point radially away from them.
4:03
Now what if the charge creating the field
4:05
were a negative charge?
4:07
So, let's try to figure that one out,
4:08
let me get rid of this.
4:09
Let's say the charge creating the electric field
4:11
were negative, a big negative charge,
4:13
how do we determine the electric field
4:14
direction around this negative charge?
4:16
We're gonna do the same thing,
4:17
we're gonna take our positive test charge
4:19
and we're gonna keep our test charge positive,
4:21
that way we know that the direction
4:24
of the electric force on this positive test charge
4:27
is gonna be the same direction
4:28
as the electric field in that region.
4:30
In other words, the positivity of this test charge
4:33
will just make it so that the electric field
4:34
and electric force point in the same direction.
4:37
And if we do that, I'll move this around.
4:38
We'll just put it at this point here,
4:39
we'll move this test charge here.
4:41
Which way is the force on that test charge?
4:43
This time it's getting attracted to this negative charge.
4:46
Opposite charges attract
4:47
so the electric force would point this way
4:49
and since it's a positive test charge
4:51
and it preserve the direction in this equation,
4:53
that means the electric field
4:55
also points in that leftward direction.
4:57
And we can keep mapping the field
4:58
we'll move the test charge over to here.
5:00
The electric force this time is gonna point up
5:02
because this positive test charges
5:03
is attracted to this negative charge.
5:05
And if the electric force points up,
5:07
that means the electric field also points up in that region.
5:10
And you'd realize the electric force
5:12
is always gonna pull a positive test charge
5:15
toward this negative creating the field around it.
5:17
And because of that, the electric field
5:19
created by a negative charge points radially inward
5:24
toward that negative charge.
5:25
This is different.
5:26
Positive charge created a field that pointed
5:28
radially away from
5:30
because it always repelled the positive test charge.
5:33
But a negative charge creates an electric field
5:34
that points radially into
5:37
because it's always attracting a positive test charge.
5:40
Basically what I'm saying is
5:41
that if we got rid of all these,
5:42
clean this up,
5:43
the electric field from a positive charge
5:44
points radially outward
5:46
but if it were a negative charge,
5:48
you'd have to erase all these arrowheads
5:49
and put them on the other end.
5:51
Because the electric field from a negative charge
5:53
points radially inward toward that negative charge.
5:56
In other words, the electric field created by
5:59
a negative charge at some point in space around it
6:02
is gonna point toward that negative charge
6:04
creating that electric field.
6:06
And so, that's how you could determine
6:07
the direction of the electric field created by a charge.
6:09
If it's a positive charge you know
6:11
the electric field points radially out from that positive.
6:14
And if it's a negative charge,
6:16
you know the field points radially inward
6:18
toward that negative charge.
6:20
Okay, so that was number one here.
6:21
We found the direction
6:23
of the electric field created by a charge.
6:25
Check, we've done this.
6:26
Now we should get good at finding
6:28
the direction of the electric force
6:29
exerted on a charge in a field.
6:32
What does that mean?
6:33
Let's say you had a region of space
6:34
with electric field pointing to the right.
6:36
What's creating this electric field?
6:38
I don't know.
6:39
It doesn't even really matter.
6:40
This is why the electric field is a cool idea.
6:42
I don't really need to know
6:43
what created this electric field.
6:45
I mean, it could be positive charges over here
6:47
creating fields that point radially away from them.
6:51
But it could also be negative charges over here
6:53
creating fields that point radially toward them
6:56
or both, we don't really know.
6:58
It doesn't really matter.
6:58
As long as I now have an electric field
7:00
that points to the right,
7:01
I can figure out the direction of the electric force
7:03
on a charge in that field.
7:05
Let's put a charge in this field.
7:06
We'll just start with a positive charge.
7:08
We'll put this charge in here.
7:09
Since the electric field is equal to
7:12
the electric force on a charge
7:13
divided by that charge,
7:15
if this is a positive charge
7:17
and this charge we put down here is positive,
7:20
then the electric force points in the same direction
7:22
as the electric field and vice versa.
7:24
The electric field and electric force
7:26
would point the same direction
7:27
if the charge feeling that force is a positive charge.
7:30
This is just a long way of saying
7:32
that the electric force on a positive charge
7:34
is gonna point in the same direction
7:36
as the electric field in that region.
7:39
If there's an electric field that points to the right
7:41
like we have in here
7:42
then the electric force on a positive charge in that region
7:45
is also gonna point to the right.
7:46
And you might be thinking well,
7:47
duh, isn't that kind of obvious?
7:49
Doesn't this equation say
7:50
that the electric force has to be
7:52
the same direction as the electric field.
7:54
Almost, not quite.
7:55
There's one exception.
7:56
If this charge in here were negative,
7:59
if you put a negative charge in here,
8:00
now this force vector gets multiplied by a negative,
8:04
well, divided by a negative but the same thing.
8:06
Dividing by negative ones like multiplying by negative one.
8:09
You would swap the direction of this force vector
8:12
and this electric field would point
8:13
the opposite direction as the force
8:15
on a negative charge in that region,
8:17
and that's confusing.
8:18
In other words, check this out.
8:19
Say we took a negative charge in this region
8:21
and we wanted to know which way
8:22
would the electric force be on this negative charge
8:25
due to this electric field that points to the right.
8:27
Well, if the electric field points to the right
8:29
and this charge is negative,
8:31
then the electric force has to point to the left.
8:33
And the reason is if this force vector is leftward
8:36
and we divide it by a negative sign,
8:38
that's gonna take this force vector
8:40
and turn it from left to right.
8:41
That means the electric field
8:42
would be pointing to the right.
8:44
If the charge experiencing the electric force is negative
8:47
because multiplying a vector by negative one
8:49
changes its direction,
8:51
the electric force and the electric field
8:53
are gonna have opposite directions.
8:54
A negative charge feels a force
8:56
in the opposite direction as the electric field
8:59
but a positive charge feels a force
9:01
in the same direction as the electric field.
9:03
And I'll repeat that because it's important.
9:05
Positive charges experience an electric force
9:08
in the same direction as the electric field.
9:11
And negative charges experience an electric force
9:14
in the opposite direction as the electric field.
9:17
People mess this up all the time.
9:18
This confuses people a lot
9:20
so here's a way that might make it seem a little simpler.
9:23
Notice that neither of these charges
9:24
are creating this electric field
9:26
that's exerting the force on them
9:28
but let's draw some possibilities
9:29
for charges that might be creating this electric field.
9:32
One way to create an electric field to the right
9:34
is by having a bunch of positive charges over here,
9:37
creating electric fields that point radially away from them.
9:41
That would create an electric field to the right.
9:42
And what would be the force on these charges then?
9:45
Well, we know positive charges repel other positive charges
9:48
so the electric forces to the right.
9:50
And positive charges attract negative charges
9:52
so the electric force would point to the left.
9:54
This convention of electric forces pointing
9:56
in the same direction as the electric field
9:59
for a positive charge
10:00
and electric forces pointing in the opposite direction
10:02
of the electric field for a negative charge
10:04
agrees with what we already know
10:05
about opposites attracting and likes repelling.
10:08
It's just that people get confused
10:09
when we don't draw these charges
10:10
that are creating the electric field,
10:12
sometimes people forget how to find
10:14
the direction of the force.
10:15
If you want to, you can always draw them in there.
10:17
The other possibility is that
10:18
to create fields to the right,
10:20
we can put negative charges over here.
10:22
These might be creating that electric field
10:24
because they'd create fields
10:25
that point radially into them
10:27
because that's what negative charges do.
10:29
And which way will the forces be?
10:30
These negatives would be attracting
10:32
this positive to the right just like we said
10:34
in the same direction as the electric field.
10:36
Whether that electric field created by
10:38
positives or negatives, it doesn't matter.
10:40
If the electric field points to the right,
10:42
positive charges feel the force to the right.
10:44
And then a negative charge in this region
10:46
would be repelled by these negatives
10:47
or attracted by these positives
10:49
and it would feel a force to the left.
10:51
It doesn't matter whether it was positives
10:53
or negatives creating the field.
10:55
If the field points right,
10:57
positive charges are gonna feel a force
10:59
in that region to the right.
11:00
Negative charges are gonna feel a force
11:01
in that region to the left.
11:03
Let's do one more for practice.
11:04
Let's say you had this example.
11:06
Let's say you had a negative charge
11:07
and it was experiencing an electric force downward.
11:10
Now we wanna know what direction
11:12
is the electric field in this region?
11:14
Well, if the electric force
11:15
on a negative charge is downward,
11:17
the only way that happens is
11:18
for there to be an electric field
11:20
in this region that points upward.
11:22
Because negative charges are gonna feel
11:23
an electric force in the opposite direction
11:26
as the electric field.
11:27
The direction of the E would be the opposite direction
11:30
as the direction of F
11:31
or it could just ask what charge would cause
11:33
an electric force downward on this negative charge?
11:35
A big positive charge down here would do it.
11:37
Well, positive charges create fields
11:39
that point radially away from them.
11:41
So in this region up here
11:42
it would have to point radially upward
11:44
since that's a away from the positive charge.
11:47
Or you could say something else
11:48
that would cause an electric force
11:49
downward on this negative charge
11:51
would be a big negative charge up here.
11:53
And negative charges always create fields
11:55
that point radially into them.
11:57
What would the field be in this region down here,
11:59
it would still point upward
12:01
because upward would be radially in
12:03
toward the negative charge creating that field.
12:06
Recapping, you can find the direction
12:08
of the electric field created by a charge
12:10
since positive charges create fields
12:12
that point radially away from them.
12:14
And negative charges create fields
12:16
that point radially toward them.
12:18
And you can find the direction of
12:19
the electric force on a charge
12:21
since positive charges are gonna feel an electric force
12:24
in the same direction as the electric field in that region.
12:27
And negative charges are gonna feel an electric force
12:29
in the opposite direction
12:31
to the electric field in that region.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Z_ddImEdmCQ,

Male: What I'm going to talk about in this video
0:02
is one of the darker periods in Chilean history
0:04
and depending on your point of view,
0:05
also one of the darker periods in American history.
0:08
What I want to make clear in this video,
0:11
and it applies to every video I'll make in history,
0:13
is be skeptical of everything that I'm telling you.
0:15
I'm going to do my best attempt to give a reasonably
0:18
accurate series of events and draw connections
0:22
when they're clear and also make it clear where
0:24
there might be connections and no one is sure.
0:26
But you should be skeptical and frankly you should
0:28
be skeptical of anything anyone is telling you.
0:30
I encourage y'all to kind of use this as a scaffold
0:32
for your own research, for you to look up
0:34
these names and these events and figure out
0:36
what actually happened.
0:38
Now, with that said, let's rewind back to 1970
0:42
when Chile was having an election for president.
0:45
And they have their election and it's considered
0:47
a fairly free and fair election,
0:50
and one of the candidates in that election
0:51
was this gentleman over here,
0:53
Salvadore Allende, who was a known Marxist.
0:57
A known Marxist.
0:59
He has communist ideologies here.
1:04
He's known to be sympathetic to what has
1:07
happened in Cuba, sympathetic to the Soviets.
1:10
So you can imagine in this context America is concerned.
1:16
It's in the middle of the cold war.
1:17
You have Richard Nixon President.
1:19
You have Henry Kissinger is his Secretary of State.
1:22
They're actively watching this election.
1:25
They clearly do not want Salvadore Allende
1:27
to become president.
1:28
All of a sudden a major country in Latin America
1:31
being controlled by a Marxist.
1:34
Unlucky for them, Salvadore Allende actually does
1:37
get more votes than everyone else.
1:39
He gets 36% of the votes, which is a plurality.
1:44
Just so you know what plurality means, it means
1:46
that you got more of the votes than anyone else
1:48
but not necessarily the majority of the votes.
1:50
If he'd gotten 51% of the votes that would be a majority.
1:53
In this case, he didn't get a majority
1:55
and the standard procedure in Chile is that
1:58
if no one gets a majority it goes to Congress
2:00
and Congress picks who's president.
2:03
The usual thing that they would do is they would
2:06
pick whoever has the largest amount of votes.
2:08
They normally didn't do a runoff.
2:10
So, you can imagine Nixon and Kissinger they're worried.
2:13
So they kind of get into let's mess with what's going
2:16
on in Chile mode.
2:18
And this part is well established that they had this
2:19
what they called a track one strategy
2:21
of actually trying to get the Chilean congress
2:24
to not do what they normally do, to not pick the guy
2:28
with the largest number of votes.
2:31
So, they were trying to mess there, didn't seem
2:32
like something they would be able to pull off.
2:33
The other thing that it looks like they started
2:36
to kind of get involved with through the CIA
2:41
is they started to at least interface, it's not clear
2:46
how much they actually supported, they actually
2:49
started to talk to people in the military and see
2:52
how likely is a coup to happen.
2:55
How likely is Allende to be overthrown
2:58
if he becomes president?
2:59
They were looking for people who could I guess
3:02
keep this known Marxist from becoming president.
3:07
And the number one problem was this guy right over here,
3:11
the number one problem was this guy right over here.
3:14
In this whole video I would say that Rene Schneider
3:17
was the only unambiguously good guy in this video.
3:21
He was the commander in chief of the Chilean military.
3:24
He said, ""Look, I don't care who becomes president.
3:29
I don't care how much I disagree with him.
3:31
I don't care how much pressure the Americans
3:33
put on me or how much pressure the rest of the
3:35
military puts on me, the role of the Chilean military
3:39
is not to mess with politics.""
3:42
The called him the constitutionalist.
3:44
""The role of the Chilean military is not to overthrow
3:47
people when we don't like them.
3:49
The role of the Chilean military is only to defend Chile.
3:52
It's only to literally do ...""
3:54
I guess you know what militaries are supposed to do
3:55
what constitutions say the military is supposed to do.
3:59
So, you can imagine that the people who wanted
4:02
to overthrow Allende, now that it looks
4:06
like he's coming to power.
4:08
They said this guy is not a convenient guy to have in power.
4:11
He doesn't like to play the way we play,
4:13
even though maybe there were other elements
4:16
in the military that did want to do that.
4:17
So, this is what's a little bit unclear.
4:19
You have this former general in the Chilean military
4:22
who is clearly anti Allende, and he's also
4:27
anti Schneider because this guy right here
4:29
Roberto Viaux, he thinks that the military should be
4:32
I guess actively overthrowing dictators
4:35
and so there is some contact between him and
4:39
the CIA.
4:41
It seems like the CIA may have supplied some
4:43
support to him and then maybe got a little bit
4:45
freaked out that ...
4:47
At least Kissinger might have gotten a little bit
4:48
freaked out that this guy seemed a little bit extreme.
4:52
But remember we're in this period where Allende
4:54
was, he got 36% of the votes, Congress is
4:58
trying to figure out what they do about it
5:00
and during this period there are some people who say
5:02
Well look, if Rene Schneider is not going to do,
5:05
what's in their mind, the right thing
5:08
and depose the eventual Allende then we'll have to
5:12
depose Rene Schneider.
5:14
So, you have this plot that's worked up by
5:16
Roberto Viaux to essentially kidnap Rene Schneider.
5:20
And that would essentially depose him from being
5:23
head of the military and maybe they could put
5:24
somebody in his place who is more likely to have
5:28
a coup, more likely to want to overthrow Allende.
5:32
Unfortunately, when this guy's people tried to kidnap
5:37
Schneider, Schneider he's got a gun, he sees
5:41
these guys kidnapping, he takes out the gun
5:43
and then the kidnappers shoot him several times
5:46
and he eventually dies.
5:48
So, this kidnapping turns into an assasination of Rene Schneider
5:53
and they wanted to kill him or remove him or whatever
5:58
just because he essentially wanted to do his job.
6:00
So he's the only person in this whole narrative
6:02
where I'll say he was an unambiguous good guy.
6:08
Now, what's not clear is how much involvement the Americans
6:12
or the CIA had in supporting this kind of assassination
6:17
or this kidnapping of Scheider.
6:19
It does look like they kind of knew that something was going on.
6:21
This is a quote from Kissinger.
6:23
Seems pretty well substantiated.
6:25
Where he told Nixon a few days before Schneider
6:29
was assassinated when Nixon said hey what's
6:30
going on in Chile?
6:32
Are we working on any ways through the military
6:35
and are we doing anything about potentially
6:37
maybe about Schneider. I don't know look that up for yourself.
6:41
I don't know how much Nixon may or may not have known.
6:43
Kissinger told Nixon, ""This looks hopeless. I turned
6:47
it off. Nothing could be worse than an aborted coup.""
6:51
So this quote is interesting because it looks like
6:54
they thought about it.
6:55
I turned it off.
6:56
Which implies that at one point he had it turned on.
6:59
So at one point they were actively thinking
7:00
about working with Roberto Viaux maybe to kidnap
7:04
Schneider, maybe to orchestrate a coup against Allende,
7:09
but they turned it off.
7:10
So, they're not morally above doing this kind of thing,
7:14
but they decided that this guy was a little bit ...
7:16
Was not as competent as maybe they thought he should,
7:19
and at least according to Kissinger he's saying
7:21
we turned it off because nothing could be worse
7:23
than an abortive coup.
7:25
It turned out that's exactly what happened
7:26
because as soon as this guy got killed everyone
7:29
was like oh my God you have all these shady elements
7:31
who are trying to overthrow democracy and that
7:35
actually put more pressure on Congress to say
7:37
hey we have to let Allende become president.
7:40
So, in November he gets inaugurated president.
7:43
November Allende becomes president.
7:49
There's a bunch of different stories here how
7:53
much the CIA was involved.
7:54
The counter argument is look the CIA would not
7:57
have wanted to assassinate Schneider because this
8:00
would have only made Allende all the more popular.
8:03
They would have only maybe wanted to remove him
8:06
and put someone else there who was more likely
8:09
to have a coup against Allende later.
8:11
Who knows.
8:12
If you believe Kissinger's words here it looks
8:14
like maybe they provided some initial support to Viaux
8:17
and then they backed off a little bit.
8:19
Who knows.
8:20
Well, regardless to say by November of 1970 Salvadore Allende
8:24
became president, and he started implementing
8:26
his kind of Marxist ideology and it didn't go that well.
8:32
Chile's economy especially if you fast forward
8:35
to 1972, 1973, not doing so well.
8:38
He started price-fixing.
8:40
He tried to do the fairly naive approach of
8:43
raising salaries while keeping prices fixed,
8:46
which will obviously lead to shortages.
8:48
So, all around he wasn't the most popular president.
8:51
It didn't look like it, especially his economic policies
8:53
wereworking out that well.
8:55
People who were pro Allende would say well look
8:57
just like what the United States did to Cuba
8:59
they started doing to Chile as soon as they had
9:01
a Marxist in charge, someone they didn't like.
9:03
The United States started swinging its huge
9:06
economic power around to kind of hurt the Chilean
9:10
economy so that this guy would come out of power.
9:13
I'll let you decide that.
9:15
You fastforward all the way to 1973 so now Allende
9:19
has been in power for about three years,
9:21
things are not going well for him.
9:23
There are strikes going on.
9:25
He tries to clamp down on the media a bit.
9:28
There is unrest.
9:31
There are people who definitely don't want
9:33
him to be president anymore, and the people who
9:38
don't think much of the United States will say
9:40
hey but the United States the whole time was
9:41
kind of actively undermining Allende and that's probably true.
9:44
The United States will say no look we were trying
9:46
to keep the press free.
9:48
This guy was clamping down on free press.
9:49
We were trying to keep things so that there will
9:52
be another election so that this guy won't
9:54
turn into another Fidel Castro and essentially
9:56
just turn Chile into a totalitarian communist regime.
10:01
Regardless of which side you take, on September 11, 1973,
10:06
Allende is deposed.
10:08
The military surrounds the presidential palace
10:12
and it is said that he commits ""suicide.""
10:17
I put that in quotes because once again some
10:18
people believe that he really did commit suicide.
10:21
Some people believe that he was assassinated,
10:23
and some accounts say that he committed suicide
10:26
with an automatic weapon and well I guess
10:28
you could commit suicide with an automatic weapon
10:30
but it doesn't seem like the weapon of choice
10:32
for many peoples, but I'll leave that once again
10:34
for you to decide.
10:36
Whether or not he committed suicide or whether he was killed,
10:40
but regardless to say September 11 he gets
10:43
thrown out of power and once again it's not clear
10:45
what role the CIA played.
10:50
They clearly were sympathetic to the people
10:52
that wanted to overthrow him.
10:53
Clearly were providing indirect support throughout
10:57
Allende's regime to all of the people who were
10:59
anti Allende, and you can look up.
11:01
There actually are some declassified documents
11:03
that hint at what the level of CIA involvement
11:06
might have been.
11:08
Regardless to say, Allende deposed and this gentleman,
11:12
this gentleman comes to power right over here, Augusto Pinochet.
11:18
And he comes to power and he says look
11:21
you know this democracy thing is silly.
11:24
I am the president.
11:26
I am the commander in chief.
11:28
Chile will be run by military junta.
11:32
Let me write that down.
11:35
Chile will be run by a junta.
11:37
A junta just means a government that's run
11:40
by the military.
11:41
It's a military dictatorship.
11:43
The military is now in charge of Chile.
11:45
We don't need people to do silly things like voting anymore.
11:49
And you can imagine Nixon didn't care so much
11:52
that this guy didn't like democracy but he was happy.
11:54
Let me see if I can put a smile on his face.
11:57
He was happy that at least Pinochet was not a Marxist,
12:01
that at least we had stopped the spread
12:05
of communism in Latin America.
12:08
And Nixon, with that said, and this is explicit,
12:11
he wanted everything in his power to make
12:14
Augusto Pinochet successful especially
12:17
from an economic point of view.
12:19
So, the United States does start supporting Pinochet.
12:25
He's viewed as kind of an American friend.
12:27
Unfortunately for America and unfortunately for Chile,
12:30
this guy is one of those big time tyrants in history.
12:34
So, he is a tyrant.
12:36
He starts rounding up people.
12:38
He starts killing people.
12:40
He's one of those people that anything
12:42
anyone...there was a whiff of communism, a whiff
12:45
of political opposition he would round them up,
12:47
he would round their family up.
12:49
He would torture people, and just to kind of put some ...
12:52
This is another picture of him when he's older.
12:54
It's amazing how gentle some fairly evil people
12:57
can look in the world.
12:59
So I'll put some unambiguous horns on him.
13:03
He killed many, many people and many, many
13:07
people disappeared.
13:08
Just to give an idea, these are some of the people
13:11
who disappeared.
13:13
It was anyone from people who were critical of him,
13:15
people who were perceived to be left-leaning,
13:18
whatever it was.
13:19
He tortured including women and children and all the rest.
13:23
So, all around bad guy.
13:25
He stuck around in Chile as president until 1990.
13:29
So, that's 17 years, and he really stayed
13:30
in power until 1998 where he was commander and chief
13:33
of the army.
13:34
You can imagine if the military is in control
13:36
President isn't that important of a title.
13:39
Commander and chief is.
13:40
So for 25 years he hung around Chile and
13:44
continued to be this totalitarian guy,
13:48
although he liked free markets.
13:51
He was a capitalist in the traditional sense
13:53
and the one I guess silver lining if you
13:58
had to throw a silver lining on Pinochet's regime
14:00
was that the Chilean economy actually did well
14:03
during his regime.
14:05
Chile is considered one of the success stories
14:08
economically over that time period.
14:10
So, I'll let you decide, and some people would
14:13
say oh that's because Pinochet understood economics,
14:16
he didn't try to do all this price fixing stuff that
14:18
Allende tried to do.
14:20
Regardless of the fact that he was a tyrant,
14:22
at least the economy was doing well.
14:26
The other side of the equation would be well look
14:28
of course the economy did well, now you had
14:30
the United States doing everything in its power,
14:33
this huge the largest economy in the world,
14:35
doing everything in its power to make sure
14:38
that Chile's economy thrives while one of its
14:41
buddies are in power.
14:42
So, I'll let you decide who's right, who's wrong,
14:44
what was the actual involvement of the CIA
14:48
and Nixon and Kissinger and all of this mess over here.
14:52
But I think needless to say that this was a
14:54
not so pleasant chapter in I guess world history.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Um92GZLCQ_Q,
khan_video_WScwPIPqZa0_200,"What is ""R"" in the ideal gas law?",MCQ,"•
0:00
Let's say I have a balloon.
0:03
And in that balloon I have a bunch of
0:05
particles bouncing around.
0:07
They're gas particles, so they're floating freely.
0:10
And they each have some velocity, some kinetic energy.
0:17
And what I care about, let me just draw a few more, what I
0:23
care about is the pressure that is exerted on the surface
0:27
of the balloon.
0:28
So I care about the pressure.
0:29
And what's pressure?
0:30
It's force per area.
0:36
So the area here, you can think of it as the inside
0:39
surface of the balloon.
0:40
And what's going to apply force to that?
0:42
Well any given moment-- I only drew six particles here, but
0:46
in a real balloon you would have gazillions of particles,
0:50
and we could talk about how large, but more particles than
0:54
you can really probably imagine-- but at any given
0:57
moment, some of those particles are bouncing off the
0:59
wall of the container.
1:01
That particle is bouncing there, this particle is
1:03
bouncing there, this guy's bouncing like that.
1:06
And when they bounce, they apply force to the container.
1:10
An outward force, that's what keeps the balloon blown up.
1:14
So think about what the pressure is going to be
1:16
dependent on.
1:18
So first of all, the faster these particles move, the
1:22
higher the pressure.
1:31
Slower particles, you're going to be bouncing into the
1:34
container less, and when you do bounce into the container,
1:37
it's going to be less of a ricochet, or less of a change
1:40
in momentum.
1:41
So slower particles, you're going to
1:45
have pressure go down.
1:47
Now, it's practically impossible to measure the
1:50
kinetic energy, or the velocity, or the direction of
1:53
each individual particle.
1:55
Especially when you have gazillions
1:56
of them in a balloon.
1:57
So we do is we think of the average
2:00
energy of the particles.
2:01
And the average energy of the particles, you might say oh,
2:04
Sal is about to introduce us to a new concept.
2:08
It's a new way of looking at probably a very familiar
2:11
concept to you.
2:12
And that's temperature.
2:14
Temperature can and should be viewed as the average energy
2:18
of the particles in the system.
2:20
So I'll put a little squiggly line, because there's a lot of
2:23
ways to think about it.
2:24
Average energy.
2:28
And mostly kinetic energy, because these particles are
2:31
moving and bouncing.
2:32
The higher the temperature, the faster that these
2:35
particles move.
2:36
And the more that they're going to bounce into the side
2:40
of the container.
2:41
But temperature is average energy.
2:44
It tells us energy per particle.
2:52
So obviously, if we only had one particle in there with
2:57
super high temperature, that's going to have less pressure
3:00
than if we have a million particles in there.
3:02
Let me draw that.
3:05
If I have, let's take two cases right here.
3:12
One is, I have a bunch of particles with a certain
3:16
temperature, moving in their different directions.
3:22
And the other example, I have one particle.
3:25
And maybe they have the same temperature.
3:27
That on average, they have the same kinetic energy.
3:29
The kinetic energy per particle is the same.
3:32
Clearly, this one is going to be applying more pressure to
3:35
its container, because at any given moment more of these
3:38
particles are going to be bouncing off the side than in
3:40
this example.
3:41
This guy's going to bounce, bam, then going to go and
3:43
move, bounce, bam.
3:44
So he's going to be applying less pressure, even though his
3:46
temperature might be the same.
3:47
Because temperature is kinetic energy, or you can view it as
3:51
kinetic energy per particles.
3:53
Or it's a way of looking at kinetic energy per particle.
3:55
So if we wanted to look at the total energy in the system, we
3:59
would want to multiply the temperature times the number
4:04
of particles.
4:05
And just since we're dealing on the molecular scale, the
4:08
number of particles can often be represented as moles.
4:11
Remember, moles is just a number of particles.
4:13
So we're saying that that pressure-- well, I'll say it's
4:19
proportional, so it's equal to some constant,
4:26
let's call that R.
4:29
Because we've got to make all the units work out in the end.
4:31
I mean temperature is in Kelvin but we eventually want
4:33
to get back to joules.
4:34
So let's just say it's equal to some constant, or it's
4:36
proportional to temperature times the number of particles.
4:41
And we can do that a bunch of ways.
4:43
But let's think of that in moles.
4:44
If I say there are 5 mole particles there, you know
4:47
that's 5 times 6 times 10 to the 23 particles.
4:50
So, this is the number of particles.
4:55
This is the temperature.
4:57
And this is just some constant.
5:02
Now, what else is the pressure dependent on?
5:04
We gave these two examples.
5:06
Obviously, it is dependent on the temperature; the faster
5:08
each of these particles move, the higher pressure we'll
5:10
have. It's also dependent on the number of particles, the
5:13
more particles we have, the more pressure we'll have. What
5:16
about the size of the container?
5:18
The volume of the container.
5:20
If we took this example, but we shrunk the container
5:23
somehow, maybe by pressing on the outside.
5:26
So if this container looked like this, but we still had
5:29
the same four particles in it, with the same average kinetic
5:37
energy, or the same temperature.
5:39
So the number of particles stays the same, the
5:41
temperature is the same, but the volume has gone down.
5:44
Now, these guys are going to bump into the sides of the
5:47
container more frequently and there's less area.
5:50
So at any given moment, you have more force and less area.
5:54
So when you have more force and less area, your pressure
5:56
is going to go up.
5:57
So when the volume went down, your pressure went up.
6:08
So we could say that pressure is inversely
6:10
proportional to volume.
6:12
So let's think about that.
6:13
Let's put that into our equation.
6:15
We said that pressure is proportional-- and I'm just
6:22
saying some proportionality constant, let's call that R,
6:26
to the number of particles times the temperature, this
6:31
gives us the total energy.
6:32
And it's inversely proportional to the volume.
6:36
And if we multiply both sides of this times the volume, we
6:39
get the pressure times the volume is proportional to the
6:46
number of particles times the temperature.
6:49
So PV is equal to RnT.
6:51
And just to switch this around a little bit, so it's in a
6:53
form that you're more likely to see in your chemistry book,
6:56
if we just switch the n and the R term.
6:58
You get pressure times volume is equal to n, the number of
7:03
particles you have, times some constant times temperature.
7:08
And this right here is the ideal gas equation.
7:14
Hopefully, it makes some sense to you.
7:21
When they say ideal gas, it's based on this little mental
7:25
exercise I did to come up with this.
7:27
I made some implicit assumptions when I did this.
7:30
One is I assumed that we're dealing with an ideal gas.
7:35
And so you say what, Sal, is an ideal gas?
7:38
An ideal gas is one where the molecules are not too
7:43
concerned with each other.
7:44
They're just concerned with their own kinetic energy and
7:46
bouncing off the wall.
7:47
So they don't attract or repel each other.
7:56
Let's say they attracted each other, then as you increased
7:59
the number of particles maybe they'd want to
8:01
not go to the side.
8:02
Maybe they'd all gravitate towards the center a little
8:04
bit more if they did attract each other.
8:06
And if they did that, they would bounce into the walls
8:08
less and the pressure would be a little bit lower.
8:10
So we're assuming that they don't attract
8:11
or repel each other.
8:13
And we're also assuming that the actual volume of the
8:17
individual particles are inconsequential.
8:20
Which is a pretty good assumption, because they're
8:22
pretty small.
8:22
Although, if you start putting a ton of particles into a
8:28
certain volume, then at some point, especially if they're
8:31
big molecules, it'll start to matter in terms of their size.
8:34
But we're assuming for the purposes of our little mental
8:37
exercise that the molecules have inconsequential volumes
8:43
and they don't attract or repel each other.
8:45
And in that situation, we can apply the ideal gas equation
8:50
right here.
8:52
Now, we've established the ideal gas equation.
8:54
But you're like, well what's R, how do I deal with it, and
8:56
how do I do math problems, and solve chemistry
8:59
problems with it?
8:59
And how do the units all work out?
9:01
We'll do all of that in the next video where we'll solve a
9:03
ton of equations, or a ton of exercises with
9:06
the ideal gas equation.
9:08
The important takeaway from this video is just to have the
9:12
intuition as to why this actually does make sense.
9:15
And frankly, once you have this intution, you should
9:17
never forget it.
9:17
You should be able to maybe even derive it on your own.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,WScwPIPqZa0,

0:00
One of the reasons that's most cited as to a cause
0:04
or the cause of why World War I turned into a world war,
0:08
as opposed to just a regional conflict in southeast Europe,
0:11
is the alliance system that was developing in the decades
0:15
leading up to World War I. And to understand
0:18
that, I've distilled a bunch of the alliances that occurred
0:20
in those decades leading up to World War I.
0:22
And this is just a distilled version.
0:24
There were many other alliances that were tangentially related.
0:26
But I tried to distill down the ones that were directly related
0:29
to all of the dominoes falling in 1914 that
0:33
led to all of Europe being essentially at war
0:35
with each other.
0:36
So to understand that, we have to rewind 75 years.
0:39
So World War I starts in 1914.
0:42
75 years before that, in 1839, you have the Treaty of London.
0:47
And the Treaty of London did many things.
0:49
But Article 7 is what's relevant to the beginning of World War
0:52
I, where Britain agrees to protect
0:55
the neutrality of Belgium.
0:57
And if you're skeptical, you might say, hey,
0:59
this is a 75-year-old treaty.
1:01
Why does this matter anymore?
1:02
And that, actually, would be a good question.
1:05
Really, all of these alliances-- it's
1:06
a very healthy debate you can have as to
1:08
whether these are the direct causes of why
1:10
one of these powers declared war on the other.
1:13
Or whether these were just excuses.
1:15
These were a legal pretext for saying,
1:17
oh, I need to declare war on you.
1:18
When in reality, they really did want
1:20
to declare war for a whole set of reasons
1:21
to keep the other person's empire in check,
1:24
to flex their military muscle, to go
1:26
after more territory in their empires.
1:28
Who knows what it might be?
1:30
But needless to say, 1839 was the legal basis
1:33
for the British Empire to protect Belgium.
1:39
Now, you fast-forward 40 years, you get to 1879.
1:43
You have a newly born German Empire
1:46
out of the Franco-Prussian War in 1871.
1:50
That newly born German empire, they just had-- essentially,
1:53
it's an extension of Prussia, fundamentally,
1:57
a German kingdom.
1:58
They just had a war with France.
2:00
They took some very valuable territory from France.
2:02
They're paranoid that France wants to get back at them.
2:05
They're paranoid about the Russians.
2:08
And they have some connection with the Austrians--
2:12
the Austro-Hungarians, I should say.
2:14
And so in 1879, they sign the Dual Alliance Treaty
2:19
between Germany and Austria-Hungary
2:21
to protect each other if Russia attacks.
2:24
They have this common enemy right over here, Russia.
2:27
So they are going to-- let me do this in a different color.
2:30
They are going to protect each other.
2:32
So this makes the new German Empire feel a little bit better
2:35
about its position in Europe, in case
2:37
they were to get into a war with either of these characters.
2:41
Then in 1892-- you could imagine,
2:43
if you ever play a game of Risk or if you ever
2:45
play the game of Diplomacy, which is actually
2:47
based on what happened in World War
2:49
I. If you see some people that you might be
2:52
at war with starting to become friends,
2:54
you want to look for other friends, other alliances
2:56
that you can form in case they declare war on you.
2:59
So in 1892, you have an alliance between the French
3:02
and the Russians, the Franco-Russian Military
3:04
Convention.
3:05
So this is an alliance.
3:07
Let me do this in the magenta color again.
3:10
You have an alliance between France and Russia.
3:16
And then finally, in the early 1900s, 1904 to 1907,
3:20
you have a series of agreements.
3:22
""Entente"" essentially means agreements.
3:24
Agreements between the British Empire and France,
3:26
between the British Empire and the Russian Empire,
3:29
to essentially get on good terms with each other.
3:32
These weren't as formally bonding
3:34
that, hey, if someone's going to attack you,
3:35
I'm going to attack them.
3:37
But they were, essentially, able to resolve
3:39
a lot of their issues on what's going on
3:41
in their other imperial conquests.
3:43
And they formed what is called the Triple Entente,
3:46
the triple agreement between Britain,
3:50
between the British Empire-- and right here, I just
3:52
circled the United Kingdom-- France, and Russia.
3:57
And on the other side of that, you had the Triple Alliance.
4:00
You have Germany.
4:00
You have Austria-Hungary.
4:02
And you also have Italy.
4:06
Now, the reason why, even though entering into World War I,
4:09
Italy was formerly part of the Triple Alliance.
4:11
And there were treaties between Italy and Germany
4:14
to become part of this Triple Alliance.
4:16
The reason I don't focus on those is once the war started,
4:18
Italy did not go on the side of Germany and Austria-Hungary.
4:24
It went on the side of the Allies,
4:26
on the side of the Triple Entente.
4:29
But this will give you a good background
4:30

Arturo Potori here, but you can call me Art.
0:05
This is explorations in art history starring me!
0:11
And, the hand.
0:14
Well, without the rest of me, how embarrassing,
0:18
people watching from around the world and I'm stuck waiting on some five-fingered prima donna.
0:24
Oh, well that's better. It looks like we'll be talking about the Renaissance Period.
0:33
During the medieval period, the torch lit by the Greeks, carried on by the Romans, had been rejected,
0:38
Medieval values instead elevated the spiritual and denounced the flesh.
0:44
Then, in the mid-14th century, Petrarch, an Italian poet and scholar of Latin,
0:49
was able to reconcile Christianity and classical Roman and Greek thought in his writings,
0:55
and revive interest in what had been dismissed as the pagan past.
1:00
This started the period called the Renaissance, or rebirth.
1:05
The shift of focus from god-centered toward human-centered interest became known as Humanism.
1:13
Of course, there wouldn't have been much of a Renaissance without a Renaissance man or two,
1:18
a man with expertise in many fields.
1:21
Take Brunelleschi, who was a goldsmith, architect, engineer, sculptor and mathematician.
1:27
As an artist, he discovered the principles of linear perspective, which gives the illusion of 3-dimensional space, to 2-dimensional art.
1:35
Start with the horizon line, add a vanishing point, and then lines that converge to that vanishing point.
1:42
Now you have a framework for making objects appear farther away. Or closer.
1:48
Of course, Brunelleschi was most famous for his massive dome. No, not that dome.
1:53
The dome he built for the Florence Cathedral, equal in size to the dome of the Pantheon.
1:58
Brunelleschi's new method of construction was so different that some Florentines wondered if he was mad!
2:04
He devised a way to build the dome without scaffolding, and without using flying buttresses,
2:09
commonly used in Gothic architecture to support the weight of large structures.
2:14
Sixteen years later when the dome was completed, it was recognized as a marvel of the era,
2:19
and Brunelleschi was heralded as a genius.
2:26
Donatello also started as a goldsmith.
2:29
No, no, no, no, Donatello was not a crime-fighting turtle,
2:32
but Donatello did study the old Roman styles of sculpture and ornamentation.
2:38
His David is famous as the first free-standing bronze sculpture cast during the Renaissance.
2:43
It depicts David as the beautiful youth of the Bible, just after decapitating the giant Goliath,
2:49
and uses classical techniques like contrapposto in its design.
2:53
Donatello also developed a new way of sculpting in shallow relief, that applied the rules of linear perspective
2:59
to create a greater illusion of depth.
3:02
He would have been hailed as the most accomplished sculptor of the Renaissance,
3:06
if not for the coming of Michelangelo,
3:08
who, along with da Vinci and Raphael kicked the art world into high gear for the High Renaissance.
3:13
Perhaps no one exemplifies the ideal of the Renaissance man more than Leonardo da Vinci.
3:22
No, Renaissance man was not a superhero. Really, read your history.
3:29
Leonardo was a talented painter, sculptor, scientist, architect, and even a military engineer.
3:36
He painted the most famous portrait in the world, the Mona Lisa.
3:40
His boundless curiosity was best exemplified by his notebooks, which were filled with inventions,
3:45
like a tank, flying machine, and a parachute.
3:49
In 1482, Leonardo went to Milan where he painted his famous mural, The Last Supper, on the wall of a monastery.
3:57
He chose to portray the emotional moment when Jesus predicts that one of the apostles will betray him,
4:02
and the betrayer will take bread at the same time he does.
4:06
The apostles react in different degrees of surprise and horror, except for Judas, who, distracted by the commotion,
4:12
reaches for a piece of bread.
4:16
Leonardo used perspective lines as a compositional device that leads the eye to Jesus' face,
4:20
the calm center of the chaos.
4:24
Though The Last Supper had been painted by others, Leonardo's was the first to depict the apostles as
4:29
acting, or reacting, like real people.
4:36
Now we come to Michelangelo. You think we can do this one straight? Ok.
4:43
At 24, Michelangelo carved the famous Pieta, which in Italian, means pity.
4:48
The Pieta depicts the body Jesus on his mother Mary's lap, as she mourns his death by crucifixion,
4:54
and combines the Renaissance ideals classical beauty and realism.
4:59
Shortly after installing the Pieta, Michelangelo overheard someone say that the sculpture
5:03
was the work of another artist.
5:05
That night Michelangelo chiseled the words,
5:08
""Michelangelo Bourinati Florentine made this"" across the sash running across Mary's breast.
5:14
Later, Michelangelo regretted this act. It was the only
5:17
statue he ever signed. Michelangelo was reluctant to accept the commision
5:21
to paint the Sistine chapel, but Pope Julius II insisted.
5:26
Contrary to popular belief, Michelangelo did not lay on his back to paint,
5:30
but stood on specially designed scaffolding and had to reach upward
5:34
craning his neck awkwardly to paint. Fresco required painting in to a newly
5:38
applied layer of wet plaster, and Michelangelo, also a
5:41
poet, complained in a letter to a friend, ""My beard turns up to heaven
5:46
my nape falls in, a rich embroidery bedews my face,
5:50
from brushstrokes thick and thin."" Four years later the arduous
5:53
task was done, and a masterpiece created.
6:01
The paintings of the Sistine Chapel had a profound effect on other artists. One story
6:05
claims that Raphael slipped into the chapel to examine the paintings
6:09
when Michelangelo was absent. ""Mamma mia!
6:15
What's the matter with me? It's back to the drawing board.""
6:16
Raphael scraped the fresco he was working on off the wall and repainted it.
6:21
Imititating the more powerful style of Michelangelo. Raphael became
6:25
a favorite of the Pope, and was commissioned to paint other rooms in the Vatican.
6:29
His greatest masterpiece, The School of Athens, portrays Plato,
6:32
Aristotle and other Greek philosophers, mathematicians, scientists, from
6:36
classical antiquity, sharing their ideas, learning from each other.
6:41
It's a kind of intellectual fantasy gathering, since these figures
6:45
all lived at different times, and it shows that Humanism had become
6:48
accepted in the church. Raphael even included himself standing
6:52
with the astronomers. Sounds like my kind of party, Plato,
6:57
Aristotle, Arturo, huh?
7:03
Oh. We haven't mentioned the
7:04
Northern Renaissance. No, no, no, Leonardo, Michelangelo,
7:08
and Raphael did not go North for a skiing trip. Sorry folks,
7:12
you'll have to excuse the hand today, it's just that, well, for many, the Renaissance
7:17
was an intoxicating time. Ok, so what happened in Italy
7:20
didn't stay in Italy. The ideas of the Renaissance migrated
7:24
up into the rest of Europe, and started what was called the Northern Renaissance.
7:28
Jan van Eyck pioneered the techniques of painting with oil
7:32
based paints on wooden panels. Artists of the North had a
7:36
fondness for meticulous detail, and were more interested in realism than
7:40
classicism. Albrecht Dürer traveled to Italy and was friends with
7:44
Raphael and other artists of the Renaissance. He was able to incorporate the
7:48
Italian and Northern ideas into his paintings and prints.
7:51
He became one of the most influential artists of printmaking, and elevated this
7:55
relatively art form to new levels of aesthetic quality and
7:59
popularity.
8:03
After the death of Leonardo in 1519 and Raphael in 1520
8:08
artists rejected the values of the High Renaissance for
8:11
a more heightened or more mannered approach. Mannerists like Tito and
8:16
Regel created unbalanced compositions that gave for visual tension
8:19
to the work. Tintoreto's painting of The Last Supper shifts the table
8:23
from the center to the left side, and emphasizes dramatic lighting and
8:27
motion to increase the drama of the image. Mannerist artists also
8:31
intentionally distorted and stylized the human body and spatial relationships
8:35
like this painting of the Madonna, by Parmegianino.
8:39
The figures are elongated, and instead of balancing the angels on either side
8:43
of Mary, they are deliberately squeezed into the left side with only a tiny
8:47
Saint Jerome on the right. Oww, how does she
8:51
do it!
8:54
The Renaissance was a period of great discovery, invention, and creativity
8:59
The Renaissance included the discovery of the New World by Columbus, the invention of the printing press by Gutenberg,
9:05
the beginning of the Protestant Reformation by Martin Luther, and the scientific
9:09
advances of Copernicus and Galileo, to name a few.
9:13
The influence of the Renaissance on Western art is ongoing, and even
9:17
went viral without Facebook or Twitter or Youtube, because of the
9:23
strength of its ideas, and the beauty
9:24
of its creations.
