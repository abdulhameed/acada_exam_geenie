khan_video_uwMYpTYsNZM_83373,Are effector and plasma cells the same?,MCQ,"•
0:00
In talking about the adaptive immune system, we've already
0:04
seen that there's a couple of actors.
0:16
You have your humoral response.
0:20
So this is responding to things that are floating
0:22
around in the fluids of the body and not necessarily
0:24
things that have infiltrated your body cells and then you
0:27
have your cell mediated response.
0:35
And then in the humoral response-- and we're talking
0:38
about specific humoral response-- this is where the B
0:40
cells, the B lymphocytes are at their most active.
0:45
And essentially what they do is, you got a B cell here.
0:48
It has a very specific antibody, specific to just
0:52
this B cell, not B cells in general.
0:55
If this happens to be the one of the billions of B cells
0:59
that happens to have the matching key-- or maybe I
1:02
should say the matching lock for the key that is the
1:05
intruding pathogen-- that pathogen will
1:09
bind to that B cell.
1:11
Maybe it's a virus, maybe it's a bacteria.
1:14
And then the B cell will get activated and we'll talk about
1:17
in this video that the activation
1:19
doesn't always happen.
1:20
In fact, it usually doesn't happen just from this, but so
1:23
far we've said it gets activated, it goes into memory
1:28
B cells, which are essentially multiple versions of this
1:31
original B cell-- just saying, hey, let's have multiple
1:33
versions of this-- because it tends to recognize this virus.
1:36
So in the future if we get this virus, those multiple
1:39
versions, those memory cells are going to be there to have
1:42
this interaction.
1:43
This interaction's going to be more likely to happen in the
1:45
future because I'm going to have more of this
1:47
variety of B cell.
1:48
And then you have effector cells.
1:53
And these are essentially-- so both of these are B cells.
1:56
So this guy, once he gets activated, he proliferates,
2:00
keeps dividing and cloning himself.
2:02
The memory cells just stick around waiting to be activated
2:05
in the future.
2:06
And I'm only drawing one of these membrane bound
2:10
antibodies, but there are actually 10,000 on them.
2:13
I mean, I could draw a bunch of these.
2:15
I don't have to just draw one.
2:17
The memories just wade around in the future, but there's
2:19
more of them now.
2:19
So in the future, if we get this virus again, this
2:23
interaction's going to happen faster and so they're going to
2:26
get activated faster.
2:27
And then the effector B cells essentially turn
2:32
into antibody factories.
2:35
This antibody goes in and it says, let me just produce--
2:39
I've been activated.
2:39
Let me produce many, many more versions
2:42
of that exact antibody.
2:44
So they get spit out.
2:46
I drew that one little wrong.
2:48
So that exact antibody, that can then be spit out to go
2:53
disable or tag antigens-- and not just any antigen-- this
2:57
antigen right here.
3:00
And we also saw that the other thing that the B cell does is
3:03
it becomes an antigen presenting cell.
3:06
So what it does is, as soon as it recognizes this, it's had
3:11
this interaction with an antigen that just matches the
3:14
variable portion of its membrane bound antibody.
3:17
It endocytosizes that.
3:19
It brings that into itself.
3:22
It's membrane facilitated so it just kind of pulls it in,
3:25
chunks it up, and then presents a piece of that
3:27
antibody on an MHC II molecule.
3:31
We saw that in the last video.
3:33
So it cuts that up and presents a piece of it right
3:36
there and that's why we call it an antigen presenting cell.
3:39
Now in this video, we're going to talk about why we even have
3:42
these MHC II molecules.
3:44
What are we presenting these antigens to?
3:47
So we're going to start talking about the cell
3:48
mediated-- and actually, even more than the cell mediated,
3:50
we're going to talk about T cells.
3:56
And I said in the first video, they're called T cells because
3:59
they mature in the thymus.
4:07
And there are two types of T cells and it's all very
4:09
confusing because you have B cells and T cells, but then
4:11
there are two types of T cells.
4:13
You have helper T cells-- and most people just write T with
4:18
a lower-case or subscript h there.
4:21
And then you have cytotoxic T cells-- or T cells that kill
4:26
other cells.
4:32
Now just so that you have a big, overarching impression of
4:36
what does what-- B cells.
4:39
When they are activated, they generate antibodies.
4:43
At 30,000 feet, that's the best summary of what an
4:46
activated B cell does.
4:47
It actually generate antibodies.
4:49
Those antibodies attach to viruses and bacteria and other
4:53
types of pathogens and disables them-- either tags
4:55
them so that macrophages can go and eat them up or just by
5:02
throwing all of those antibodies on to the surface
5:06
of the pathogen in question.
5:08
It might disable the pathogens or essentially bundle them
5:11
altogether so that it'll be easier for macrophages to pick
5:14
them up, but this is only effective for things that are
5:17
floating around.
5:19
Free floating antibodies are only effective for things that
5:21
are floating around.
5:24
Cytotoxic T cells, which I'll cover in more detail in a
5:27
future video-- these actually attack cells that have been
5:32
infiltrated.
5:34
So this is attack, kill, infiltrated cells-- and when I
5:42
say infiltrated, it could be a cell that a virus has gone
5:45
into or some bacteria has penetrated it.
5:47
And when I say infiltrated, it doesn't necessarily even mean
5:49
something from the outside.
5:50
It could even be a cancerous cell that shows itself to be
5:53
abnormal in some way and so the cytotoxic T cells will at
5:57
least attempt to kill them.
5:59
But what I want to focus on-- out of the three types of
6:02
lymphocytes-- remember, everything we've been talking
6:06
about was leukocytes, white blood cells, but lymphocytes
6:09
are a subset of that and these three are lymphocytes.
6:12
And they're called that because they began their
6:14
development in the bone marrow.
6:18
So this guy and this guy actually do stuff.
6:24
This guy generates antibodies that attach to pathogens
6:27
floating around.
6:28
This guy directly attacks cells that are
6:31
broken in some way.
6:32
They've either been infiltrated, they're abnormal,
6:34
they're cancerous-- who knows what.
6:36
And I'll do a whole video on that, but that leads us to a
6:39
very obvious question.
6:40
What does this guy do?
6:42
What does the helper T cell do if he doesn't directly
6:47
interface either with pathogens or produce things
6:50
that interface with pathogens-- or if he himself
6:53
doesn't go and directly kill cells?
6:55
And the answer is that the helper T cell's kind of the
6:58
alarm of the immune system.
7:01
And on some level, it's almost the most important.
7:03
So we talked already in the last video about antigen
7:08
presenting cells-- that either when a macrophage or a
7:11
dendritic cell takes things in, it cuts them up and
7:15
presents it on its surface as these MHC II proteins or in
7:19
complex with these MHC II complexes or proteins.
7:24
And so do B cells.
7:27
B cells are more specific.
7:28
Now, once something is presented, now the helper T
7:33
cell can come into the picture.
7:34
So this is a-- let me do a dendritic cell-- and I'm doing
7:39
dendritic cells actually on purpose because dendritic
7:42
cells are actually the best cells at
7:45
activating helper T cells.
7:46
We're going to talk about in a second what happens when a
7:49
helper T cell gets activated.
7:51
So let's say I have this dendritic cell.
7:54
It's called dendritic so it looks like it has
7:55
dendrites on it.
8:01
So I have this dendritic cell here.
8:03
It's a phagocyte.
8:06
Let's say it's already consumed some type of bacteria
8:10
or virus and it's cut it up and now it's presenting kind
8:14
of the body parts of that virus on the MHC II complex.
8:23
It's kind of its way of saying, hey, I found this
8:25
shady thing floating around in the body's tissues.
8:29
Maybe someone ought to raise an alarm.
8:32
Maybe this is part of some type of bigger thing going on
8:35
and some type of alarm bell has to be released.
8:37
And that's what the helper T cell does.
8:40
So let's say this guy-- he's presented it.
8:42
He says, I found this thing.
8:43
I killed it.
8:43
Here's a part of it.
8:44
The helper T cell has a T cell receptor on it.
8:49
Let's say this is the helper T cell right here.
8:55
And it has a T cell receptor on it and the T cell receptors
9:00
bond to-- and I'll be very particular here.
9:03
So this is the T cell receptor.
9:07
It's just like a protein, but like the membrane bound
9:11
antibodies on B cells that every B cell or almost every B
9:16
cell has a different version, different variable chain,
9:18
that's also true of helper T cells-- that just like the B
9:24
cells, this has some variation in where it binds.
9:27
So this right here is going to be variable from one helper T
9:31
cell to another.
9:31
For example, I might have another helper T cell here.
9:35
That also has a T cell receptor, but the variable
9:41
portion on that T cell receptor is different than the
9:47
variable portion on this T cell receptor.
9:49
So this helper T cell will not bind to this dendritic cell or
9:55
the MHC II complex of this dendritic cell.
9:58
Only this one would.
9:59
And the mechanism of how you get this variation is very
10:02
similar to the mechanism in how you get the variation on
10:05
the antibodies and the B cells.
10:07
During these helper T cells' development, at some point the
10:12
genes that code for this part of this receptor get shuffled
10:15
around and they get shuffled around intentionally so that
10:18
each T cell has a certain specificity to a combination
10:23
of an MHC II complex and a certain polypeptide, a certain
10:28
part of a virus.
10:29
So only this guy's going to be activated, not this guy.
10:32
So this is why we call it the specific immune system.
10:35
Now we said, what does that helper T
10:36
cell do at that point?
10:40
He said, hey, I happen to be the one helper T cell that can
10:44
bond to this guy, this antigen that's presented.
10:46
It becomes activated.
10:49
And I won't go into the details, but in general,
10:51
dendritic cells are the best ones at activating it,
10:54
especially a naive T cell.
11:02
In general, when we talk about a naive B cell or a naive
11:05
helper T cell, these are cells that are non-memory,
11:08
non-effector, that have never been touched by-- they've
11:11
never been activated, in the case of a B cell.
11:14
They've never been activated by something binding to their
11:18
membrane bound antibody-- or a naive helper T cell is a
11:23
non-effector, non-memory helper T cell that's never had
11:26
anything bound to it.
11:28
So if this guy is naive and then he finally has a reaction
11:33
with this antigen presenting cell, he becomes non-naive.
11:37
He becomes activated and when activated, two things happen.
11:41
Well, just like with B cells, he proliferates many, many,
11:44
many copies of himself and some subset of those copies
11:48
differentiate into effector cells.
11:54
And effector just means it does something.
11:56
It does something now instead of saving the memory.
12:01
And then some subset of them become memory helper T cells
12:08
after getting activated.
12:12
Now the memory T cells, just like memory B cells-- now you
12:15
have more copies of this.
12:16
So in 10 years in the future, if something like this
12:17
happens, this interaction's going to be
12:19
more likely to happen.
12:20
These guys have the same T cell receptor as their parent.
12:33
It's just that the memory T cells-- or actually even the
12:36
memory B cells-- they last longer.
12:38
They don't kill themselves.
12:39
They'll last for years so that if 10 years later, something
12:42
like this starts presenting itself, you're going to have
12:44
more of these guys around to bump into this guy so that you
12:47
can raise the alarm bells.
12:49
This guy's also going to have the same chain right there.
12:56
So you're saying, fine.
12:57
I have these memory cells.
12:58
They're going to stick around so that this reaction can
13:00
happen in the future, but I still haven't answered the
13:02
question, what does the effector T cell do?
13:05
What the effector T cell does is it raises the alarm.
13:16
So there's an effector T cell.
13:18
It has been activated.
13:22
Remember, this is very particular.
13:23
Only this version of T cells, but once it got activated, it
13:27
produced many copies of itself because it says, hey, I'm
13:29
responding to a particular type of pathogen.
13:32
So that this is a helper T cell.
13:34
This is an effector.
13:37
And what these do is they start releasing these
13:39
molecules called cytokines.
13:42
So they start releasing cytokines.
13:50
There are many, many different types of cytokines and I'm not
13:52
going to go into detail on all that, but what cytokines do is
13:56
that they really raise the alarm.
13:58
So if you have other activated lymphatic cells or other
14:03
activated immunological cells-- when the cytokines
14:07
enter those cells-- remember, cytokines
14:08
are really just proteins.
14:10
When the cytokines enter-- or polypeptides-- when they enter
14:14
those cells, it makes them get in gear.
14:17
It makes them multiply more often or it makes them get
14:21
more active in their immune response.
14:24
So what this does-- these cytokines you can view as
14:26
chemical alarm bells chemical or peptide alarm bells alarm
14:34
bells it it tells everyone to get in gear.
14:38
So that's one role, and so you can see this is actually a
14:40
very central role and it'll tell both activated cytotoxic
14:45
T cells to get in gear, which we haven't talked about yet.
14:47
And it'll also tell B cells to keep proliferating.
14:50
So when an activated B cell gets some of-- so this is an
14:53
activated B cell.
14:55
When it gets some of these cytokines, that maybe come
14:58
from a local helper T cell, it'll tell it, hey no, divide
15:01
more often.
15:02
Divide more often.
15:03
Only if you've been activated already.
15:04
And we'll talk more about why it has to be that case,
15:07
because you don't want all the B cells to be activated.
15:10
And the other thing that the effector T cell does-- in the
15:13
B cell discussion, I said, OK, if I have a B cell, and it has
15:21
its membrane bound antibody, has its
15:24
membrane bound antibody.
15:25
And remember, this is a particular version, it has its
15:29
particular variable chain right here.
15:31
And this guy binds to a pathogen.
15:34
So this binds to a pathogen.
15:36
Maybe it's a virus right there.
15:38
Up to now, I've been saying that this guy's activated.
15:41
And he's going to-- well, when he binds to the pathogen he'll
15:44
take this in and he'll take part of the pathogen and cut
15:49
it up and place it on an MHC II molecule.
15:55
And we said, then he'll be activated.
15:57
He'll proliferate and he'll differentiate into memory and
16:00
effector B cells-- but that's not quite true.
16:02
This first stage happens.
16:04
This guy bonds.
16:05
This B cell happened to be specific to this virus.
16:08
Cuts up the virus.
16:10
Puts parts of the virus on its surface and presents parts of
16:13
the antigen.
16:14
But in most cases, this B cell isn't yet activated.
16:19
You can kind of view it as in its resting state, ready to be
16:22
activated, but it hasn't started proliferating and
16:24
differentiating into effector and memory molecules yet.
16:27
And in order for that to happen, an activated helper T
16:36
cell that is also specific to this very same virus-- so you
16:40
could imagine someplace else in the cell-- this virus was
16:45
eaten by a dendritic cell.
16:52
So this exact same virus, this exact same species of virus,
16:55
is eaten by that dendritic cell and so the dendritic cell
16:59
eats it up, it cuts it up, and then it presents it-- it's
17:05
antigen presenting so it presents it just like that.
17:10
Then this will activate a very specific T
17:12
cell, maybe that one.
17:14
So a very specific T cell will come and bump into it.
17:20
Not just any T cell, the one with the
17:23
right variable portion.
17:24
So think about what's happening.
17:25
The variable portion for this T cell, it connects to this
17:33
part of the virus plus the MHC II, but it's really reacting
17:38
to the same virus.
17:39
It might be a different part.
17:40
This little part that was cut off might be someplace inside
17:43
the virus while the epitope for the B cell might be some
17:47
place on the outside of the virus, but they're both
17:50
specific to the same virus.
17:53
Now once this guy gets activated and he starts
17:56
producing memory and effector cells-- or they're descended
17:59
from him, one of those effector cells specific to
18:02
this virus are needed to come bind to this guy.
18:06
So then this guy could then go along and bump around and
18:09
eventually end up here.
18:11
And he is also specific to this virus.
18:14
So this binding site right here is the same as this
18:16
binding site.
18:17
This combination of antigen plus MHC II.
18:21
And so when this guy binds-- and remember, this binding
18:29
site is the same as this and it only binds to this
18:31
combination right here-- this is what activates the B cell
18:36
in most cases.
18:37
This is T-dependent activation, which
18:41
is usually the case.
18:42
Sometimes all you need is this first thing, but in general
18:45
you need the first thing and then you also need a T cell to
18:48
come and activate it, and only then will the B cell get
18:52
activated and start proliferating and dividing and
18:55
differentiating itself and producing-- when its effector
18:58
cells will produce a lot of antibodies.
19:00
And so there's a natural question.
19:01
Why do biological systems-- or why do we
19:04
have this double system?
19:05
And at least my sense of it is, it's a failsafe mechanism.
19:10
If every time a virus came and attached this, this guy just
19:13
started going crazy and producing antibodies against
19:15
this thing, there's some chance that maybe after
19:20
development, this chain right here or his genes for
19:26
generating these chains become specific, not for foreign
19:30
pathogens, but maybe they become specific for self
19:35
molecules, molecules that are naturally
19:37
produced within the body.
19:38
It's just a random mutation, but if he started going crazy
19:40
for that, his antibodies will start attacking molecules that
19:45
are naturally in the body and then that could really hurt.
19:47
That what causes autoimmune diseases, where your own
19:51
immune cells start activating yourself.
19:53
But if you have this double handshake system where this
19:55
has to happen and this has to happen, the likelihood of both
19:59
of these guys after they leave their development stage
20:03
becoming specific to a self protein or a self cell or a
20:09
self molecule is very unlikely.
20:12
So it kind of inhibits this guy from going wild, even if
20:15
he has some type of a mutation.
20:17
Anyway, hopefully that explains a little bit of what
20:19
helper T cells do.
20:20
We'll talk a lot more about it.
20:22
I know it can be a little bit confusing.
20:23
In the next video, we'll talk about cytotoxic T cells.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,uwMYpTYsNZM,
khan_video_i-NNWI8Ccas_47047,Why is the universe mostly made of hydrogen?,MCQ,"•
0:00
Let's imagine we have a huge cloud
0:02
of hydrogen atoms floating in space.
0:05
Huge, and when I say huge cloud, huge both in distance
0:08
and in mass.
0:09
If you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,
0:11
it would just be this really, really massive thing.
0:15
So you have this huge cloud.
0:16
Well, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually
0:20
attracted to each other.
0:21
It's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.
0:25
But it would slowly affect these atoms.
0:27
And they would slowly draw close to each other.
0:30
It would slowly condense.
0:31
They'd slowly move towards the center
0:34
of mass of all of the atoms.
0:37
They'd slowly move in.
0:39
So if we fast forward, this cloud's
0:42
going to get denser and denser.
0:46
And the hydrogen atoms are going to start
0:48
bumping into each other and rubbing up against each other
0:51
and interacting with each other.
0:53
And so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.
0:56
Now remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.
0:58
So the temperature is going up.
1:03
And it'll-- they'll keep condensing.
1:05
They'll just keep condensing and condensing
1:07
until something really interesting happens.
1:09
So let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here
1:12
in the center.
1:16
And there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.
1:19
It's really dense.
1:20
I could never draw the actual number of atoms here.
1:22
This is really to give you an idea.
1:24
There's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,
1:28
from everything that wants to get
1:29
to that center of mass of our entire cloud.
1:32
The temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.
1:38
And at that point, something neat happens.
1:40
And to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,
1:43
let's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.
1:46
A hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just
1:48
going to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.
1:49
So the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.
1:50
If you want to think about a hydrogen atom,
1:52
it also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.
1:57
And let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.
1:59
And obviously this distance isn't to scale.
2:02
This distance is also not to scale.
2:04
Atoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms
2:05
are actually much, much, much, much smaller
2:07
than the actual radius of an atom.
2:10
And so is the electron.
2:11
But anyway, this just gives you an idea.
2:13
So we know from the Coulomb forces,
2:14
from electromagnetic forces, that these two positively
2:17
charged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere
2:20
near each other.
2:22
But we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four
2:25
forces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,
2:28
that if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures
2:31
and huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close
2:35
enough to each other, then all of a sudden,
2:37
the strong force will overtake.
2:39
It's much stronger than the Coulomb force.
2:41
And then these two hydrogens will actually--
2:43
these nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?
2:48
Well, anyway, they would actually fuse together.
2:50
And so that is what actually happens
2:53
once this gets hot and dense enough.
2:57
You now have enough pressure and enough temperature
2:59
to overcome the Coulomb force and bring
3:02
these protons close enough to each other for fusion
3:05
to occur, for fusion ignition.
3:12
And the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.
3:14
It's not ignition.
3:15
It's not combustion in the traditional sense.
3:16
It's not like you're burning a carbon molecule
3:20
in the presence of oxygen.
3:22
It's not combustion.
3:23
It's ignition.
3:24
And the reason why it's called ignition
3:25
is because when two of these protons,
3:27
or two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus
3:32
has a slightly smaller mass.
3:35
And so in the first stage of this,
3:36
you actually have two protons under enough pressure--
3:42
obviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--
3:44
with enough pressure they get close enough.
3:46
And then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.
3:51
One of these guys degrades into a neutron.
3:56
And the resulting mass of the combined protons
3:59
is lower than the mass of each of the original.
4:01
By a little bit, but that little bit of mass
4:04
results in a lot of energy-- plus energy.
4:11
And this energy is why we call it ignition.
4:13
And so what this energy does is it provides
4:16
a little bit of outward pressure,
4:17
so that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.
4:21
So once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.
4:24
And then that energy provides outward pressure
4:26
to balance what is now a star.
4:30
So now we are at where we actually
4:32
have the ignition at the center.
4:35
We have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying
4:39
to get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.
4:43
Now, what is the hydrogen being fused into?
4:46
Well, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just
4:50
kind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens
4:54
in stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.
5:00
I have trouble spelling.
5:01
Which is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.
5:03
This is still hydrogen because it
5:04
has one proton and one neutron now.
5:07
It is not helium yet.
5:08
This does not have two-- it does not have two protons.
5:12
But then the deuterium keeps fusing.
5:14
And then we eventually end up with helium.
5:19
And we can even see that on the periodic table.
5:21
Oh, I lost my periodic table.
5:22
Well, I'll show you the next video.
5:23
But we know hydrogen in its atomic state
5:30
has an atomic number of 1.
5:32
And it also has a mass of 1.
5:34
It only has one nucleon in its nucleus.
5:38
But it's being fused.
5:39
It goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,
5:42
which is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.
5:46
And then that eventually gets fused--
5:48
and I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--
5:50
into helium.
5:51
And by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.
5:56
So it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,
5:58
in particular, that isotope of helium--
6:00
it has an atomic mass of 4.
6:03
And this process releases a ton of energy.
6:06
Because the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced
6:09
is slightly lower than four times the atomic mass
6:15
of each of the constituent hydrogens.
6:17
So all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it
6:21
needs super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--
6:24
keeps the star from collapsing.
6:28
And once a star is in this stage,
6:31
once it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen
6:35
in its core, where the pressure and the temperature
6:37
is the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.
6:41
This is now a main sequence star.
6:48
And that's actually where the sun is right now.
6:50
Now there's questions of, well, what if there just
6:53
wasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?
6:56
And there actually are things that
6:57
never get to quite that threshold
6:59
to fuse all the way into helium.
7:00
There are a few things that don't quite
7:02
make the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.
7:05
So they are generating some of their heat.
7:06
Or there are even smaller objects
7:08
that just get to the point there's
7:10
a huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually
7:13
occurring inside of the core.
7:15
And something like Jupiter would be an example.
7:17
And you could go several masses above Jupiter
7:20
where you get something like that.
7:21
So you have to reach a certain threshold
7:23
where the mass, where the pressure and the temperature
7:25
due to the heavy mass, get so large that you
7:27
start this fusion.
7:28
And-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,
7:31
the slower the fusion will occur.
7:33
But if you're super massive, the fusion
7:35
will occur really, really fast.
7:37
So that's the general idea of just how stars get formed
7:40
and why they don't collapse on themselves
7:43
and why they are these kind of balls
7:45
of fusion reactions existing in the universe.
7:48
In the next few videos, we'll talk
7:50
about what happens once that hydrogen fuel in the core

Male: Hello and welcome to the wonderful world
0:03
of fungi or [funji]; both are acceptable pronunciations,
0:08
but I say fungi because it's fungus, not [funjus],
0:11
though [funjus] is also fun to say.
0:14
Fungi are a little bit like plants
0:15
and more like animals than you might think.
0:17
They diverged from protists about a billion years ago
0:20
and today scientists estimate that there are
0:22
about 1.5 million species of fungi on the earth,
0:26
though in a formal taxonomic way,
0:28
we only know about 100,000 or so of them,
0:30
and those that we have met are wonderful, weird
0:33
and in some cases, deadly.
0:35
The fact is, death is pretty much what fungi are all about.
0:38
Sure, there are the fun fungi,
0:40
like the single-celled saccharomyces,
0:42
also known as yeast.
0:43
Without them we wouldn't have beer or wine or bread.
0:46
It's also true that fungi are responsible
0:48
for all kinds of diseases from athlete's foot
0:50
to potentially deadly histoplasmosis,
0:53
AKA Spelunker's Lung caused by fungus
0:56
found in bird and bat droppings.
0:57
Fungi can even make people crazy.
0:59
When the fungus Claviceps purpurea
1:01
grows on grains used to make bread or beer,
1:03
it causes gangrene, nervous spasms, burning sensations,
1:07
hallucinations and temporary insanity.
1:10
Once compound in this fungus, lysergic acid,
1:12
is the raw material used to make LSD.
1:14
Finally, there's the destruction that some
1:16
fungi bring onto other animals.
1:18
More than 6 million bats in North America
1:20
have died since just 2007 due to a fungal disease
1:23
called White Nose Syndrome,
1:25
and a fungus has been implicated in several
1:26
extinctions of amphibians and threatens many more,
1:29
perhaps as many as 1/3 of all amphibians on earth.
1:32
But none of this is what I mean
1:33
when I talk about fungi and death.
1:36
While some members of the fungus family are total bummers,
1:38
all of them together perform perhaps the most vital function
1:41
in the global food web.
1:43
They feast on the deceased remains
1:45
of almost all organisms on the planet.
1:48
By doing that, they convert the organic matter
1:50
that we're all made of back into soil
1:53
from which new life will spring.
1:55
So fungi, they thrive on death
1:57
and in the process make all life possible.
1:59
(bopppy music)
2:09
Aha! You didn't expect to see me in the chair so soon,
2:11
but before we go any deeper into the kingdom fungi,
2:14
I wanted to make a toast to Louis Pasteur
2:17
in the form of a Biolo-graphy.
2:19
(1920's music)
2:24
By Pasteur's time, beer had been brewed
2:26
for thousands of years in cultures all over the world.
2:29
Some experts think it may have been
2:31
the very reason that our hunter-gatherer ancestors
2:34
started farming and cobbled together
2:36
civilization in the first place.
2:37
For all those millennia, no one understood
2:39
how its most important ingredient worked.
2:42
Until brewers could actually see what yeast were doing,
2:45
the magic of fermentation was essentially ""magic.""
2:49
Pasteur himself was never a big beer drinker,
2:51
but part of his academic duties in France
2:54
required him to help find solutions to problems
2:56
for the local alcohol industry.
2:58
As part of this work in 1857, he began
3:01
studying yeast under a microscope
3:04
and discovered that they were, in fact, living organisms.
3:07
In a series of experiments on the new-found creatures,
3:09
he found that in the absence of free oxygen
3:12
yeast were able to obtain energy
3:15
by decomposing substances that contained oxygen.
3:18
We now know that Pasteur was observing yeast
3:20
undergoing the process of anaerobic respiration,
3:22
AKA fermentation; breaking down the sugars in grains
3:26
like malted barley and converting them
3:29
into alcohol, carbon dioxide,
3:30
and the range of flavors that we associate with beer.
3:34
Along the way, Pasteur also discovered that beer
3:36
was often contaminated by other bacteria and fungi.
3:38
The growth of these beer-spoiling microbes, he found,
3:41
could be thwarted for up to 90 days
3:43
by keeping the beer between 55 and 60 degrees Celcius
3:46
for a short period of time.
3:47
Today, we call that heating process pasteurization
3:51
and it's used in everything from milk
3:53
to canned foods to syrups to wines.
3:56
For our purposes, the thing to hold onto here is
3:58
Pasteur discovered that yeast decomposed sugars to get energy.
4:02
It turns out most fungi spend most of their time
4:05
decomposing all kinds of organic matter.
4:07
Often the matter is dead when fungi get to it,
4:10
but not always.
4:11
When a tree or a person or a deer keels over,
4:14
fungi move in and start the work of decomposition.
4:16
Same goes for that orange you forgot
4:18
at the bottom of the fruit bowl.
4:19
If it weren't for this fungal function,
4:21
plants and the animals that eat them couldn't exist
4:23
because the elements that they take from the soil
4:26
would never return.
4:27
Thankfully, the decomposition performed by fungi
4:29
recycles the nutrients for the enjoyment
4:31
of plants and animals, as well as for other fungi.
4:34
All of this points to one of the main traits
4:35
that all fungi have in common.
4:37
From single-celled yeast to giant multi-cellular mushrooms,
4:40
fungi, like us, are heterotrophs, but instead of eating,
4:44
they absorb nutrition from their surroundings.
4:47
They do this mostly be secreting powerful enzymes
4:49
that break down complex molecules into
4:50
smaller organic compounds, which they use
4:53
to feed, grow and reproduce.
4:55
Most multi-cellular fungi contain networks
4:57
of tiny tubular filaments called hyphae,
4:59
then grow through and within whatever they're feasting on.
5:02
Unlike plant cell walls, which are made of cellulose,
5:04
the cell walls of fungi are strengthened
5:06
by the nitrogenous carbohydrate, chitin,
5:08
the same material found in the exoskeletons
5:10
of insects, spiders and other arthropods.
5:12
The interwoven mass of hyphae
5:14
that grows into the food source is called they mycelium.
5:16
It's structured to maximize its surface area,
5:19
which as we've learned in both plants and animals,
5:21
is the name of the game when it comes to absorbing stuff.
5:23
Mycelia are so densely packed that one cubic centimeter
5:26
of rich soil can contain enough hyphae
5:29
to stretch out one kilometer if you laid them end-to-end.
5:32
As hyphae secrete the digestive enzymes,
5:34
fungi use the food to synthesize more proteins
5:37
and the hyphae continued to grow, allowing the fungi
5:39
to conquer new territory and grow even more.
5:42
As a result, fungi can get crazy big; record-holding big.
5:46
A single honey mushroom in the Blue Mountains of Oregon
5:49
is thought to occupy some 2,386 acres.
5:53
By area, the largest organism on the planet.
5:56
There all kinds of crazy ways that fungi are classified,
5:58
but probably the easiest and most useful
5:59
is organizing them by how they interact with other organisms.
6:02
The straight up decomposers that break down dead stuff,
6:05
the mutualists which form beneficial relationships
6:07
with other organisms, especially plants,
6:09
and then there are the predators and the parasites.
6:12
Decomposer fungi secrete enzymes that break down
6:15
and absorb nutrients from non-living organic material
6:17
such as that tree that nobody heard fall in the forest.
6:20
In fact, the ability of fungi to break down lignin,
6:22
which is like what makes wood woody,
6:24
and break it into glucose and other simple sugars,
6:26
is crucial for this cycle of life.
6:28
They're pretty much the only organism that can do that.
6:30
They can even decompose proteins
6:32
into component amino acids.
6:33
Basically all the black bits in the soil
6:36
in your backyard are tiny fragments
6:38
of former plants digested by fungi.
6:40
Mutualist fungi are a smaller group.
6:42
Many have specialized hyphae called haustoria
6:44
that tangle themselves with plant roots
6:46
for the benefit of both organisms.
6:47
These guys help plants absorb nutrients,
6:49
especially phosphates,
6:51
by breaking them down more efficiently
6:52
than the roots can themselves.
6:54
In turn, the fungi send out their hyphae
6:56
into the plant's root tissue
6:57
and withdraws like a finder's fee, basically,
7:00
in the form of energy-rich sugars.
7:01
These mutualistic relationships
7:03
are known as mycorrhizae, from the Greek words
7:05
mykos, or fungus, and rhiza, or root.
7:08
Mycorrhizae are enormously important
7:10
in natural ecosystems, as well as in agriculture.
7:12
Almost all vascular plants, in fact,
7:14
have fungi attached to their roots
7:16
and rely on them for essential nutrients.
7:18
Growers of barley, the main ingredient in beer,
7:20
will even inoculate barley seed beds
7:22
with specific mycorrhizal fungi to help promote growth.
7:25
Other fungi aren't nearly so kind to their hosts.
7:27
Predatory fungi actively capture prey with their hyphae.
7:31
The soil fungus arthrobotrys uses
7:32
modified hoops on its filaments
7:34
to snare nematodes and absorb their inner tissue.
7:37
Then there are the parasites,
7:38
those fungi that feed on living organisms
7:40
without killing them, at least for a while.
7:42
Take one of my personal favorites,
7:44
the zombie ant fungus, or ophiocordyceps.
7:46
It shoots spores into an ant
7:48
where their hyphae grow into its body
7:50
and absorb nutrients from nonessential ant organs.
7:53
When the fungus is ready to reproduce,
7:55
it invades the ant's brain
7:56
and directs it to march to a cool, moist location
7:59
in the forest where it's so-called fruiting spores
8:02
erupt through the ant's head to spread even more spores.
8:06
Just to prove that even fungi have superheroes,
8:08
in 2012 scientists discovered
8:11
that these zombie spores have themselves
8:13
been targeted by another parasitic fungus.
8:16
Not a lot is known about this ant-saving fungus,
8:18
other than it sterilizes many of the zombie spores
8:21
through a process likened to chemical castration.
8:24
That is so messed up!
8:25
Weird!
8:26
All right now, since I brought that up
8:28
we should talk briefly about fungus sex.
8:29
Fungi reproduce any way they can,
8:32
either sexually or asexually.
8:34
Some species even do it both ways.
8:36
Whichever way they choose, most propagate themselves
8:38
by producing enormous numbers of spores,
8:41
much like we saw in non-vascular plants
8:43
and the simplest vascular plants, the ferns.
8:46
But, and this a big but, sexual reproduction
8:48
in fungi isn't like sex in any other organism
8:51
we've studied so far.
8:52
The concepts of male and female don't apply here at all.
8:56
Some fungi reproduce on their own,
8:58
others can reproduce with any other
9:00
individual that happens to be around,
9:02
and still others can only mate
9:04
with a member of a different so-called ""mating type.""
9:06
They're not different sexes,
9:08
they just have different molecular mechanisms
9:10
that either make them compatible or not.
9:12
Sometimes these types are called plus and minus,
9:14
and other times one and two.
9:16
In any case, it's still considered sexual reproduction
9:18
because each parent contributes genetic information
9:20
when they make with the spore-making.
9:22
It all starts with this beautiful chemical mating dance.
9:25
The mycelium from one fungus sends out pheromones
9:28
that are picked up and bound to receptors
9:30
by another willing and able partner.
9:32
This binding compels each mycelium
9:34
to send its hyphae toward the other.
9:36
When they meet, they fuse the cytoplasm of their cells;
9:39
the stage of reproduction called plasmogamy.
9:41
Sometime between hours and centuries later,
9:43
yes, it can literally take hundreds of years
9:46
for fungi to have sex,
9:47
this union leads to the production of spores
9:50
that each fungus is then able to disperse.
9:53
Certain types of fungi, including the tasty morel,
9:55
produce spores in a sac-like asci
9:57
contained in fruiting bodies known as ascocarps.
10:00
That is that part that you pick
10:01
when you're wandering through the forest.
10:03
Some fungi shoot their spores off into the breeze,
10:04
other spores float away on the water.
10:07
More enterprising spores will hitch a ride
10:09
on passing critters,
10:10
hopefully, to be dropped off somewhere
10:12
where there's plenty of nutrients to absorb
10:13
so they, too, can grow, send out sexual pheromones
10:16
when their time comes,
10:18
and let their hyphae do the tango.
10:20
Finally, for some fungi sexual reproduction
10:22
just isn't all it's cracked up to be.
10:24
They'd rather just get on with it themselves.
10:26
Some of these grow filamented structures
10:28
that produce spores by mitosis.
10:30
These structures are visible and they're called molds.
10:33
This stuff on the orange in the bottom of the fruit bowl
10:35
or on the heel of the piece of bread
10:37
that you left for a roommate
10:38
who decided to leave it for the other roommate
10:40
who thought that you'd rather have it.
10:41
In the unicellular yeast, the asexual reproduction
10:44
occurs by old fashioned cell division
10:46
or the formation of buds that get pinched off
10:48
into separate organisms.
10:49
Since some species of yeast,
10:51
like our beer-making friend Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
10:53
convert sugars into alcohol, brewers create conditions
10:56
that encourage high rates of yeast production,
10:59
like giving them lots of sugar and oxygen
11:01
since more yeast means more alcohol.
11:03
So, yeah, fungi.
11:04
They feast on death and they can make us go insane
11:06
and turn ants into unholy zombies of the night,
11:09

0:21
And above that I had a vacuum.
0:22
So essentially there's some force per area, or pressure,
0:26
being applied by the bumps of the
0:27
particles into this piston.
0:30
And if this weight wasn't here-- let's assume that the
0:32
piston itself or this movable ceiling itself, it has no
0:35
mass-- if that weight wasn't there it would just be pushed
0:38
indefinitely far, because there'd be no pressure from
0:41
the vacuum.
0:41
But this weight is applying some force on
0:44
that same area downwards.
0:45
So we're at some equilibrium point, some stability.
0:49
And we plotted that on this PV diagram right here.
0:53
I'll do it in magenta.
0:55
So that's our state 1 that we were in right there.
1:00
And then what I did in the last video, I just blew away
1:03
half of this block.
1:04
And as soon as I blew away half of this block, obviously
1:07
the force that's being applied by the block will immediately
1:10
go down by half, and so the gas will push up on it.
1:13
And it happened so fast that, al of a sudden the gas is
1:16
pushing up.
1:17
Right when it happens, the gas near the top of the canister
1:20
is going to have lower pressure, because it has less
1:23
pushing up against it.
1:24
The molecules that are down here don't even know that I
1:27
blew away this block yet.
1:29
It's going to take some time.
1:30
And essentially the gas is going to push it up, and then
1:33
maybe it'll oscillate down, and then push it up, and
1:35
oscillate down a little bit.
1:37
It'll take some time eventually until we get to
1:39
another equilibrium state, where we have a new, probably,
1:43
or definitely lower pressure.
1:45
We definitely have a higher volume.
1:49
I won't talk too much about it yet, but we probably have a
1:51
lower temperature as well.
1:52
And this is our new state.
1:56
And our macrostate's pressure and volume are defined once
2:00
we're at the new equilibrium, so we're right here.
2:03
So my question in the last video was,
2:05
how did we get here?
2:06
Is there any way to have defined a path to get from our
2:09
first state-- where pressure and volume were well defined,
2:13
because the system wasn't thermodynamic equilibrium-- to
2:17
get to our second state?
2:19
And the answer was no.
2:21
Because between this state and this state
2:24
all hell broke loose.
2:25
I had different temperatures at different
2:27
points in the system.
2:31
I could have had a different pressure here
2:33
than I had up here.
2:35
The volume might have been fluctuating
2:36
from moment to moment.
2:38
So when you're outside of equilibrium-- and I had
2:40
written it down over there-- you cannot define, or you
2:44
can't say that those macro variables are well defined.
2:48
So there was no path that you could say how we got from--
2:52
erase this-- how we got from state 1 to state 2.
2:57
You could just say, OK, we were in some type of
2:59
equilibrium.
3:00
So we were in state 1.
3:01
Then I blew away half the rock.
3:03
The pressure went down, the volume went up.
3:06
The temperature also probably went down.
3:08
And so I ended up in this other state once I reached
3:11
equilibrium.
3:12
And that's all fair and good, but wouldn't it have been nice
3:15
if there was some way?
3:16
If we could have said, look, you know, there's some way
3:18
that we got from this point to this point?
3:21
If we could perform my little rock experiment in a slightly
3:25
different manner, so that all this hell didn't break loose,
3:27
so that maybe at every point in between my macro variables
3:32
are actually defined?
3:33
So how could I do that?
3:34
Remember, I said that the macro variables, the
3:37
macrostates, whether it's pressure, temperature, volume,
3:40
and there are others, but I said these are only defined
3:42
when we are in a thermodynamic equilibrium.
3:46
And that just means that things have reached a
3:48
stability point.
3:49
That, for example, the temperature is consistent
3:52
throughout the system.
3:53
If it's not consistent throughout the system, I
3:55
shouldn't be talking about it.
3:56
If the temperature is different here than it is up
3:59
here, I shouldn't say that the temperature of
4:01
the system is x.
4:02
It's different at different points.
4:03
I really can't make a well-defined statement about
4:06
temperature, similar for pressure or for volume,
4:10
because the volume is also fluctuating.
4:12
But what if I perform that same experiment?
4:15
That same process, I should call it.
4:18
Let me draw it again.
4:20
So I have my canister.
4:23
And instead of starting with a rock, just one big rock-- let
4:27
me draw, this is my piston right here, at the top of the
4:31
movable ceiling of the cylinder.
4:33
And I have some gas inside of it.
4:37
Instead of having just one big rock like I had over here, how
4:42
about I start with an equal weight of rock?
4:44
But let's say I have a bunch of small pebbles that add up
4:48
to that same rock.
4:49
So just a bunch of, well, you know, just a pile of pebbles.
4:54
You know, maybe they're sand.
4:55
They're super duper small.
5:01
Instead of just blowing away half of the sand all at once,
5:05
like I did with that rock over there, and immediately jumping
5:08
to that state and throwing the whole system into this
5:11
undefined state of non-equilibrium.
5:14
Instead of doing that, let me just do things very slowly and
5:16
very gently.
5:17
Let me just take out one grain of sand at a time.
5:21
So if I just take out one grain of sand.
5:27
And so I took out an
5:28
infinitesimal amount of weight.
5:30
So what's going to happen?
5:31
Well this piston's going to move up a little bit.
5:33
And let me draw that.
5:35
So let me copy and paste it.
5:42
So I just took out one little piece of sand.
5:45
The force pushing down will be a little bit less.
5:47
The pressure pushing down will be a little less.
5:49
And so my piston-- let me see if I can draw this-- it will
5:54
have moved up-- let me erase it-- it will have moved up a
5:59
very infinitesimal-- infinitesimal means an
6:02
infinitely small amount-- it would have moved an infinitely
6:08
small amount of time.
6:10
And so you wouldn't have thrown that system into this,
6:12
you know, havoc that I did this last time.
6:15
Of course, we haven't moved all the way here yet.
6:17
But what we have done is, we would have moved from that
6:19
point maybe to this other point right here that's just a
6:24
little bit closer to there.
6:26
I've just removed a little bit of the weight.
6:29
So my pressure went down just a little bit.
6:31
And my volume went up a just a little bit.
6:32
Temperature probably went down.
6:34
And the key here is I'm trying to do it in such small
6:37
increments that as I do it, my system is pretty much super
6:43
close to equilibrium.
6:46
I'm just doing it just slow enough that at every step it
6:49
achieves equilibrium almost immediately.
6:51
Or it's almost in equilibrium the whole time I'm doing it.
6:54
And then I do it again, and do it again.
6:57
And I'll just draw my drawings a little less neat, just for
7:00
the sake of time.
7:02
Let's say I remove another little dot of sand that's
7:06
infinitely small mass.
7:09
And now my little piston will move just a little bit higher.
7:14
And I have, remember I have one less sand up here than I
7:17
had over here.
7:19
And then my volume in my gas increases a little bit.
7:23
My pressure goes down a little bit.
7:24
And I've moved to this point here.
7:27
What I'm doing here is I'm setting up what's called a
7:30
quasi-static process.
7:39
And the reason why it's called that is
7:40
because it's almost static.
7:42
It's almost in equilibrium the whole time.
7:45
Every time I move a grain of sand I'm just moving a little
7:48
bit closer.
7:49
And obviously even a grain of sand, the reality is if I were
7:52
to do this in real life, even a grain of sand on a small
7:55
scale is going to reek a little bit
7:56
of havoc on my system.
7:58
This piston is going to go up a little bit.
8:00
So say, let me just do even a smaller grain of sand, and do
8:03
it even a little bit slower so that I'm always in
8:05
equilibrium.
8:06
So you can imagine this is kind of a theoretical thing.
8:08
If I did an infinitely small grains of sand, and did it
8:11
just slow enough so that it's just gently moved from this
8:15
point to this point.
8:16
But we like to think of it theoretically, because it
8:19
allows us to describe a path.
8:21
Because remember, why am I being so careful here?
8:23
Why am I so careful to make sure that the state, the
8:26
system is in equilibrium the whole time when I get from
8:29
there to there?
8:31
Because our macrostates, our macro variables like pressure,
8:35
volume, and temperature, our only defined when we're in
8:38
equilibrium.
8:39
So if I do this process super slowly, in super small
8:42
increments, it allows me to keep my pressure and volume
8:46
and actually my temperature of macrostates at
8:49
any point in time.
8:50
So I could actually plot a path.
8:51
So if I keep doing it small, small, small, I could actually
8:53
plot a path to say, how did I get from state 1 to state 2 on
8:59
this on this PV diagram.
9:01
And you might say, hey, you know, Sal, this is all-- And
9:05
I'll take a little step back here.
9:06
I always found this really confusing.
9:08
You know, you'll see a lot of talk in thermodynamic circles,
9:13
or even in your book about-- it has to be a quasi-static
9:15
process, and I always used to wonder, why are people going
9:18
through these pains to describe this process where
9:20
you're removing sand after sand?
9:22
And the whole point is because you want to get as close to
9:25
equilibrium the whole time you're doing it as possible so
9:27
that your pressure and volume are defined the whole time.
9:31
The reality is, in the real world you can never get
9:33
something that's continuously defined, but you can just do
9:36
really, really, really small increments.
9:39
So that at each small increment you're at some
9:41
equilibrium.
9:42
And if you're not happy with that, you can do even smaller
9:44
increments.
9:44
So at some point, at some limiting point, you do have
9:47
some type of continuous state change, while you're always in
9:51
equilibrium.
9:52
It's almost an oxymoron, because you're saying you're
9:55
static, you're saying that you're in equilibrium the
9:59
whole time, but clearly you're also changing the whole time.
10:02
You keep removing little pieces of sand.
10:05
But you're moving them just slowly enough that all that
10:07
crazy up and down motion, and all of the flux, and all of
10:11
the weird temperature changes don't happen.
10:13
And it just, you know, just that it slowly, slowly,
10:16
slowly creeps up.
10:18
The reason why I'm even going through this exercise is
10:21
because it's key when we start talking about thermodynamics
10:24
and these PV diagrams, and we'll start talking about
10:27
carnot engines and all of that, that we be able to at
10:30
least theoretically describe the path that we take on this
10:34
PV diagram.
10:35
And we wouldn't have been able to do that if we can't assume
10:37
that we're dealing with a quasi-static process.
10:41
Now there's another term that you'll hear in thermodynamic
10:45
circles that really, I mean, to me it really, I don't know,
10:48
I had trouble comprehending it the first time I heard it,
10:50
called reversible.
10:54
And sometimes these terms quasi-static and reversible
10:57
are used interchangeably, but there is a difference.
11:03
Reversible processes are quasi-static, and most
11:06
quasi-static processes are reversible, but there are a
11:08
few special cases that aren't.
11:10
But the idea of a reversible process is something that
11:12
happens so slowly.
11:14
So in this example I took off a grain of sand and I got to
11:17
the state, but if I assume that no friction when, you
11:20
know, when this piston moved up a little bit, in the real
11:23
world, let's say if this piston was metal, when this
11:27
rubs against the canister, there'd be a little bit of
11:29
friction generated and a little bit of energy would be
11:32
dissipated as friction or heat.
11:33
But in a reversible process, we're assuming that, look,
11:36
this is frictionless.
11:37
When anything happens in the system, when we go from this
11:40
state right here-- let's say this the state a,
11:42
this is state b.
11:43
So this is state a, this is state b.
11:46
When we go from this state to this state, one, we're
11:48
infinitesimally close to equilibrium the whole time, so
11:51
all of our macrostates are well defined.
11:54
And even more, when we move from one state to the other,
11:57
there's no loss or dissipation of energy.
11:59
So those are two important characteristics.
12:03
One, infinitely close to equilibrium at all times, and
12:06
no loss of energy.
12:07
And the reason why that matters for a reversible
12:10
process is because if we wanted, if we were sitting in
12:13
state b, we could just add another grain of sand back in,
12:18
push down this piston infinitely slowly, at an
12:22
infinitely small increment, and get back to state a.
12:26
So that's why it's called reversible.
12:27
You could be at this point right here, and take out a
12:32
little bit of sand, and get to this point right here.
12:34
But if you want, since no energy was lost, you could add
12:37
a little bit of sand, and get back to this point right here.
12:40
Now the reality in the real world is, there is no such
12:44
thing as a perfectly reversible process.
12:46
There will always be, whenever you do anything, there will
12:48
always be some energy or heat lost to the process.
12:54
In the real world, if I moved down here, if I tried to put
12:58
the sand back I would lose some energy and probably get
13:00
to a little slightly different point.
13:02
But you don't have to worry about that.
13:03
The important takeaway from this video is that, in the
13:07
situation I described there, there was no intermediate
13:11
macrostate variables, because our system was in flux, it
13:14
wasn't in equilibrium.
13:16
So if we wanted to get intermediate states, we just
13:18
have to essentially do this process slower.
13:21
And so slow, I mean, it theoretically would take you
13:24
forever, so we can only approximate it.
13:26
But the sand gives you an idea of what we're talking about.
13:29
And if we did it slowly with these infinitesimally small
13:32
particles of sand, then we can define the state at every
13:35
point along the process.
13:39
And that's why we call it quasi-static, because at any
13:41
point it's almost static.
13:43
It's almost in equilibrium.
13:44
So our pressures, volumes, and temperatures can be defined.
13:48
And if we add to that the notion that we haven't lost
13:51
any heat when we're going in one direction or another, we
13:55
could say it's reversible, because if we took a piece of
13:57
sand away, we can always add a little bit of sand next.
14:02
Now, actually, with that said, let me give you the one
14:04
example of maybe a quasi-static-- no, actually
14:07
I'll save that for future video.
14:08
Anyway, hopefully you understand that these are two
14:11
concepts that used to really confuse me, and hopefully this
14:14
clears it up a little bit.
14:15
And I think more than what it is, I think the first time I
14:18
read about them I'm like, OK, well what's the big deal?
14:20
The big deal is, it allows you to define your macrostates for
14:25
every state in between these two states
14:27
that you care about.

0:00
- [Instructor] Let's compare the structures
0:01
of ethane and ethene.
0:03
Ethane is an alkane with an A-N-E ending,
0:07
and it has the molecular formula C2H6.
0:13
Ethene is an alkene with an E-N-E ending,
0:17
and it has the molecular formula C2H4.
0:22
For two carbons,
0:23
six hydrogens is the maximum number that you can have,
0:26
so we say that ethane is completely saturated
0:30
with hydrogens.
0:32
If we look at ethene,
0:33
we only have four hydrogens for two carbons,
0:36
so we say that ethene is unsaturated.
0:40
So, for two carbons, it's possible to have more,
0:44
so this is unsaturated.
0:46
Next, let's look at the carbons present in both molecules.
0:50
We'll start with ethane.
0:52
This carbon is sp3 hybridized,
0:54
and so is this one,
0:55
so ethane contains two sp3 hybridized carbons.
1:01
And we know the geometry around sp3 hybridized carbon
1:05
is tetrahedral.
1:07
So we should have tetrahedral geometry
1:10
around both of these carbons.
1:13
For ethene,
1:14
let me use a different color here,
1:16
so this carbon and this carbon are both sp2 hybridized.
1:20
So sp2 hybridized carbons.
1:23
And we know the geometry around an sp2 hybridized carbon
1:27
is trigonal planar.
1:28
So, there's planar geometry around both of these carbons.
1:33
Finally, let's look at the bonding between the two carbons.
1:38
So, for ethane, this sigma bond between the two carbons
1:42
has some free rotation.
1:44
So different confirmations of the ethane molecule
1:47
are possible.
1:48
So we have free rotation.
1:50
Free rotation about the sigma bonds
1:53
between our two carbon atoms.
1:56
But for ethene, if we look at those two carbon atoms,
1:59
so this one and this one,
2:00
there's a double bond between those two carbons.
2:04
And we know that there's no free rotation
2:07
around a double bond.
2:08
So there's no free rotations.
2:12
You're not gonna get different confirmations for ethene,
2:17
so no free rotation, no confirmations.
2:20
That affects the structure of your alkenes.
2:24
On the left is ethane,
2:25
and if we look at our two sp3 hybridized carbons,
2:28
we can see the tetrahedral geometry around them.
2:31
And for the sigma bonds between those two carbons,
2:34
we know there's free rotation.
2:36
So here I am rotating the molecule
2:38
to show different confirmations of ethane.
2:41
For ethene, or ethylene, our two sp2 hybridized carbons
2:45
have planar geometry around them,
2:47
so if I rotate this molecule to the side here,
2:50
you can see that it is planar,
2:52
and there's no free rotation because of this double bond,
2:55
because of the presence of a pi bond.
2:57
So, here I am trying to rotate the model set
3:00
and you can see that the molecule does not rotate.
3:05
You can classify alkenes
3:06
according to their degrees of substitution.
3:09
If you take ethene, and you take a hydrogen off,
3:12
and you add-on an R group,
3:13
you now have a monosubstituted alkene.
3:17
So, on the right is an example of a monosubstituted alkene.
3:21
If I put in the hydrogens,
3:22
it might be a little bit more obvious.
3:24
We know that this carbon has two hydrogens
3:27
and we know that this carbon has one.
3:30
We have an alkyl group coming off of this carbon,
3:33
a methyl group,
3:34
and so this is an example of a monosubstituted alkene.
3:38
If I want to name this alkene,
3:40
we saw how to name them in an earlier video.
3:43
We would make this carbon one, this is carbon two,
3:46
and this is carbon three.
3:48
So, longest carbon chain, including our alkene,
3:51
and a three carbon alkene is called propene.
3:55
Let me write that down here.
3:57
So this is propene.
3:59
Next, let's look at a disubstituted alkene.
4:02
So now we're talking about two R groups.
4:05
Here I've put an R and R prime.
4:08
An R and R prime might be the same,
4:10
or they might be different.
4:12
Here, R and R prime are on the same carbon,
4:16
but it's possible to have a disubstituted alkene
4:18
where R and R prime are bonded to different carbons.
4:24
And then another example
4:25
of a disubstituted alkene on the right here,
4:28
so R and R prime are bonded to different carbons,
4:31
but notice a difference.
4:32
These two R groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.
4:36
So this and this one are on opposite sides,
4:38
whereas in this example, if I draw a line right here,
4:42
both R groups are on the same side of the double bond,
4:46
and we know that one of these
4:47
doesn't rotate to form the other,
4:49
because there's no free rotation around our double bond.
4:53
So here we have three examples of disubstituted alkenes.
4:57
Let's look at this one down here and let's name it.
5:00
So find our longest carbon chain
5:02
that includes our double bond,
5:04
and I wanna give the lowest number possible
5:06
to our double bond,
5:07
so we're gonna start right here at carbon one,
5:09
this is carbon two, and this is carbon three.
5:12
So three carbon alkene is called propene,
5:15
and we have a methyl group coming off carbon two,
5:19
so this would be 2-Methylpropene.
5:24
In terms of which type of disubstituted alkene this is,
5:27
let's go ahead and draw in our hydrogens
5:28
so it's a little bit easier to see.
5:30
So, for this carbon, there are two hydrogens bonded to it,
5:34
and then for the carbon on the left,
5:36
it has a methyl group and another methyl group.
5:39
So, two R groups that happen to be the same.
5:42
So that's this example of a disubstituted alkene,
5:44
where both of our R groups are bonded to one carbon.
5:50
Now let's look at a trisubstituted alkene.
5:53
So, we have three R groups.
5:55
R, R prime, and R double prime.
5:58
And again, R, R prime, and R double prime
6:00
might be the same, or they might be different.
6:03
So here's an example of a trisubstituted alkene.
6:07
Let me go ahead and draw in the hydrogen on this carbon,
6:11
so it's easier to see that we have three R groups
6:14
bonded to the double bonds.
6:17
If I want to name it,
6:19
I need to find the longest carbon chain
6:21
that includes my double bond,
6:23
so this would be carbon one,
6:24
this would be carbon two, three, four, and five.
6:28
So a five carbon alkene is called pentene,
6:32
so let me write that in here,
6:34
and our double bond starts at carbon two,
6:37
so this would be 2-Pentene.
6:39
And finally, I have a methyl group coming off of carbon two.
6:43
So, to complete the name, I need 2-Methyl,
6:46
so 2-Methyl-2-Pentene would be the name
6:50
for this trisubstituted alkene.
6:53
Next, let's look at a tetrasubstituted alkene.
6:56
So R, R prime, R double prime, and R triple prime.
6:59
This molecule is actually tetrasubstituted.
7:04
If we find our double bond,
7:05
so this carbon and this carbon, so this top carbon here,
7:09
actually, let's go ahead and name it first,
7:11
and then we'll look at why it's a tetrasubstituted alkene.
7:15
So this would be carbon one,
7:16
and then I have to follow my double bond for carbon two.
7:20
So, we have a cyclohexene derivative.
7:23
Again, we saw this in an earlier video,
7:25
so let me go ahead and write cyclohexene down here.
7:28
So, cyclohexene.
7:30
And we have a methyl group coming off carbon one,
7:33
and a methyl group coming off of carbon two.
7:36
So this would be 1,2-Dimethyl,
7:38
so 1,2-Dimethylcyclohexene would be the name.
7:44
And now, let's look at why it's tetrasubstituted.
7:46
So, let me use a different color here.
7:48
So, for carbon one,
7:50
I have one methyl group coming off on this side,
7:53
and then I have this alkyl group, as part of the ring,
7:56
coming off of that side.
7:58
So that carbon has two R groups bonded to it,
8:01
and carbon two also has two R groups bonded to it.
8:04
So, methyl group here, and again,
8:06
I have this portion of the rings.
8:08
So that's why this is a tetrasubstituted alkene.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,tlUOyF3mz-k,

0:00
Right now, the best estimate of when the Big Bang occurred--
0:05
and once again, I don't like the term that much because it
0:08
kind of implies some type of explosion.
0:10
But what it really is is kind of an expansion
0:12
of space, when space started to really start
0:14
to expand from a singularity.
0:16
But our best estimate of when this occurred
0:18
is 13.7 billion years ago.
0:24
And even though we're used to dealing with numbers
0:26
in the billions, especially when we
0:28
talk about large amounts of money and what not,
0:30
this is an unbelievable amount of time.
0:32
It seems like something that is tractable, but it really isn't.
0:35
And in future videos, I'm actually
0:37
going to talk about the time scale.
0:39
So we can really appreciate how long,
0:41
or even start to appreciate, or appreciate
0:43
that we can't appreciate how long 13.7 billion years is.
0:47
And I also want to emphasize that this is the current best
0:51
estimate.
0:52
Even in my lifetime, even in my lifetime that I actually
0:54
knew about the Big Bang and that I would pay attention
0:57
to what the best estimate was, this number's
0:59
been moving around.
1:00
So I suspect that in the future, this number
1:02
might become more accurate or might move around some.
1:04
But this is our best guess.
1:06
Now with that said, I want to think about what this tells us
1:08
about the size of the observable universe.
1:17
So if all of the expansion started 13.7 billion years ago,
1:22
that 13.7 billion years ago, everything
1:25
we know in our three-dimensional universe
1:28
was in a single point, the longest
1:31
that any photon of light could be traveling that's reaching us
1:34
right now-- so let's say that that is my eye right over here.
1:39
That's my eyelashes, just like that-- so some photon of light
1:45
is just to getting to my eye or maybe it's
1:47
just getting to the lens of a telescope.
1:50
The longest that that could have been traveling
1:52
is 13.7 billion years.
1:55
So it could be traveling 13.7 billion years.
2:07
So when we looked at that depiction--
2:09
this I think was two or three videos ago,
2:11
of the observable universe-- I drew, it was this circle.
2:18
And when we see light coming from these remote objects--
2:21
that light is getting to us right here.
2:23
This is where we are.
2:24
This is where I guess in the depiction
2:27
the remote object was.
2:28
But the light from that remote object
2:30
is just now getting to us.
2:32
And that light took 13.7 billion years to get to us.
2:43
Now, what I'm going to hesitate to do,
2:45
because we're talking over such large distances
2:48
and we're talking on such large time scales and time scales
2:51
over which space itself is expanding--
2:55
we're going to see in this video that you cannot say that this
2:59
object over here, this is not necessarily, this is NOT,
3:03
I'll put it in caps, this is NOT 13.7 billion light years away.
3:13
If we were talking about smaller time scales
3:15
or I guess smaller distances, you
3:18
could say approximately that.
3:20
The expansion of the universe itself would not make as much
3:23
of a difference.
3:24
And let me make it even more clear.
3:26
I'm talking about an object over there.
3:28
But we could even talk about that coordinate in space.
3:33
And actually, I should say that coordinate in space-time,
3:35
because we're viewing it at a certain instant as well.
3:37
But that coordinate is not 13.7 billion light years away
3:43
from our current coordinate.
3:44
And there's a couple of reasons to think about it.
3:46
First of all, think about it, that light
3:48
was emitted 13.7 billion years ago.
3:51
When that light was emitted, we were
3:53
much closer to that coordinate.
3:55
This coordinate was much closer to that.
3:57
Where we are in the universe right now
3:59
was much closer to that point in the universe.
4:01
The other thing to think about is
4:04
as this-- let me actually draw it.
4:06
So let's go 300,000 years after that initial expansion
4:16
of that singularity.
4:17
So we're just 300,000 years into the universe's history
4:21
right now.
4:22
So this is roughly 300,000 years into the universe's life.
4:30
I guess we could view it that way.
4:33
And first of all, at that point things haven't differentiated
4:37
in a meaningful way yet right now.
4:39
And we'll talk more about this when
4:40
we talk about the cosmic microwave background radiation.
4:43
But at this point in the universe,
4:45
it was kind of this almost uniform white-hot plasma
4:49
of hydrogen.
4:50
And then we're going to talk about it.
4:51
It was emitting microwave radiation.
4:53
And we'll talk more about that in a future video.
4:55
But let's just think about two points in this early universe.
5:01
So in this early universe, let's say you have that point.
5:03
And let's say you have the coordinate where we are right
5:05
now.
5:06
You have the coordinate where we are right now.
5:10
And in fact, I'll just make that roughly-- I won't make it
5:12
the center just because I think it makes it easier
5:14
to visualize if it's not the center.
5:15
And let's say at that very early stage in the universe,
5:19
if you were able to just take some rulers instantaneously
5:22
and measure that, you would measure this distance
5:26
to be 30 million light years.
5:36
And let's just say right at that point,
5:38
this object over here-- I'll do it in magenta--
5:40
this object over here emits a photon, maybe
5:43
in the microwave frequency range.
5:45
And we'll see that that was the range that it was emitting in.
5:48
But it emits a photon.
5:50
And that photon is traveling at the speed of light.
5:52
It is light.
5:53
And so that photon, says, you know what, I only
5:55
got 30 million light years to travel.
5:56
That's not too bad.
5:57
I'm going to get there in 30 million years.
6:00
And I'm going to do it discrete.
6:01
The math is more complicated than what I'm doing here.
6:04
But I really just want to give you
6:05
the idea of what's going on here.
6:07
So let's just say, well, that photon
6:09
says in about 10 million years, in roughly 10 million years,
6:13
I should be right about at that coordinate.
6:18
I should be about one third of the distance.
6:20
But what happens over the course of those 10 million years?
6:26
Well, over the course of those 10 million years,
6:28
the universe has expanded some.
6:30
The universe has expanded maybe a good deal.
6:32
So let me draw the expanded universe.
6:35
So after 10 million years, the universe might look like this.
6:40
Actually it might even be bigger than that.
6:42
Let me draw it like this.
6:44
After 10 million years, the universe
6:47
might have expanded a good bit.
6:49
So this is 10 million years into the future.
6:53
Still on a cosmological time scale, still almost at kind
6:58
of the infancy of the universe because we're
7:00
talking about 13.7 billion years.
7:02
So let's say 10 million years.
7:04
10 million years go by.
7:07
The universe has expanded.
7:09
This coordinate, where we're sitting today
7:10
at the present time, is now all the way over here.
7:15
That coordinate where the photon was originally emitted
7:19
is now going to be sitting right over here.
7:24
And that photon, it said, OK, after 10 million light years,
7:26
I'm going to get over there.
7:28
And I'm approximating.
7:29
I'm doing it in a very discrete way.
7:30
But I really just want to give you the idea.
7:32
So that coordinate, where the photon roughly
7:35
gets in 10 million light years, is about right over here.
7:38
The whole universe has expanded.
7:39
All the coordinates have gotten further away from each other.
7:42
Now, what just happened here?
7:44
The universe has expanded.
7:45
This distance that was 30 million light years now--
7:49
and I'm just making rough numbers here.
7:52
I don't know the actual numbers here.
7:53
Now, it is actually-- this is really just
7:55
for the sake of giving you the idea of why-- well, giving you
8:01
the intuition of what's going on.
8:03
This distance now is no longer 30 million light years.
8:08
Maybe it's 100 million.
8:10
So this is now 100 million light years away from each other.
8:16
The universe is expanding.
8:17
These coordinates, the space is actually spreading out.
8:20
You could imagine it's kind of a trampoline
8:22
or the surface of a balloon.
8:23
It's getting stretched thin.
8:25
And so this coordinate where the light happens
8:27
to be after 10 million years, it has
8:29
been traveling for 10 million years,
8:32
but it's gone a much larger distance.
8:37
That distance now might be on the order of-- maybe
8:40
it's on the order of 30 million light years.
8:42
And the math isn't exact here.
8:44
I haven't done the math to figure it out.
8:47
So it's done 30 million light years.
8:50
And actually I shouldn't even make it the same proportion.
8:53
Because the distance it's gone and the distance it has to go,
8:56
because of the stretching, it's not
8:58
going to be completely linear.
8:59
At least when I'm thinking about it in my head, it shouldn't be,
9:02
I think.
9:02
But I'm going to make a hard statement about that.
9:06
But the distance that it reversed, maybe this distance
9:10
right here is now 20 million light years
9:15
because it got there.
9:16
Every time it moved some distance, the space that it
9:20
had traversed is now stretched.
9:23
So even though its traveled for 10 million years,
9:27
the space that it traversed is no longer
9:29
just 10 million light years.
9:31
It's now stretched to 20 million light years.
9:34
And the space that it has left to traverse
9:35
is no longer only 20 million light years.
9:38
It might now be 80 million light years.
9:41
It is now 80 million light years.
9:44
And so this photon might be getting frustrated.
9:47
There's an optimistic way of viewing it.
9:48
It is like, wow, I was able to cover
9:50
20 million light years in only 10 million years.
9:53
It looks like I'm moving faster than the speed of light.
9:55
The reality is it's not because the space coordinates
9:58
themselves are spreading out.
10:00
Those are getting thin.
10:01
So the photon is just moving at the speed of light.
10:04
But the distance that it actually
10:05
traversed in 10 million years is more than 10 million
10:10
light years.
10:10
It's 20 million light years.
10:12
So you can't just multiply a rate times time
10:15
on these cosmological scales, especially when the coordinates
10:19
themselves, the distance coordinates are actually
10:23
moving away from each other.
10:24
But I think you see, or maybe you might see,
10:27
where this is going.
10:29
OK, this photon says, oh, in another-- let me write this.
10:33
This is 80 million light years-- in another 40 million
10:35
light years, maybe I'm going to get over here.
10:40
But the reality is over that next 40 million light years--
10:43
sorry, in 40 million years, I might get right over here,
10:47
because this is 80 million light years.
10:49
But the reality is after 40 million years--
10:52
so another 40 million years go by-- now, all of a sudden,
10:56
the universe has expanded even more.
10:59
I won't even draw the whole bubble.
11:01
But the place where the photon was emitted from
11:04
might be over here.
11:07
And now our current position is over here.
11:11
Where the light got after 10 million years is now over here.
11:18
And now, where the light is after 40 million years,
11:24
maybe it's over here.
11:27
So now this distance, the distance
11:29
between these two points, when we started,
11:32
it was 10 million light years.
11:33
Then it became 20 million light years.
11:36
Maybe now, it's on the order of-- I don't know-- maybe it's
11:39
a billion light years.
11:41
Maybe now it's a billion light years.
11:43
And maybe this distance over here-- and I'm
11:45
just making up these numbers.
11:46
In fact, that's probably be too big for that point-- maybe this
11:49
is now 100 million light years.
11:52
This is now 100 million light years.
11:55
And now, maybe this distance right
11:59
here is-- I don't know-- 500 million light years.
12:01
And maybe now the total distance between the two points
12:04
is a billion light years.
12:05
So as you can see, the photon might getting frustrated.
12:08
As it covers more and more distance,
12:10
it looks back and says, wow, in only 50 million years,
12:13
I've been able to cover 600 million light years.
12:16
That's pretty good.
12:16
But it's frustrated because what it thought
12:18
was it only had to cover 30 million light years
12:22
in distance.
12:23
That keeps stretching out because space
12:25
itself is stretching.
12:26
So the reality, just going to the original idea,
12:32
this photon that is just reaching us,
12:36
that's been traveling for-- let's say
12:38
it's been traveling for 13.4 billion years.
12:41
So it's reaching us is just now.
12:43
So let me just fast forward 13.4 billion years
12:46
from this point now to get to the present day.
12:49
So if I draw the whole visible universe right over here,
12:54
this point right over here is going
12:56
to be-- where it was emitted from is right over there.
13:00
We are sitting right over there.
13:04
And actually, let me make something clear.
13:06
If I'm drawing the whole observable universe,
13:08
the center actually should be where we are.
13:10
Because we can observe an equal distance.
13:12
If things aren't really strange, we
13:14
can observe an equal distance in any direction.
13:16
So actually maybe we should put us at the center.
13:19
So if this was the entire observable universe,
13:21
and the photon was emitted from here 13.4 billion years ago--
13:26
so 300,000 years after that initial Big Bang,
13:29
and it's just getting to us, it is true
13:35
that the photon has been traveling
13:41
for 13.7 billion years.
13:47
But what's kind of nutty about it is this object, since we've
13:50
been expanding away from each other, this object is now,
13:53
in our best estimates, this object
13:56
is going to be about 46 billion light years away from us.
14:08
And I want to make it very clear.
14:10
This object is now 46 billion light years away from us.
14:13
When we just use light to observe it, it looks like,
14:16
just based on light years, hey, this light
14:18
has been traveling 13.7 billion years to reach us.
14:21
That's our only way of kind with light
14:22
to kind of think about the distance.
14:24
So maybe it's 13.4 or whatever-- I
14:27
keep changing the decimal-- but 13.4 billion light years away.
14:31
But the reality is if you had a ruler today, light year rulers,
14:36
this space here has stretched so much
14:38
that this is now 46 billion light years.
14:41
And just to give you a hint of when
14:43
we talk about the cosmic microwave background
14:45
radiation, what will this point in space
14:47
look like, this thing that's actually
14:49
46 billion light years away, but the photon only
14:52
took 13.7 billion years to reach us?
14:54
What will this look like?
14:56
Well, when we say look like, it's
14:59
based on the photons that are reaching us right now.
15:02
Those photons left 13.4 billion years ago.
15:05
So those photons are the photons being
15:07
emitted from this primitive structure,
15:10
from this white-hot haze of hydrogen plasma.
15:16
So what we're going to see is this white-hot haze.
15:19
So we're going to see this kind of white-hot plasma, white hot,
15:26
undifferentiated not differentiated
15:28
into proper stable atoms, much less stars and galaxies,
15:32
but white hot.
15:33
We're going to see this white-hot plasma.
15:36
The reality today is that point in space
15:38
that's 46 billion years from now,
15:40
it's probably differentiated into stable atoms, and stars,
15:45
and planets, and galaxies.
15:46
And frankly, if that person, that person,
15:49
if there is a civilization there right now
15:51
and if they're sitting right there, and they're observing
15:52
photons being emitted from our coordinate,
15:54
from our point in space right now,
15:56
they're not going to see us.
15:57
They're going to see us 13.4 billion years ago.
16:01
They're going to see the super primitive state
16:05
of our region of space when it really
16:07
was just a white-hot plasma.
16:09
And we're going to talk more about this in the next video.
16:11
But think about it.
16:12
Any photon that's coming from that period in time,
16:15
so from any direction, that's been traveling
16:17
for 13.4 billion years from any direction,
16:21
it's going to come from that primitive state
16:23
or it would have been emitted when the universe was
16:27
in that primitive state, when it was just
16:29
that white-hot plasma, this undifferentiated mass.
16:32

16:33
a sense of where the cosmic microwave background

0:00
In this video, I want to cover several topics
0:02
that are all related.
0:03
And on some level, they're really simple, but on a whole
0:05
other level, they tend to confuse people a lot.
0:07
So hopefully we can make some headway.
0:10
So a good place to start-- let's just imagine that I have
0:12
some type of container here.
0:15
Let's say that's my container and inside of that container,
0:18
I have a bunch of water molecules.
0:21
It's just got a bunch of water molecules.
0:24
They're all rubbing against each other.
0:25
It's in its liquid form, this is liquid water.
0:27
and inside of the water molecules, I
0:30
have some sugar molecules.
0:33
Maybe I'll do sugar in this pink color.
0:35
So I have a bunch of sugar molecules right here.
0:40
I have many, many more water molecules though.
0:43
I want to make that clear.
0:49
Now in this type of situation, we call the thing that there's
0:55
more of, the solvent.
1:00
So in this case, there's more water molecules and you can
1:03
literally just view more as the number of molecules.
1:07
I'm not going to go into a whole discussion of moles and
1:10
all of that because you may or may not have been exposed to
1:13
that yet, but just imagine whatever there's more of,
1:15
that's what we're going to call the solvent.
1:17
So in this case, water is the solvent.
1:24
And whatever there is less of-- in this case, that is the
1:30
sugar-- that is considered the solute.
1:36
It doesn't have to be sugar.
1:37
It can be any molecule that there's less of, in the water,
1:40
in this case.
1:45
And we say that the sugar has been dissolved into the water.
2:03
And this whole thing right here, the combination of the
2:06
water and the sugar molecules, we call a solution.
2:10
We call this whole thing a solution.
2:14
And a solution has the solvent and the solute.
2:16
The solvent is water.
2:18
That's the thing doing the dissolving and the thing that
2:21
is dissolved is the sugar.
2:23
That's the solute.
2:24
Now all of this may or may not be review for you, but I'm
2:27
doing it for a reason-- because I want to talk about
2:32
the idea of a diffusion.
2:39
And the idea is actually pretty straightforward.
2:43
If I have, let's say, the same container.
2:46
Let me do it in a slightly different container here, just
2:49
to talk about diffusion.
2:50
We'll go back to water and sugar--
2:52
especially back to water.
2:54
Let's say we have a container here and let's say it just has
2:58
a bunch of-- let's say it just has some air particles in it.
3:00
It could be anything-- oxygen or carbon dioxide.
3:03
So let me just draw a couple of air molecules here.
3:07
So let's say that that is a gaseous-- just for the sake of
3:11
argument-- gaseous oxygen.
3:12
So each of this is an O2-- each of those, right?
3:14
And let's say that this is the current configuration, that
3:16
all of this is a vacuum here and that there's some
3:19
temperatures.
3:20
So these water molecules, they have some
3:22
type of kinetic energy.
3:25
They're moving in some type of random directions right there.
3:29
So my question is, what is going to happen in this type
3:34
of container?
3:35
Well, any of these guys are going to be randomly bumping
3:38
into each other.
3:39
They're more likely to bump into things in this down-left
3:43
direction than they are in the up-right direction.
3:45
So if this guy was happening to go in this down-left
3:47
direction, he's going to bump into something and then
3:50
ricochet into the up-right direction.
3:52
But in the up-right direction, there's
3:53
nothing to bounce into.
3:55
So in general, everything is moving in random directions,
3:57
but you're more likely to be able to move in
4:00
the rightward direction.
4:01
When you go to the left, you're more likely to bump
4:02
into something.
4:04
So it's almost common sense.
4:06
Over time, if you just let this system come to some type
4:09
of equilibrium-- I'm not going to go into detail
4:11
on what that means.
4:12
You can watch the thermodynamics videos if you'd
4:14
like to see that.
4:15
You'll eventually see the container will look
4:18
something like this.
4:19
I can't guarantee it.
4:20
There's some probability it would actually stay like this,
4:22
but very likely that those five particles are going to
4:25
get relatively spread out.
4:27
This is diffusion and so it's really just the spreading of
4:32
particles or molecules from high concentration to low
4:36
concentration areas, right?
4:39
In this case, the molecules are going to spread in that
4:41
direction from a high concentration to a low
4:43
concentration area.
4:45
Now you're saying, Sal, what is concentration?
4:47
And there's many ways to measure concentration and you
4:51
can go into molarity and molality and all of that.
4:54
But the very simple idea is, how much of that particle do
4:57
you have per unit space?
4:59
So here, you have a lot of those particles per unit space
5:02
and here you have very few of those
5:04
particles per unit space.
5:05
So this is a high concentration and that's a low
5:09
concentration.
5:09
So you could imagine other experiments like this.
5:12
You could imagine a solution like-- let's do
5:17
something like this.
5:21
Let's say I have two containers.
5:25
Let's go back to the solution situation.
5:27
This was a gas, but I started off with that example so let's
5:29
stay with that example.
5:31
So let's say that I have a door right there that's larger
5:35
than either the water or the sugar molecules.
5:38
On either side, I have a bunch of water molecules.
5:52
So I have a lot of water molecules.
5:53
So if I just had water molecules here-- they're all
5:55
bouncing around in random directions-- and so the odds
5:58
of a water molecule going this way, equivalent to odds of a
6:01
water molecule going that way, assuming that both sides have
6:04
the same level of water molecule, otherwise the
6:06
pressures would be different.
6:07
But let's say that the top of this is the same
6:10
as the top of this.
6:11
So there's no more pressure going in one
6:12
direction or another.
6:13
So if for whatever reason, a bunch more water molecules
6:17
were going in the rightward direction, then all of a
6:18
sudden this would fill up with more water and we know that
6:20
that isn't likely to occur.
6:22
So this is just two containers of water.
6:28
Now let's put some solute in it.
6:30
Let's dissolve some solute in it and let's say we do all the
6:33
dissolving on the left-hand side.
6:35
So we put some sugar molecules on the left-hand side.
6:40
And these are small enough to fit through this little pipe.
6:42
That's one assumption that I'm making.
6:44
So what's going to happen?
6:45
All of these things have some type of kinetic energy.
6:47
They're all bouncing around.
6:52
Well, over time, the water's going back and forth.
6:56
This water molecule might go that way.
6:57
That water molecule might go that way, but they net each
7:00
other out, but over time one of these big sugar molecules
7:03
will be going in just the right direction to go
7:06
through-- maybe this guy's, instead of going that
7:08
direction, he starts off going in that direction.
7:10
He goes just through this tunnel connecting the two
7:15
containers and he'll end up there, right?
7:18
And this guy will still be bouncing around.
7:20
There's some probability he goes back, but there's still
7:23
more sugar particles here than there.
7:25
So there's still more probability that one of these
7:31
guys will go to that side than one of these guys
7:33
will go to that side.
7:34
So you can imagine if you're doing this with gazillions of
7:36
particles-- I'm only doing it with four-- over time, the
7:40
particles will have spread out so that their concentrations
7:43
are roughly equal.
7:44
So that maybe you'll have two here over time.
7:46
But when you're only dealing with three or four or five
7:49
particles, there's some probability it doesn't happen,
7:51
but when you're doing it with a gazillion and they're super
7:53
small, it's a very, very, very high likelihood.
7:56
But anyway, this whole process-- we went from a
7:59
container of high concentration to a container
8:02
of low concentration and the particles would have spread
8:06
from the low concentration container to the high
8:08
concentration container.
8:09
So they diffused.
8:11
This is diffusion.
8:16
And just so that we learn some other words that tend to be
8:18
used with the idea of diffusion-- when we started
8:21
off, this had a higher concentration.
8:24
The left-hand side container had higher concentration.
8:33
It's all relative, right?
8:34
It's higher than this guy.
8:37
And this right here had a lower concentration.
8:42
And there are words for these things.
8:44
This solution with a high concentration is called a
8:47
hypertonic solution.
8:50
Let me write that in yellow.
8:58
Hyper, in general, meaning having a lot of something,
9:01
having too much of something.
9:02
And this lower concentration is hypotonic.
9:13
You might have heard maybe one of your relatives, if they
9:16
haven't had a meal in awhile say, I'm hypoglycemic.
9:20
That means that they have not-- they're feeling
9:22
lightheaded.
9:22
There's not enough sugar in their bloodstream and they
9:24
want to pass out so they want a meal.
9:26
If you just had a candy bar, maybe you're hyperglycemic--
9:29
or maybe you're just hyper in general.
9:32
So these are just good prefixes to know, but
9:35
hypertonic-- you have a lot of the solute.
9:38
You have a high concentration.
9:40
And then in hypotonic, not too much of the solute so you have
9:44
a low concentration.
9:46
These are good words to know.
9:47
So in general, diffusion-- if there's no barriers to the
9:51
diffusion like we had here, you will have the solute go
9:54
from a high concentration or hypertonic solution if they
9:58
can travel to a hypotonic solution, to a hypo, where the
10:03
concentration is lower.
10:05
Now let's do an interesting experiment here.
10:08
We've talked about diffusion and so far we've been talking
10:10
about the diffusion of the solute, right?
10:14
And in general-- and this is not always the case-- if you
10:17
want to be as general as possible, the solute is
10:19
whatever you have less of, the solvent is whatever
10:22
you have more of.
10:23
And the most common solvent tends to be water, but it
10:26
doesn't have to be water.
10:27
It could be some type of alcohol.
10:28
It could be mercury.
10:31
It could be a whole set of molecules, but water in most
10:34
biological or chemical systems tends to be the
10:38
most typical solvent.
10:39
It's what other things are dissolved into.
10:41
But what happens if we have a tunnel where the solute is too
10:46
big to travel, but water is small enough to travel?
10:51
Let's think about that situation.
10:55
In order to think about it, I'm going to do something
10:57
interesting.
10:58
Let's say we have a container here.
11:02
Actually, I won't even draw a container.
11:03
Let's just say we have an outside environment that has a
11:07
bunch of water.
11:09
This is the outside environment and then you have
11:12
some type of membrane.
11:19
Water can go in and out of this membrane.
11:22
So it's semi-permeable.
11:23
Well, it's permeable to water, but the solute cannot go
11:26
through the membrane.
11:27
So let's say that the solute is sugar.
11:28
So we have water on the outside and
11:33
also inside the membrane.
11:36
So these are little small water molecules.
11:39
This is a membrane right here.
11:43
And let's say that we have some sugar molecules again--
11:46
I'm just picking on sugar.
11:47
It could have been anything.
11:48
So we have some sugar molecules here that are just a
11:51
little bit bigger-- or they could be a lot bigger.
11:55
Actually, they're a lot bigger than water molecules.
11:57
You have a bunch of-- and I only draw four, but you have a
11:59
gazillion of them, right?
12:01
You have that much more water molecules.
12:03
I'm just trying to show you have more water molecules than
12:05
sugar molecules.
12:06
And this membrane is semi-permeable.
12:13
Permeable means it allows things to pass.
12:15
Semi-permeables means it's not completely permeable.
12:18
So semi-permeable-- in this context, I'm saying I allow
12:20
water to pass through the membrane.
12:22
So water can pass, but sugar cannot.
12:28
Sugar is too large.
12:35
So if we were to zoom in on the actual membrane itself--
12:39
maybe the membrane looks like this.
12:40
I'm going to zoom in on this membrane.
12:44
So it has little holes in the membrane, just like that.
12:48
And maybe the water molecules are about that size.
12:51
So they can go through those holes.
12:53
So the water molecules can go back and forth through the
12:56
holes, but the sugar molecules are about that big.
13:01
So they cannot go through that hole.
13:04
They're too big for this opening right here to go back
13:07
and forth between them.
13:08
Now what do you think is going to happen in this situation?
13:12
So first of all, let's use our terminology.
13:14
Remember, sugar is our solute.
13:15
Water is our solvent.
13:17
Semi-permeable membrane.
13:18
Which side of the membrane has a higher or lower
13:21
concentration of solute?
13:24
Well, the inside does.
13:25
The inside is hypertonic.
13:32
The outside has a lower
13:33
concentration so it's hypotonic.
13:44
Now, if these openings were big enough, based on what we
13:47
just talked about-- these guys are bouncing around, water is
13:51
travelling in either direction, and equal
13:53
probability or-- actually I'm going to talk
13:56
about that in a second.
13:58
If everything was wide open, it would be equal probability,
14:01
but if it was wide open, these guys eventually would bounce
14:03
their ways over to this side and you'd probably end up with
14:06
equal concentrations eventually.
14:08
And so you would have your traditional diffusion, where
14:10
high concentration of solute to low
14:13
concentrations of solute.
14:14
But in this case, these guys-- they can't
14:17
fit through the hole.
14:18
Only water can go back and forth.
14:20
If these guys were not here, water would have an equal
14:25
likelihood of going in this direction as they would be
14:28
going in that direction, a completely equal likelihood.
14:33
But because these guys are on the right-hand side of-- or in
14:40
this case, on the inside of our membrane.
14:42
This is our inside of our membrane zoomed up-- it's less
14:47
likely because these guys might be in the approach
14:50
position of the holes-- that's slightly less likely for water
14:55
to be in the approach position for the holes so it's actually
14:58
more probable that water could enter than water exit.
15:02
And I want to make that very clear.
15:04
If these sugar molecules were not here, obviously it's
15:07
equally likely for water to go in either direction.
15:09
Now that these sugar molecules are there, these sugar
15:12
molecules might be on the right-hand side.
15:15
They might be blocking-- I guess the best way to think
15:18
about it is blocking the approach to the hole.
15:20
They'll never be able to go through the hole themselves
15:22
and might not even be blocking the hole, but they're going in
15:24
some random direction.
15:25
So if a water molecule was approaching-- it's all
15:29
probabilistic and we're dealing with gazillions of
15:31
molecules-- it's that much more likely to be blocked to
15:34
get outside.
15:35
But the water molecules from the outside-- there's nothing
15:37
blocking them to get in so you're going to have a flow of
15:40
water inside.
15:41
So in this situation, with a semi-permeable membrane,
15:44
you're going to have water.
15:45
You're going to have a net inward flow of water.
15:49
And so this is kind of interesting.
15:51
We have the solvent flowing from a hypotonic situation to
15:56
a hypertonic solution, but it's only
15:59
hypotonic in the solute.
16:07
But water-- if you flip it the other way-- if you've used
16:11
sugar as the solvent, then you could say, we're going from a
16:15
high concentration of water to a low concentration of water.
16:19
I don't want to confuse you too much.
16:20
This is what tends to confuse people, but just think about
16:23
what's going to happen.
16:24
No matter in what situation, the solution is going to do
16:27
what it can to try to equilibriate the
16:30
concentration.
16:30
To make the concentrations on both
16:32
sides as close as possible.
16:33
And it's not just some magic.
16:35
It's not like the solution knows.
16:36
It's all based on probabilities and these things
16:38
bumping around, but in this situation, water is more
16:41
likely to flow into the container.
16:43
So it's actually going to go from the hypotonic side when
16:46
we talk about low concentration of solute to the
16:50
side that has high concentrations of solute, of
16:53
sugar-- and actually, if this thing is stretchable, more
16:57
water will keep flowing in and this membrane
17:01
will stretch out.
17:04
I won't go to too much detail here, but this idea of water--
17:08
of the solvent-- if in this case, water is the solvent--
17:12
of water as a solvent diffusing through a
17:15
semi-permeable membrane, this is called osmosis.
17:22
You've probably heard learning by osmosis-- if you put a book
17:25
against your head, maybe it'll just seep into your brain.
17:27
Same idea.
17:28
That's where the word comes from.
17:29
This idea of water seeping through membranes to try to
17:33
make concentrations more equal.
17:35
So if you say, well, I have high concentration here, low
17:38
concentration here.
17:39
If there was no membrane here, these big molecules would
17:43
exit, but because there's this semi-permeable membrane here,
17:48
they can't.
17:48
So the system just probabilistically-- no magic
17:52
here-- more water will enter to try to equilibriate
17:56
concentration.
17:57
Eventually-- if maybe there's a few molecules out here-- not
18:01
as high concentration here-- eventually if everything was
18:06
allowed to happen fully, you'll get to the point where
18:08
you have just as many-- you have just as high
18:11
concentration on this side as you have on the right-hand
18:13
side because this right-hand side is going to fill with
18:16
water and also probably become a larger volume.
18:19
And then, once again, the probabilities of a water
18:21
molecule going to the right and to the left will be the
18:23
same and you'll get to some type of equilibrium.
18:25
But I want to make it very clear-- diffusion is the idea
18:29
of any particle going from higher concentration and
18:33
spreading into a region that has a lower concentration and
18:35
just spreading out.
18:36
Osmosis is the diffusion of water.
18:41
And usually you're talking about the diffusion of water
18:44
as a solvent and usually it's in the context of a
18:47
semi-permeable membrane, where the actual solute cannot
18:51
travel through the membrane.
18:53
Anyway, hopefully you've found that useful and
18:55
not completely confusing.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,aubZU0iWtgI,

to actually produce an organism.
0:31
And to produce an organism, you somehow have to
0:33
take that information in the DNA, and then
0:35
produce things like a structural molecules,
0:39
enzymes, transport molecules, signaling molecules,
0:43
that actually do the work of the organism.
0:48
And that process, the first step, and this is all a review
0:51
that we've seen in other videos.
0:53
The first step is to go from DNA to RNA,
0:55
and in particular, messenger RNA.
0:58
""Messenger RNA,"" and this process right over here,
1:02
this is called transcription.
1:04
""Transcription,"" we go into a lot of detail
1:06
on this in other videos.
1:08
And then you wanna go from that messenger RNA,
1:10
it goes to the ribosomes and then tRNA goes and grabs
1:14
amino acids, and they form actual proteins.
1:17
So you go from messenger RNA, and then in conjunction,
1:21
so this is all, this is in conjunction with tRNA
1:24
and amino acids, so let me say ""+tRNA,"" and ""amino acids.""
1:32
And I'll write ""amino acids"" in, I'll write it in a brighter
1:35
color, since that's going to be the focus of this video.
1:39
So tRNA and amino acids, you're able to construct proteins.
1:45
You are able to construct proteins,
1:47
which are made up of chains of amino acids,
1:51
and it's the proteins that do
1:53
a lot of the work of the organism.
1:56
Proteins, which are nothing but chains of amino acids,
1:59
or they're made up of, sometimes
2:00
multiple chains of amino acids.
2:02
So you can image, I'm just going to, that's an amino acid.
2:05
That's another amino acid.
2:07
This is an amino acid.
2:10
This is an amino acid, you could keep going.
2:13
So these chains of amino acids, based on
2:16
how these different, based on the properties
2:19
of these different amino acids,
2:21
and how the protein takes shape and how
2:23
it might interact with its surrounding,
2:24
these proteins can serve all sorts of different functions.
2:27
Anything from part of your immune system,
2:30
antibodies, they can serve as enzymes,
2:33
they can serve as signaling hormones, like insulin.
2:38
They're involved in muscle contraction.
2:40
Actin and myosin, we actually have
2:42
a fascinating video on that.
2:43
Transport of oxygen.
2:45
Hemoglobin.
2:46
So proteins, the way at least my brain of it,
2:48
is they do a lot of the work.
2:50
DNA says, well, what contains the information,
2:54
but a lot of the work of organism is actually done,
2:57
is actually done by the proteins.
3:00
And as I just said, the building blocks
3:02
of the proteins are the amino acids.
3:05
So let's focus on that a little bit.
3:07
So up here are some examples of amino acids.
3:10
And there are 20 common amino acids,
3:12
there are a few more depending on what organism you look at,
3:17
and theoretically there could be many more.
3:19
But in most biological systems,
3:21
there are 20 common amino acids that the DNA is coding for,
3:24
and these are two of them.
3:26
So let's just first look at what is common.
3:29
So, we see that both these, and actually all three of this,
3:33
this is just a general form, you have an amino group.
3:36
You have an amino group, and this where,
3:39
this is why we call it an ""amino,"" an amino acid.
3:42
So you have an amino group.
3:44
Amino group right over here.
3:46
Now you might say, ""well, it's called an amino acid,""
3:49
""so where is the acid?""
3:50
And that comes from this carboxyl group right over here.
3:55
So that's why we call it an acid.
3:57
This carboxyl group is acidic.
4:02
It likes to donate this proton.
4:04
And then in between, we have a carbon,
4:06
and we call that the alpha carbon.
4:09
We call that the alpha carbon.
4:12
Alpha carbon, and that alpha carbon is bonded,
4:14
it has a covalent bond to the amino group,
4:16
covalent bond to the carboxyl group,
4:18
and a covalent bond to a hydrogen.
4:20
Now, from there, that's where you get the variation
4:24
in the different amino acids, and actually,
4:26
there's even some exceptions for how the nitrogen is,
4:30
but for the most part, the variation between
4:32
the amino acids is what this fourth covalent bond
4:36
from the alpha carbon does.
4:38
So you see in serine, you have this,
4:43
what you could call it an alcohol.
4:45
You could have an alcohol side chain.
4:47
In valine right over here, you have a
4:50
fairly pure hydrocarbon, hydrocarbon side chain.
4:54
And so in general, we refer to these side chains
4:58
as an R group, and it's these R groups
5:01
that play a big role in defining the shape of the proteins,
5:05
and how they interact with their environment
5:07
and the types of things they can do.
5:08
And you can even see, just from these examples
5:10
how these different sides chains might behave differently.
5:13
This one has an alcohol side chain,
5:16
and we know that oxygen is electronegative,
5:18
it likes to hog electrons, it's amazing how much
5:21
of chemistry or even biology you can deduce
5:23
from just pure electronegativity.
5:26
So, oxygen likes to hog electrons, so you're gonna have
5:28
a partially-negative charge there.
5:31
Hydrogen has a low electronegativity relative to oxygen,
5:38
so it's gonna have its electrons hogged,
5:40
so you're gonna have a partially positive charge,
5:42
just like that, and so this has a polarity to it,
5:46
and so it's going to be hydrophilic, it's going to,
5:48
at least this part of the molecule is going to
5:50
be able to be attracted and interact with water.
5:54
And that's in comparison to what we have over here,
5:57
this hydrocarbon side chain, this has no polarity over here,
6:02
so this is going to be hydrophobic.
6:04
So this is going to be hydrophobic.
6:08
And so when we start talking about the structures
6:10
of proteins, and how the structures of proteins
6:12
are influenced by its side chains,
6:14
you could image that parts of proteins that have
6:17
hydrophobic side chains, those are gonna
6:18
wanna get onto the inside of the proteins
6:21
if we're in an aqueous solution,
6:23
while the ones that are more hydrophilic
6:24
will wanna go onto the outside,
6:26
and you might have some side chains
6:27
that are all big and bulky, and so they might
6:29
make it hard to tightly pack, and then you might have
6:32
other side chains that are nice and small
6:34
that make it very easy to pack, so these things
6:36
really do help define the shape,
6:39
and we're gonna talk about that a lot more
6:41
when we talk about the structure.
6:44
But how do these things actually connect?
6:47
And we're gonna go into much more detail
6:49
in another video, but if you have...
6:51
If you have serine right over here, and then you have
6:56
valine right over here, they connect through
7:01
what we call peptide bonds, and a peptide
7:03
is the term for two or more amino acids connected together,
7:08
so this would be a dipeptide, and the bond
7:10
isn't this big, I just, actually let me just,
7:12
let me draw it a little bit smaller.
7:14
So...
7:15
That's serine.
7:17
This is valine.
7:20
They can form a peptide bond, and this would be the smallest
7:23
peptide, this would be a dipeptide right over here.
7:27
""Peptide,"" ""peptide bond,"" or sometimes
7:30
called a peptide linkage.
7:32
And as this chain forms, that polypeptide,
7:35
as you add more and more things to it,
7:37
as you add more and more amino acids,
7:42
this is going to be, this can be a protein
7:44
or can be part of a protein that does all of these things.
7:47
Now one last thing I wanna talk about,
7:50
this is the way, the way these amino acids have been drawn
7:52
is a way you'll often see them in a textbook,
7:54
but at physiological pH's, the pH's inside of your body,
7:59
which is in that, you know, that low sevens range,
8:01
so it's a pH of roughly 7.2 to 7.4.
8:08
What you have is this, the carboxyl group right over here,
8:12
is likely to be deprotonated, it's likely
8:15
to have given away its hydrogen,
8:16
you're gonna find that more likely than when you have...
8:19
It's gonna be higher concentrations having been
8:21
deprotonated than being protonated.
8:23
So, at physiological conditions, it's more likely
8:26
that this oxygen has taken both of those electrons,
8:33
and now has a negative charge,
8:35
so it's given, it's just given away the hydrogen proton
8:37
but took that hydrogen's electron.
8:40
So it might be like this, and then the amino group,
8:43
the amino group at physiological pH's,
8:46
it's likely to actually grab a proton.
8:49
So nitrogen has an extra loan pair,
8:52
so it might use that loan pair to grab a proton,
8:55
in fact it's physiological pH's,
8:56
you'll find a higher concentration of it having
8:58
grabbed a proton than not grabbing a proton.
9:01
So, the nitrogen will have grabbed a proton,
9:05
use its loan pairs to grab a proton,
9:07
and so it is going to have...
9:09
So it is going to have a...
9:11
It is going to have a positive charge.
9:14
And so sometimes you will see amino acids
9:19
described this way, and this is actually more accurate
9:21
for what you're likely to find at physiological conditions,
9:24
and these molecules have an interesting name,
9:26
a molecule that is neutral even though
9:28
parts of it have charge, like this,
9:31
this is called a zwitterion.
9:33
That's a fun, fun word.
9:35
Zwitterion.
9:39
And ""zwitter"" in German means ""hybrid,""
9:41
and ""ion"" obviously means that it's going to have charge,
9:44
and so this has hybrid charge,
9:46
even though it has charges at these ends,
9:47
the charges net out to be neutral.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Pk4d9lY48GI,

- [Voiceover] Before we go in-depth on meiosis,
0:02
I want to do a very high level overview
0:04
comparing mitosis to meiosis.
0:07
So, in mitosis, this is all a review,
0:10
if you've watched the mitosis video,
0:12
in mitosis, we start with a cell,
0:16
that has a diploid number of chromosomes.
0:19
I'll just write 2n to show it has a diploid number.
0:22
For human beings, this would be 46 chromosomes.
0:29
46 for humans, you get 23 chromosomes from your mother,
0:33
23 chromosomes from your father or you can say
0:36
you have 23 homologous pairs, which leads to 46 chromosomes.
0:42
Now after the process of mitosis happens
0:44
and you have your cytokinesis and all the rest,
0:47
you end up with two cells that each
0:49
have the same genetic information as the original.
0:53
So you now have two cells
0:56
that each have the diploid number of chromosomes.
0:59
So, 2n and 2n.
1:04
And now each of these cells
1:05
are just like this cell was,
1:08
it can go through interphase again.
1:10
It grows and it can replicate its DNA
1:15
and centrosomes and grow some more
1:16
then each of these can go through mitosis again.
1:19
And this is actually how
1:21
most of the cells in your body grow.
1:23
This is how you turn from a single cell organism into you,
1:27
or for the most part, into you.
1:30
So that is mitosis.
1:32
It's a cycle.
1:33
After each of these things go through mitosis,
1:36
they can then go through
1:37
the entire cell cycle again.
1:38
Let me write this a little bit neater.
1:40
Mitosis, that s was a little bit hard to read.
1:43
Now what happens in meiosis?
1:45
What happens in meiosis?
1:48
I'll do that over here.
1:50
In meiosis, something slightly different happens
1:54
and it happens in two phases.
1:58
You will start with a cell
2:00
that has a diploid number of chromosomes.
2:03
So you will start with a cell
2:06
that has a diploid number of chromosomes.
2:09
And in it's interphase, it also replicates its DNA.
2:12
And then it goes through something called Meiosis One.
2:15
And in Meiosis One,
2:16
what you end up with is two cells
2:18
that now have haploid number of chromosomes.
2:23
So you end up with two cells,
2:26
You now have two cells that each have a
2:28
haploid number of chromosomes.
2:31
So you have n and you have n.
2:34
So if we're talking about human beings,
2:35
you have 46 chromosomes here,
2:37
and now you have 23 chromosomes in this nucleus.
2:40
And now you have 23 in this nucleus.
2:42
But you're still not done.
2:45
Then each of these will go through a phase,
2:47
which I'll talk about in a second, which is
2:49
very similar to mitosis, which will
2:53
duplicate this entire cell into two.
2:56
So actually, let me do it like this.
2:57
So now, this one,
3:01
you're going to have four cells
3:04
that each have the haploid number
3:06
that each have the haploid number of chromosomes.
3:11
And they don't all necessarily have the same
3:13
genetic informatioin anymore.
3:15
Because as we go through this first phase,
3:17
right over here of meiosis, and this first phase
3:19
here you go from diploid to haploid, right over here,
3:23
this is called Meiosis One.
3:25
Meiosis One,
3:29
you're essentially splitting the homologous pairs
3:32
and so this one might get some of the
3:36
ones that you originally got from your father,
3:38
and some that you originally got from your mother,
3:39
some that you originally got from your father,
3:41
some that you originally got from your mother,
3:43
they split randomly, but each homogolous pair
3:46
gets split up.
3:48
And then in this phase, Meiosis Two,
3:51
so this phase right over here is called Meiosis Two,
3:55
it's very similar
3:56
to mitosis, except your now dealing with cells that start off
4:00
with the haploid number.
4:02
It's important to realize that meiosis is not a cycle.
4:05
These cells that you have over here, these are gametes.
4:09
This are sex cells.
4:10
These are gametes.
4:12
This can now be used in fertilization.
4:14
If we're talking about, if you're male, this is happening
4:18
in your testes, and these are going to be sperm cells
4:22
If you are female, this is happening in your ovaries
4:26
and these are going to be egg cells.
4:28
If you a tree, this could be pollen or it could be an ovul.
4:34
But these are used for fertilization.
4:37
These will fuse together in sexual reproduction
4:39
to get to a fertilized egg, which then can undergo
4:44
mitosis to create an entirely new organism.
4:48
So not a cycle here,
4:49
although these will find sex cells
4:52
from another organism and fuse with them
4:57
and those can turn into another organism.
4:59
And I guess the whole circle of life starts again.
5:01
But it's not the case with mitosis where this can keep
5:04
going and going, going.
5:05
This cell is just like this cell, while these sex cells
5:10
are differeent than this one right over here.
5:12
Now, where does this happen in the body?
5:14
We've talked about this in previous videos.
5:16
These are your somatic cells right over here.
5:19
These are the ones that make up the bulk of your body,
5:22
somatic cells.
5:23
And where is this happening?
5:25
Well, this is happening in germ cells,
5:27
As we mentioned, if you're male it's in your tesis
5:29
and if you're female it's in your ovaries.
5:32
And germ cells actually can undergo mitosis
5:36
to produce other germ cells that have a diploid
5:38
number of chromosomes, or they can undergo
5:42
meiosis in order to produce sperm or egg cells
5:46
in order to produce gametes.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,IQJ4DBkCnco,

0:02
Let's talk about the cardiovascular system.
0:04
Here's a cartoon of it.
0:06
And we have our heart, which is the pump, which pumps blood
0:11
through the blood vessels, round and round through the body.
0:15
And the purpose of this whole system
0:17
is to get blood out here to the capillary beds.
0:21
So here's a capillary bed.
0:22
And that's where the blood vessels become very skinny.
0:25
And they divide.
0:27
And because they're so skinny, they
0:29
have a lot more surface area.
0:31
And that increased surface area allows the blood
0:33
to exchange its oxygen and nutrients with these cells
0:37
here that I'm drawing, which need those things.
0:41
So the blood gives its oxygen to these cells.
0:44
And by the time it gets through the capillary bed,
0:47
it's lost its own oxygen.
0:48
And so now it's blue.
0:50
And that blood goes back to the heart.
0:53
Now, I haven't drawn it, but here also the blood
0:56
goes through the lungs and gets new oxygen,
0:58
so that when it goes around again, it has oxygen.
1:01
So this is a closed loop, with blood going round
1:04
and round and round.
1:05
But it has a problem, which is that the heart needs
1:08
to pump quite strong for blood to go around fast enough
1:12
and feed all the cells in your body.
1:15
And what that means is that the pressure that the heart exerts
1:18
is very high.
1:19
So there's high pressure in the heart.
1:21
And there's high pressure throughout these blood vessels.
1:24
And what that actually does is it forces some fluid out
1:28
of your blood vessels, and especially
1:31
out of these capillaries here.
1:32
It forces some fluid out.
1:34
And that fluid is not exactly blood,
1:37
because, for example, the red blood
1:39
cells which are in your blood are too big to squeeze out.
1:44
But the sort of more liquidy part
1:46
of your blood, which is like the plasma, that does
1:49
get squeezed out.
1:49
And so that's what ends up here.
1:52
And that fluid mixes in with the cells
1:56
which are outside of the capillaries.
1:59
And it accumulates.
2:01
Now, this is a problem, because if we let this go on,
2:04
we would lose pretty much all of the fluid in the blood.
2:07
And we would get a buildup of fluid out here.
2:09
And that would be an unsustainable situation.
2:14
So that's where your lymphatic system comes in.
2:16
This is the problem that it addresses.
2:19
So your lymphatic system is actually
2:20
another plumbing system, which I'm going to try to draw here.
2:25
So it's another plumbing system.
2:26
It has these vessels which kind of
2:29
start in the middle of nowhere.
2:31
And they collect this fluid.
2:34
The fluid goes in.
2:35
They collect it.
2:36
And they bring it back into circulation.
2:40
So they bring it back into the blood.
2:43
And that way, it goes back in.
2:45
And the blood can continue to circulate.
2:47
And we now do have a sustainable situation.
2:51
So these vessels here we call lymphatic vessels.
2:55
And if you'll notice, they're a little bit
2:56
different from blood vessels because they
3:00
don't form a closed loop.
3:02
The lymph, as this stuff is called,
3:05
lymph-- so that's the fluid that gets forced out of your blood.
3:09
The lymph goes in here.
3:11
And it gets dumped out into the blood vessels there.
3:13
It doesn't go back around to the start.
3:17
So that's kind of the basic explanation
3:19
for why we need these lymphatic vessels.
3:21
But to give it a little bit more depth,
3:24
let's take one of these capillaries.
3:26
And we're going to zoom in.
3:28
And we're going to draw it a little bit rotated here.
3:31
Hope that doesn't throw you off.
3:34
These are the endothelial cells lining that capillary.
3:39
And we're going to study exactly how fluid gets forced out.
3:46
So as we move along this capillary,
3:49
the blood is going to become deoxygenated.
3:53
And so I'm drawing the changing colors.
3:55
Even though, in reality, it's not the endothelial cells that
3:58
are changing colors, but having these colors will help orient,
4:01
I think.
4:04
And so flowing through this capillary,
4:06
you have little red blood cells, which
4:09
I'll try to draw as little disks there.
4:13
You have little red blood cells.
4:14
And of course you have lots of water, a lot of water.
4:20
And finally, you also have a bunch of little proteins.
4:24
Some of the proteins are actually bigger than others,
4:27
so we'll draw them in varying sizes.
4:29
But all this stuff is present in the blood.
4:32
And because of the high pressure, it gets squeezed out.
4:36
So the first question is exactly where and how
4:38
does it get squeezed out?
4:39
And the answer is it gets through between the cells.
4:43
The cells are not quite held together
4:46
tightly enough to prevent stuff from getting out.
4:49
But they are held tightly enough to prevent the bigger things
4:52
from getting out.
4:52
So the red blood cells and the bigger proteins won't get out.
4:56
But what will get out is some of the fluid, some of the water,
4:59
and some of the smaller proteins, which
5:02
we'll draw like this.
5:06
So actually, by the time the blood gets down
5:08
to the latter part of the capillary,
5:11
it's lost some of these smaller proteins
5:14
and some of this fluid.
5:16
And so let's show that by actually erasing some of it.
5:18
And so the concentration of bigger proteins is higher.
5:24
And you could even say that the concentration of red blood
5:27
cells is a little higher.
5:30
So we have a higher concentration
5:34
of solutes in this part of the capillary
5:38
than we had over there.
5:39
And the reason why I'm mentioning this
5:41
is because there's actually a subtlety, a complication here,
5:45
which is that although lymph or what will soon
5:48
be lymph is being forced out of the capillary over here,
5:53
actually some fluid comes back into the blood
5:56
vessel over here.
5:58
And to understand that, you need to know
6:00
that the concentration of solutes
6:02
is higher here, which leads to a higher osmotic pressure pulling
6:07
fluid back in.
6:09
And to understand it, you also need
6:10
to know that the pressure, the regular hydrostatic pressure,
6:14
is lower in the latter part of the capillary
6:17
compared to the earlier part.
6:19
So the pressure goes down.
6:21
And the pressure was what was pushing the lymph out
6:26
of the blood vessel over here.
6:27
So now we have less pushing out, and more pulling back in.
6:31
The stuff that's pulling back in is the osmotic pressure
6:35
caused by the increased concentration.
6:39
So here, some of the fluid and some of the smaller proteins
6:46
might get pulled back in.
6:48
So now you might be confused because I
6:50
said that fluid is getting pushed out,
6:53
is leaking out of the blood vessels.
6:55
And here I'm saying that it's leaking out but then
6:57
coming back in.
6:58
But the fact is that more goes out than comes back in.
7:03
And so let's draw these arrows a little bigger.
7:06
So more goes out than comes back in.
7:09
And so net result of the blood traveling
7:12
through this capillary is that you end up
7:15
with lymph squeezed out.
7:18
So now you know a little more detail
7:19
about how and why we end up with lymph.
7:22
But you might be asking yourself,
7:23
why don't these cells just tighten up their connections
7:26
there to prevent stuff from getting out?
7:29
But the answer is, you have to remember
7:31
that we have other cells around here which want to be fed.
7:35
They want to get glucose and other such things
7:38
from the blood.
7:40
And so it's important that little glucose molecules
7:44
and small proteins like hormones can get out
7:47
into this space near these cells so
7:50
that it can interact with them.
7:52
So basically, if these endothelial cells
7:55
in the capillaries were tightly connected together,
7:58
then all these cells in your body
8:00
would kind of be sealed off.
8:02
And you might be wondering, well,
8:04
are these gaps also necessary so that oxygen
8:06
can get to the cells?
8:08
And actually, oxygen is different.
8:10
It's very small.
8:11
It's just two atoms, one molecule.
8:13
So oxygen can just go right through the cells.
8:16
It can just travel right through walls
8:18
and get where it needs to.
8:21
So hopefully this gives you a better idea
8:23
of how lymph is kind of formed from capillaries,
8:27
how a bunch is squeezed out and only some of it gets back in.
8:31
So finally, I just wanted to draw a pretty ugly human being,
8:38
and make the point that you pretty much have capillaries
8:43
all over your body.
8:44
They're feeding all your muscles, all
8:46
your different tissues.
8:47
And for that reason, you need lymph vessels
8:50
to take lymph away from pretty much all of your body.
8:53
So you have lymph vessels coming out of your legs,
8:55
coming out of your arms, and so on.
8:57
And in a sense, they have a similar structure
8:59
to blood vessels, which is that they start very small.
9:02
And many of them come together and join up
9:05
into a bigger lymph vessel.
9:06
And that lymph vessel joins with another, bigger lymph vessel,
9:09
and so on.
9:10
And so it's kind of like they start out as capillaries,
9:14
and then they merge together and get bigger and bigger.
9:16
But of course they have the big difference
9:18
from blood vessels, which is that they're not a closed loop.
9:21
Ultimately, when they've consolidated
9:23
into big lymphatic vessels, they just
9:26
dump their contents back into blood circulation.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,_GinTV94hUk,
khan_video_xbyfeEW56Nc_145411,Can you have a myocardial infarction and then have an ischemic stroke because the hearth can not pump enough blood to the brain ?,Essay,"•
0:01
You've probably heard of
0:02
people having a stroke,
0:04
and you're probably familiar with the notion
0:07
that it has something to do
0:09
with the brain, and you'd be right.
0:10
In particular, it's a rapid loss of
0:14
brain function because of
0:15
something strange happening
0:17
with the blood flow to the brain.
0:20
And let me show you that
0:21
in a little bit more detail.
0:23
And to do that,
0:24
let's think about
0:24
the 2 major types of strokes.
0:26
There's the ischemic strokes,
0:34
and the other type of stroke
0:35
is hemorrhagic,
0:36
and these can kind of be sub-categorized,
0:38
but I won't go into all of the details there.
0:44
And if I really just define
0:46
ischemia and hemorrhaging to you,
0:48
I think you'll have an idea
0:49
of how these strokes are different
0:50
and how they interrupt the blood flow
0:53
to different parts of the brain.
0:55
You know from the videos on
0:57
stenosis and ischemia
0:59
and the videos on heart attacks
1:00
that ischemia is
1:01
a lack of blood flow
1:03
to certain body tissues.
1:05
So an ischemic stroke is actually
1:07
very, very similar to what we saw
1:09
in a heart attack,
1:10
except it's not occurring
1:11
in a coronary blood vessel,
1:12
it's occurring in a blood vessel
1:14
in the brain.
1:16
So let me draw that right over here.
1:18
Let's say that this is
1:19
a blood vessel in the brain.
1:25
And let's say that blood is flowing
1:27
in that direction (this is an artery).
1:30
And so you could imagine
1:31
that maybe there is a big blood clot
1:33
that forms in some part of the brain.
1:35
Let me do the blood clot in magenta.
1:37
This blood clot might form because --
1:38
no, that's not magenta --
1:40
the blood clot might form
1:41
because maybe there's a plaque there,
1:43
maybe the plaque got ruptured,
1:45
either way, this clot is restricting
1:48
the flow of blood.
1:49
And we know that this blood clot --
1:50
we can call this a thrombus,
1:55
or we could say that thrombosis
1:57
has occurred over here--
1:58
either way, the blood flow is restricted,
2:01
and the brain tissue that's further downstream
2:05
is not going to get its oxygen,
2:07
and it might die; it might experience infarction.
2:11
And that's why ischemic strokes are also
2:13
sometimes called cerebral infarctions.
2:19
These are all very fancy words,
2:20
but I think, hopefully, they're becoming
2:22
a little bit more common in our vocabulary,
2:24
they keep showing up over and over again.
2:27
And I also want to be clear:
2:29
most strokes are actually
2:30
ischemic strokes.
2:32
The numbers I looked up, they say,
2:34
87% of strokes are ischemic.
2:39
Now, the other type of way
2:41
that you could have ischemia
2:42
in one of these blood vessels,
2:44
and this is completely analogous
2:45
to what we saw in the heart,
2:47
when we had heart attacks, is:
2:49
you could have thrombosis,
2:50
or you could also have an embolism.
2:52
Whenever someone says thrombosis,
2:55
or a thrombus, or thrombi,
2:57
they're talking about blood clots.
2:59
Whenever someone talks about
3:00
an embolus, or emboli, or embolism,
3:03
they're talking about something
3:04
moving through the blood
3:05
that eventually blocks a blood vessel.
3:08
So you can actually have
3:09
a thromboembolism,
3:10
you can actually have a blood clot
3:14
that gets broken off --
3:17
so let me ignore this for now--
3:19
let me paint over it a little bit
3:22
so that this isn't the main cause of blockage--
3:24
but you could actually have a blood clot
3:26
that breaks off, becomes an embolus,
3:33
and since it's an embolus due to a blood clot,
3:35
you call it a thrombembolus --
3:37
I always have trouble saying all of these words--
3:39
and eventually it blocks an artery over here.
3:46
So this right here is an embolism,
3:51
but either way, you're blocking the blood flow
3:53
further down the brain,
3:55
[which] could cause infarction,
3:56
that brain tissue will die,
3:57
and whatever that brain tissue did
4:00
for mental function, or whatever,
4:03
is going to make it very hard
4:04
for this person who is experiencing this stroke
4:06
to do those things.
4:08
Now, it's not always noticeable,
4:08
that's called a silent stroke,
4:11
but damage is occurring.
4:13
The person experiencing the stroke--
4:15
and I'm not a doctor,
4:16
so take all of this with a grain of salt--
4:18
the person experiencing the stroke
4:20
could be anywhere from -
4:21
well, one, they may not even notice
4:22
that damage is occurring,
4:24
they might have a headache,
4:25
or it might be more severe,
4:26
they might actually
4:28
not be able to properly move
4:29
a side of their body,
4:30
or a side of their face,
4:32
or properly be able to speak,
4:33
so it really depends on what
4:34
part of the brain is being damaged.
4:37
But in either of these situations,
4:39
an ischemic stroke is caused by
4:40
some type of restriction or blockage
4:43
that causes things downstream to not
4:45
get proper oxygen, and then,
4:47
so you can imagine,
4:48
cells over here aren't going
4:49
to get their oxygen,
4:50
and then they might actually die.
4:53
A hemorrhagic stroke -
4:54
to hemorrhage means to bleed,
4:56
it's literally just a fancy word for bleeding-
4:58
and so in a hemorrhagic stroke
5:00
you have a situation where a blood vessel
5:02
can actually break, where you have a blood vessel-
5:06
I'm actually trying to draw
5:07
the same blood vessel- where it actually breaks.
5:09
We'll talk more in the future
5:10
of why a blood vessel might break -
5:12
strongly related to high blood pressure
5:14
and other risk factors,
5:15
but I don't want to get into that right now -
5:17
but you could imagine if a blood vessel breaks,
5:20
you have all this blood spewing into the brain
5:22
in, kind of, an uncontrolled way.
5:24
So let's say this little diagram
5:26
[that] I drew right here,
5:28
that part of the brain,
5:29
if you have a hemorrhagic stroke,
5:30
you have all of this blood
5:31
that's flowing into the brain,
5:32
and all of that uncontrolled blood
5:35
will mess up that part of the brain,
5:37
that causes those neurons
5:39
and brain tissue to malfunction
5:40
and maybe causes some of them to die,
5:43
and it would also cause
5:44
the blood flow further dowstream
5:46
to be impaired, so the stuff
5:47
downstream aren't going to get
5:49
the blood they need
5:50
because all the blood
5:51
is being released everywhere else.
5:54
And since 87% of strokes are ischemic strokes,
5:57
the remainder are hemorrhagic,

so this is the remaining 13% of strokes.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,xbyfeEW56Nc,

0:00
Let's talk about one of the most
0:01
important biological processes.
0:04
Frankly, if this process didn't occur, we probably
0:07
wouldn't have life on Earth, and I wouldn't be making this
0:09
video for you, because there'd be no place for me to
0:11
actually get food.
0:13
And the process is called photosynthesis.
0:20
And you're probably reasonably familiar with the idea.
0:23
The whole idea is plants, and actually bacteria and algae
0:28
and other things, but we normally
0:29
associate it with plants.
0:31
Let me make it in very simple terms. So we normally
0:33
associate it with plants.
0:36
And it's a process that plants use, and we might have learned
0:38
this when we were very young.
0:39
It's the process that plants use to take carbon dioxide
0:43
plus some water plus some sunlight and turn it into some
0:56
sugars or some maybe carbohydrates.
1:00
Carbohydrates or sugars plus oxygen.
1:04
Obviously, this has two very profound pieces to it for us
1:09
as a living species.
1:10
One, we need carbohydrates or we need sugars in order to
1:14
fuel our bodies.
1:15
You saw that in the cellular respiration videos.
1:17
We generate all of our ATP by performing cellular
1:21
respiration on glucose, which is essentially a byproduct, or
1:24
a broken down carbohydrate.
1:27
It's the simplest one for us to process in cellular
1:30
respiration.
1:31
And the second hugely important part
1:33
is getting the oxygen.
1:34
Once again, we need to breathe oxygen in order for us to
1:38
break down glucose, in order to respire, in order to
1:42
perform cellar respiration.
1:44
So these two things are key for life, especially for life
1:50
that breathes oxygen.
1:54
So this process, other than the fact that it's
1:56
interesting, that there are organisms around us, mostly
2:01
plants, that are able to harness actual sunlight.
2:05
You have these fusion reactions in the sun 93
2:07
million miles away, and it's releasing these photons, and
2:11
some small subset of those photons reach
2:13
the surface of Earth.
2:14
They make their way through clouds and whatever else.
2:17
And then these plants and bacteria and algae are able to
2:21
harness that somehow and turn them into sugars that we can
2:25
then eat or maybe the cow eats them and we eat the cow if
2:29
we're not vegetarians, and we can then use that for energy.
2:33
Not that the cow is all carbohydrates, but this is
2:35
essentially what is used as the fuel or the energy for all
2:39
of the other important compounds that we eat.
2:41
This is where we get all of our fuel.
2:43
So this is fuel for animals.
2:48
Or you know, if you eat a potato directly, you are
2:50
directly getting your carbohydrates.
2:52
But anyway, this is a very simple notion of
2:55
photosynthesis, but it's not incorrect.
2:56
I mean, if you had to know one thing about photosynthesis,
2:58
this would be it.
3:00
But let's delve a little bit deeper and try to get into the
3:03
guts of it and see if we can understand a little bit better
3:05
how this actually happens.
3:06
I find it amazing that somehow photons of sunlight are used
3:10
to create these sugar molecules or these
3:13
carbohydrates.
3:14
So let's delve a little bit deeper.
3:16
So we can write the general equation for photosynthesis.
3:21
Well, I've almost written it here.
3:23
But I'll write it a little bit more scientifically specific.
3:27
You start off with some carbon dioxide.
3:30
You add to that some water, and you add to that-- instead
3:34
of sunlight, I'm going to say photons because these are what
3:38
really do excite the electrons in the chlorophyll that go
3:42
down, and you'll see this process probably in this
3:44
video, and we'll go in more detail in the next few videos.
3:47
But that excited electron goes to a high energy state, and as
3:50
it goes to a lower energy state, we're able to harness
3:52
that energy to produce ATPs, and you'll see NADPHs, and
3:57
those are used to produce carbohydrates.
3:59
But we'll see that in a little bit.
4:01
But the overview of photosynthesis, you start off
4:03
with these constituents, And then you end up with a
4:10
carbohydrate.
4:11
And a carbohydrate could be glucose,
4:12
doesn't have to be glucose.
4:14
So the general way we can write a carbohydrates is CH2O.
4:20
And we'll put an n over here, that we could have n multiples
4:24
of these, and normally, n will be at least three.
4:27
In the case of glucose, n is 6.
4:29
You have 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens and 6 oxygens.
4:34
So this is a general term for carbohydrates, but you could
4:36
have many multiples of that.
4:38
You could have these long-chained carbohydrates, so
4:40
you end up with a carbohydrate and then you end
4:42
up with some oxygen.
4:45
So this right here isn't so different than what I wrote up
4:48
here in my first overview of how we always imagined
4:52
photosynthesis in our heads.
4:53
In order to make this equation balance-- let's see, I have n
4:56
carbons so I need n carbons there.
4:59
Let's see, I have two n hydrogens here.
5:02
Two hydrogens and I have n there, so I need two n
5:05
hydrogens here.
5:06
So I'll put an n out there.
5:07
And lets see how many oxygens.
5:10
I have two n oxygens, plus another n, so I
5:12
have three n oxygens.
5:13
So let's see, I have one n, and you put an n here, and
5:18
then I have two n, and I think this equation balances out.
5:21
So this is a 30,000-foot view of what's going on in
5:26
photosynthesis.
5:27
But when you dig a little deeper, you'll see that this
5:29
doesn't happen directly, that this happens through a bunch
5:32
of steps that eventually gets us to the carbohydrate.
5:37
So in general, we can break down photosynthesis.
5:40
I'll rewrite the word.
5:42
We can break down photosynthesis-- and we'll
5:47
delve deeper into future videos, but I want to get you
5:49
the overview first-- into two stages.
5:54
We can call one the light reactions.
5:58
Or sometimes they are called the light-dependent reactions,
6:01
and that actually would probably be a better
6:04
way to write it.
6:04
Let me write it like that.
6:05
Light dependent means that they need light to occur.
6:10
Light-dependent reactions.
6:12
And then you have something called the dark reactions, and
6:14
that's actually a bad name, because it also
6:18
occurs in the light.
6:19
Dark reactions, I wrote in a slightly darker color.
6:23
And the reason why I said it's a bad name is because it still
6:26
occurs in the light.
6:32
But the reason why they probably called it the dark
6:34
reaction is that you don't need light, or that part of
6:38
photosynthesis isn't dependent on photons to occur.
6:41
So a better term for it would have been
6:45
light-independent reaction.
6:55
So just to be clear, the light reactions
6:58
actually need sunlight.
6:59
They actually need photons for them to proceed.
7:03
The dark reactions do not need photons for them to happen,
7:07
although they do occur when the sun is out.
7:10
They don't need those photons, but they need the byproducts
7:13
from the light reaction to occur, so that's why it's
7:14
called the light-independent reaction.
7:17
They occur while the sun is out, but they
7:19
don't need the sun.
7:20
This needs the sun, so let me make it very clear.
7:24
So this requires sunlight.
7:26
This requires photons.
7:31
And let me just make a very brief overview of this.
7:35
This'll maybe let us start building a scaffold from which
7:38
we can dig deeper.
7:40
So the light reactions need photons, and
7:42
then it needs water.
7:46
So water goes into the light reactions and out of the other
7:48
side of the light reactions.
7:49
We end up with some molecular oxygen.
7:52
So that's what happens in the light reactions, and I'm going
7:54
to go much deeper into what actually occurs.
7:57
And what the light the actions produce is ATP, which we know
8:03
is the cellular or the biological currency of energy.
8:07
It produces ATP and it produces NADPH.
8:14
Now, when we studied cellular respiration, we saw the
8:16
molecule NADH.
8:18
NADPH is very similar.
8:21
You just have this P there.
8:23
You just have this phosphate group there, but they really
8:25
perform similar mechanisms. That this agent right here,
8:31
this molecule right here, is able to give away-- now let's
8:37
think about what this means-- it's able to give away this
8:41
hydrogen and the electron associated with this hydrogen.
8:44
So if you give away an electron to someone else or
8:48
someone else gains an electron, that something else
8:51
is being reduced.
8:53
Let me write that down.
8:54
This is a good reminder.
8:56
OIL RIG.
8:59
Oxidation is losing an electron.
9:02
Reduction is gaining an electron.
9:04
Your charge is reduced when you gain an electron.
9:07
It has a negative charge.
9:08
So this is a reducing agent.
9:10
It gets oxidized by losing the hydrogen and the
9:14
electron with it.
9:15
I have a whole discussion on the biological versus
9:18
chemistry view of oxidation, but it's the same idea.
9:21
When I lose a hydrogen, I also lose the ability to hog that
9:25
hydrogen's electron.
9:27
So this right here, when it reacts with other things, it's
9:30
a reducing agent.
9:31
It gives away this hydrogen and the electron associated
9:37
with it, and so the other thing gets reduced.
9:40
So this thing is a reducing agent.
9:46
And what's useful about it is when this hydrogen, and
9:49
especially the electron associated with that hydrogen,
9:52
goes from the NADPH to, say, another molecule and goes to a
9:56
lower energy state, that energy can also be used in the
10:01
dark reactions.
10:02
And we saw in cellular respiration the very similar
10:04
molecule, NADH, that through the Kreb Cycle, or actually
10:09
more importantly, that through the electron transport chain,
10:11
was able to help produce ATP as it gave away its electrons
10:17
and they went to lower energy states.
10:18
But I don't want to confuse you too much.
10:20
So the light reactions, you take in photons, you take in
10:23
water, it spits out oxygen, and it spits out ATP and NADPH
10:28
that can then be used in the dark reactions.
10:32
And the dark reactions, for most plants we talk about,
10:35
it's called the Calvin Cycle.
10:39
And I'll go into a lot more detail of what actually occurs
10:43
in the Calvin Cycle, but it takes in the ATP, the NADPH,
10:48
and it produces-- it doesn't directly produce glucose.
10:56
It produces-- oh, you probably saw this.
11:00
You could call it PGAL.
11:02
You could call it G3P.
11:05
These all stand for-- let me write these down-- this is
11:09
phosphoglyceraldehyde.
11:21
My handwriting broke down.
11:23
Or you could call it glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
11:35
Same exact molecule.
11:38
You can almost imagine it as-- this is a very gross
11:41
oversimplification-- as three carbons with a phosphate group
11:45
attached to it.
11:48
But this can then be used to produce other carbohydrates,
11:51
including glucose.
11:52
If you have two of these, you can use those
11:54
two to produce glucose.
11:57
So let's just take a quick overview again because this is
11:59
super important.
12:00
I'm going to make videos on the light reactions and the
12:03
dark reactions.
12:04
Those will be the next two videos I make.
12:05
So photosynthesis, you start with photons.
12:08
All of these occur when the sun is out, but only the light
12:11
reactions actually need the photons.
12:14
The light reactions take photons-- we're going to go
12:16
into more detail about what actually occurs--
12:17
and it takes in water.
12:19
Oxygen gets spit out.
12:21
ATP and NADPH get spit out, which are then used by the
12:24
dark reaction, or the Calvin Cycle, or the
12:28
light-independent reaction, because these still
12:30
occur in the light.
12:31
They just don't need photons.
12:32
So they're the light-independent reaction.
12:34
And it uses that in conjunction-- and we'll talk
12:37
about other molecules that are used in conjunction.
12:39
Oh, and I forgot a very important constituent of the
12:43
dark reaction.
12:45
It needs carbon dioxide.
12:47
That's where you get your carbons to keep producing
12:50
these phosphoglyceraldehydes, or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
12:54
So that's super important.
12:56
It takes in the carbon dioxide, the products from the
13:00
light reactions, and then uses that in the Calvin Cycle to
13:05
produce this very simple building block of other
13:09
carbohydrates.
13:09
And if you remember from glycolysis, you might remember
13:12
that this PGAL molecule, or this G3P-- same thing-- this
13:16
was actually the first product when we split glucose in two
13:20
when we performed the glycolysis.
13:21
So now we're going the other way.
13:23
We're building glucose so that we can split
13:25
it later for energy.
13:26
So this is an overview of photosynthesis, and in the
13:29
next couple of videos, I'm actually going to delve a
13:31
little bit deeper and tell you about the light reactions and
13:33
the dark reactions and how they actually occur.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,-rsYk4eCKnA,

0:00
We've learned a little bit about gravity.
0:02
We've learned a little bit about electrostatic.
0:05
So, time to learn about a new fundamental
0:09
force of the universe.
0:10
And this one is probably second most familiar to us,
0:13
next to gravity.
0:13
And that's magnetism.
0:17
Where does the word come from?
0:18
Well, I think several civilizations-- I'm no
0:21
historian-- found these lodestones, these objects that
0:29
would attract other objects like it, other magnets.
0:33
Or would even attract metallic objects like iron.
0:37
Ferrous objects.
0:39
And they're called lodestones.
0:41
That's, I guess, the Western term for it.
0:43
And the reason why they're called magnets is because
0:45
they're named after lodestones that were found near the Greek
0:50
province of Magnesia.
0:56
And I actually think the people who lived there were
0:58
called Magnetes.
1:00
But anyway, you could Wikipedia that and learn more
1:03
about it than I know.
1:05
But anyway let's focus on what magnetism is.
1:08
And I think most of us have at least a working knowledge of
1:12
what it is; we've all played with magnets and we've dealt
1:15
with compasses.
1:16
But I'll tell you this right now, what it really is, is
1:20
pretty deep.
1:22
And I think it's fairly-- I don't think anyone has-- we
1:25
can mathematically understand it and manipulate it and see
1:28
how it relates to electricity.
1:31
We actually will show you the electrostatic force and the
1:33
magnetic force are actually the same thing, just viewed
1:37
from different frames of reference.
1:39
I know that all of that sounds very
1:40
complicated and all of that.
1:41
But in our classical Newtonian world we treat them as two
1:45
different forces.
1:46
But what I'm saying is although we're kind of used to
1:48
a magnet just like we're used to gravity, just like gravity
1:52
is also fairly mysterious when you really think about what it
1:54
is, so is magnetism.
1:56
So with that said, let's at least try to get some working
1:59
knowledge of how we can deal with magnetism.
2:02
So we're all familiar with a magnet.
2:07
I didn't want it to be yellow.
2:10
I could make the boundary yellow.
2:12
No, I didn't want it to be like that either.
2:16
So if this is a magnet, we know that a magnet
2:21
always has two poles.
2:24
It has a north pole and a south pole.
2:28
And these were just labeled by convention.
2:30
Because when people first discovered these lodestones,
2:33
or they took a lodestone and they magnetized a needle with
2:37
that lodestone, and then that needle they put on a cork in a
2:40
bucket of water, and that needle would point to the
2:44
Earth's north pole.
2:46
They said, oh, well the side of the needle that is pointing
2:48
to the Earth's north, let's call that the north pole.
2:50
And the point of the needle that's pointing to the south
2:52
pole-- sorry, the point of the needle that's pointing to the
2:57
Earth's geographic south, we'll call
2:59
that the south pole.
3:00
Or another way to put it, if we have a magnet, the
3:03
direction of the magnet or the side of the magnet that
3:05
orients itself-- if it's allowed to orient freely
3:07
without friction-- towards our geographic north, we call that
3:11
the north pole.
3:12
And the other side is the south pole.
3:14
And this is actually a little bit-- obviously we call the
3:23
top of the Earth the north pole.
3:26
You know, this is the north pole.
3:30
And we call this the south pole.
3:34
And there's another notion of magnetic north.
3:38
And that's where-- I guess, you could kind of say-- that
3:42
is where a compass, the north point of a
3:47
compass, will point to.
3:48
And actually, magnetic north moves around because we have
3:51
all of this moving fluid inside of the earth.
3:54
And a bunch of other interactions.
3:55
It's a very complex interaction.
3:56
But magnetic north is actually roughly in northern Canada.
4:01
So magnetic north might be here.
4:04
So that might be magnetic north.
4:05
And magnetic south, I don't know exactly where that is.
4:07
But it can kind of move around a little bit.
4:09
It's not in the same place.
4:10
So it's a little bit off the axis of the geographic north
4:14
pole and the south pole.
4:16
And this is another slightly confusing thing.
4:19
Magnetic north is the geographic location, where the
4:23
north pole of a magnet will point to.
4:26
But that would actually be the south pole, if you viewed the
4:31
Earth as a magnet.
4:35
So if the Earth was a big magnet, you would actually
4:38
view that as a south pole of the magnet.
4:40
And the geographic south pole is the
4:43
north pole of the magnet.
4:44
You could read more about that on Wikipedia, I know it's a
4:46
little bit confusing.
4:47
But in general, when most people refer to magnetic
4:49
north, or the north pole, they're talking about the
4:51
geographic north area.
4:53
And the south pole is the geographic south area.
4:56
But the reason why I make this distinction is because we know
5:00
when we deal with magnets, just like electricity, or
5:03
electrostatics-- but I'll show a key difference very
5:06
shortly-- is that opposite poles attract.
5:10
So if this side of my magnet is attracted to Earth's north
5:14
pole then Earth's north pole-- or Earth's magnetic north--
5:19
actually must be the south pole of that magnet.
5:22
And vice versa.
5:23
The south pole of my magnet here is going to be attracted
5:26
to Earth's magnetic south.
5:28
Which is actually the north pole of the
5:29
magnet we call Earth.
5:31
Anyway, I'll take Earth out of the equation because it gets a
5:34
little bit confusing.
5:35
And we'll just stick to bars because that tends to be a
5:37
little bit more consistent.
5:40
Let me erase this.
5:44
There you go.
5:45
I'll erase my Magnesia.
5:49
I wonder if the element magnesium was first discovered
5:52
in Magnesia, as well.
5:53
Probably.
5:55
And I actually looked up Milk of
5:57
Magnesia, which is a laxative.
5:58
And it was not discovered in Magnesia, but it has
6:02
magnesium in it.
6:04
So I guess its roots could be in Magnesia if magnesium was
6:08
discovered in Magnesia.
6:09
Anyway, enough about Magnesia.
6:11
Back to the magnets.
6:13
So if this is a magnet, and let me draw another magnet.
6:18
Actually, let me erase all of this.
6:23
All right.
6:24
So let me draw two more magnets.
6:32
We know from experimentation when we were all kids, this is
6:36
the north pole, this is the south pole.
6:38
That the north pole is going to be attracted to the south
6:43
pole of another magnet.
6:45
And that if I were to flip this magnet around, it would
6:48
actually repel north-- two north facing magnets would
6:52
repel each other.
6:54
And so we have this notion, just like we had in
6:56
electrostatics, that a magnet generates a field.
7:01
It generates these vectors around it, that if you put
7:05
something in that field that can be affected by it, it'll
7:09
be some net force acting on it.
7:15
So actually, before I go into magnetic field, I actually
7:17
want to make one huge distinction between magnetism
7:24
and electrostatics.
7:25
Magnetism always comes in the form of a dipole.
7:30
What does a dipole mean?
7:30
It means that we have two poles.
7:32
A north and a south.
7:34
In electrostatics, you do have two charges.
7:40
You have a positive charge and a negative charge.
7:43
So you do have two charges.
7:44
But they could be by themselves.
7:46
You could just have a proton.
7:48
You don't have to have an electron there
7:49
right next to it.
7:50
You could just have a proton and it would create a positive
7:54
electrostatic field.
7:56
And our field lines are what a positive point
7:57
charge would do.
7:59
And it would be repelled.
8:00
So you don't always have to have a negative charge there.
8:05
Similarly you could just have an electron.
8:07
And you don't have to have a proton there.
8:08
So you could have monopoles.
8:10
These are called monopoles, when you just have one charge
8:12
when you're talking about electrostatics.
8:14
But with magnetism you always have a dipole.
8:17
If I were to take this magnet, this one right here, and if I
8:20
were to cut it in half, somehow miraculously each of
8:28
those halves of that magnet will turn
8:30
into two more magnets.
8:31
Where this will be the south, this'll be the north, this'll
8:34
be the south, this will be the north.
8:36
And actually, theoretically, I've read-- my own abilities
8:41
don't go this far-- there could be such a thing as a
8:44
magnetic monopole, although it has not been
8:46
observed yet in nature.
8:48
So everything we've seen in nature has been a dipole.
8:51
So you could just keep cutting this up, all the way down to
8:54
if it's just one electron left.
8:56
And it actually turns out that even one electron is still a
8:59
magnetic dipole.
9:00
It still is generating, it still has a north pole and a
9:04
south pole.
9:05
And actually it turns out, all magnets, the magnetic field is
9:08
actually generated by the electrons within it.
9:12
By the spin of electrons and that-- you know, when we talk
9:14
about electron spin we imagine some little
9:16
ball of charge spinning.
9:18
But electrons are-- you know, it's hard to--
9:20
they do have mass.
9:21
But it starts to get fuzzy whether they
9:23
are energy or mass.
9:24
And then how does a ball of energy spin?
9:26
Et cetera, et cetera.
9:27
So it gets very almost metaphysical.
9:31
So I don't want to go too far into it.
9:33
And frankly, I don't think you really can get an intuition.
9:35
It is almost-- it is a realm that we don't
9:38
normally operate in.
9:39
But even these large magnets you deal with, the magnetic
9:43
field is generated by the electron spins inside of it
9:47
and by the actual magnetic fields generated by the
9:51
electron motion around the protons.
9:53
Well, I hope I'm not overwhelming you.
9:56
And you might say, well, how come sometimes a metal bar can
9:58
be magnetized and sometimes it won't be?
10:00
Well, when all of the electrons are doing random
10:02
different things in a metal bar, then it's not magnetized.
10:06
Because the magnetic spins, or the magnetism created by the
10:10
electrons are all canceling each other out,
10:11
because it's random.
10:12
But if you align the spins of the electrons, and if you
10:16
align their rotations, then you will have a magnetically
10:20
charged bar.
10:21
But anyway, I'm past the ten-minute mark, but hopefully
10:23
that gives you a little bit of a working knowledge of
10:26
what a magnet is.
10:27
And in the next video, I will show what the effect is.
10:31
Well, one, I'll explain how we think about a magnetic field.
10:34
And then what the effect of a magnetic
10:36
field is on an electron.
10:38
Or not an electron, on a moving charge.

0:00
I've now done a bunch of videos on thermodynamics, both
0:04
in the chemistry and the physics playlist, and I
0:07
realized that I have yet to give you, or at least if my
0:09
memory serves me correctly, I have yet to give you the first
0:12
law of thermodynamics.
0:13
And I think now is as good a time as any.
0:17
The first law of thermodynamics.
0:24
And it's a good one.
0:26
It tells us that energy-- I'll do it in this magenta color--
0:32
energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be
0:38
transformed from one form or another.
0:41
So energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
0:56
So let's think about a couple of examples of this.
0:59
And we've touched on this when we learned mechanics and
1:02
kinetics in our physics playlist, and we've done a
1:07
bunch of this in the chemistry playlist as well.
1:10
So let's say I have some rock that I just throw as fast as I
1:15
can straight up.
1:17
Maybe it's a ball of some kind.
1:19
So I throw a ball straight up.
1:21
That arrow represents its velocity vector, right?
1:24
it's going to go up in the air.
1:25
Let me do it here.
1:27
I throw a ball and it's going to go up in the air.
1:29
It's going to decelerate due to gravity.
1:31
And at some point, up here, the ball is not going to have
1:35
any velocity.
1:36
So at this point it's going to slow down a little bit, at
1:39
this point it's going to slow down a little bit more.
1:41
And at this point it's going to be completely stationary
1:42
and then it's going to start accelerating downwards.
1:45
In fact, it was always accelerating downwards.
1:46
It was decelerating upwards, and then it'll start
1:49
accelerating downwards.
1:50
So here its velocity will look like that.
1:52
And here its velocity will look like that.
1:53
Then right when it gets back to the ground, if we assume
1:56
negligible air resistance, its velocity will be the same
1:59
magnitude as the upward but in the downward direction.
2:03
So when we looked at this example, and we've done this
2:05
tons in the projectile motion videos in the physics
2:09
playlist, over here we said, look, we have some kinetic
2:13
energy here.
2:13
And that makes sense.
2:14
I think, to all of us, energy intuitively means that you're
2:18
doing something.
2:19
So kinetic energy.
2:21
Energy of movement, of kinetics.
2:23
It's moving, so it has energy.
2:25
But then as we decelerate up here, we clearly have no
2:29
kinetic energy, zero kinetic energy.
2:34
So where did our energy go?
2:35
I just told you the first law of thermodynamics, that energy
2:38
cannot be created or destroyed.
2:40
But I clearly had a lot of kinetic energy over here, and
2:43
we've seen the formula for that multiple times, and here
2:46
I have no kinetic energy.
2:48
So I clearly destroyed kinetic energy, but the first law of
2:53
thermodynamics tells me that I can't do that.
2:55
So I must have transformed that kinetic energy.
2:58
I must have transformed that kinetic energy
3:00
into something else.
3:01
And in the case of this ball, I've transformed it into
3:04
potential energy.
3:05
So now I have potential energy.
3:08
And I won't go into the math of it, but potential energy is
3:10
just the potential to turn into other forms of energy.
3:17
I guess that's the easy way to do it.
3:18
But the way to think about it is, look, the ball is really
3:20
high up here, and by virtue of its position in the universe,
3:24
if something doesn't stop it, it's going to fall back down,
3:28
or it's going to be converted into another form of energy.
3:30
Now let me ask you another question.
3:32
Let's say I throw this ball up and let's say we actually do
3:34
have some air resistance.
3:36
So I throw the ball up.
3:38
I have a lot of kinetic energy here.
3:41
Then at the peak of where the ball is, it's all potential
3:46
energy, the kinetic energy has disappeared.
3:49
And let's say I have air resistance.
3:50
So when the ball comes back down, the air was kind of
3:53
slowing it down, so when it reaches this bottom point,
3:57
it's not going as fast as I threw it.
4:01
So when I reach this bottom point here, my ball is going a
4:04
lot slower than I threw it up to begin with.
4:07
And so if you think about what happened, I have a lot of
4:09
kinetic energy here.
4:10
I'll give you the formula.
4:11
The kinetic energy is the mass of the ball, times the
4:14
velocity of the ball, squared, over 2.
4:17
That's the kinetic energy over here.
4:19
And then I throw it.
4:20
It all turns into potential energy.
4:22
Then it comes back down, and turns into kinetic energy.
4:24
But because of air resistance, I have a
4:26
smaller velocity here.
4:28
I have a smaller velocity than I did there.
4:31
Kinetic energy is only dependent on the magnitude of
4:33
the velocity.
4:34
I could put a little absolute sign there to show that we're
4:37
dealing with the magnitude of the velocity.
4:39
So I clearly have a lower kinetic energy here.
4:42
So lower kinetic energy here than I did here, right?
4:50
And I don't have any potential energy left.
4:52
Let's say this is the ground.
4:54
We've hit the ground.
4:55
So I have another conundrum.
4:57
You know, when I went from kinetic energy to no kinetic
5:00
energy there, I can go to the first law and
5:02
say, oh, what happened?
5:03
And the first law says, oh, Sal, it all turned into
5:05
potential energy up here.
5:07
And you saw it turned into potential energy because when
5:09
the ball accelerated back down, it turned back into
5:12
kinetic energy.
5:12
But then I say, no, Mr. First Law of Thermodynamics, look,
5:17
at this point I have no potential energy, and I had
5:20
all kinetic energy and I had a lot of kinetic energy.
5:22
Now at this point, I have no potential energy once again,
5:26
but I have less kinetic energy.
5:27
My ball has fallen at a slower rate than I
5:30
threw it to begin with.
5:31
And the thermodynamics says, oh, well that's
5:33
because you have air.
5:34
And I'd say, well I do have air, but where
5:36
did the energy go?
5:37
And then the first law of thermodynamics says, oh, when
5:41
your ball was falling-- let me see, that's the ball.
5:47
Let me make the ball yellow.
5:50
So when your ball was falling, it was rubbing
5:52
up against air particles.
5:54
It was rubbing up against molecules of air.
5:59
And right where the molecules bumped into the wall, there's
6:02
a little bit of friction.
6:04
Friction is just essentially, your ball made these molecules
6:08
that it was bumping into vibrate a little bit faster.
6:11
And essentially, if you think about it, if you go back to
6:13
the macrostate/ microstate problem or descriptions that
6:16
we talked about, this ball is essentially transferring its
6:20
kinetic energy to the molecules of air that it rubs
6:24
up against as it falls back down.
6:26
And actually it was doing it on the way up as well.
6:28
And so that kinetic energy that you think you lost or you
6:32
destroyed at the bottom, of here, because your ball's
6:34
going a lot slower, was actually transferred to a lot
6:36
of air particles.
6:38
It was a lot of-- to a bunch of air particles.
6:41
Now, it's next to impossible to measure exactly the kinetic
6:45
energy that was done on each individual air particle,
6:47
because we don't even know what their microstates were to
6:49
begin with.
6:50
But what we can say is, in general I transferred some
6:53
heat to these particles.
6:56
I raised the temperature of the air particles that the
7:01
ball fell through by rubbing those particles or giving them
7:05
kinetic energy.
7:06
Remember, temperature is just a measure of kinetic-- and
7:10
temperature is a macrostate or kind of a gross way or a macro
7:14
way, of looking at the kinetic energy of
7:17
the individual molecules.
7:18
It's very hard to measure each of theirs, but if you say on
7:21
average their kinetic energy is x, you're essentially
7:22
giving an indication of temperature.
7:24
So that's where it went.
7:25
It went to heat.
7:27
And heat is another form of energy.
7:29
So that the first law of thermodynamics
7:30
says, I still hold.
7:32
You had a lot of kinetic energy, turned into potential,
7:36
that turned into less kinetic energy.
7:37
And where did the remainder go?
7:39
It turned into heat.
7:40
Because it transferred that kinetic energy to these air
7:44
particles in the surrounding medium.
7:47
Fair enough.
7:49
So now that we have that out of the way, how do we measure
7:51
the amount of energy that something contains?
7:57
And here we have something called the internal energy.
8:00
The internal energy of a system.
8:03
Once again this is a macrostate, or you could call
8:06
it a macro description of what's going on.
8:08
This is called u for internal.
8:10
The way I remember that is that the word internal does
8:13
not begin with a U.
8:15
U for internal energy.
8:25
Let me go back to my example-- that I had in the past, that I
8:30
did in our previous video, if you're watching these in
8:33
order-- of I have, you know, some gas with some movable
8:39
ceiling at the top.
8:40
That's its movable ceiling.
8:42
That can move up and down.
8:43
We have a vacuum up there.
8:44
And I have some gas in here.
8:50
The internal energy literally is all of the energy that's in
8:53
the system.
8:54
So it includes, and for our purposes, especially when
8:58
you're in a first-year chemistry course, it's the
9:01
kinetic energy of all the atoms or molecules.
9:10
And in a future video, I'll actually calculate it for how
9:13
much kinetic energy is there in a container.
9:16
And that'll actually be our internal energy plus all of
9:19
the other energy.
9:19
So these atoms, they have some kinetic energy because they
9:22
have some translational motion, if we look at the
9:24
microstates.
9:25
If they're just individual atoms, you can't really say
9:28
that they're rotating, because what does it mean for an atom
9:30
to rotate, right?
9:31
Because its electrons are just jumping around anyway.
9:34
So if they're individual atoms they can't rotate, but if
9:36
they're molecules they can rotate, if it looks
9:38
something like that.
9:40
There could be some rotational energy there.
9:43
It includes that.
9:44
If we have bonds-- so I just drew a molecule.
9:47
The molecule has bonds.
9:49
Those bonds contain some energy.
9:51
That is also included in the internal energy.
9:53
If I have some electrons, let's say that this was not
9:56
a-- well I'm doing it using a gas, and gases aren't good
9:59
conductors-- but let's say I'm doing it for a solid.
10:03
So I'm using the wrong tools.
10:05
So let's say I have some metal.
10:11
Those are my metal-- let me do more-- my metal atoms. And in
10:16
that metal atom, I have, a bunch of electrons-- well
10:21
that's the same color-- I have a bunch of-- let me use a
10:24
suitably different color-- I have a bunch
10:26
of electrons here.
10:29
And I have fewer here.
10:31
So these electrons really want to get here.
10:33
Maybe they're being stopped for some reason, so they have
10:35
some electrical potential.
10:37
Maybe there's a gap here, you know, where they can't conduct
10:40
or something like that.
10:41
Internal energy includes that as well.
10:43
That's normally the scope out of what you'd see in a
10:45
first-year chemistry class.
10:46
But it includes that.
10:47
It also includes literally every form of energy that
10:51
exists here.
10:52
It also includes, for example, in a metal, if we were to heat
10:54
this metal up they start vibrating, right?
10:57
They start moving left and right, or up or down, or in
11:00
every possible direction.
11:01
And if you think about a molecule or an atom that's
11:04
vibrating, it's going from here, and then it goes there,
11:09
then it goes back there.
11:10
It goes back and forth, right?
11:12
And if you think about what's happening, when it's in the
11:14
middle point it has a lot of kinetic energy, but at this
11:17
point right here, when it's about to go back, it's
11:19
completely stationary for a super small moment.
11:23
And at that point, all of its kinetic energy
11:25
is potential energy.
11:26
And then it turns into kinetic energy.
11:27
Then it goes back to potential energy again.
11:29
It's kind of like a pendulum, or it's
11:30
actually harmonic motion.
11:33
So in this case, internal energy also includes the
11:37
kinetic energy for the molecules that are moving
11:38
fast. But it also includes the potential energies for the
11:42
molecules that are vibrating, they're at that point where
11:44
they don't have kinetic energy.
11:45
So it also includes potential energy.
11:47
So internal energy is literally all of the energy
11:52
that's in a system.
11:54
And for most of what we're going to do, you can assume
11:58
that we're dealing with an ideal gas.
12:00
Instead of, it becomes a lot more complicated with solids,
12:02
and conductivity, and vibrations and all that.
12:05
We're going to assume we're dealing with an ideal gas.
12:07
And even better, we're going to assume we're dealing with a
12:09
monoatomic ideal gas.
12:11
And maybe this is just helium, or neon.
12:15
One of the ideal gases.
12:16
They don't want to bond with each other.
12:18
They don't form molecules with each other.
12:23
Let's just assume that they're not.
12:25
They're just individual atoms. And in that case, the internal
12:32
energy, we really can simplify to it being the kinetic
12:35
energy, if we ignore all of these other things.
12:37
But it's important to realize, internal energy is everything.
12:39
It's all of the energy inside of a system.
12:44
If you said, what's the energy of the system?
12:45
Its internal energy.
12:48
So the first law of thermodynamics says that
12:52
energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
12:56
So let's say that internal energy is changing.
12:59
So I have this system, and someone tells me, look, the
13:03
internal energy is changing.
13:06
So delta U, that's just a capital delta that says, what
13:09
is the change an internal energy?
13:10
It's saying, look, if your internal energy is changing,
13:14
your system is either having something done to it, or it's
13:17
doing something to someone else.
13:18
Some energy is being transferred to it
13:20
or away from it.
13:22
So, how do we write that?
13:24
Well the first law of thermodynamics, or even the
13:27
definition of internal energy, says that a change in internal
13:29
energy is equal to heat added to the system-- and once again
13:35
a very intuitive letter for heat, because heat does not
13:40
start with Q, but the convention is
13:43
to use Q for heat.
13:45
The letter h is reserved for enthalpy, which is a very,
13:49
very, very similar concept to heat.
13:51
We'll talk about that maybe in the next video.
13:54
It's equal to the heat added to the system, minus the work
13:59
done by the system.
14:03
And you could see this multiple ways.
14:05
Sometimes it's written like this.
14:06
Sometimes it's written that the change in internal energy
14:10
is equal to the heat added to the system, plus the work done
14:18
on the system.
14:19
And this might be very confusing, but you should just
14:21
always-- and we'll really kind of look at this 100 different
14:25
ways in the next video.
14:25
And actually this is a capital U.
14:27
Let me make sure that I write that as a capital U.
14:29
But we're going to do it 100 different ways.
14:31
But if you think about it, if I'm doing work I lose energy.
14:35
I've transferred the energy to someone else.
14:37
So this is doing work.
14:41
Likewise, if someone is giving me heat that is increasing my
14:45
energy, at least to me these are reasonably intuitive
14:48
definitions.
14:48
Now if you see this, you say, OK, if my energy is going up,
14:54
if this is a positive thing, I either have to have this go
14:57
up, or work is being done to me.
15:05
Or energy is being transferred into my system.
15:09
I'll give a lot more examples of what exactly that means in
15:11
the next video.
15:12
But I just want to make you comfortable
15:14
with either of these.
15:15
Because you're going to see them all the time, and you
15:16
might even get confused even if your teacher
15:18
uses only one of them.
15:19
But you should always do this reality check.
15:22
When something does work, it is transferring energy to
15:25
something else, right?
15:27
So if you're doing work, it'll take away, this is taking
15:30
away, your internal energy.
15:32
Likewise, heat transfer is another way for energy to go
15:36
from one system to another, or from one entity to another.
15:40
So if my total energy is going up, maybe heat is being added
15:45
to my system.
15:46
If my energy is going down, either heat is being taken
15:51
away from my system, or I'm doing more work on something.
15:55
I'll do a bunch of examples with that.
15:57
And I'm just going to leave you with this video with some
15:59
other notation that you might see.
16:01
You might see change in internal energy is equal to
16:05
change-- let me write it again-- change in internal
16:09
energy, capital U.
16:11
You'll sometimes see it as, they'll write a delta Q, which
16:14
kind of implies change in heat.
16:17
But I'll explain it in a future video why that doesn't
16:18
make a full sense, but you'll see this a lot.
16:21
But you can also view this as the heat added to the system,
16:24
minus the change in work, which is a little
16:28
non-intuitive because when you talk about heat or work you're
16:30
talking about transferring of energy.
16:32
So when you talk about change in transfer it becomes a
16:33
little-- So sometimes a delta work, they just mean this
16:36
means that work done by a system.
16:41
So obviously if you have some energy, you do some work,
16:44
you've lost that energy, you've given it to someone
16:46
else, you'd have a minus sign there.
16:48
Or you might see it written like this, change in internal
16:52
energy is equal to heat added-- I won't say even this
16:58
kind of reads to me as change in heat.
16:59
I'll just call this the heat added-- plus the work done
17:06
onto the system.
17:07
So this is work done to, this is work done by the system.
17:15
Either way.
17:16
And you shouldn't even memorize this, you should just
17:19
always think about it a little bit.
17:20
If I'm doing work I'm going to lose energy.
17:22
If work is done to me I'm going to gain energy.
17:24
If I lose heat, if this is a negative number, I'm going to
17:27
lose energy.
17:29
If I gain heat I'm going to gain energy.
17:31
Anyway, I'll leave you there for this video, and in the
17:33

Voiceover: What I want to talk about in this video
0:01
are the notions of Electronegativity,
0:05
electro, negati, negativity,
0:13
and a closely, and a closely related
0:15
idea of Electron Affinity, electron affinity.
0:22
And they're so closely related that in general,
0:24
if something has a high electronegativity,
0:27
they have a high electron affinity,
0:29
but what does this mean?
0:31
Well, electron affinity is how much does that atom
0:34
attract electrons, how much does it like electrons?
0:37
Does it want, does it maybe want more electrons?
0:41
Electronegativity is a little bit more specific.
0:45
It's when that atom is part of a covalent bond,
0:49
when it is sharing electrons with another atom,
0:53
how likely is it or how badly does it want
0:55
to hog the electrons in that covalent bond?
0:58
Now what do I mean by hogging electrons?
1:01
So let me make, let me write this down.
1:03
So how badly wants to hog,
1:13
and this is an informal definition clearly,
1:15
hog electrons, keep the electrons,
1:18
to spend more of their time closer to them
1:20
then to the other party in the covalent bond.
1:23
And this is how, how much they like electrons,
1:28
or how much affinity they have towards electrons.
1:32
So how much they want electrons.
1:39
And you can see that these are very,
1:41
these are very related notions.
1:43
This is within the context of a covalent bond,
1:45
how much electron affinity is there?
1:47
Well this, you can think of it as a slightly broader notion,
1:50
but these two trends go absolutely in line with each other.
1:54
And to think about, to just think about
1:55
electronegativity makes it a little bit more tangible.
1:58
Let's think about one of the most famous
1:59
sets of covalent bonds,
2:00
and that's what you see in a water molecule.
2:03
Water, as you probably know, is H two O,
2:07
you have an oxygen atom,
2:11
and you have two hydrogens.
2:13
Each of the hydrogen's have one valence electron,
2:17
and the oxygen has, we see here, at it's outermost shell,
2:21
it has one, two, three, four, five, six valence electrons.
2:25
One, two, three, four, five, six valence electrons.
2:31
And so you can imagine, hydrogen would be happy
2:33
if it was able to somehow pretend like it had another
2:35
electron then it would have an electron configuration
2:37
a stable, first shell that only requires two electrons,
2:41
the rest of them require eight,
2:42
hydrogen would feel, hey I'm stable like helium
2:45
if it could get another electron.
2:46
And oxygen would feel, hey I'm stable like neon
2:49
if I could get two more electrons.
2:51
And so what happens is they share each other's electrons.
2:53
This, this electron can be shared in conjunction
2:57
with this electron for this hydrogen.
2:59
So that hydrogen can kind of feel like it's using
3:01
both and it gets more stable,
3:03
it stabilizes the outer shell,
3:04
or it stabilizes the hydrogen.
3:06
And likewise, that electron could be,
3:08
can be shared with the hydrogen,
3:10
and the hydrogen can kind of feel more like helium.
3:13
And then this oxygen can feel like
3:14
it's a quid pro quo,
3:16
it's getting something in exchange for something else.
3:18
It's getting the electron, an electron,
3:20
it's sharing an electron from each of these hydrogens,
3:22
and so it can feel like it's, that it stabilizes it,
3:26
similar to a, similar to a neon.
3:30
But when you have these covalent bonds,
3:32
only in the case where they are equally
3:34
electronegative would you have a case
3:35
where maybe they're sharing,
3:37
and even there what happens
3:38
in the rest of the molecule might matter,
3:40
but when you have something like this,
3:42
where you have oxygen and hydrogen,
3:43
they don't have the same electronegativity.
3:45
Oxygen likes to hog electrons more than hydrogen does.
3:49
And so these electrons are not gonna spend
3:51
an even amount of time.
3:52
Here I did it kind of just drawing these,
3:54
you know, these valence electrons as these dots.
3:57
But as we know, the electrons are in this
3:59
kind of blur around, around the,
4:03
around the actual nuclei,
4:06
around the atoms that make up the atoms.
4:09
And so, in this type of a covalent bond,
4:11
the electrons, the two electrons that this bond represents,
4:15
are going to spend more time around the oxygen
4:18
then they are going to spend around the hydrogen.
4:20
And these, these two electrons are gonna spend
4:23
more time around the oxygen,
4:25
then are going to spend around the hydrogen.
4:27
And we know that because oxygen is more electronegative,
4:30
and we'll talk about the trends in a second.
4:31
This is a really important idea in chemistry,
4:34
and especially later on as you study organic chemistry.
4:36
Because, because we know that
4:39
oxygen is more electronegative,
4:40
and the electrons spend more time
4:41
around oxygen then around hydrogen,
4:44
it creates a partial negative charge on this side,
4:47
and partial positive charges on this side right over here,
4:50
which is why water has many of the properties that it does,
4:55
and we go into much more in depth in that in other videos.
4:59
And also when you study organic chemistry,
5:00
a lot of the likely reactions that are
5:02
going to happen can be predicted,
5:04
or a lot of the likely molecules that form
5:06
can be predicted based on elecronegativity.
5:09
And especially when you start going
5:10
into oxidation numbers and things like that,
5:12
electronegativity will tell you a lot.
5:15
So now that we know what electronegativity is,
5:19
let's think a little bit about what is,
5:21
as we go through, as we start,
5:24
as we go through, as we go through a period,
5:27
as say as we start in group one,
5:29
and we go to group, and as we go all the way
5:35
all the way to, let's say the halogens,
5:38
all the way up to the yellow column right over here,
5:42
what do you think is going to be
5:44
the trend for electronegativity?
5:47
And once again, one way to think about it
5:49
is to think about the extremes.
5:50
Think about sodium, and think about chlorine,
5:53
and I encourage you to pause
5:54
the video and think about that.
5:56
Assuming you've had a go at it,
5:58
and it's in some ways the same idea,
6:01
or it's a similar idea as ionization energy.
6:03
Something like sodium has only one electron
6:06
in it's outer most shell.
6:07
It'd be hard for it to complete that shell,
6:09
and so to get to a stable state it's much easier
6:12
for it to give away that one electron that it has,
6:15
so it can get to a stable configuration like neon.
6:18
So this one really wants to give away an electron.
6:22
And we saw in the video on ionization energy,
6:24
that's why this has a low ionization energy,
6:26
it doesn't take much energy, in a gaseous state,
6:29
to remove an electron from sodium.
6:32
But chlorine is the opposite.
6:33
It's only one away from completing it's shell.
6:35
The last thing it wants to do is give away electron,
6:37
it wants an electron really, really, really, really badly
6:40
so it can get to a configuration of argon,
6:42
so it can complete it's third shell.
6:45
So the logic here is that sodium wouldn't mind
6:49
giving away an electron,
6:50
while chlorine really would love an electron.
6:52
So chlorine is more likely to hog electrons,
6:55
while sodium is very unlikely to hog electrons.
6:59
So this trend right here,
7:00
when you go from the left to the right,
7:02
your electronegativity, let me write this,
7:04
your getting more electronegative.
7:07
More electro, electronegative, as you,
7:13
as you go to the right.
7:16
Now what do you think the trend is going to be
7:18
as you go down, as you go down in a group?
7:22
What do you think the trend is going to be as you go down?
7:25
Well I'll give you a hint.
7:27
Think about, think about atomic radii, and given that,
7:31
pause the video and think about
7:31
what do you think the trend is?
7:32
Are we gonna get more or less electronegative
7:34
as we move down?
7:36
So once again I'm assuming you've given a go at it,
7:39
so as we know, from the video on atomic radii,
7:41
our atom is getting larger, and larger, and larger,
7:44
as we add more and more and more shells.
7:46
And so cesium has one electron in it's outer most shell,
7:50
in the sixth shell,
7:52
while, say, lithium has one electron.
7:55
Everything here, all the group one elements,
7:57
have one electron in it's outer most shell,
7:59
but that fifty fifth electron,
8:01
that one electron in the outer most shell in cesium,
8:03
is a lot further away then the outer most electron
8:05
in lithium or in hydrogen.
8:08
And so because of that, it's, well one,
8:12
there's more interference between that electron and the
8:14
nucleus from all the other electrons in between them,
8:16
and also it's just further away,
8:18
so it's easier to kind of grab it off.
8:20
So cesium is very likely to give up,
8:24
it's very likely to give up electrons.
8:27
It's much more likely to give up electrons than hydrogen.
8:30
So, as you go down a given group,
8:33
you're becoming less, less electronegative, electronegative.
8:39
So what, what are, based on this,
8:41
what are going to be the most electronegative
8:44
of all the atoms?
8:46
Well they're going to be the ones
8:47
that are in the top and the right of the periodic table,
8:50
they're going to be these right over here.
8:52
These are going to be the most electronegative,
8:54
Sometimes we don't think as much about the noble gases
8:56
because they aren't, they aren't really that reactive,
8:59
they don't even form covalent bond,
9:01
because they're just happy.
9:02
While these characters up here,
9:03
they sometimes will form covalent bonds,
9:06
and when they do, they really like to hog those electrons.
9:09
Now what are the least electronegative,
9:11
sometimes called very electropositive?
9:13
Well these things down here in the bottom left.
9:15
These, over here, they have only,
9:18
you know in the case of cesium,
9:19
they have one electron to give away
9:21
that would take them to a stable state like, like xenon,
9:25
or in the case of these group two elements
9:27
they might have to give away two,
9:28
but it's much easier to give away two
9:29
then to gain a whole bunch of them.
9:31
And they're big, they're big atoms.
9:34
So those outer most electrons are getting
9:35
less attracted to the positive nucleus.
9:39
So the trend in the periodic table
9:40
as you go from the bottom left,
9:42
to the top right,
9:44
you're getting more, more electro, electronegative.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Rr7LhdSKMxY,

Let's continue with our study of the planet Lubricon VI.
0:04
Now the one thing I did not tell you in the last video
0:07
is that Lubricon VI is not rotating at all.
0:14
And because it's not rotating, it
0:15
can really not have an equator.
0:18
So when we talked about in the path of this frozen sock,
0:21
instead of saying it's traveling across an equator,
0:23
I should say it's traveling along a great circle.
0:25
If you assume that earth is a sphere--
0:27
and it's not a perfect sphere-- but if you assume
0:29
it's a sphere, our equator would be a perfect sphere.
0:32
But in order to have an equator, you need to have some rotation.
0:35
This right over here, we'll just say
0:36
it's traveling along the largest possible circle
0:40
that it can travel along.
0:41
It's traveling along one of the great circles of this sphere,
0:44
this block of sock right over there.
0:46
And now that we know it's not rotating,
0:48
I want to enter another thought experiment.
0:50
Because this little frozen block of sock is not the only thing
0:54
that's on the surface of Lubricon VI.
0:58
Over here-- we were viewing it at a distance--
1:01
but right over there, if we were to zoom in,
1:03
you would see sitting on the surface of Lubricon VI--
1:08
so once again, that's the surface-- is a frozen banana.
1:12
So this right over here is a block of ice.
1:16
And in that block of ice we have a banana.
1:19
It's a frozen banana.
1:21
So that's my best attempt at drawing our banana.
1:25
And this relative to the surface of Lubricon VI
1:29
is absolutely stationary.
1:32
It has absolutely no tangential velocity like this block had
1:36
and will continue to have for all eternity.
1:39
This has absolutely no tangential velocity.
1:42
And so my question for you, if we
1:44
think about what are the forces acting on this?
1:48
Well, we have the force of gravity
1:51
towards the center of Lubricon VI.
1:53
So we have the force of gravity.
1:55
And I'm drawing all the forces from the center
1:57
of mass of this block of banana.
1:59
So once again, let me draw that same color.
2:01
We have the force of gravity acting radially inward.
2:10
And then we know that this banana is not
2:12
plummeting straight into the center of the Earth.
2:14
There must be some other force that is keeping it stationary.
2:19
And that force is the force of the surface
2:21
of Lubricon VI on the banana or on this block that's keeping it
2:26
from plunging towards the center of the planet.
2:29
So that, in this case, is the normal force.
2:37
And my question to you is, are these two things
2:42
equal in the case of the banana?
2:47
Well, as far as we can tell, this banana
2:49
is completely at rest.
2:50
This planet right over here, at least relative to the planet,
2:54
this planet right here has absolutely no rotation.
2:57
And this banana has no relative motion towards the planet.
3:01
It is not accelerating in absolutely any direction.
3:04
And if it's not accelerating in any direction,
3:07
the net forces on it in any dimension
3:10
must all or must be 0, or all of the forces
3:13
must cancel out with each other.
3:15
So in the case of this banana, the normal force exactly
3:20
cancels out the force of gravity.
3:22
These two things, the normal force
3:26
is exactly equal to the inward force of gravity.
3:30
Or I guess we should say that they add to 0.
3:32
They're going in opposite directions.
3:34
So I should say the normal force plus the force of gravity
3:40
are going to be equal 0.
3:41
They have the same exact magnitude.
3:43
They're going in opposite directions.
3:45
So when you add them together, they are going to cancel out.
3:49
Now, with that little thought experiment out of the way,
3:52
let's return to the frozen sock.
3:55
The frozen sock, as we already learned,
3:57
is orbiting around this planet at a altitude of 0
4:02
for all eternity at 1 kilometer per hour.
4:05
And we know that the force of gravity
4:07
is acting on it towards the center of the planet
4:09
and there is a normal force that's
4:11
keeping it from plummeting, from spiraling
4:14
towards the center of the planet.
4:15
But my question to you is, in the case of the frozen sock
4:19
right over here, are these two forces
4:22
equal like they are for the banana?
4:29
So in the case of the frozen sock, the traveling,
4:32
orbiting sock, if these two forces had the same magnitude,
4:39
but just going in opposite directions the way
4:41
we've drawn it right over here, it would completely cancel out.
4:44
And then we would have no net force.
4:47
So let me make it clear.
4:48
If the normal force plus the force of gravity
4:55
canceled out with each other, if this equalled 0,
4:58
then we would have absolutely no net force
5:03
and the object would not accelerate in any direction.
5:06
An object in motion will stay in motion.
5:09
So this one right over here, if it
5:10
had no net force acting on it, it
5:13
would not stay on the surface of the planet.
5:16
It would just travel in a straight line,
5:18
in a tangential line from where it happens to be at this moment
5:20
forever.
5:21
So if it was right over here-- I know this isn't the path,
5:24
it would just keep traveling forever
5:26
off the surface of the planet.
5:30
We know that clearly is not what's happening.
5:32
It is orbiting around the planet.
5:34
It has a circular path.
5:36
And since it has a circular path--
5:39
so if I were to draw a cross-section of its--
5:41
if I were to look at its path from the side,
5:43
it has a circular path like that.
5:45
It is going like that.
5:46
It is constantly being accelerated inward.
5:52
There is some centripetal acceleration
5:55
going on, inward acceleration.
5:58
So in order for that inward acceleration to be going on,
6:01
there must be some net inward force.
6:04
So in this situation, in the situation for the stationary
6:07
banana, these two guys cancelled each other out.
6:11
But for the case of the moving frozen sock, the sock that
6:15
is orbiting for all of eternity, it is in orbit.
6:18
It has a circular path.
6:20
So there are centripetal motion.
6:22
There is some net inward force going on here.
6:25
So
6:25
In this situation, the magnitude of the force of gravity
6:32
is going to be greater than the magnitude of the normal force.
6:40
So we don't have this situation.
6:41
In that situation, you wouldn't orbit.
6:43
We have the situation where you do
6:45
have some net centripetal force.
6:47
The force of gravity, the magnitude of it,
6:49
is slightly larger than the magnitude of the normal force.
6:53
And an interesting thing to think about,
6:55
and we might address it in a future tutorial,
6:57
is what would happen if this started going faster and faster
7:01
and faster, if the frozen sock were to accelerate.
7:04
What then?

0:00
- [Voiceover] We've already talked about how DNA's structure
0:03
as this double helix, this twisted ladder,
0:05
makes it suitable for being the molecular basis of heredity.
0:10
And what we wanna do in this video is get
0:11
a better appreciation for why it is suitable,
0:14
and the mechanism by which it is
0:16
the molecular basis for heredity.
0:18
And we're gonna focus on a conceptual level,
0:19
I'm not gonna go into all of the,
0:21
I guess you could say biochemical details.
0:23
Really just give you the conceptual idea of what happens.
0:26
So right over here this could be a fragment of DNA,
0:30
I have, what, I have--
0:31
This is eight base pairs depicted.
0:34
And just to be clear, and we talked about this
0:35
in the introductory video to DNA,
0:37
DNA is much more than, you know, a handful of base pairs.
0:42
The DNA molecule can be tens of millions of base pairs long.
0:47
So for example this might be a section
0:49
of a much longer molecule,
0:51
so the much longer strand of DNA,
0:54
and even there I'm probably not giving justice to it.
0:57
But this might just be this very, very small section,
1:03
let me do this in a different color,
1:04
this little section right over here,
1:06
zoomed in.
1:08
So once again it might be part of a molecule
1:10
that has not seven or eight base pairs,
1:13
but might have 70 million base pairs.
1:16
So just like that.
1:20
So let's understand what a molecular basis of heredity
1:23
would need to do.
1:25
Well first of all it would need to be replicable.
1:27
Or we would need to be able to replicate it.
1:31
As a cell divides,
1:32
the two new cells would want to have
1:35
the same genetic material.
1:37
So how does DNA replicate?
1:39
And this process is called replication.
1:45
And we covered this in the introduction video as well,
1:47
but it's nice to see the different processes
1:49
next to each other.
1:51
And replication, you can imagine taking
1:54
either splitting these two sides of the ladder,
1:58
and actually let's do that.
2:00
So let me copy and paste,
2:03
so if I take that side right over there,
2:06
so let me copy and then paste it.
2:10
And then there we go,
2:12
a little bit of it is dropping below the video
2:15
but I think that serves the purpose.
2:18
And then let's copy and paste the other side.
2:23
So let me select that.
2:28
And then I copy and then I paste,
2:32
and it's just like that.
2:35
And so you can imagine if you were to split these,
2:38
these things you could call them two sides of the ladder,
2:41
that either side could be used to construct the other side.
2:43
And then you would have two strands,
2:45
two identical strands of the DNA.
2:49
And so let's see what that actually looks like.
2:52
So let me get my pen tool out now,
2:54
let me deselect this, get the pen tool out.
2:58
It's a new tool I'm using,
2:59
so let me make sure I'm doing it right.
3:01
Alright, so from this side,
3:02
from this left side,
3:03
or at least what we are looking at as the left side,
3:05
you can then construct another right side
3:07
based on this information.
3:09
A always pairs with T if we're talking about DNA.
3:14
So adenine pairs with thymine just like that.
3:17
Thymine pairs with adenine
3:19
Let me do that a little bit neater.
3:22
Thymine pairs with adenine,
3:26
guanine pairs with cytosine,
3:29
cytosine pairs with guanine,
3:32
falling a little bit down here.
3:33
And just like that I was able to construct
3:35
a new right hand side using that left hand side.
3:38
So maybe I'll do the new sugar phosphate
3:44
backbone in yellow.
3:45
And we can do the same thing here
3:47
using the original right hand side.
3:49
So using the original right hand side,
3:51
once again the T is paired with the A,
3:54
let me do that in adenine's color.
3:57
So we have an adenine and thymine,
3:59
adenine and thymine,
4:00
adenine and thymine.
4:02
Thymine pairs with adenine,
4:03
so thymine, adenine.
4:05
Thymine, adenine.
4:07
Guanine pairs with cytosine.
4:11
And then cytosine pairs with guanine.
4:14
So cytosine just like that.
4:17
And so you can take half of each of this ladder,
4:19
and then you can use it to construct the other half,
4:21
and what you've essentially done is
4:22
you've replicated the actual DNA.
4:25
And this is actually a kind of conceptual level
4:28
of how replication is done
4:29
before a cell divides and replicates,
4:32
and the entire cell duplicates itself.
4:35
So that's replication.
4:37
So the next thing you're probably thinking about,
4:39
""Okay, well it's nice to be able to replicate yourself
4:41
""but that's kind of useless if that information can't be
4:44
""used to define the organism in some way
4:47
""to express what's actually happening.""
4:50
And so let's think about how the genes
4:54
in this DNA molecule are actually expressed.
4:59
So I'll write this as ""expression"".
5:03
And actually that warrants a little bit of a detour
5:07
because you hear sometimes the words
5:09
DNA and chromosome and gene
5:11
used somewhat interchangeably,
5:13
and they are clearly related,
5:15
but it's worth knowing what is what.
5:17
So when you're talking about DNA
5:18
you're talking literally about this molecule here
5:21
that has this sugar phosphate base
5:23
and it has the sequence of base pairs,
5:25
it's got this double helix structure,
5:27
and so this whole thing this could be a DNA molecule.
5:29
Now when you have a DNA molecule
5:32
and it's packaged together with other molecules
5:34
and proteins and kind of given a broader structure,
5:37
then you're talking about a chromosome.
5:41
And when you're talking about a gene,
5:42
you're talking about a section of DNA
5:45
that's used to express a certain trait.
5:48
Or actually used to code for a certain type of protein.
5:53
So for example this could be,
5:55
this whole thing could be a strand of DNA,
5:57
but this part right over, let's say in orange I'll do it,
6:01
this part in orange right over here could be one gene,
6:04
it might define information for one gene,
6:09
it could define a protein,
6:11
this section right over here
6:13
could be used to define another gene.
6:17
And genes could be anywhere from
6:20
several thousand base pairs long,
6:22
all the way up into the millions.
6:24
And as we'll see,
6:25
the way that a gene is expressed,
6:27
the way we get from the information for that section of DNA
6:30
into a protein which is really how it's expressed,
6:33
is through a related molecule to DNA,
6:37
and that is RNA.
6:40
Actually let me write this down.
6:41
RNA.
6:45
So RNA stands for ribonucleic acid.
6:50
Ribonucleic acid, let me write that down.
7:02
And so you might remember that DNA is
7:04
deoxyribonucleic acid,
7:07
so the sugar backbone in RNA
7:09
is a very similar molecule,
7:11
well now it's got its oxy,
7:12
it's not deoxyribonucleic acid,
7:15
it's ribonucleic acid.
7:17
The R, let me make it clear where the RNA come from,
7:19
the R is right over there,
7:22
then you have the nucleic, that's the n,
7:27
and then it's a, acid.
7:29
Same reason why we call the DNA nucleic acid.
7:32
So you have this RNA.
7:35
So what role does this play as we are trying
7:38
to express the information in this DNA?
7:41
Well the DNA,
7:41
especially if we're talking about cells with nucleii,
7:44
the DNA sits there but that information has to
7:47
for the most part get outside of the nucleus
7:49
in order to be expressed.
7:50
And one of the functions that RNA plays
7:53
is to be that messenger,
7:54
that messenger between a certain section of DNA
7:57
and kind of what goes on outside of the nucleus,
7:59
so that that can be translated into an actual protein.
8:04
So the step that you go from DNA to mRNA,
8:07
messenger RNA,
8:08
is called transcription.
8:11
Let me write that down.
8:20
And what happens in transcription,
8:21
let's go back to looking at one side of this DNA molecule.
8:27
So let's say you have that right over there,
8:30
let me copy and paste it.
8:34
So there we go, actually I didn't wanna do that.
8:38
I wanted the other side.
8:39
So actually I think I'm on the wrong, let me go back here.
8:44
And so let me copy and then let me paste.
8:48
There we go.
8:49
So let's say you have part of this DNA molecule,
8:56
or you have 1/2 of it
8:57
just like we did when we replicated it.
8:58
But now we're not just trying to duplicate the DNA molecule,
9:01
we're actually trying to create
9:02
a corresponding mRNA molecule.
9:05
At least for that section of,
9:08
at least for that gene.
9:09
So this might be part of a gene
9:11
Actually whoops, let me make sure I'm using the right tool.
9:14
This might be part of a gene that is this section
9:17
of our DNA molecule right over there.
9:20
And so transcription is a very similar conceputal idea,
9:23
where we're now going to construct
9:25
a strand of RNA and specifically mRNA
9:28
'cause it's going to take that information
9:29
outside of the nucleus.
9:32
And so it's very similar
9:33
except for when we're talking about RNA,
9:35
adenine, instead of pairing with thymine,
9:38
is now going to pair with uracil.
9:41
So let me write this down,
9:42
so now you're gonna have adenine pairs not with thymine
9:45
but uracil.
9:47
DNA has uracil instead of the thymine.
9:49
But you're still going to have cytosine and guanine pairing.
9:52
So for the RNA and in this case the mRNA
9:56
that's going to leave the nucleus
9:59
A is going to pair with U,
10:01
U for uracil,
10:03
so uracil, that's the base we're talking about,
10:06
let me write it down, uracil.
10:09
Thymine is still going to pair with adenine,
10:15
just like that.
10:16
Guanine is gonna pair with cytosine,
10:20
and cytosine is going to pair with guanine.
10:26
And so when you do that,
10:27
now these two characters can detach,
10:29
and now you have a single strand of RNA
10:32
and in this case messenger RNA,
10:33
that has all the information
10:37
on that section of DNA.
10:41
And so now that thing can leave the nucleus,
10:44
go attach to a ribosome,
10:46
and we'll talk more about that in future videos
10:48
exactly how that's happened,
10:50
and then this code can be used
10:52
to actually code for proteins.
10:55
Now how does that happen?
10:56
And that process is called translation.
11:01
Which is really taking this base pair sequence
11:04
and turning it into an amino acid sequence.
11:07
Proteins are made up of sequences of amino acids.
11:10
So translation.
11:11
So let's take our mRNA or this little section of our mRNA,
11:15
and actually let me draw it like this.
11:20
Now let's see, I have it is U A C,
11:23
so it's gonna be U A C then U U
11:28
then A C G okay?
11:30
And then we have an A,
11:33
let me make sure I change it to the right color.
11:35
We have an A there, and then we have this U U A,
11:41
C G, alright,
11:43
now let me put a C right over there,
11:45
I'm just taking this and I'm writing it horizontally.
11:47
I have a C here, not a G, it's a C.
11:52
And then finally I have a G.
11:54
And of course it'll keep going on and on and on.
11:57
And what happens is each sequence of three,
12:01
and you have to be very careful where it starts,
12:03
and so this is in some ways a delicate and surprising,
12:05
but at the same time surprisingly robust process,
12:08
every three of these bases code for a specific amino acid.
12:14
And so three bases together,
12:16
so these bases right over here,
12:18
these I guess you could say this three letter word
12:20
or this three letter sequence,
12:22
that's called a codon.
12:25
And this is going to be the next codon.
12:29
And we actually haven't drawn the next codon after that
12:31
'cause we need three bases to get to the next codon.
12:35
And how many possible codons do you have?
12:38
Well you have one of four bases
12:40
and you have them in three different places,
12:42
so you have four times four times four,
12:44
possible codon words I guess you could say.
12:47
And four times four times four is 64.
12:50
So you have 64 possible codons.
12:56
Which is good because you have 20 possible amino acids.
12:58
So this is overkill and allows codons to be used
13:01
for other purposes as well.
13:02
And they also, you might have more than one codon
13:04
coding for the same amino acid.
13:07
So you have 64 possible codons
13:08
that need to code for 20 amino acids.
13:11
And so this codon right over here with the ribosome,
13:14
and we'll talk more about how that happens,
13:16
can code for
13:22
amino acid 1.
13:25
So let me just write it here, this is amino acid 1.
13:28
And actually this amino acid is brought to here,
13:31
they're actually matched together by another type of RNA,
13:34
this is mRNA we're talking about right over here.
13:37
This is mRNA, but there's another type of RNA
13:41
called tRNA
13:43
that essentially brings these two characters together.
13:47
So the tRNA,
13:48
and I'm just gonna, it's got some structure here,
13:49
I'm not drawing it completely right,
13:51
but it's going to match right over here,
13:52
where maybe it has an A, a U, and a G right over here
13:58
and on this end it was attached to this amino acid,
14:01
and so it matches them together.
14:03
And then they're gonna have another tRNA
14:08
that might attach to amino acid 2,
14:12
which I will do in purple,
14:16
and that just happens to coincide with,
14:19
so it can complement right over here,
14:21
so it attaches in the right place,
14:22
so it's A A U right over here,
14:25
this tRNA.
14:26
And so it'll construct the sequence of amino acids.
14:29
And as you put these amino acids together,
14:31
then you're actually constructing a protein.
14:34
So protein is essentially a bunch,
14:38
a sequence of these amino acids put together.
14:42
And these proteins are essentially the molecules
14:46
that run life for the most part.
14:49
Obviously you know if you eat an animal
14:51
it's going to be made up of fat and sugars and proteins,
14:53
but the proteins are the things that actually do a lot
14:56
of the whether they're enzymes, whether they're structural,
14:58
the muscle is formed from proteins,
15:00
these are the things,
15:01
and I'm just drawing a small segment of them,
15:03
they could be thousands or more of these amino acids long.
15:08
And they kind of form these incredibly complex shapes
15:11
and they have all of these functions.
15:13
This is what's kind of doing the work of life.
15:15
And this for the most part,
15:17
and this is kind of how the information for life is stored.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,6gUY5NoX1Lk,

0:00
In the very first immunology video, where we talked about
0:02
nonspecific defense mechanisms, we said if we had
0:05
some type of a pathogen-- let's say it's a bacteria--
0:09
that our phagocytes can recognize either proteins on
0:14
the bacteria or maybe it was some other type of pathogen--
0:16
some other marker on the pathogen.
0:18
It doesn't know what type of pathogen it is, but that's
0:20
enough for the phagocyte.
0:23
It'll engulf the pathogen.
0:25
So let's say this is the phagocyte.
0:28
Somehow one of their receptors touches one of the proteins
0:32
that's on the surface of this bacteria in this case and
0:36
says, gee, that's not a good thing to have around and so
0:38
it'll engulf it.
0:39
So the membrane is just going to surround the pathogen-- and
0:44
this part is going to go in.
0:46
It's going to kind of pinch in and the pathogen is going to
0:48
get surrounded and get engulfed--
0:50
phagocytozed by the phagocyte.
0:53
So the end product-- we saw this on the first video where
0:56
I talked about phagocytes-- is we're going to end up-- so
1:00
then the membrane's going to be completely around.
1:02
This is going to pinch in and bubble around this thing and
1:05
so we're going to have the pathogen sitting
1:08
inside of the phagocyte.
1:11
It's going to be surrounded by a membrane.
1:13
That membrane's called a phagosome.
1:16
And we learned there's different types of
1:17
phagocytes-- could be a macrophage, could be a
1:22
neutrophil, could be a dendritic cell-- and we have
1:28
it like this and then we also saw in that video, it's not
1:30
just done-- the macrophage doesn't
1:32
just digest this thing.
1:34
That by itself is very useful.
1:35
It got this bacteria out of the way.
1:38
If this was a virus, it got that virus out of the way.
1:40
But it does even more than that.
1:42
It takes that and then it lyses it-- or it breaks it up.
1:45
It doesn't have to actually use-- well, it breaks it up.
1:50
There's several ways it can do it, but the bottom line is, it
1:53
processes it.
1:58
It'll break up the pathogen-- and we saw that first video on
2:01
phagocytes that we'll actually have a lysosome bond to it and
2:05
dump all sorts of particles that are going to break up and
2:08
cut up this bacteria, in this case, into
2:10
its constituent molecules.
2:18
And then some subset of the leftovers, particular chains
2:24
of the peptides-- and remember, proteins are long
2:27
chains of amino acids.
2:28
Polypeptides are short chains.
2:30
So you take short chains of those and they're going to
2:32
bond to special proteins.
2:37
And this is essentially the topic of this video.
2:39
So let's say they bond to that special protein, bond to that
2:42
special protein.
2:43
And then those proteins get transported or get to the
2:47
membrane or the outer surface of the cell and they present
2:49
themselves along with the piece of the pathogen.
2:53
So the end product after phagocytozed this pathogen is
2:57
that the phagocyte will look something like this and it
3:01
will have these antigen presenting proteins, I guess
3:08
we can call them, that had bound to parts of that
3:11
original pathogen.
3:13
Let me do it right here.
3:16
So it has a little bit of the original pathogen on it that I
3:20
drew in green right here.
3:23
And these proteins right here, these are called-- it's a
3:26
fancy word and I talked about it in the previous video--
3:29
these are called major histocompatibility complexes,
3:47
or MHC for short.
3:53
And when we're talking about phagocytes or macrophages or
3:58
dendritic cells that are particular cases of
4:00
phagocytes, the major histocompatibility complexes
4:03
that they present after they've digested this
4:05
molecule-- this is an MHC class II.
4:09
Let me write this down.
4:11
This is an MHC class II protein.
4:16
It might seem like I'm really going into the minutiae of
4:18
what these proteins are, but we're going to see this is key
4:21
for activating other parts of the immune system, especially
4:25
the cell mediated parts of the immune system.
4:27
So this was the case with a macrophage or a dendrite.
4:30
They engulf something, they chew it all up, and then parts
4:34
of the chewed up thing that they ate, they attach to these
4:36
MHC II proteins and these MHC proteins go to the
4:41
surface of the cell.
4:42
The same thing-- or actually not the quite the same thing--
4:45
a very similar thing happens with B cells.
4:49
So if we have a B cell-- that's a good color.
4:52
B for blue.
4:53
We know B stands for bursa, but it could stand for bone
4:57
marrow just as well.
4:58
Let's say we have a B cell and it's got its membrane bound
5:02
antibody on it.
5:03
Remember, it's very specific to that B cells.
5:07
So all of the membrane bound antibodies, all 10,000 or so
5:10
of them on this B cell, they all expressed the same
5:14
variable part.
5:16
So this is a particular B cell.
5:18
So remember, this was nonspecific.
5:20
When we talked about phagocytosis, these guys just
5:23
say, you're a bacteria.
5:24
You're a virus.
5:24
I don't know what kind you are.
5:25
I'm just going to eat you up.
5:26
You look shady.
5:27
I'm going to eat you up.
5:28
I don't know what type you are or whether
5:29
I've seen you before.
5:30
When we're talking about B cells, we're talking about the
5:32
adaptive or the specific immune system.
5:35
And so these-- the variable ends of these membrane bound
5:39
antibodies are specific to certain parts of certain
5:43
pathogens, to certain epitopes.
5:45
Remember, epitopes were the parts of certain pathogens
5:49
that these specific chains can recognize and bond to.
5:53
So let's say that we're dealing with a
5:55
virus in this situation.
5:57
And let's say the virus just happens to
5:59
bond to this B cell.
6:01
Remember, there might be other-- in fact, there
6:02
definitely are tons of other B cells around, but their
6:08
variable portions are all different.
6:17
And that's what I always find amazing about B cells is that
6:19
they come from the same genetic line, their genes have
6:23
been shuffled around in their development so that they can
6:26
produce billions of combinations of these
6:29
proteins, or the variable ends of their antibodies.
6:34
So let's say we have some virus.
6:37
Let me say it's a bacteria.
6:38
When I did the other B cell example, I said we're dealing
6:40
with viruses.
6:41
But let's say some new bacteria and just some part of
6:46
its surface just happens to bind to only this B cell--
6:50
because this B cell has just the right combination.
6:52
So some part of his surface binds just to that B cell
6:57
right there.
6:57
That part of the surface that binds, remember, that was
6:59
called the epitope.
7:01
That's that part of the pathogen that binds to our
7:05
variable sequencer.
7:06
It won't bind to this B cell or this B cell because they
7:09
have different sequences here, but it binds to this B cell
7:12
and then that starts the activation process.
7:15
We'll go into-- sometimes this by itself can get the B cell
7:19
activated, but you normally need help from helper T
7:22
cells-- and we'll talk more about that.
7:24
And we said, once this happens, once you get
7:27
activated or the activation process starts, this guy
7:30
actually gets engulfed-- and I didn't talk about that in the
7:32
last video just because I didn't want to go into too
7:34
much detail.
7:35
So this whole thing gets engulfed by the B cell.
7:42
And then when it gets activated, it proliferates
7:46
itself and you normally need the T cells there and some
7:49
part of them become plasma B cells, some part of them
7:52
become memory B cells.
7:58
Remember, the plasma B cells say, gee, I've been activated.
8:02
I'm just going to produce a ton of these antibodies.
8:05
So the plasma B cell will just produce tons of these
8:07
antibodies and start spitting them out so that they can
8:10
attach to more and more of that pathogen and just mess
8:14
them up in different ways, either tag them so that other
8:18
macrophages or phagocytes eat them up-- or tag two of them
8:23
so you bundle them up so that they can't operate properly.
8:25
Whatever.
8:25
I'm not going to go into detail on that.
8:27
That's when it gets activated.
8:28
But the interesting thing is that the B cell will also do
8:31
what the phagocytes do.
8:33
The B cell will also take this guy into the cell.
8:41
Maybe he's initially attached to the antibody-- and break
8:47
him up, take pieces of this pathogen and attach it to MHC
8:55
II proteins and then present them on the surface.
8:59
So a B cell will also present the antigen.
9:06
So this is also an MHC II complex-- a major
9:11
histocompatibility complex-- and just so you know, histo
9:13
means tissue.
9:14
So this is related to whether something is compatible with
9:17
the tissue in your body and we'll talk more about that and
9:19
how it relates to transplants and all of that.
9:21
So this is also an MHC class II.
9:25
In both cases, whether we're talking about B cells that
9:28
recognize a very specific pathogen-- and it could be a
9:31
specific virus, a specific protein, a specific bacteria,
9:37
or in the cases of phagocytes, they'll just say,
9:40
oh, you look shady.
9:41
Let me take you in.
9:42
I don't know what type of bacteria or virus or protein
9:44
you are, but in either case, they both engulf them, take
9:47
pieces of them, cut them up, and present them on their
9:50
surface in a complex with the major
9:52
histocompatibility complexes.
9:57
So cells that do this are called professional antigen
10:01
presenting cells.
10:05
This is what they do for a living, although they do other
10:07
things, as we've seen.
10:09
The phagocytes eat things.
10:10
The B cells generate antibodies or memories so that
10:14
they can later be activated to generate antibodies, but these
10:17
are called professional antigen presenting cell.
10:25
And the antigen in question is this little piece of the
10:29
actual thing that you're trying to track, that little
10:35
piece-- the actual part of the pathogen, that's what the
10:38
antigen-- so it's presenting the antigen.
10:40
It's professional because it takes pathogens from in the
10:48
fluid of our system and then engulfs them, breaks them up,
10:51
and then presents them.
10:53
Now there are also nonprofessional antigen
10:57
presenting cells.
10:58
And in fact, most cells are this.
11:00
In fact, even these guys.
11:02
Actually, I'm going to wait for the next video.
11:03
I realize all of my videos are getting long.
11:05
So you're probably thinking, these guys in either case
11:10
engulf them, cut them up, present them,
11:12
what is it good for?
11:13
You'll see these MHC II, these are what are recognized by
11:18
helper T cells.
11:20
It'll all form part of the puzzle of how our immune
11:23
system works.
11:24

0:00
- [Voiceover] We've already talked about how DNA's structure
0:03
as this double helix, this twisted ladder,
0:05
makes it suitable for being the molecular basis of heredity.
0:10
And what we wanna do in this video is get
0:11
a better appreciation for why it is suitable,
0:14
and the mechanism by which it is
0:16
the molecular basis for heredity.
0:18
And we're gonna focus on a conceptual level,
0:19
I'm not gonna go into all of the,
0:21
I guess you could say biochemical details.
0:23
Really just give you the conceptual idea of what happens.
0:26
So right over here this could be a fragment of DNA,
0:30
I have, what, I have--
0:31
This is eight base pairs depicted.
0:34
And just to be clear, and we talked about this
0:35
in the introductory video to DNA,
0:37
DNA is much more than, you know, a handful of base pairs.
0:42
The DNA molecule can be tens of millions of base pairs long.
0:47
So for example this might be a section
0:49
of a much longer molecule,
0:51
so the much longer strand of DNA,
0:54
and even there I'm probably not giving justice to it.
0:57
But this might just be this very, very small section,
1:03
let me do this in a different color,
1:04
this little section right over here,
1:06
zoomed in.
1:08
So once again it might be part of a molecule
1:10
that has not seven or eight base pairs,
1:13
but might have 70 million base pairs.
1:16
So just like that.
1:20
So let's understand what a molecular basis of heredity
1:23
would need to do.
1:25
Well first of all it would need to be replicable.
1:27
Or we would need to be able to replicate it.
1:31
As a cell divides,
1:32
the two new cells would want to have
1:35
the same genetic material.
1:37
So how does DNA replicate?
1:39
And this process is called replication.
1:45
And we covered this in the introduction video as well,
1:47
but it's nice to see the different processes
1:49
next to each other.
1:51
And replication, you can imagine taking
1:54
either splitting these two sides of the ladder,
1:58
and actually let's do that.
2:00
So let me copy and paste,
2:03
so if I take that side right over there,
2:06
so let me copy and then paste it.
2:10
And then there we go,
2:12
a little bit of it is dropping below the video
2:15
but I think that serves the purpose.
2:18
And then let's copy and paste the other side.
2:23
So let me select that.
2:28
And then I copy and then I paste,
2:32
and it's just like that.
2:35
And so you can imagine if you were to split these,
2:38
these things you could call them two sides of the ladder,
2:41
that either side could be used to construct the other side.
2:43
And then you would have two strands,
2:45
two identical strands of the DNA.
2:49
And so let's see what that actually looks like.
2:52
So let me get my pen tool out now,
2:54
let me deselect this, get the pen tool out.
2:58
It's a new tool I'm using,
2:59
so let me make sure I'm doing it right.
3:01
Alright, so from this side,
3:02
from this left side,
3:03
or at least what we are looking at as the left side,
3:05
you can then construct another right side
3:07
based on this information.
3:09
A always pairs with T if we're talking about DNA.
3:14
So adenine pairs with thymine just like that.
3:17
Thymine pairs with adenine
3:19
Let me do that a little bit neater.
3:22
Thymine pairs with adenine,
3:26
guanine pairs with cytosine,
3:29
cytosine pairs with guanine,
3:32
falling a little bit down here.
3:33
And just like that I was able to construct
3:35
a new right hand side using that left hand side.
3:38
So maybe I'll do the new sugar phosphate
3:44
backbone in yellow.
3:45
And we can do the same thing here
3:47
using the original right hand side.
3:49
So using the original right hand side,
3:51
once again the T is paired with the A,
3:54
let me do that in adenine's color.
3:57
So we have an adenine and thymine,
3:59
adenine and thymine,
4:00
adenine and thymine.
4:02
Thymine pairs with adenine,
4:03
so thymine, adenine.
4:05
Thymine, adenine.
4:07
Guanine pairs with cytosine.
4:11
And then cytosine pairs with guanine.
4:14
So cytosine just like that.
4:17
And so you can take half of each of this ladder,
4:19
and then you can use it to construct the other half,
4:21
and what you've essentially done is
4:22
you've replicated the actual DNA.
4:25
And this is actually a kind of conceptual level
4:28
of how replication is done
4:29
before a cell divides and replicates,
4:32
and the entire cell duplicates itself.
4:35
So that's replication.
4:37
So the next thing you're probably thinking about,
4:39
""Okay, well it's nice to be able to replicate yourself
4:41
""but that's kind of useless if that information can't be
4:44
""used to define the organism in some way
4:47
""to express what's actually happening.""
4:50
And so let's think about how the genes
4:54
in this DNA molecule are actually expressed.
4:59
So I'll write this as ""expression"".
5:03
And actually that warrants a little bit of a detour
5:07
because you hear sometimes the words
5:09
DNA and chromosome and gene
5:11
used somewhat interchangeably,
5:13
and they are clearly related,
5:15
but it's worth knowing what is what.
5:17
So when you're talking about DNA
5:18
you're talking literally about this molecule here
5:21
that has this sugar phosphate base
5:23
and it has the sequence of base pairs,
5:25
it's got this double helix structure,
5:27
and so this whole thing this could be a DNA molecule.
5:29
Now when you have a DNA molecule
5:32
and it's packaged together with other molecules
5:34
and proteins and kind of given a broader structure,
5:37
then you're talking about a chromosome.
5:41
And when you're talking about a gene,
5:42
you're talking about a section of DNA
5:45
that's used to express a certain trait.
5:48
Or actually used to code for a certain type of protein.
5:53
So for example this could be,
5:55
this whole thing could be a strand of DNA,
5:57
but this part right over, let's say in orange I'll do it,
6:01
this part in orange right over here could be one gene,
6:04
it might define information for one gene,
6:09
it could define a protein,
6:11
this section right over here
6:13
could be used to define another gene.
6:17
And genes could be anywhere from
6:20
several thousand base pairs long,
6:22
all the way up into the millions.
6:24
And as we'll see,
6:25
the way that a gene is expressed,
6:27
the way we get from the information for that section of DNA
6:30
into a protein which is really how it's expressed,
6:33
is through a related molecule to DNA,
6:37
and that is RNA.
6:40
Actually let me write this down.
6:41
RNA.
6:45
So RNA stands for ribonucleic acid.
6:50
Ribonucleic acid, let me write that down.
7:02
And so you might remember that DNA is
7:04
deoxyribonucleic acid,
7:07
so the sugar backbone in RNA
7:09
is a very similar molecule,
7:11
well now it's got its oxy,
7:12
it's not deoxyribonucleic acid,
7:15
it's ribonucleic acid.
7:17
The R, let me make it clear where the RNA come from,
7:19
the R is right over there,
7:22
then you have the nucleic, that's the n,
7:27
and then it's a, acid.
7:29
Same reason why we call the DNA nucleic acid.
7:32
So you have this RNA.
7:35
So what role does this play as we are trying
7:38
to express the information in this DNA?
7:41
Well the DNA,
7:41
especially if we're talking about cells with nucleii,
7:44
the DNA sits there but that information has to
7:47
for the most part get outside of the nucleus
7:49
in order to be expressed.
7:50
And one of the functions that RNA plays
7:53
is to be that messenger,
7:54
that messenger between a certain section of DNA
7:57
and kind of what goes on outside of the nucleus,
7:59
so that that can be translated into an actual protein.
8:04
So the step that you go from DNA to mRNA,
8:07
messenger RNA,
8:08
is called transcription.
8:11
Let me write that down.
8:20
And what happens in transcription,
8:21
let's go back to looking at one side of this DNA molecule.
8:27
So let's say you have that right over there,
8:30
let me copy and paste it.
8:34
So there we go, actually I didn't wanna do that.
8:38
I wanted the other side.
8:39
So actually I think I'm on the wrong, let me go back here.
8:44
And so let me copy and then let me paste.
8:48
There we go.
8:49
So let's say you have part of this DNA molecule,
8:56
or you have 1/2 of it
8:57
just like we did when we replicated it.
8:58
But now we're not just trying to duplicate the DNA molecule,
9:01
we're actually trying to create
9:02
a corresponding mRNA molecule.
9:05
At least for that section of,
9:08
at least for that gene.
9:09
So this might be part of a gene
9:11
Actually whoops, let me make sure I'm using the right tool.
9:14
This might be part of a gene that is this section
9:17
of our DNA molecule right over there.
9:20
And so transcription is a very similar conceputal idea,
9:23
where we're now going to construct
9:25
a strand of RNA and specifically mRNA
9:28
'cause it's going to take that information
9:29
outside of the nucleus.
9:32
And so it's very similar
9:33
except for when we're talking about RNA,
9:35
adenine, instead of pairing with thymine,
9:38
is now going to pair with uracil.
9:41
So let me write this down,
9:42
so now you're gonna have adenine pairs not with thymine
9:45
but uracil.
9:47
DNA has uracil instead of the thymine.
9:49
But you're still going to have cytosine and guanine pairing.
9:52
So for the RNA and in this case the mRNA
9:56
that's going to leave the nucleus
9:59
A is going to pair with U,
10:01
U for uracil,
10:03
so uracil, that's the base we're talking about,
10:06
let me write it down, uracil.
10:09
Thymine is still going to pair with adenine,
10:15
just like that.
10:16
Guanine is gonna pair with cytosine,
10:20
and cytosine is going to pair with guanine.
10:26
And so when you do that,
10:27
now these two characters can detach,
10:29
and now you have a single strand of RNA
10:32
and in this case messenger RNA,
10:33
that has all the information
10:37
on that section of DNA.
10:41
And so now that thing can leave the nucleus,
10:44
go attach to a ribosome,
10:46
and we'll talk more about that in future videos
10:48
exactly how that's happened,
10:50
and then this code can be used
10:52
to actually code for proteins.
10:55
Now how does that happen?
10:56
And that process is called translation.
11:01
Which is really taking this base pair sequence
11:04
and turning it into an amino acid sequence.
11:07
Proteins are made up of sequences of amino acids.
11:10
So translation.
11:11
So let's take our mRNA or this little section of our mRNA,
11:15
and actually let me draw it like this.
11:20
Now let's see, I have it is U A C,
11:23
so it's gonna be U A C then U U
11:28
then A C G okay?
11:30
And then we have an A,
11:33
let me make sure I change it to the right color.
11:35
We have an A there, and then we have this U U A,
11:41
C G, alright,
11:43
now let me put a C right over there,
11:45
I'm just taking this and I'm writing it horizontally.
11:47
I have a C here, not a G, it's a C.
11:52
And then finally I have a G.
11:54
And of course it'll keep going on and on and on.
11:57
And what happens is each sequence of three,
12:01
and you have to be very careful where it starts,
12:03
and so this is in some ways a delicate and surprising,
12:05
but at the same time surprisingly robust process,
12:08
every three of these bases code for a specific amino acid.
12:14
And so three bases together,
12:16
so these bases right over here,
12:18
these I guess you could say this three letter word
12:20
or this three letter sequence,
12:22
that's called a codon.
12:25
And this is going to be the next codon.
12:29
And we actually haven't drawn the next codon after that
12:31
'cause we need three bases to get to the next codon.
12:35
And how many possible codons do you have?
12:38
Well you have one of four bases
12:40
and you have them in three different places,
12:42
so you have four times four times four,
12:44
possible codon words I guess you could say.
12:47
And four times four times four is 64.
12:50
So you have 64 possible codons.
12:56
Which is good because you have 20 possible amino acids.
12:58
So this is overkill and allows codons to be used
13:01
for other purposes as well.
13:02
And they also, you might have more than one codon
13:04
coding for the same amino acid.
13:07
So you have 64 possible codons
13:08
that need to code for 20 amino acids.
13:11
And so this codon right over here with the ribosome,
13:14
and we'll talk more about how that happens,
13:16
can code for
13:22
amino acid 1.
13:25
So let me just write it here, this is amino acid 1.
13:28
And actually this amino acid is brought to here,
13:31
they're actually matched together by another type of RNA,
13:34
this is mRNA we're talking about right over here.
13:37
This is mRNA, but there's another type of RNA
13:41
called tRNA
13:43
that essentially brings these two characters together.
13:47
So the tRNA,
13:48
and I'm just gonna, it's got some structure here,
13:49
I'm not drawing it completely right,
13:51
but it's going to match right over here,
13:52
where maybe it has an A, a U, and a G right over here
13:58
and on this end it was attached to this amino acid,
14:01
and so it matches them together.
14:03
And then they're gonna have another tRNA
14:08
that might attach to amino acid 2,
14:12
which I will do in purple,
14:16
and that just happens to coincide with,
14:19
so it can complement right over here,
14:21
so it attaches in the right place,
14:22
so it's A A U right over here,
14:25
this tRNA.
14:26
And so it'll construct the sequence of amino acids.
14:29
And as you put these amino acids together,
14:31
then you're actually constructing a protein.
14:34
So protein is essentially a bunch,
14:38
a sequence of these amino acids put together.
14:42
And these proteins are essentially the molecules
14:46
that run life for the most part.
14:49
Obviously you know if you eat an animal
14:51
it's going to be made up of fat and sugars and proteins,
14:53
but the proteins are the things that actually do a lot
14:56
of the whether they're enzymes, whether they're structural,
14:58
the muscle is formed from proteins,
15:00
these are the things,
15:01
and I'm just drawing a small segment of them,
15:03
they could be thousands or more of these amino acids long.
15:08
And they kind of form these incredibly complex shapes
15:11
and they have all of these functions.
15:13
This is what's kind of doing the work of life.
15:15
And this for the most part,
15:17
and this is kind of how the information for life is stored.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,6gUY5NoX1Lk,

Let's say that you're a watermelon farmer,
0:03
and you want to study how dense the seeds are
0:06
in your watermelon.
0:06
Perhaps you want to do this because over time, you're
0:09
trying to breed watermelons that have fewer seeds,
0:11
and you should see whether you are actually making progress.
0:15
And you don't want to cut open every watermelon
0:17
in your watermelon farm or patch or whatever
0:21
it might be called, because you want to sell most of them.
0:23
You just want to sample a few watermelons,
0:25
and then take samples of those watermelons
0:28
to figure out how dense the seeds are, and hope that you
0:33
can calculate statistics on those samples that
0:36
are decent estimates of the parameters for the population.
0:40
So let's start doing that.
0:42
So let's say that you take these little cubic inch chunks out
0:45
of a random sample of your watermelons.
0:48
And then you count the number of seeds in them.
0:50
And you have 8 samples like this.
0:54
So in one of them, you found 4 seeds.
0:57
In the next, you found 3, 5, 7, 2, 9, 11, and 7.
1:06
So this is a sample, just to make
1:08
sure we're visualizing it right.
1:10
If this is the population of all of the chunks--
1:15
I guess we could view this as a cubic inch--
1:17
the cubic inch chunks in my entire watermelon farm,
1:21
I'm sampling a very small sample of them.
1:26
Maybe I could have had a million over here.
1:29
A million chunks of watermelon could
1:30
have been produced from my farm, but I'm only
1:33
sampling-- so capital N would be 1 million,
1:36
lowercase n is equal to 8.
1:39
And once again, you might want to have more samples,
1:41
but this'll make our math easy.
1:43
Now, let's think about what statistics we can measure.
1:47
Well, the first one that we often do
1:49
is a measure of central tendency.
1:51
And that's the arithmetic mean.
1:53
But here, we're trying to estimate the population mean
1:56
by coming up with the sample mean.
2:00
So what is the sample mean going to be?
2:04
Well, all we have to do is add up these points,
2:08
add up these measurements, and then divide
2:10
by the number of measurements we have.
2:12
So let's get our calculator out for that.
2:15
Actually, maybe I don't need my calculator.
2:17
Let's see.
2:18
So 4 plus 3 is 7.
2:20
7 plus 5 is 12.
2:21
12 plus 7 is 19.
2:24
19 plus 2 is 21, plus 9 is 30, plus 11 is 41, plus 7 is 48.
2:33
So I'm going to get 48 over 8 data points.
2:36
So this worked out quite well.
2:38
48 divided by 8 is equal to 6.
2:41
So our sample mean is 6.
2:43
It's our estimate of what the population mean might be.
2:47
But we also want to think about how much in our population
2:50
we want to estimate, how much spread is there,
2:56
or how much do our measurements vary from this mean.
3:01
So there, we say, well, we can try to estimate the population
3:05
variance by calculating the sample variance.
3:08
And we're going to calculate the unbiased sample variance.
3:13
Hopefully, we're fairly convinced at this point
3:15
why we divide by n minus 1.
3:16
So we're going to calculate the unbiased sample variance.
3:20
And if we do that, what do we get?
3:24
I'll do this in a different color.
3:25
It's going to be 4 minus 6 squared plus 3 minus 6 squared
3:32
plus 5 minus 6 squared plus 7 minus 6 squared
3:38
plus 2 minus 6 squared plus 9 minus 6 squared
3:44
plus 11 minus 6 squared plus 7 minus 6 squared, all of that
3:51
divided by-- not by 8.
3:54
Remember, we want the unbiased sample variance.
3:57
We're going to divide it by 8 minus 1.
4:00
So we're going to divide by 7.
4:03
Let me give myself a little bit more real estate.
4:05
The unbiased sample variance-- and I could even
4:07
denote it by this to make it clear that we're
4:09
dividing by lowercase n minus 1-- is going
4:13
to be equal to-- let's see, 4 minus 6 is negative 2.
4:18
That squared is positive 4.
4:20
So I did that one.
4:21
3 minus 6 is negative 3.
4:23
That squared is going to be 9.
4:25
5 minus 6 squared is 1 squared, which is 1.
4:29
7 minus 6 is once again 1 squared, which is 1.
4:33
2 minus 6, negative 4 squared is 16.
4:40
9 minus 6 squared, well, that's going to be 9.
4:43
11 minus 6 squared, that is 25.
4:48
And then finally, 7 minus 6 squared, that's another 1.
4:52
And we're going to divide it by 7.
4:56
Let's see if we can add this up in our heads.
4:58
4 plus 9 is 13, plus 1 is 14, 15, 31, 40, 65, 66.
5:10
So this is going to be equal to 66 over 7.
5:15
And we could either divide-- we get that's 9 and 3/7.
5:20
We could write that as 9 and 3/7.
5:23
Or if we want to write that as a decimal,
5:25
I could just take 66 divided by 7
5:30
gives us 9 point-- I'll just round it.
5:33
So it's approximately 9.43.
5:43
Now, that gave us our unbiased sample variance.
5:48
Well, how could we calculate a sample standard deviation?
5:51
We want to somehow get added estimate of what the population
5:55
standard deviation might be.
5:57
Well, the logic, I guess, is reasonable to say, well,
6:01
this is our unbiased sample variance.
6:03
It's our best estimate of what the true population
6:07
variance is.
6:08
When we think about population parameters
6:10
to get the population standard deviation,
6:15
we just take the square root of the population variance.
6:19
So if we want to get an estimate of the sample standard
6:23
deviation, why don't we just take
6:25
the square root of the unbiased sample variance?
6:32
So that's what we'll do.
6:33
So we'll define it that way.
6:34
We'll call it the sample standard deviation.
6:36
We're going to define it to be equal to the square root
6:40
of the unbiased sample variance.
6:42
It's going to be the square root of this quantity,
6:45
and we can take our calculator out.
6:47
It's going to be the square root of what I just typed in.
6:50
I can do 2nd answer.
6:51
It'll be the last entry here.
6:52
So the square root of that is-- and I'll just round.
6:54
It's approximately equal to 3.07.
7:01
Now, I'm going to tell you something
7:02
very counterintuitive.
7:04
Or at least initially it's counterintuitive,
7:06
but hopefully you'll appreciate this over time.
7:09
This we've already talked about in some depth.
7:12
People have even created simulations
7:14
to show that this is an unbiased estimate of population variance
7:19
when we divide it by n minus 1.
7:21
And that's a good starting point if we're
7:22
going to take the square root of anything.
7:24
But it actually turns out that because the square root
7:28
function is nonlinear, that this sample standard
7:32
deviation-- and this is how it tends
7:35
to be defined-- sample standard deviation, that this sample
7:42
standard deviation, which is the square root of our sample
7:53
variance, so from i equals 1 to n
7:57
of our unbiased sample variance, so we divide it by n minus 1.
8:01
This is how we literally divide our sample standard deviation.
8:04
Because the square root function is nonlinear,
8:11
it turns out that this is not an unbiased estimate
8:16
of the true population standard deviation.
8:20
And I encourage people to make simulations of that
8:23
if they're interested.
8:24
But then you might say, well, we went through great pains
8:27
to divide by n minus 1 here in order
8:29
to get an unbiased estimate of the population variance.
8:32
Why don't we go through similar pains
8:34
and somehow figure out a formula for an unbiased estimate
8:38
of the population standard deviation?
8:41
And the reason why that's difficult
8:43
is to unbias the sample variance,
8:46
we just have to divide by n minus 1 instead of n.
8:48
And that'd work for any probability distribution
8:52
for our population.
8:54
It turns out to do the same thing
8:55
for the standard deviation.
8:57
It's not that easy.
8:59
It's actually dependent on how that population is actually
9:02
distributed.
9:03
So in statistics, we just define the sample standard deviation.
9:07
And the one that we typically use
9:10
is based on the square root of the unbiased sample variance.
9:15
But when you take that square root,
9:19
it does give you a biased result when
9:25
you're trying to use this to estimate the population
9:27
standard deviation.

- [Voiceover] Let's now see if we can balance a chemical
0:02
equation with slightly more complex molecules.
0:07
So, here we have a chemical equation,
0:10
describing a chemical reaction.
0:11
This is actually a combustion reaction.
0:14
You have some ethylene right over here,
0:17
in the presence of oxygen, and you need to get a
0:20
little bit of energy to get this going, but then you're
0:22
going to have this reaction that's actually going to
0:24
release energy as well, but we're not accounting for
0:26
the energy, at least the way we've written it.
0:28
Right over here, you have some ethylene, and this little
0:32
g in parentheses, says it's in the gas form
0:35
or gaseous form, so gaseous ethylene plus some
0:40
dioxygen molecule, which is the most prevalent form of
0:43
oxygen molecule that you would find in the atmosphere.
0:47
And so, that's also in the gas form.
0:49
Put them together, you end up with some carbon dioxide
0:52
gas and some liquid water.
0:55
This is the classic combustion reaction.
0:58
But now let's think about, how do we balance this thing?
1:01
Let's make sure we have the same number
1:03
of each atom on both sides.
1:07
And when you see something more complicated like this,
1:09
where, you know, here I have an oxygen and two different
1:13
molecules over here, and a lot of these molecules have
1:17
multiple elements in it.
1:19
It might be very daunting.
1:20
Where do I start?
1:21
And this is where the art of balancing chemical
1:23
equations starts to come into play.
1:26
The general idea is,
1:28
Try to balance the...
1:30
try to balance the molecules that have multiple
1:33
elements in them first, and leave the...
1:37
molecules that only have one element in them for last.
1:40
And the idea there is, is that these are harder.
1:43
They're going to have all sorts of implications,
1:44
and then, at the end of the day, you can just set
1:46
a number here for the number of dioxygens.
1:50
If you saved, say the ethylene for last,
1:54
then every time, and you're trying to balance the carbons,
1:57
you try to change the number of carbons, you're going to
1:59
change the number of hydrogens,
2:00
which is going to change the...
2:01
You're going to have to balance over and over, and you're
2:03
going to go into this really really really confusing circle.
2:05
So, the best thing to do, try to balance
2:08
the complex molecules first, and then
2:11
save the single element molecules for last.
2:15
So let's do that.
2:16
So, let's start with the carbons.
2:19
So, over here, I have two carbons.
2:22
Over here, I only have one carbon.
2:26
I only have one carbon.
2:28
So, it seems like the best way to balance it is, I should
2:31
have two molecules of carbon dioxide,
2:35
and I haven't even thought about the oxygens yet.
2:37
By putting that two there, that's going to change the
2:39
number of oxygens I have on the righthand side.
2:42
But at least it balances my carbons.
2:44
I now have two carbons on the lefthand side,
2:47
and I have two carbons on the righthand side.
2:49
I’m no longer magically destroying
2:52
a carbon atom, all right.
2:55
Now, let's move on to the hydrogens, and remember,
2:57
what I said is, let's wait to do the oxygens last,
3:00
because we have a molecule
3:03
that only contains oxygen right over here,
3:06
so we'll save oxygen for last.
3:08
So, let's do hydrogen next.
3:11
So, hydrogen, right over here, we have four hydrogens.
3:15
And on the righthand side, we have two hydrogens.
3:18
So, it seems like the easiest thing to do to balance
3:21
the hydrogens is to have two of these water molecules.
3:25
Now I have four hydrogens here,
3:27
and I have four hydrogens there.
3:30
Now, let's do the oxygen.
3:33
Now, let's do the oxygen.
3:34
I've balanced the carbons and the hydrogens.
3:36
And the reason why oxygen's going to be interesting,
3:38
I can just count the amount of oxygen I now have here,
3:41
after changing the amount of molecules I have.
3:45
And then I can adjust this accordingly, because this is
3:48
only going to affect the number of oxygens
3:50
that I have on the lefthand side.
3:52
Right now, on the lefthand side, I have two oxygens,
3:54
and on the righthand side, let me count this,
3:57
I have two O two's, really.
4:00
So, this is going to be four oxygens here,
4:02
and then I have, each of these water molecules has
4:05
one oxygen, but I have two water molecules,
4:07
so this is going to be two oxygens, two oxygens here.
4:11
So, on the righthand side, I have four plus two oxygens.
4:15
So, I have six oxygens on the righthand side.
4:17
I need six oxygens on the lefthand side.
4:19
I need this number to be six.
4:21
So, how do I do that?
4:23
Well, I just need three of these molecules.
4:24
If I have three molecules, each of them have two oxygens,
4:27
I'm going to have a total of six oxygens.
4:29
And just like that, we have balanced this

0:00
In most topics you have to get pretty advanced before you
0:03
start addressing the philosophically interesting
0:05
things, but in chemistry it just starts right from the
0:08
get-go with what's arguably the most philosophically
0:11
interesting part of the whole topic, and that's the atom.
0:15
And the idea of the atom, as philosophers long ago, and you
0:18
could look it up on the different philosophers who
0:21
first philosophized about it, they said, hey, you know, if I
0:23
started off with, I don't know, if I started off with an
0:28
apple, and I just kept cutting the apple -- let me draw a
0:32
nice looking apple just so it doesn't look just
0:34
like a heart .
0:36
There you go.
0:36
You have a nice looking apple, And you just kept cutting it,
0:38
smaller and smaller pieces.
0:40
So eventually, you get a piece so small, so tiny, that you
0:44
can't cut it anymore.
0:46
And I'm sure some of these philosophers went out there
0:48
with a knife and tried to do it and they just felt that,
0:50
oh, if I could just get my knife a little bit sharper, I
0:52
could cut it again and again.
0:53
So it's a completely philosophical construct, which
0:56
frankly, in a lot of ways, isn't too different to how the
0:59
atom is today.
1:00
It's really just a mental abstraction that allows us to
1:04
describe a lot of observations we see in the universe.
1:07
But anyway, these philosophers said, well, at some point we
1:10
think that there's going to be some little part of an apple
1:15
that they won't be able to divide anymore.
1:16
And they called that an atom.
1:18
And it doesn't just have to just be for an apple they said
1:19
this is true for any substance or any element to that you
1:23
encounter in the universe.
1:25
And so the word atom is really Greek for uncuttable.
1:29
Uncuttable or indivisible.
1:34
Now we know that it actually is cuttable and even though it
1:37
is not a trivial thing, it's not the smallest form of
1:42
matter we know.
1:43
We now know that an atom is made up of other more
1:47
fundamental particles.
1:48
And let me write that.
1:50
So the we have the neutron.
1:55
And I'll draw in a second how they all fit together and the
1:59
structure of an atom.
2:00
We have a neutron.
2:02
We have a proton.
2:05
And we have electrons.
2:09
Electrons.
2:11
And you might already be familiar with this if you look
2:13
at old videos about atomic projects, you'll see a drawing
2:18
that looks something like this.
2:20
Let me see if I can draw one.
2:21
So you'll have something like that.
2:24
And you'll have these things spinning around
2:27
that look like this.
2:28
They have orbits that look like that.
2:30
And maybe something that looks like that.
2:33
And the general notion behind these kind of nuclear drawings
2:36
-- and I'm sure that they still show up at some
2:39
government defense labs or something like that -- is that
2:41
you have a nucleus at the center of an atom.
2:46
You have a nucleus at the center of an atom.
2:48
And we know that a nucleus has neutrons and protons.
2:52
Neutrons and protons.
2:53
And we'll talk a little bit more about which elements have
2:56
how many neutrons and how many protons.
2:59
And then orbiting, and I'm going to use the word orbit
3:02
right now, although we'll learn in about two minutes
3:05
that the word orbit is actually the incorrect or even
3:08
the mentally incorrect way of visualizing what
3:10
an electron is doing.
3:11
But the old idea was that you have these electrons that are
3:14
orbiting around the nucleus very similar to the way the
3:17
Earth orbits around the Sun or the moon
3:19
orbits around the Earth.
3:21
And it's been shown that that's actually
3:23
a very wrong way.
3:26
And when we cover quantum mechanics we'll learn why this
3:30
doesn't work, what are the contradictions that emerge
3:34
when you try to model an electron like a planet going
3:38
around the Sun.
3:40
But this was kind of the original idea, and frankly I
3:41
think this is kind of the idea that is the most mainstream
3:45
way of viewing an atom.
3:50
Now, I said an atom is philosophically interesting.
3:52
Why is it philosophically interesting?
3:53
Because what we now view as the accepted way of viewing an
3:58
atom really starts to blur the line between our physical
4:04
reality and everything in the world is just information, and
4:09
there really isn't any such thing as true matter or true
4:12
particles as the way we define them in our everyday life.
4:15
You know, for me a particle, oh, it looks
4:16
like a grain of sand.
4:17
I can pick it up, touch it.
4:19
While a wave, that could be like a soundwave. It could be
4:21
just this change in energy over time.
4:23
But we'll learn, especially when we do quantum mechanics,
4:25
that it all gets jumbled up as we start approaching the
4:29
scales or the size of an atom.
4:31
Anyway, I said this was an incorrect way of doing it.
4:34
What's the correct way?
4:37
So it turns out-- this is a picture, not a picture really,
4:40
this is also a depiction.
4:42
So it's an interesting question, what I just said.
4:44
How can you have a picture of an atom?
4:47
Because is actually turns out that most wavelengths of
4:49
light, especially the visible wavelengths of light, are much
4:52
larger than the size of an atom.
4:56
Everything else we quote-unquote, observe in
4:58
life, it's by reflected light.
5:00
But all of a sudden when you're dealing with an atom,
5:02
reflected light you could almost view it as too big, or
5:06
too blunt of an instrument with which to observe an atom.
5:09
Anyway, this is a depiction of a helium atom.
5:14
A helium atom has two protons and two neutrons.
5:18
Or at least this helium atom has two
5:19
protons and two neutrons.
5:21
And the way they depict it here in the nucleus, right
5:24
there, maybe these are the two-- I'm assuming they're
5:26
using red for proton and purple for neutron.
5:32
Purple seems like more of a neutral color.
5:34
And they're sitting at the center of this atom.
5:39
And then this whole haze around there, those are the
5:42
two electrons that helium has, or that at least
5:45
this helium atom has.
5:47
Maybe you could gain or lose an electron.
5:49
But these are the two electrons.
5:50
And you say, hey, Sal, how can two electrons be this blur
5:55
that's kind of smeared around this atom.
5:58
And that's where it gets philosophically interesting.
6:01
So you cannot describe an electron's path around a
6:09
nucleus with the traditional orbit idea that we've
6:12
encountered when we look at planets or if we just imagine
6:16
things at kind of a larger scale.
6:18
It turns out that an electron, you cannot know exactly its
6:24
momentum and location at any given point in time.
6:28
All you can know is a probability distribution of
6:31
where it is likely to be.
6:33
And the way they depicted this, black is a higher
6:36
probability, so you're much more likely to find the
6:39
electron here than you are here.
6:42
But the electron really could be anywhere.
6:43
It could even to be here, even though it's completely white
6:46
there, with some very, very, very, very, very low
6:49
probability.
6:50
And so this function of where an electron is, this is called
6:55
an orbital.
6:56
Orbital.
6:57
Not to be confused with orbit.
7:00
Orbital.
7:02
Remember, an orbit was something like this.
7:05
It's like Venus going around the Sun.
7:08
So it's very physically easy for us to imagine.
7:12
While an orbital is actually a mathematical probability
7:16
function that tells us where we're
7:17
likely to find an electron.
7:18
We'll deal a lot more with that when we cover quantum
7:21
mechanics, but that's not going to be in the scope of
7:23
this kind of introductory set of chemistry lectures.
7:26
But it's interesting, right?
7:28
An electron's behavior is so bizarre at that scale that you
7:32
can't-- I mean, to call it a particle is almost misleading.
7:35
It is called a particle, but it's not a particle in the
7:38
sense that we're used to in our everyday life.
7:40
It's this thing that you can't even say exactly where it is.
7:45
It can be anywhere in this haze.
7:47
And we'll learn later that there are different shapes of
7:49
the hazes is as we add more and more electrons to an atom.
7:53
But to me, it starts to address philosophical issues
7:57
of what matter even is, or do the things we look at, how
8:01
real are they?
8:02
Or how real are they, at least as we've defined reality?
8:04
Anyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.
8:07
But the whole notion of electrons, protons, they're
8:12
all kind of predicated on this notion of charge.
8:15
And we've talked about it before when we learned about
8:17
Coulomb's law.
8:18
You could review Coulomb's laws videos in the physics
8:22
playlist. But the idea is that an electron
8:27
has a negative charge.
8:29
A proton, sometimes written like that,
8:31
has a positive charge.
8:33
And a neutron has no charge.
8:37
And so that's what was tempting about the original
8:39
model of an electron.
8:42
If they say, OK, if this thing has positive charges, right?
8:45
So let's say this is two neutrons and two protons.
8:47
Let's say it's a helium atom.
8:48
Then we'll have some positive charges here.
8:51
We have some negative charges out here.
8:54
Opposite charges attract.
8:56
And so if these things had some velocity, enough
9:03
velocity, they would orbit around this, just the way a
9:08
planet will orbit around the Sun.
9:10
But now we learn, even though this is partially true, that
9:15
the further away an electron is from the nucleus, it does
9:23
have more, it's true, potential energy.
9:27
In that it will want to move towards the nucleus, but
9:31
because of all the mechanics at the quantum level, it won't
9:34
just do something simple like move in a path like that, like
9:37
a comet would do around the Sun, it actually has this kind
9:41
of wave-like behavior, where it just has this probability
9:43
function that describes it.
9:45
But the further away an orbital, it
9:48
does have more potential.
9:50
We're going to go a lot more into that in future videos.
9:53
But anyway, how do you recognize what an element is?
9:56
I've talked a lot about the philosophy and all of that,
9:58
but how do I know that this is helium?
10:00
Is it by the number of neutrons it has?
10:03
Is it by the number of protons it has?
10:05
Is it by the number of electrons?
10:07
Well the answer is, it's by the number of protons.
10:09
So if you know the number of protons in an element, you
10:13
know what that element is.
10:14
And the number of protons, this is defined
10:21
as the atomic number.
10:26
Now, so let's say I said something has four protons.
10:33
How do we know what it is?
10:34
Well if we haven't memorized it, we could look it up on the
10:37
periodic table of elements, which we'll be dealing with a
10:39
lot in this playlist. And you'd say, oh, four protons,
10:43
that is beryllium.
10:45
Right there.
10:46
And the atomic number is the number that you see up there.
10:50
And that' s literally the number of protons.
10:52
And that is what differentiates
10:55
one atom from another.
10:56
If you have fifteen protons, you're dealing with
10:59
phosphorus.
11:00
And all of a sudden, if you have seven protons, you're
11:06
dealing with nitrogen.
11:07
If you have eight, you're dealing with oxygen.
11:09
That is what defines the element.
11:11
Now, we'll talk in the future about what happens with charge
11:15
and all of that.
11:17
Or what happens when you gain or lose electrons.
11:19
But that does not change what element you're dealing with.
11:21
And likewise, when you change the number of neutrons, that
11:26
also does not change the element you're dealing with.
11:30
But that leads to an obvious question of, well, how many
11:32
neutrons and electrons do you have?
11:35
Well, if an atom is charge-neutral, that means it
11:43
has the same number of electrons.
11:46
So let's say that I have carbon.
11:52
Its atomic number is six.
11:53
And let's say its mass number is twelve.
12:00
Now what does this mean?
12:01
And let me say further that this is a neutral particle.
12:05
This is a neutral atom.
12:07
So the atomic number for carbon is six.
12:10
That tells us exactly how many protons it has.
12:13
So if I were to draw a little model here, and this is in no
12:16
way an accurate model.
12:17
I'll draw six-- two, three, four, five, six
12:21
protons in the center.
12:23
And the weight of these protons, each proton is one
12:26
atomic mass unit, and we'll talk more about how that
12:28
relates to kilograms. It's a very small
12:31
fraction of a kilogram.
12:32
Roughly I think it's 1.6 times 10 to the
12:36
minus 27th of a kilogram.
12:38
So let's say each of these are one atomic mass unit, and
12:45
that's approximately equal to, I think, 1.67 times 10 to the
12:48
minus 27 kilograms. This is a very small number.
12:53
It's actually almost impossible to visualize.
12:57
At least it is for me.
12:58
This tells me the mass of the entire carbon atom, of this
13:03
particular carbon atom.
13:04
And this can actually change from carbon
13:05
atom to carbon atom.
13:07
And this is essentially the mass of all of the protons
13:10
plus all of the neutrons.
13:12
And each proton has an atomic mass of one, in atomic mass
13:17
units, and each neutron has an atomic mass of
13:20
one atomic mass unit.
13:22
So this is really the number of protons plus
13:28
the number of neutrons.
13:33
So in this case we have six protons, so we must also have
13:37
six neutrons.
13:39
Six neutrons plus six protons.
13:42
Now, where are the electrons?
13:44
Well, I said it's neutral, so the proton has an equal
13:49
positive charge as the electron's negative charge.
13:51
So this is a neutral atom, and it has six protons, so it also
13:55
has six electrons.
13:56
Let me draw that.
13:57
So we said it has six neutrons in here.
13:59
One, two, three, four, five, six.
14:01
So that's the nucleus right there.
14:04
And then if we were to draw the electons-- well, I could
14:09
draw it as a smear, but if we want to kind of visualize it a
14:12
little better, we could say, OK, there's going to be six
14:13
electrons orbiting.
14:15
One, two, three, four, five, six.
14:18
And they're going to be moving around in this unpredictable
14:21
way that we would have to describe with
14:22
a probability function.
14:24
And so the interesting thing about it is, most of the mass
14:30
of an atom is sitting right in here.
14:32
I mean, you might notice that when people care about the
14:34
mass, when they care about the atomic mass number of an atom,
14:40
they ignore the electrons.
14:41
And that's because the mass of a proton, one proton
14:47
mass-wise, is equal to 1,836 electons.
14:52
So for thinking about the mass of an atom, for all basic
14:58
purposes, you can ignore the mass of an electron.
15:01
It's really the mass of the nucleus that counts as the
15:08
mass of the atom.
15:10
Now, you might see this periodic table here, and you
15:12
say, OK, they gave us the atomic number up there.
15:15
The atomic number of oxygen is eight.
15:18
It means it has eight protons.
15:20
The atomic number of silicon is 14.
15:22
It has 14 protons.
15:24
Now what is this right here?
15:27
Let's see, in carbon.
15:28
In carbon they have this 12.0107.
15:34
That is the atomic weight of carbon.
15:36
Let me write this.
15:41
Atomic weight of carbon.
15:47
The atomic weight of carbon is 12.0107.
15:56
Now, what does that mean?
15:57
Does that mean that carbon has six protons and then the
16:03
remainder, the remaining 6.0107 neutrons, it has kind
16:09
of this fraction of a neutron?
16:11
No.
16:12
It means if you were to average all the different
16:16
versions of carbon you find on the planet and you were to
16:19
average the number of neutrons based on the quantity of the
16:25
different types of carbon, this is the
16:27
average you would get.
16:28
So it turns out that carbon, the two major forms, the main
16:32
one you'll find is carbon-12.
16:35
So that's like this.
16:36
So that has six protons and six neutrons.
16:39
And then another isotope of carbon.
16:42
Now an isotope is the same element with a different
16:45
number of neutrons.
16:46
Another isotope of carbon is carbon-14, which is much more
16:50
scarce on the planet.
16:52
We don't know how much in the universe, but on the planet.
16:55
Now, if you were to average these, not just a straight-up
16:58
average, then you would get carbon-13 and then the atomic
17:01
weight would be 13, but you weight this one much higher
17:04
because this exists in much larger quantities on Earth.
17:07
I mean, this is pretty much all of the
17:08
carbon that you see.
17:09
But there's a little bit of this.
17:10
So if you weight them appropriately, the average
17:13
becomes this.
17:14
So most of the carbon you'll find-- if you just found
17:17
carbon someplace, on average its weight in atomic mass
17:22
units is going to be 12.0107.
17:27
But that idea of an isotope is an interesting one.
17:29
Remember, when you change the neutrons, you're not changing
17:32
the actual, fundamental element.
17:33
You're just getting a different isotope, a different
17:36
version, of the element.
17:37
So these two versions of carbon are both isotopes.
17:41
Now, I want to leave this video with what I think is
17:43
kind of the neatest idea behind atoms. And it's the
17:46
most philosophically interesting things about them.
17:49
It's that the relative size-- so, we have these electrons,
17:54
which represent very little of the mass of an atom.
17:58
It's 1/2000 of the mass of an atom are the electrons.
18:01
And even those, it's hard to even describe them as
18:04
particles, because you can't even tell me exactly where and
18:08
how fast one of these particles is moving.
18:11
They just have a probability function.
18:12
So most of the atom is sitting inside the nucleus.
18:16
And this is the interesting thing.
18:17
If you look at an atom on average, if you
18:21
say this is my atom.
18:23
Let's say I had two atoms that are bonded to each other.
18:26
And I were to say, how much of this is actual stuff?
18:29
And when I say stuff, that's a very abstract concept, because
18:32
we're talking about the nucleus, right?
18:33
Because the nucleus is where all the
18:34
mass is, all the stuff.
18:36
It turns out that it's actually an infinitesimally
18:39
small fraction of the volume of the atom where-- the volume
18:44
of the atom is hard to define, because the electron can
18:45
pretty much be anywhere, but if you view the volume as
18:48
where you're most likely to find the electron, or with 90%
18:52
probability you're likely to find the electron, then the
18:55
nucleus is, in a lot of cases and the way I think about it,
18:59
it's about 1/10,000 of the volume.
19:01
So if you think about it, when you look at something, if you
19:03
look at your hand or if you look at the wall or if you
19:06
look at your computer, 99.999% of it is free space.
19:14
It's nothing.
19:15
It's vacuum.
19:18
If you had ultra-small-- I guess we could call them
19:20
particles or something-- most of them would pass straight
19:23
through whatever you look at.
19:24
So it already starts to kind of
19:26
question our hold on reality.
19:28
What is there when, if-- and this is fact, this isn't
19:32
theory right here-- that if you take anything down to the
19:35
building blocks, down to the atomic level, most of the
19:39
space of that kind of, quote-unquote object, is free
19:43
vacuum space.
19:44
You could go straight through it if you could get down to
19:46
that scale.
19:47
This image of a helium atom, they say right here this is
19:50
one femtometer.
19:52
Right?
19:52
One femtometer.
19:57
This is the scale of the nucleus of a
20:00
helium atom, right?
20:01
One femtometer.
20:03
This is one angstrom, right?
20:04
And they say that equals 100,000 femtometers.
20:06
And just to get a sense of scale, one angstrom is 1 times
20:10
10 to the negative 10 meters, right?
20:13
So the atom is roughly on the scale of an angstrom.
20:15
In the case of helium, the nucleus is
20:17
even a smaller fraction.
20:18
It's 1/100,000.
20:20
So if you had-- let's say you had liquid helium, which you'd
20:23
have to get very cold to get.
20:25
If you're looking at that, most of it is free space.
20:27
If you're looking at an iron bar, the great, great, great,
20:30
great, great, great majority of it is free space.
20:33
And we're not even talking about, maybe there's some free
20:35
space inside the nucleus that we could talk
20:37
about in the future.
20:38
But to me, that just blows my mind that most things we look
20:41
at are not really solid.
20:44
They're really just empty space, but they look solid
20:47
because of the way light reflects on them or the forces
20:50
that repel us.
20:51
But there really isn't something to touch there.
20:55
That most of this right here is all free space.
20:57
I think I've said the word free space now, and I think

0:00
I've now supplied you with two definitions of the state
0:03
variable entropy.
0:04
And it's S for entropy.
0:06
The thermodynamic definition said that the change in
0:09
entropy is equal to the heat added to the system divided by
0:12
the temperature at which the heat is added.
0:14
So obviously, if the temperature is changing while
0:16
we add the heat, which is normally the case, we're going
0:18
to have to do a little bit of calculus.
0:20
And then you can view this as the mathematical, or the
0:22
statistical, or the combinatorical
0:24
definition of entropy.
0:26
And this essentially says that entropy is equal to some
0:29
constant times the natural log of the number of states the
0:32
system can take on.
0:33
And this is the case when all the states are equally
0:35
probable, which is a pretty good assumption.
0:37
If you have just a gazillion molecules that could have a
0:41
gazillion gazillion states, you can assume they're all
0:43
roughly equally likely.
0:44
There's a slightly more involved definition if they
0:46
had different probabilities, but we won't
0:48
worry about that now.
0:49
So given that we've seen these two definitions, it's a good
0:52
time to introduce you to the second law of thermodynamics.
1:00
And that's this.
1:01
And it's a pretty simple law, but it explains a whole range
1:04
of phenomena.
1:06
It tells us that the change in entropy for the universe when
1:16
any process is undergone is always greater
1:19
than or equal to 0.
1:22
So that tells us that when anything ever happens in the
1:26
universe, the net effect is that there's more entropy in
1:30
the universe itself.
1:31
And this seems very deep, and it actually is.
1:34
So let's see if we can apply it to see why it explains, or
1:38
why it makes sense, relative to some examples.
1:41
So let's say I have two reservoirs that are in contact
1:44
with each other.
1:45
So I have T1.
1:49
And let's call this our hot reservoir.
1:52
And then I have T2.
1:56
I'll call this our cold reservoir.
1:58
Well, we know from experience.
1:59
What happens if I put a hot cup of water, and it's sharing
2:03
a wall with a cold glass of water, or cold cube of water,
2:07
what happens?
2:08
Well, their temperatures equalize.
2:09
If these are the same substance, we'll end up
2:11
roughly in between, if they're in the same phase.
2:13
So essentially, we have a transfer of heat from the
2:15
hotter substance to the colder substance.
2:18
So we have some heat, Q, that goes from the hotter substance
2:23
to the colder substance.
2:24
You don't see, in everyday reality, heat going from a
2:27
colder substance to a hotter substance.
2:29
If I put an ice cube in, let's say, some hot tea, you don't
2:33
see the ice cube getting colder and the
2:35
hot tea getting hotter.
2:36
You see them both getting to some equal temperature, which
2:39
essentially the T is giving heat to the ice cube.
2:42
Now in this situation there are reservoirs, so I'm
2:44
assuming that their temperatures stay constant.
2:46
Which would only be the case if they were both infinite,
2:49
which we know doesn't exist in the real world.
2:51
In the real world, T1's temperature as it gave heat
2:53
would go down, and T2's temperature would go up.
2:56
But let's just see whether the second law of thermodynamics
2:59
says that this should happen.
3:01
So what's happening here?
3:04
What's the net change in entropy for T1?
3:07
So the second law of thermodynamics says that the
3:09
change in entropy for the universe is greater than 0.
3:13
But in this case, that's equal to the change in entropy for
3:16
T1 plus the change in entropy for-- oh, I shouldn't--
3:23
instead of T1, let me call it just 1.
3:28
For system 1, that's this hot system up here, plus the
3:31
change in entropy for system 2.
3:33
So what's the change in entropy for system 1?
3:35
It loses Q1 at a high temperature.
3:43
So this equals minus the heat given to the system is Q over
3:50
some hot temperature T1.
3:53
And then we have the heat being added to the system T2.
3:57
So plus Q over T2.
4:02
This is the change in entropy for the system 2, right?
4:05
This guy loses the heat, and is at temperature 1, which is
4:08
a higher temperature.
4:09
This guy gains the heat, and he is at a temperature 2,
4:12
which is a colder temperature.
4:13
Now, is this going to be greater than 0?
4:18
Let's think about it a little bit.
4:19
If I divide-- let me rewrite this.
4:22
So I can rearrange them, so that we can write this as Q
4:25
over T2 minus this one.
4:28
I'm just rearranging it.
4:30
Minus Q over T1.
4:33
Now, which number is bigger?
4:35
T2 to T1?
4:36
Well, T1 is bigger, right?
4:39
This is bigger.
4:43
Now, if I have a bigger number, bigger than this--
4:46
when we use the word bigger, you have to
4:47
compare it to something.
4:48
Now, T1 is bigger than this.
4:50
We have the same number in the numerator
4:52
in both cases, right?
4:54
So if I take, let's say, 1 over some, let's say, 1/2
4:58
minus 1/3, we're going to be bigger than 0.
5:01
This is a larger number than this number, because this has
5:03
a bigger denominator.
5:04
You're dividing by a larger number.
5:06
That's a good way to think about it.
5:08
You're dividing this Q by some number here to get something,
5:11
and then you're subtracting this Q
5:13
divided by a larger number.
5:14
So this fraction is going to be a smaller absolute number.
5:16
So this is going to be greater than 0.
5:20
So that tells us the second law of thermodynamics, it
5:23
verifies this observation we see in the real world, that
5:28
heat will flow from the hot body to the cold body.
5:32
Now, you might say, hey, Sal.
5:33
I have a case that will show you that you are wrong.
5:38
You could say, look.
5:39
If I put an air conditioner in a room-- Let's say this is the
5:45
room, and this is outside.
5:50
You'll say, look what the air conditioner does.
5:54
The room is already cold, and outside is already hot.
5:59
But what the air conditioner does, is it makes the cold
6:01
even colder, and it makes the hot even hotter.
6:04
It takes some Q and it goes in that direction.
6:08
Right?
6:09
It takes heat from the cold room, and puts it out
6:11
into the hot air.
6:12
And you're saying, this defies the second law of
6:14
thermodynamics.
6:15
You have just disproved it.
6:17
You deserve a Nobel Prize.
6:18
And I would say to you, you're forgetting one small fact.
6:24
This air conditioner inside here, it has some type of a
6:27
compressor, some type of an engine, that's
6:29
actively doing this.
6:31
It's putting in work to make this happen.
6:33
And this engine right here-- I'll do it in magenta-- it's
6:38
also expelling some more heat.
6:40
So let's call that Q of the engine.
6:47
So if you wanted to figure out the total entropy created for
6:52
the universe, it would be the entropy of the cold room plus
7:02
the change in entropy for outside-- I'll call it
7:06
outside, maybe I'll call this, for the room.
7:10
Right?
7:10
So you might say, OK.
7:11
This change in entropy for the room, it's giving away heat--
7:14
let's see the room is roughly at a constant temperature for
7:16
that one millisecond we're looking at it.
7:19
It's giving away some Q at some temperature T1.
7:23
And then-- so that's a minus.
7:26
And then this the outside is gaining some heat at some
7:30
temperature T2.
7:32
And so you'll immediately say, hey.
7:33
This number right here is a smaller number than this one.
7:39
Right?
7:39
Because the denominator is higher.
7:41
So if you just look at this, this would be negative
7:43
entropy, and you'd say hey, this defies the second law of
7:46
thermodynamics.
7:47
No!
7:47
But what you have to throw in here is another notion.
7:50
You have to throw in here the notion that the outside is
7:52
also getting this heat from the engine over the outside
7:58
temperature.
7:59
And this term, I can guarantee you-- I'm not giving you
8:03
numbers right now-- will make this
8:05
whole expression positive.
8:07
This term will turn the total net entropy to the universe to
8:12
be positive.
8:13
Now let's think a little bit how about what entropy is and
8:17
what entropy isn't in terms of words.
8:18
So when you take an intro chemistry class, the teacher
8:22
often says, entropy equals disorder.
8:28
Which is not incorrect.
8:30
It is disorder, but you have to be very careful what we
8:34
mean by disorder.
8:35
Because the very next example that's often given is that
8:39
they'll say, look.
8:40
A clean room-- let's say your bedroom is clean, and then it
8:45
becomes dirty.
8:45
And they'll say, look.
8:46
The universe became more disordered.
8:48
The dirty room has more disorder than the clean room.
8:53
And this is not a case of entropy increase.
8:56
So this is not a good example.
9:01
Why is that?
9:04
Because clean and dirty are just states of the room.
9:07
Remember, entropy is a macro state variable.
9:14
It's something you use to describe a system where you're
9:16
not in the mood to sit there and tell me what exactly every
9:19
particle is doing.
9:20
And this is a macro variable that actually tells me how
9:23
much time would it take for me to tell you what every
9:27
particle is doing.
9:28
It actually tells you how many states there are, or how much
9:30
information I would have to give you to tell
9:32
you the exact state.
9:34
Now, when you have a clean room and a dirty room, these
9:36
are two different states of the same room.
9:39
If the room has the same temperature, and it has the
9:42
same number of molecules in it and everything, then they have
9:46
the same entropy.
9:47
So clean to dirty, it's not more entropy.
9:49
Now, for example, I could have a dirty, cold room.
9:58
And let's say I were to go into that room and, you know,
10:01
I work really hard to clean it up.
10:03
And by doing so, I add a lot of heat to the system, and my
10:06
sweat molecules drop all over the place, and so there's just
10:09
more stuff in that room, and it's all warmed up to me-- so
10:13
to a hot, clean room with sweat in it-- so it's got more
10:22
stuff in here that can be configured in more ways, and
10:25
because it's hot, every molecule in the room can take
10:28
on more states, right?
10:29
Because the average kinetic energy is up, so they can kind
10:32
of explore the spaces of how many kinetic energies it can
10:36
have. There's more potential energies that each molecule
10:39
can take on.
10:40
This is actually an increase in entropy.
10:42
From a dirty, cold room to a hot, clean room.
10:45
And this actually goes well with what we know.
10:47
I mean, when I go into room and I start cleaning it, I am
10:50
in putting heat into the room.
10:52
And the universe is becoming more-- I guess we could say
10:55
it's the entropy is increasing.
10:57
So where does the term disorder apply?
11:03
Well, let's take a situation where I take a ball.
11:07
I take a ball, and it falls to the ground.
11:10
And then it hits the ground.
11:12
And there should have been a question that you've been
11:14
asking all the time, since the first law of thermodynamics.
11:20
So the ball hits the ground, right?
11:21
It got thrown up, it had some potential energy at the top,
11:24
then that all gets turned into kinetic energy and it hits the
11:26
ground, and then it stops.
11:28
And so your obvious question is, what happened to all that
11:30
energy, right?
11:31
Law of conservation of energy.
11:33
Where did all of it go?
11:34
It had all that kinetic energy right before it hit the
11:35
ground, then it stopped.
11:37
Right?
11:37
It seems like it disappeared.
11:39
But it didn't disappear.
11:40
So when the ball was falling, it had a bunch of-- you know,
11:44
everything had a little bit of heat.
11:45
But let's say the ground was reasonably ordered.
11:51
The ground molecules were vibrating with some kinetic
11:56
energy and potential energies.
11:58
And then our ball molecules were also
12:00
vibrating a little bit.
12:02
But most of their motion was downwards, right?
12:06
Most of the ball molecules' motion was downwards.
12:09
Now, when it hits the ground, what happens-- let me show you
12:12
the interface of the ball.
12:14
So the ball molecules at the front of the ball are going to
12:17
look like that.
12:19
And there's a bunch of them.
12:20
It's a solid.
12:21
It will maybe be some type of lattice.
12:24
And then it hits the ground.
12:25
And when it hits the ground-- so the ground is another solid
12:30
like that-- All right, we're looking at the microstate.
12:35
What's going to happen?
12:37
These guys are going to rub up against these guys, and
12:39
they're going to transfer their-- what was downward
12:41
kinetic energy, and a very ordered downward kinetic
12:45
energy-- they're going to transfer it to
12:47
these ground particles.
12:49
And they're going to bump into the ground particles.
12:50
And so when this guy bumps into that guy, he might start
12:54
moving in that direction.
12:55
This guy will start oscillating in that direction,
12:57
and go back and forth like that.
12:59
That guy might bounce off of this guy, and go in that
13:02
direction, and bump into that guy, and
13:04
go into that direction.
13:05
And then, because that guy bumped here, this guy bumps
13:09
here, and because this guy bumps here, this guy bumps
13:11
over there.
13:12
And so what you have is, what was relatively ordered motion,
13:16
especially from the ball's point of view, when it starts
13:19
rubbing up against these molecules of the ground, it
13:22
starts making the kinetic energy, or their movement, go
13:24
in all sorts of random directions.
13:26
Right?
13:27
This guy's going to make this guy go like that, and that guy
13:29
go like that.
13:30
And so when the movement is no longer ordered, if I have a
13:33
lot of molecules-- let me do it in a different color-- if I
13:36
have a lot of molecules, and they're all moving in the
13:38
exact same direction, then my micro state looks like my
13:41
macro state.
13:42
The whole thing moves in that direction.
13:44
Now, if I have a bunch of molecules, and they're all
13:47
moving in random directions, my ball as a whole will be
13:51
stationary.
13:52
I could have the exact same amount of kinetic energy at
13:54
the molecular level, but they're all going to be
13:56
bouncing into each other.
13:58
And in this case, we described the kinetic energy as internal
14:02
energy, or we describe it as temperature, where temperature
14:06
is the average kinetic energy.
14:07
So in this case, when we talk about, the world is becoming
14:10
more disordered, you think about the order of maybe the
14:13
velocities or the energies of the molecules.
14:16
Before they were reasonably ordered, the molecules-- they
14:18
might have been vibrating a little bit, but they were
14:20
mainly going down in the ball.
14:22
But when they bump into the ground, all of a sudden they
14:24
start vibrating in random directions a little bit more.
14:26
And they make the ground vibrate in more random
14:28
directions.
14:29
So it makes-- at the microstate-- everything became
14:32
just that much more disordered.
14:36
Now there's an interesting question here.
14:37
There is some probability you might think-- Look, this ball
14:41
came down and hit the ground.
14:43
Why doesn't the ball just-- isn't there some probability
14:46
that if I have a ground, that these molecules just rearrange
14:50
themselves in just the right way to just hit these ball
14:56
molecules in just the right way?
14:58
There's some probability, just from the random movement, that
15:00
at get some second, all the ground molecules just hit the
15:04
ball molecules just right to send the ball back up.
15:08
And the answer is yes.
15:10
There's actually some infinitesimally small chance
15:13
that that happens.
15:14
That you could have a ball that's sitting on the ground--
15:16
and this is interesting-- could have a ball that's
15:19
sitting on the ground, and while you're looking, you'll
15:21
probably have to wait a few gazillion years for it to
15:24
happen, if it happens at all-- it could just randomly pop up.
15:28
And there's some random, very small chance that these
15:33
molecules just randomly vibrate in just the right way
15:36
to be ordered for a second, and then the ball will pop up.
15:39
But the probability of this happening, relative to
15:43
everything else, is essentially 0.
15:46
So when people talk about order and disorder, the
15:49
disorder is increasing, because now these molecules
15:52
are going in more random directions, and they can take
15:54
on more potential states.
15:57
And we saw that here.
15:59
And you know, on some level, entropy seems something kind
16:01
of magical, but on some level, it seems
16:04
relatively common sense.
16:06
In that video-- I think was the last video-- I had a case
16:10
where I had a bunch of molecules, and then I had this
16:13
extra space here, and then I removed the wall.
16:18
And we saw that these molecules will-- we know,
16:23
there's always some modules that are bouncing off this
16:26
wall before, because we probably had some pressure
16:28
associated with it.
16:29
And then as soon as we remove that wall, the molecule that
16:31
would have bounced there just keeps going.
16:34
There's nothing to stop it from there.
16:36
In that direction, there's a lot of stuff.
16:37
It could bump into other molecules, and it could
16:39
bumping into these walls.
16:40
But in this direction, the odds of it bumping into
16:42
everything is, especially for these leading molecules, is
16:45
essentially 0.
16:45
So it's going to expand to fill the container.
16:48
So that's kind of common sense.
16:50
But the neat thing is that the second law of thermodynamics,
16:53
as we saw in that video, also says that this will happen.
16:57
That the molecules will all expand to fill the container.
17:00
And that the odds of this happening are very low.
17:05
That they all come back and go into a ordered state.
17:11
Now there is some chance, just from the random movements once
17:13
they fill, that they all just happen to come back here.
17:15
But it's a very, very small probability.
17:18
And even more-- and I want to make this very clear-- S is a
17:22
macro state.
17:25
We never talk about the entropy for
17:28
an individual molecule.
17:30
If we know what an individual molecule is doing, we
17:32
shouldn't be worrying about entropy.
17:33
We should be worrying about the system as a whole.
17:38
So even if we're looking at the system, if we're not
17:43
looking directly at the molecules, we won't even know
17:45
that this actually happened.
17:48
All we can do is look at the statistical
17:50
properties of the molecules.
17:52
How many molecules they are, what their temperature is, all
17:54
their macro dynamics, the pressure, and
17:56
say, you know what?
17:57
A box that has these molecules has more state than a smaller
18:01
box, than the box when we had the wall there.
18:03
Even if, by chance, all of the molecules happened to be
18:06
collecting over there, we wouldn't know that that
18:08
happened, because we're not looking at the micro states.
18:10
And that's a really important thing to consider.
18:13
When someone says that a dirty room has a higher entropy than
18:17
a clean room, they're looking at the micro states.
18:20
And entropy essentially is a macro state variable.
18:23
You could just say that a room has a
18:24
certain amount of entropy.
18:26
So entropy is associated with the room, and it's only useful
18:32
when you really don't know exactly what's
18:33
going on in the room.
18:34
You just have a general sense of how much stuff there is in
18:37
the room, what's the temperature of the room,
18:39
what's the pressure in the room.
18:40
Just the general macro properties.
18:42
And then entropy will essentially tell us how many
18:45
possible micro states that macro system can actually
18:50
have. Or how much information-- and there's a
18:53
notion of information entropy-- how much information
18:56
would I have to give you to tell you what the exact micro
19:00
state is of a system at that point in time.
19:03
Well anyway.
19:03
Hopefully you found this discussion a little bit
19:05
useful, and it clears up some misconceptions about entropy,
19:08
and gives you a little bit more intuition about what it
19:11
actually is.

khan_video_3-xfmbdzkqc_56171,What is a null space?,MCQ,"•
0:00
In the last video, we started with the 2 by 2 matrix A is
0:05
equal to 1, 2, 4, 3.
0:09
And we used the fact that lambda is an eigenvalue of A,
0:21
if and only if, the determinate of lambda times
0:27
the identity matrix-- in this case it's a 2 by 2 identity
0:30
matrix-- minus A is equal to 0.
0:33
This gave us a characteristic polynomial and we solved for
0:36
that and we said, well, the eigenvalues for A are lambda
0:40
is equal to 5 and lambda is equal to negative 1.
0:45
That's what we saw in the last video.
0:47
We said that if you were trying to solve A times some
0:52
eigenvector is equal to lambda times that eigenvector, the
0:56
two lambdas, which this equation can be solved for,
0:59
are the lambdas 5 and minus 1.
1:04
Assuming nonzero eigenvectors.
1:18
So we have our eigenvalues, but I don't even call that
1:21
half the battle.
1:22
What we really want is our eigenvectors and our
1:24
eigenvalues.
1:24
So let's see if we can do that.
1:27
So if we manipulate this equation a little bit and
1:30
we've manipulate it in the past. Actually, we've even
1:32
come up with this statement over here.
1:34
We can rewrite this over here as the 0 vector is equal to
1:38
lambda times my eigenvector minus A times my eigenvector.
1:43
I just subtracted Av from both sides.
1:45
We know lambda times some eigenvector is the same thing
1:48
as lambda times the identity matrix times that eigenvector.
1:54
So all I'm doing is rewriting this like that.
1:58
You multiply the identity matrix times an eigenvector or
2:00
times any vector, you're just going to get that vector.
2:02
So these two things are equivalent.
2:03
Minus Av.
2:07
That's still going to be able to the 0 vector.
2:09
So far all I've done is manipulated this thing.
2:11
This is really how we got to that thing up there.
2:15
You factor out the v so to speak because we know that
2:18
matrix vector products exhibit the distributive property.
2:21
And we get lambda times the identity matrix minus A times
2:28
my eigenvector have got to be equal to 0.
2:33
Or another way to say it is, for any lambda eigenvalue, and
2:43
let me write it for any eigenvalue lambda, the
2:51
eigenvectors that correspond to that lambda, we can call
2:54
that the eigenspace for a lambda.
2:59
So that's a new word, eigenspace.
3:04
Eigenspace just means all of the eigenvectors that
3:07
correspond to some eigenvalue.
3:09
The eigenspace for some particular eigenvalue is going
3:16
to be equal to the set of vectors that
3:18
satisfy this equation.
3:19
Well, the set of vectors that satisfy this equation is just
3:22
the null space of that right there.
3:26
So it's equal to the null space of this
3:29
matrix right there.
3:30
The null space of lambda times the identity matrix.
3:34
And by an identity matrix minus A.
3:36
And so everything I've done here, this is true-- this is
3:39
the general case.
3:39
But now we can apply this notion to this
3:42
matrix A right here.
3:44
So we know that 5 is an eigenvalue.
3:48
Let's say for lambda is equal to 5, the eigenspace that
3:53
corresponds to 5 is equal to the null space of?
3:59
Well, what is 5 times the identity matrix?
4:03
It's going to be the 2 by 2 identity matrix.
4:06
5 times the identity matrix is just 5, 0, 0, 5 minus A.
4:15
That's just 1, 2, 4, 3.
4:19
So that is equal to the null space of the matrix.
4:27
5 minus 1 is 4.
4:29
0 minus 2 is minus 2.
4:32
0 minus 4 is minus 4.
4:36
And then, 5 minus 3 is 2.
4:40
So the null space of this matrix right here-- and this
4:43
matrix is just an actual numerical representation of
4:46
this matrix right here.
4:48
The null space of this matrix is the set of all of the
4:51
vectors that satisfy this or all of the eigenvectors that
4:55
correspond to this eigenvalue.
4:56
Or, the eigenspace that corresponds to
4:59
the eigenvalue 5.
5:00
These are all equivalent statements.
5:02
So we just need to figure out the null space of this guy is
5:05
all of the vectors that satisfy the equation 4 minus
5:09
2, minus 4, 2 times some eigenvector is
5:13
equal to the 0 vector.
5:15
And the null space of a matrix is equal to the null space of
5:19
the reduced row echelon form of a matrix.
5:21
So what's the reduced row echelon form of this guy?
5:24
Well, I guess a good starting point-- let me keep my first
5:29
row the same, 4 minus 2.
5:31
And let me replace my second row with my second row
5:34
plus my first row.
5:35
So minus 4 plus 4 is 0.
5:38
2 plus minus 2 is 0.
5:40
Now, let me divide my first row by 4 and I
5:44
get 1, minus 1/2.
5:47
And then I get 0, 0.
5:49
So what's the null space of this?
5:51
This corresponds to v.
5:53
This times v1, v2-- that's just another way of writing my
5:58
eigenvector v-- has got to be equal to the 0 vector.
6:03
Or another way to say it is that my first entry v1, which
6:08
corresponds to this pivot column, plus or minus 1/2
6:12
times my second entry has got to be equal to
6:15
that 0 right there.
6:17
Or, v1 is equal to 1/2 v2.
6:24
And so if I wanted to write all of the eigenvectors that
6:27
satisfy this, I could write it this way.
6:29
My eigenspace that corresponds to lambda equals 5.
6:35
That corresponds to the eigenvalue 5 is equal to the
6:39
set of all of the vectors, v1, v2, that are equal to some
6:48
scaling factor.
6:49
Let's say it's equal to t times what?
6:53
If we say that v2 is equal to t, so v2 is going to be equal
6:58
to t times 1.
7:01
And then, v1 is going to be equal to 1/2 times v2
7:05
or 1/2 times t.
7:09
Just like that.
7:13
For any t is a member of the real numbers.
7:16
If we wanted to, we could scale this up.
7:17
We could say any real number times 1, 2.
7:20
That would also be the span.
7:23
Let me do that actually.
7:24
It'll make it a little bit cleaner.
7:26
Actually, I don't have to do that.
7:27
So we could write that the eigenspace for the eigenvalue
7:32
5 is equal to the span of the vector 1/2 and 1.
7:42
So it's a line in R2.
7:44
Those are all of the eigenvectors that satisfy--
7:47
that work for the equation where the
7:48
eigenvalue is equal to 5.
7:51
Now what about when the eigenvalue is
7:53
equal to minus 1?
7:59
So let's do that case.
8:00
When lambda is equal to minus 1, then we have-- it's going
8:07
to be the null space.
8:09
So the eigenspace for lambda is equal to minus 1 is going
8:13
to be the null space of lambda times our identity matrix,
8:18
which is going to be minus 1 and 0, 0, minus 1.
8:23
It's going to be minus 1 times 1, 0, 0, 1, which is just
8:26
minus 1 there.
8:27
Minus A.
8:28
So minus 1, 2, 4, 3.
8:33
And this is equal to the null space of-- minus 1,
8:37
minus 1 is minus 2.
8:40
0 minus 2 is minus 2.
8:43
0 minus 4 is minus 4 and minus 1 minus 3 is minus 4.
8:49
And that's going to be equal to the null space of the
8:51
reduced row echelon form of that guy.
8:53
So we can perform some row operations right here.
8:56
Let me just put it in reduced row echelon form.
8:59
So if I replace my second row plus 2 times my first row.
9:06
So I'll keep the first row the same.
9:08
Minus 2, minus 2.
9:09
And then my second row, I'll replace it with two times--
9:11
I'll replace it with it plus 2 times the first. Or even
9:14
better, I'm going to replace it with it plus minus 2 times
9:17
the first. So minus 4 plus 4 is 0.
9:23
And then if I divide the top row by minus 2, the reduced
9:26
row echelon form of this matrix right here or this
9:30
matrix right here is going to be 1, 1, 0.
9:34
So the eigenspace that corresponds to the eigenvalue
9:38
minus 1 is equal to the null space of this guy right here
9:48
It's the set of vectors that satisfy this
9:50
equation: 1, 1, 0, 0.
9:54
And then you have v1, v2 is equal to 0.
9:59
Or you get v1 plus-- these aren't vectors,
10:02
these are just values.
10:04
v1 plus v2 is equal to 0.
10:10
Because 0 is just equal to that thing right there.
10:14
So 1 times v1 plus 1 times v2 is going to be equal to that 0
10:17
right there.
10:18
Or I could write v1 is equal to minus v2.
10:21
Or if we say that v2 is equal to t, we could say v1 is equal
10:28
to minus t.
10:30
Or we could say that the eigenspace for the eigenvalue
10:34
minus 1 is equal to all of the vectors, v1, v2 that are equal
10:41
to some scalar t times v1 is minus t and v2 is plus t.
10:50
Or you could say this is equal to the span of the vector
10:54
minus 1 and 1.
10:56
So let's just graph this a little bit just to understand
10:59
what we just did.
11:00
We were able to find two eigenvalues for
11:02
this, 5 and minus 1.
11:05
And we were able to find all of the vectors that are
11:08
essentially-- or, we were able to find the set of vectors
11:11
that are the eigenvectors that correspond to each of these
11:14
eigenvalues.
11:15
So let's graph them.
11:16
So if we go to R2, let me draw my axes, this
11:19
is my vertical axis.
11:22
That's my horizontal axis.
11:26
So all of the vectors that correspond to lambda equal 5
11:30
are along the line 1/2, 1.
11:33
Or the span of 1/2, 1.
11:35
So that is 1.
11:37
That is 1.
11:38
So you go 1/2 and 1 just like that.
11:42
So that's that vector, spanning vector.
11:46
But anything along the span of this, all the multiples of
11:49
this, are going to be valid eigenvectors.
11:52
So anything along that line, all of the vectors when you
11:55
draw them in standard position, point to a
11:56
point on that line.
11:59
All of these vectors, any vector on there is going to be
12:01
a valid eigenvector and the corresponding eigenvalue is
12:05
going to be equal to 5.
12:07
So you give me this guy right here.
12:11
When you apply the transformation, it's going to
12:13
be five times this guy.
12:18
If this guy is x, t of x is going to be
12:21
five times this guy.
12:22
Whatever vector you give along this line, the transformation
12:25
of that guy, the transformation is literally,
12:27
multiplying it by the matrix A.
12:31
Where did I have the matrix A?
12:32
The matrix A right up there.
12:34
You're essentially just scaling this guy by 5 in
12:36
either direction.
12:37
This is for lambda equal 5.
12:40
And for lambda equals 1, it's the span of this vector, which
12:44
is minus 1, 1.
12:48
Which looks like this.
12:51
So this vector looks like that.
12:53
We care about the span of it.
12:58
Any vector that when you draw in standard position lies, or
13:01
points to, points on this line, will be an eigenvector
13:05
for the eigenvalue minus 1.
13:08
So lambda equals minus 1.
13:11
Let's say you take the spanning vector here.
13:13
You apply the transformation, you're going to get
13:16
minus 1 times it.
13:17
So if this is x, the transformation of x is going
13:20
to be that right there.
13:21
Same length, just in the opposite direction.
13:23
If you have this guy right here, you apply the
13:26
transformation, it's going to be in the same spanning line
13:29
just like that.
13:30
So the two eigenspaces for the matrix-- where did I write it?
13:35
I think it was the matrix 1, 2, 3-- 1, 2, 4, 3.
13:40
The two eigenvalues were 5 and minus 1.
13:45
And then it has an infinite number of eigenvectors, so
13:48
they actually create two eigenspaces.
13:50
Each of them correspond to one of the eigenvalues.
13:54
And these lines represent those two eigenspaces.
13:57
You give me any vector in either of these sets and
13:59
they're going to be an eigenvector.
14:02
I'm using the word vector too much.
14:03
You give me any vector in either of these sets, and they
14:05
will be an eigenvector for our matrix A.
14:08
And then, depending on which line it is, we know what their
14:10
transformation is going to be.
14:11
If it's going to be on this guy, we take the
14:13
transformation, the resulting vector's going to be five
14:16
times the vector.
14:17
If you take one of these eigenvectors and you transform
14:20
it, the resulting transformation of the vector's
14:22
going to be minus 1 times that vector.
14:25
Anyway, we now know what eigenvalues, eigenvectors,
14:28
eigenspaces are.
14:30
And even better, we know how to actually find them.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,3-xfmbdzkqc,

That is 1 kilogram.
0:15
And we're on earth, and I need to mention that because
0:20
gravity is different from planet to planet.
0:22
But as I mentioned, I'm holding it.
0:24
Let's say I'm holding it 10 meters above the ground.
0:27
So this distance or this height is 10 meters.
0:34
And we're assuming the acceleration of gravity, which
0:39
we also write as just g, let's assume it's just 10 meters per
0:42
second squared just for the simplicity of the math instead
0:44
of the 9.8.
0:45
So what we learned in the last video is that the potential
0:48
energy in this situation, the potential energy, which equals
0:53
m times g times h is equal to the mass is 1 kilogram times
0:59
the acceleration of gravity, which is 10
1:02
meters per second squared.
1:03
I'm not going to write the units down just to save space,
1:05
although you should do this when you do it on your test.
1:08
And then the height is 10 meters.
1:11
And the units, if you work them all out, it's in newton
1:13
meters or joules and so it's equal to 100 joules.
1:17
That's the potential energy when I'm holding it up there.
1:20
And I asked you, well when I let go, what happens?
1:22
Well the block obviously will start falling.
1:24
And not only falling, it will start accelerating to the
1:26
ground at 10 meters per second squared roughly.
1:29
And right before it hits the ground-- let me draw that in
1:33
brown for ground-- right before the object hits the
1:38
ground or actually right when it hits the ground, what will
1:43
be the potential energy of the object?
1:46
Well it has no height, right?
1:48
Potential energy is mgh.
1:49
The mass and the acceleration of gravity stay the same, but
1:51
the height is 0.
1:52
So they're all multiplied by each other.
1:54
So down here, the potential energy is going
1:56
to be equal to 0.
1:58
And I told you in the last video that we have the law of
2:00
conservation of energy.
2:01
That energy is conserved.
2:02
It cannot be created or destroyed.
2:04
It can just be converted from one form to another.
2:06
But I'm just showing you, this object had 100 joules of
2:10
energy or, in this case,
2:12
gravitational potential energy.
2:13
And down here, it has no energy.
2:16
Or at least it has no gravitational potential
2:18
energy, and that's the key.
2:20
That gravitational potential energy was converted into
2:22
something else.
2:23
And that something else it was converted
2:25
into is kinetic energy.
2:28
And in this case, since it has no potential energy, all of
2:32
that previous potential energy, all of this 100 joules
2:35
that it has up here is now going to be converted into
2:39
kinetic energy.
2:40
And we can use that information to figure out its
2:43
velocity right before it hits the ground.
2:46
So how do we do that?
2:47
Well what's the formula for kinetic energy?
2:49
And we solved it two videos ago, and hopefully it
2:52
shouldn't be too much of a mystery to you.
2:53
It's something good to memorize, but it's also good
2:55
to know how we got it and go back two videos if you forgot.
3:01
So first we know that all the potential energy was converted
3:05
into kinetic energy.
3:07
We had 100 joules of potential energy, so we're still going
3:10
to have 100 joules, but now all of it's going to be
3:12
kinetic energy.
3:13
And kinetic energy is 1/2 mv squared.
3:17
So we know that 1/2 mv squared, or the kinetic
3:21
energy, is now going to equal 100 joules.
3:24
What's the mass?
3:25
The mass is 1.
3:27
And we can solve for v now.
3:29
1/2 v squared equals 100 joules, and v
3:31
squared is equal to 200.
3:36
And then we get v is equal to square root of 200, which is
3:39
something over 14.
3:40
We can get the exact number.
3:41
Let's see, 200 square root, 14.1 roughly.
3:46
The velocity is going to be 14.1 meters per
3:51
second squared downwards.
3:52
Right before the object touches the ground.
3:55
Right before it touches the ground.
3:56
And you might say, well Sal that's nice and everything.
3:59
We learned a little bit about energy.
4:01
I could have solved that or hopefully you could have
4:02
solved that problem just using your kinematics formula.
4:04
So what's the whole point of introducing
4:07
these concepts of energy?
4:09
And I will now show you.
4:11
So let's say they have the same 1 kilogram object up here
4:14
and it's 10 meters in the air, but I'm going to change things
4:17
a little bit.
4:20
Let me see if I can competently erase all of this.
4:24
Nope, that's not what I wanted to do.
4:29
OK, there you go.
4:31
I'm trying my best to erase this, all of this stuff.
4:37
OK.
4:38
So I have the same object.
4:40
It's still 10 meters in the air and I'll
4:43
write that in a second.
4:45
And I'm just holding it there and I'm still going to drop
4:47
it, but something interesting is going to happen.
4:50
Instead of it going straight down, it's actually going to
4:51
drop on this ramp of ice.
4:57
The ice has lumps on it.
5:01
And then this is the bottom.
5:02
This is the ground down here.
5:04
This is the ground.
5:07
So what's going to happen this time?
5:09
I'm still 10 meters in the air, so let me draw that.
5:11
That's still 10 meters.
5:12
I should switch colors just so not everything is ice.
5:15
So that's still 10 meters, but instead of the object going
5:18
straight down now, it's going to go down here and then start
5:21
sliding, right?
5:21
It's going to go sliding along this hill.
5:24
And then at this point it's going to be going really fast
5:27
in the horizontal direction.
5:29
And right now we don't know how fast.
5:31
And just using our kinematics formula, this would have been
5:34
a really tough formula.
5:35
This would have been difficult.
5:38
I mean you could have attempted it and it actually
5:40
would have taken calculus because the angle of the slope
5:42
changes continuously.
5:44
We don't even know the formula for the angle of the slope.
5:46
You would have had to break it out into vectors.
5:48
You would have to do all sorts of complicated things.
5:49
This would have been a nearly impossible problem.
5:52
But using energy, we can actually figure out what the
5:55
velocity of this object is at this point.
5:58
And we use the same idea.
6:00
Here we have 100 joules of potential energy.
6:03
We just figured that out.
6:05
Down here, what's the height above the ground?
6:07
Well the height is 0.
6:08
So all the potential energy has disappeared.
6:10
And just like in the previous situation, all of the
6:13
potential energy is now converted into kinetic energy.
6:16
And so what is that kinetic energy going to equal?
6:18
It's going to be equal to the initial potential energy.
6:21
So here the kinetic energy is equal to 100 joules.
6:27
And that equals 1/2 mv squared, just
6:30
like we just solved.
6:31
And if you solve for v, the mass is 1 kilogram.
6:34
So the velocity in the horizontal direction will be,
6:39
if you solve for it, 14.1 meters per second.
6:42
Instead of going straight down, now it's going to be
6:44
going in the horizontal to the right.
6:47
And the reason why I said it was ice is because I wanted
6:49
this to be frictionless and I didn't want any energy lost to
6:52
heat or anything like that.
6:53
And you might say OK Sal, that's kind of interesting.
6:56
And you kind of got the same number for the velocity than
6:59
if I just dropped the object straight down.
7:01
And that's interesting.
7:02
But what else can this do for me?
7:07
And this is where it's really cool.
7:10
Not only can I figure out the velocity when all of the
7:15
potential energy has disappeared, but I can figure
7:17
out the velocity of any point-- and this is
7:19
fascinating-- along this slide.
7:21
So let's say when the box is sliding down here, so let's
7:25
say the box is at this point.
7:29
It changes colors too as it falls.
7:31
So this is the 1 kilogram box, right?
7:34
It falls and it slides down here.
7:35
And let's say at this point it's height above the ground
7:40
is 5 meters.
7:42
So what's its potential energy here?
7:44
So let's just write something.
7:45
All of the energy is conserved, right?
7:47
So the initial potential energy plus the initial
7:51
kinetic energy is equal to the final potential energy plus
7:57
the final kinetic energy.
7:59
I'm just saying energy is conserved here.
8:02
Up here, what's the initial total energy in the system?
8:05
Well the potential energy is 100 and the kinetic energy is
8:08
0 because it's stationary.
8:10
I haven't dropped it.
8:11
I haven't let go of it yet.
8:13
It's just stationary.
8:14
So the initial energy is going to be equal to 100 joules.
8:18
That's cause this is 0 and this is 100.
8:20
So the initial energy is 100 joules.
8:22
At this point right here, what's the potential energy?
8:27
Well we're 5 meters up, so mass times
8:32
gravity times height.
8:32
Mass is 1, times gravity, 10 meters per second squared.
8:36
Times height, times 5.
8:39
So it's 50 joules.
8:40
That's our potential energy at this point.
8:43
And then we must have some kinetic energy with the
8:47
velocity going roughly in that direction.
8:48
Plus our kinetic energy at this point.
8:51
And we know that no energy was destroyed.
8:54
It's just converted.
8:55
So we know the total energy still has to be 100 joules.
8:59
So essentially what happened, and if we solve for this--
9:01
it's very easy, subtract 50 from both sides-- we know that
9:03
the kinetic energy is now also going to
9:06
be equal to 50 joules.
9:07
So what happened?
9:07
Halfway down, essentially half of the potential energy got
9:12
converted to kinetic energy.
9:14
And we can use this information that the kinetic
9:16
energy is 50 joules to figure out the
9:18
velocity at this point.
9:20
1/2 mv squared is equal to 50.
9:24
The mass is 1.
9:26
Multiply both sides by 2.
9:27
You get v squared is equal to 100.
9:30
The velocity is 10 meters per second along
9:34
this crazy, icy slide.
9:37
And that is something that I would have challenged you to
9:39
solve using traditional kinematics formulas,
9:42
especially considering that we don't know really much about
9:46
the surface of this slide.
9:49
And even if we did, that would have been a million times
9:51
harder than just using the law of conservation of energy and
9:55
realizing that at this point, half the potential energy is
9:58
now kinetic energy and it's going along the
10:00
direction of the slide.

khan_video_ptAw20kem90_23191,"Why is potassium chloride considered an ""ionic"" compound if the two atoms already neutralized each other?",Essay,"•
0:00
- [Instructor] Let's get some practice now thinking
0:01
about how ions typically form,
0:03
how they might form compounds
0:05
and how we name those compounds.
0:08
So let's start with something in group one.
0:12
In this first column, this first column is often known
0:15
as alkali metals.
0:17
So let's start with potassium.
0:19
K is the symbol for potassium.
0:23
Now things in group one here,
0:25
one way to think about is their outermost shell
0:27
has one electron in it.
0:29
So they wouldn't mind losing that electron.
0:32
So when they ionize, they tend to lose an electron
0:35
and become a cation, a positive ion.
0:39
And so let's look at a situation where I have some potassium
0:44
that has been ionized.
0:47
I could write it just like this,
0:49
we've seen that in previous videos
0:51
and we can refer to this just as a potassium ion,
0:54
we could refer to this as potassium one plus.
0:57
We could refer to this as a potassium cation.
1:02
Now let's go on to the other side of the periodic table.
1:05
Things that would really love to grab an electron.
1:09
So things in group, in the halides,
1:14
which is this column right over here.
1:17
So these are the halides.
1:20
They have seven electrons in their outermost shell.
1:23
They would love to have eight,
1:25
so they tend to be really good at grabbing electrons.
1:29
And so let's say we're dealing with chlorine,
1:31
and chlorine is able to ionize.
1:34
So it's able to grab an electron.
1:36
When chlorine grabs an electron,
1:39
it will be a negatively charged ion,
1:42
so you could write it as Chlorine one minus,
1:46
but the way that we generally refer to an anion,
1:50
a negatively charged ion,
1:53
instead of just calling this the chlorine anion,
1:56
we would call this chloride.
1:59
So this we would refer to as Chloride.
2:05
Now as you can imagine with potassium having
2:08
a positive one charge or one plus charge
2:10
and this having a negative charge,
2:12
they're going to be attracted to each other
2:14
and they can actually form an ionic compound.
2:18
The ionic compound they would form, we would write
2:22
as, you'd write your positive ion first
2:25
and then you would write your negative ion.
2:28
And this right over here would be described
2:32
as potassium chloride.
2:34
Let me write that down.
2:36
Potassium, potassium chloride.
2:43
Now you might be saying, ""Well, I just,""
2:46
Let me rewrite the whole thing.
2:48
So you know the chloride part, you say okay,
2:50
this is going to be an anion
2:52
because instead of writing chlorine
2:54
which is the name of this element,
2:56
I wrote this IDE at the end
2:58
to say, ""Hey, this is an anion,""
3:00
so I know that this is the chlorine anion, this is chloride,
3:04
why didn't I do something similar for potassium?
3:07
Well, the way the convention works
3:09
is if someone says potassium chloride,
3:11
you know you're dealing with an ionic compound
3:14
and if the chlorine has a negative one charge,
3:16
an ionic compound,
3:17
the whole thing is gonna be neutral.
3:19
So if this one over here is one minus,
3:23
then you know this over here is just one-for-one,
3:26
this is going to be one plus
3:29
so you know that you're dealing with a potassium cation
3:33
and you could say and a chloride ion or a chlorine anion.
3:38
You could refer to it various ways,
3:40
but this is potassium chloride.
3:42
You have a positively charged potassium
3:45
and you have a negatively charged chlorine,
3:47
which we would call a chloride.
3:50
In the next few videos I'll do many, many more examples
3:52
of this and ones that will be a little bit more complicated.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,ptAw20kem90,

0:01
- [Voiceover] Here we have the eclipsed confirmation
0:02
of ethane, and if I turn it so we sight
0:05
down the carbon carbon bond,
0:07
we'll see the Newman projection
0:09
for the eclipsed confirmation.
0:11
Notice I have some hydrogens in green here,
0:13
and that's just to help us visualize rotation
0:16
around the carbon carbon bond.
0:18
So I'm going to rotate the front carbon
0:21
and keep the back carbon stationary.
0:23
So now we get the staggered confirmation of ethane.
0:27
I'm gonna keep rotating 60 degrees.
0:30
So I'm gonna rotate again,
0:31
and now we have an eclipsed confirmation.
0:34
I rotate again, and now we have a staggered
0:38
confirmation of ethane.
0:40
I rotate another 60 degrees,
0:42
and we get an eclipsed confirmation.
0:45
I rotate again, and we get a staggered,
0:48
and you get the idea.
0:49
One more rotation, and we get back
0:51
to an eclipsed confirmation.
0:54
Here we have a graph of the potential energies
0:57
of the confirmations that we just saw in the video.
0:59
So we started out right here
1:01
with this eclipsed confirmation of ethane,
1:03
so we are at this particular potential energy.
1:06
As we rotate to get to this staggered confirmation,
1:10
you can see there's a decrease in potential energy.
1:13
So this staggered confirmation has a lower
1:16
potential energy than the eclipsed confirmation.
1:19
We rotate again, we get back up here
1:21
to this eclipsed confirmation.
1:22
Notice that takes energy.
1:24
So it takes energy to go from this staggered
1:26
confirmation to this eclipsed confirmation.
1:30
Going from the eclipsed to the staggered,
1:31
that's a decrease in energy.
1:33
Going from staggered up to this eclipsed,
1:35
that's an increase in energy.
1:37
Going from the eclipsed down to the staggered
1:39
again is a decrease, and finally,
1:40
back to the original eclipsed confirmation
1:43
would be an increase in energy.
1:45
Notice that all of our eclipsed confirmations here
1:49
have the same potential energy.
1:51
If I draw a line, this is all the same potential energy.
1:54
Whoops, I didn't draw a very nice line there,
1:56
but you get the idea.
1:57
Therefore, we say that these are degenerate
2:00
in terms of energy.
2:02
Same thing for the staggered confirmations.
2:04
All of these staggered confirmations,
2:06
if I draw a line in here,
2:07
have the same potential energy.
2:10
So the staggered confirmations
2:13
are lower in energy than the eclipsed confirmations.
2:17
Actually, the difference is 12 kilojoules per mole.
2:21
So if I write that in here,
2:22
so 12 kilojoules per mole,
2:25
that's talking about the difference in energy
2:28
between the eclipsed confirmations
2:30
and the staggered confirmations.
2:33
Lower in energy means more stable.
2:36
The easy way of thinking about that
2:38
is imagine these things as hills,
2:41
if I have a boulder, or a rock, or something
2:43
down here at the bottom of the hill
2:45
and I'm comparing that boulder or rock
2:47
up here to a boulder at the top of the hill.
2:50
In physics, you can set your potential energy
2:52
equal to zero at the ground.
2:54
So let's say that this is ground level.
2:56
I say my potential energy, U,
2:58
is equal to zero joules at this point.
3:01
And so the boulder in this valley here,
3:03
let's say it's 10 joules.
3:05
Let's say this is 10 joules here at this point.
3:08
And then it would take energy to push this boulder
3:10
up this hill to this point.
3:13
Let's say the final potential energy
3:16
of the boulder at this point would be 22 joules.
3:19
It takes energy in order to do that.
3:21
This final position is less stable,
3:25
and this is the higher potential energy.
3:28
So higher in potential energy means less stable.
3:32
Lower in potential energy means more stable.
3:36
So why do we have a difference in energy
3:37
between the staggered and the eclipsed confirmation?
3:40
Well this is called torsional strain.
3:43
So this difference in energy,
3:45
this 12 kilojoules per mole,
3:47
is called torsional strain.
3:51
The source of torsional strain has been
3:53
a topic of debate.
3:55
One of the current theories has to do
3:57
with molecular orbital theory.
3:59
I'm gonna go with one of the older ones,
4:01
which talks about the electron pair repulsions.
4:05
The electron pair repulsions are greatest
4:08
when the bonds are eclipsed.
4:10
So if you think about the electrons
4:11
in this bond being close to the electrons
4:14
in this bond, and you have that same thing
4:16
over here and over here,
4:18
so in space, these electron pairs,
4:20
these bonding electron pairs are closer together
4:23
in the eclipsed confirmation than they are
4:25
in the staggered.
4:26
If I go down here to the staggered,
4:27
you can see if you're thinking about these electron pairs
4:30
they're relatively further away than they are
4:33
in the eclipsed confirmation.
4:34
We know that electrons will repel.
4:37
So electron pair repulsions are greatest
4:39
when the bonds are eclipsed,
4:41
and therefore, that's higher energy
4:43
and the electron pairs are further away
4:46
from each other when you're talking about staggered,
4:48
therefore, more stable.
4:50
The total energy cost between the two confirmations
4:54
is 12 kilojoules per mole.
4:57
We have three pairs of eclipsed hydrogens.
5:01
If I go back up to here,
5:02
here's one pair of eclipsed hydrogens,
5:04
here's another pair,
5:05
and here's another pair.
5:07
So if the total energy is 12 kilojoules per mole,
5:10
and I have three pairs of eclipsed hydrogens,
5:12
we could say that the energy cost
5:14
for each pair of eclipsed hydrogens
5:16
is four kilojoules per mole.
5:19
So this would be four kilojoules per mole
5:22
for this pair of eclipsed hydrogens,
5:24
four kilojoules per mole for this one,
5:27
and four kilojoules per mole for this one,
5:29
adding up for a total of 12.
5:32
So our total energy cost is 12,
5:34
and now we can think about two hydrogens
5:36
eclipsing each other as having an energy cost
5:38
of four kilojoules per mole.
5:42
We've just seen that the staggered confirmation
5:44
of ethane is more stable than the eclipsed
5:46
confirmation of ethane.
5:47
If you want turn a staggered confirmation
5:50
into an eclipsed confirmation,
5:52
you would need energy.
5:54
At room temperature, there's enough energy
5:56
for the staggered confirmation to turn
5:58
into the eclipsed.
6:00
Equilibrium is reached between the two confirmations,
6:04
and at room temperature, approximately 99%
6:08
of ethane molecules have an approximately
6:11
staggered confirmation, whereas only
6:14
about 1% have an eclipsed confirmation.
6:17
Again, that's due to stability.

0:00
- [Voiceover] Let's explore the Fluid Mosaic Model
0:03
of cell membranes.
0:05
Now, why is it called the Fluid Mosaic Model?
0:08
Well, if we were to look at a cell membrane
0:11
and just to be clear what we're looking at,
0:12
if this is a cell right over here,
0:16
and this is its membrane,
0:18
it's kind of what keeps the cell, the inside of the cell,
0:21
separated from whatever is outside the cell.
0:24
We're looking at a cross-section of its surface,
0:29
Where down here, this is inside the cell.
0:33
If we look at it relative to this diagram,
0:35
this is inside the cell, and this is outside.
0:39
And when you zoom in,
0:42
and this little part right over here,
0:44
this is actually a phospholipid bilayer that forms it.
0:49
And so when you hear that you might say,
0:50
well, what is a phospholipid?
0:53
And that's a good question.
0:54
Because when you understand what a phospholipid is,
0:56
it starts to make sense why it would form
0:58
a bilayer like this, and why it's the basis
1:01
for so many membranes in biological systems.
1:04
So this is indicative of a phospholipid
1:07
and as its name implies, and let me write that down,
1:10
this is a phospholipid.
1:14
It's a lipid that involves a phosphate group.
1:17
And in general the word lipid,
1:19
and we have a whole video on lipids,
1:20
means something that doesn't dissolve so well in water.
1:25
And that's true, as the case of this phospholipid,
1:27
you have these hydrocarbon tails
1:30
that are coming from fatty acids,
1:32
and so these hydrocarbon tails,
1:34
they have no obvious charge or no obvious polarity.
1:37
We know that water's a polar molecule
1:39
that's what gives it its hydrogen bonds,
1:41
and it's attracted to itself.
1:43
But these don't have those, and so
1:45
they're not going to be attracted to the water
1:47
and the water's not going to be attracted to it, to them,
1:49
and so these tails are hydrophobic.
1:52
So you have hydrophobic tails,
1:58
and these are really kind of
1:59
the lipid part of the phospholipids.
2:02
And then you have the phosphate head
2:08
right over here,
2:10
and as you can clearly see, this has some charge.
2:13
Charged molecules do well in polar substances like water.
2:18
They're going to dissolve well, and so this part
2:20
right over here, is going to be hydrophilic.
2:26
And actually molecules that have a hydrophilic part
2:29
and a hydrophobic part,
2:31
there's a special word for them.
2:33
Amphipathic, a word that I sometimes have trouble saying.
2:37
So phospholipids are Amphipathic,
2:44
which means that they have both a hydrophilic end,
2:47
a part that is attracted to water,
2:48
and a hydrophobic end, that is not attracted to water.
2:51
And hopefully that starts to explain
2:53
why they organize themselves in this way.
2:56
Because you could image,
2:57
the hydrophilic heads are going to want to be
3:00
where the water is, which is going to be either
3:02
outside the cell or inside the cells.
3:04
And the tails are hydrophobic,
3:07
the water's going to go away from them
3:08
or they're going to go away from the water
3:09
and so they're just going to face each other
3:11
and they're going to be on the inside of the membrane.
3:14
But the really cool thing is, a structure like this,
3:16
having this Amphipathic molecule,
3:19
allows things like these bilipid,
3:21
these lipid bilayers, I should say, to form.
3:25
And it's actually fascinating.
3:27
You would think that if you go far back enough,
3:29
even before life in cellular form, formed,
3:33
that you might have had phospholipids spontaneously forming
3:36
these spheres where you have a bilayer, a lipid bilayer.
3:41
So you could imagine something, let me see,
3:43
if I drew a cross-section,
3:45
let me see if I can draw it relatively neatly.
3:48
So, I think I'll draw half of it, just because you get,
3:53
well I'll draw the whole thing
3:54
and hopefully you get the idea.
3:56
So that would be one layer
3:59
of the phosphate heads facing the outside.
4:02
This is the inner layer,
4:04
and I'm doing a cross-section right over here.
4:07
And then you have your hydrophobic tails,
4:11
let me do that in a different color.
4:14
So your hydrophobic tails, I think you get the picture.
4:18
We have a bunch of hydrophobic tails on either end
4:22
and then you could spontaneously form a structure like this
4:24
which starts to feel like, hey,
4:25
well maybe there's a protocell forming.
4:27
And obviously to actually have real life you have to have
4:30
some form of information that can be passed on,
4:33
and you have to have some type of metabolism,
4:35
and the cell is living, and all of the definitions of life.
4:37
But at least this basic structure of the cellular membrane
4:39
you could imagine how it forms in a pre-life state even,
4:45
by virtue of Amphipathic molecules like a phospholipid.
4:50
So fair enough.
4:51
We're able to form this phospholipid bilayer,
4:54
but what are all these other things that I have drawn here?
4:57
Well, these are proteins and these are examples of,
5:02
this is a protein right over here,
5:03
this is a protein, this is a protein,
5:05
and I just drew some blobs
5:08
to be indicative of the variety of proteins.
5:10
But the important thing to realize is,
5:12
if we think of cells, there's all of this diversity.
5:15
There's all of this complexity that is on,
5:18
or embedded, inside of its membrane.
5:20
So instead of just thinking of it as just kind of
5:21
as a uniform phospholipid bilayer,
5:24
there's all sorts of stuff,
5:28
maybe if we view this as a cross-section,
5:29
there's all sorts of stuff embedded in it
5:32
and we see it right over here in this diagram.
5:36
You could say there's a mosaic of things embedded in it.
5:38
A mosaic is a picture made up of a bunch of
5:41
different components of all different colors,
5:43
and you can see that you have all different components here,
5:45
different types of proteins.
5:47
You have proteins like this, that go across the membrane.
5:50
We call these transmembrane proteins,
5:53
they're a special class of integral protein.
5:55
You have integral proteins like this,
5:57
that might only interact with one part of the bilayer
6:00
while these kind of go across it.
6:03
You have things like glycolipids.
6:06
So this right over here, this is a glycolipid,
6:13
which is fascinating.
6:14
It lodges itself in the membrane
6:16
because it has this lipid end,
6:17
so that's going to be hydrophobic.
6:19
It's going to get along
6:20
with all of the other hydrophobic things,
6:22
but then it has an end that's really a chain of sugars
6:28
and that part is going to be hydrophilic,
6:29
it's going to sit outside of the cell.
6:31
And these chains of sugars,
6:33
these are actually key for cell-cell recognition.
6:36
Your immune system uses these to differentiate
6:38
between which cells are the ones
6:40
that are actually from my body,
6:41
the ones I don't want to mess with,
6:43
the ones I want to protect
6:44
and which cells are the ones that are foreign,
6:46
the ones that I might want to attack.
6:47
When people talk about blood type,
6:49
they're talking about, well, what type of
6:51
specific glycolipids do you have on cells.
6:55
And there's all sorts of, that's not all we're talking about
6:58
when we talk about glycolipids as a way
7:02
for cells to be recognized,
7:04
or to be tagged in different ways.
7:06
So it's a fascinating thing that these chains of sugars
7:10
can lead to such complex behavior, and frankly,
7:12
such useful behavior, from our point of view.
7:15
But you don't just want to have sugar chains on lipids,
7:18
you also have sugar chains on proteins.
7:21
This, right over here, is an example of a glycoprotein.
7:27
And as you can see, when you put all this stuff together,
7:29
you get a mosaic, and I'm actually not even done.
7:31
You have things like cholesterol embedded.
7:33
Cholesterol is a lipid, so it's going to sit in the
7:35
hydrophobic part of the membrane
7:37
and that actually helps with the fluidity of the membrane,
7:40
making sure it's not too fluid or not too stiff.
7:44
So this is cholesterol, right over there.
7:49
So you see this mosaic of stuff,
7:51
but what about the fluid part?
7:53
And I just talked about cholesterol's value
7:55
in making sure that it's just the right amount of fluidity.
7:58
What's neat about this, is this isn't a rigid structure.
8:01
If this thing were to be jostled around a little bit
8:04
or maybe it would be plucked-out somehow,
8:06
the phospholipids would just spontaneously re-arrange
8:09
to fill in the gap.
8:10
You could imagine these things are all flowing around.
8:12
That this membrane actually has a consistency
8:16
of oil or salad dressing.
8:19
So it isn't like a rubbery texture,
8:24
like you might imagine, or a membrane, like a balloon.
8:26
It's actually fluid. These things can move around,
8:30
but even though it's fluid,
8:33
it's good enough to separate the two environments.
8:35
The environment inside the cell
8:37
from the environment outside of the cell.
8:41
And that's where the name Fluid Mosaic Model comes from.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,cP8iQu57dQo,
teded_8623,How are the communications systems of humans and animals similar?,open-ended,"All animals communicate.
Crabs wave their claws at each other
to signal that they're healthy
and ready to mate.
Cuttlefish use pigmented skin cells
called chromatophores
to create patterns on their skin
that act as camouflage
or warnings to rivals.
Honeybees perform complex dances
to let other bees know the location
and quality of a food source.
All of these animals have impressive
communication systems,
but do they have language?
To answer that question,
we can look at four specific qualities
that are often associated with language:
discreteness,
grammar,
productivity,
and displacement.
Discreteness means that there is a set
of individual units,
such as sounds or words,
that can be combined
to communicate new ideas,
like a set of refrigerator poetry magnets
you can rearrange
to create different phrases.
Grammar provides a system of rules
that tells you how to combine 
those individual units.
Productivity is the ability 
to use language
to create an infinite number of messages.
And displacement is the ability 
to talk about things
that aren't right in front of you,
such as past, future, or fictional events.
So, does animal communication exhibit 
any of these qualities?
For crabs and cuttlefish, 
the answer is no.
They don't combine their signals 
in creative ways.
Those signals also don't have to be 
in a grammatical order,
and they only communicate 
current conditions,
like, ""I am healthy,"" 
or ""I am poisonous.""
But some animals actually do display
some of these properties.
Bees use the moves, angle, duration,
and intensity of their waggle dance
to describe the location and richness
of a food source.
That source is outside the hive,
so they exhibit the property 
of displacement.
They share that language trait
with prairie dogs,
which live in towns of thousands,
and are hunted by coyotes, hawks,
badgers, snakes, and humans.
Their alarms calls indicate
the predator's size, shape, speed,
and, even for human predators,
what the person is wearing
and if he's carrying a gun.
Great apes, like chimps and gorillas,
are great communicators, too.
Some have even learned 
a modified sign language.
A chimpanzee named Washoe
demonstrated discreteness
by combining multiple signs
into original phrases,
like, ""Please open. Hurry.""
Coco, a female gorilla who understands
more than 1000 signs,
and around 2000 words of spoken English
referred to a beloved kitten 
that had died.
In doing so, she displayed displacement,
though it's worth noting that the apes
in both of these examples
were using a human communication system,
not one that appeared 
naturally in the wild.
There are many other examples
of sophisticated animal communication,
such as in dolphins,
which use whistles to identify age, 
location, names, and gender.
They can also understand some grammar
in a gestural language researchers use
to communicate with them.
However, grammar is not seen 
in the dolphin's natural communication.
While these communication systems
may have some of the qualities 
of language we've identified,
none display all four.
Even Washoe and Coco's impressive 
abilities are still outpaced
by the language skills 
of most three-year-old humans.
And animals' topics of conversation
are usually limited.
Bees talk about food,
prairie dogs talk about predators,
and crabs talk about themselves.
Human language stands alone
due to the powerful combination
of grammar and productivity,
on top of discreteness and displacement.
The human brain can take 
a finite number of elements
and create an infinite number of messages.
We can craft and understand 
complex sentences,
as well as words that have never
been spoken before.
We can use language to communicate
about an endless range of subjects,
talk about imaginary things,
and even lie.
Research continues to reveal more
and more about animal communication.
It may turn out that human language
and animal communication
aren't entirely different
but exist on a continuum.
After all, we are all animals.

khan_video_QaOtsYouet0_148715,What are the criteria for standard conditions in relation to delta G naught being change in free energy under standard conditions?,Essay,"•
0:01
- [Instructor] We've already seen that the change
0:02
in free energy, delta G,
0:05
can be related to the cell potential E, by this equation.
0:09
Under standard state conditions,
0:11
this would be the standard change in free energy,
0:13
so delta G zero which is related to the
0:15
standard cell potential E zero, right,
0:18
by the same equation.
0:20
This equation down here comes from thermodynamics,
0:23
and we're going to plug in for delta G and delta G zero,
0:27
so we're going to plug this in for delta G,
0:31
and we're going to plug this in for delta G zero.
0:34
So that gives us negative nFE is equal to,
0:39
negative nFE zero, plus RT,
0:45
natural log of Q,
0:47
where Q is the reaction quotient.
0:50
Let's divide everything by negative nF,
0:53
so we're going to divide everything
0:55
in here by negative nF,
0:57
and let's see what cancels out.
1:00
So all of this would cancel out,
1:02
all of that would cancel out,
1:04
and we get the Nernst equation.
1:07
So let me go ahead and write it,
1:08
the cell potential E,
1:11
is equal to the standard cell potential, E zero,
1:15
minus RT over nF,
1:20
times the natural log of Q,
1:23
where Q is the reaction quotient.
1:26
So this is the Nernst equation,
1:29
alright, we'll talk about why the Nernst equation
1:32
is so important, we'll talk more about that
1:33
at the end of the video.
1:35
Right now, let's go ahead and derive
1:38
another form of the Nernst equation,
1:40
I should say, the form when you're talking
1:41
about a certain temperature.
1:43
So at 25 degrees C, right,
1:46
most of our reactions take place at 25 degrees C,
1:50
well, temperature, right,
1:52
temperature in here, this in the temperature in Kelvin,
1:54
so we need to convert to Kelvin.
1:57
So if you add 273.15, alright,
2:01
you get your temperature in Kelvin,
2:03
so that would be 298.15,
2:08
so what we're going to do is solve for RT over F,
2:12
to write a different form of the Nernst equation.
2:15
And so the temperature is 298.15 Kelvin,
2:18
so let's write that in,
2:20
so 298.15 Kelvin.
2:24
R is the gas constant,
2:26
so remember, the gas constant is 8.314, 8.314,
2:31
joules over mole Kelvin.
2:35
And F is Faraday's constant,
2:38
remember Faraday's constant from an earlier video, right,
2:40
that's 96,500 coulombs per mole.
2:45
So Faraday's constant is the
2:48
charge of one mole of electrons.
2:52
Alright, so let's solve for
2:53
what all this is equal to,
2:55
so let's get some more space,
2:57
and let's get out the calculator.
3:00
So we've already done this calculation
3:02
in an earlier video,
3:03
but I'm going to go ahead and do it again,
3:05
for this Nernst equation video.
3:06
So 8.314 times 289.15,
3:14
we need to divide that by Faraday's constant, 96,500.
3:19
So that gives us 0.0257, alright,
3:24
so this is equal to,
3:26
this is equal to 0.0257,
3:31
and for units, Kelvin would cancel out,
3:33
moles would cancel out,
3:35
that gives us joules over coulombs,
3:37
which is equal to volts, alright.
3:40
So this is equal to volts,
3:42
and we can write another form of the Nernst equation.
3:46
So if your reaction is at 25 degrees C,
3:50
you can write the Nernst equation this way,
3:52
you could say that the cell potential E,
3:54
is equal to the standard cell potential E zero, minus,
3:59
so all that RT over F is equal to this, 0.0257, right.
4:05
So 0.0257 volts,
4:09
we still have n,
4:11
remember n is the number of moles
4:14
I'm going to use green for that,
4:15
n is the number of moles
4:17
of electrons that are transferred
4:19
in your redox reaction, right.
4:21
So we're going to put n in here,
4:23
and we still have the natural log of Q,
4:26
the reaction quotient, right.
4:28
So here is another form of the Nernst equation,
4:33
alright, so at 25 degrees, you can use this form,
4:36
and then we can also write this
4:40
into base 10 logarithms that have natural logs.
4:43
So we can do that conversion, right.
4:45
So we also did that in an earlier video,
4:47
but if you're trying to convert this 0.0257,
4:52
you need to multiply by the natural log of 10.
4:56
So when we do that,
4:58
so we have 0.0257 times the natural log of 10,
5:05
that gives us 0.0592,
5:08
so this is equal to 0.0592.
5:14
So we can write the Nernst equation once again,
5:18
alright, so E, or the cell potential,
5:20
is equal to the standard cell potential E zero,
5:22
minus 0.0592 over n.
5:29
And we essentially just change this
5:32
from natural logarithm to base 10 logarithm,
5:34
so this would be log of Q, log of the reaction quotient.
5:39
So here is just another form of the Nernst equation.
5:44
So why is the Nernst equation important
5:47
and why is it useful?
5:48
It's useful, because it allows us to calculate
5:51
a cell potential under non-standard state conditions,
5:56
so think about this cell potential
5:59
as being the instantaneous cell potential,
6:02
and you can relate that
6:03
to the progress of the reaction, right.
6:05
So as you change concentrations,
6:07
the reaction quotient Q changes, right,
6:10
and that means that the
6:12
instantaneous cell potential changes,
6:15
alright, so if you change if the concentrations,
6:17
if you change the concentrations,
6:19
you're changing the cell potential.
6:21
And so we'll see more about that in the next video,
6:23
so I think that the Nernst equation makes much more
6:26
sense when you do some problems with it,
6:29
and then you can understand better what it means.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,QaOtsYouet0,

of the protons completely balance
0:35
with the negative charges of the electrons.
0:39
So let's go ahead and draw an atom of hydrogen.
0:42
We know the atomic number of hydrogen is one,
0:45
so there's one proton in the nucleus.
0:47
So there's my one proton in the nucleus, and we're talking
0:50
about a neutral hydrogen atom, so there's one electron.
0:53
I'm going to draw that one electron
0:55
somewhere outside the nucleus and I'm going
0:57
to use the oversimplified Bohr model.
1:00
So this isn't actually what an atom looks like,
1:02
but it's a very simply view that helps you get started.
1:05
So this is one, this one version of hydrogen.
1:10
This is one isotope of hydrogen.
1:13
So this is called protium.
1:15
Let me go ahead and write that here.
1:16
So this is protium and let's talk about isotopes.
1:19
An isotope, isotopes are atoms of a single element.
1:22
So we're talking about hydrogen here.
1:25
That differ in the number of neutrons in their nuclei.
1:30
So let's talk about the next isotope of hydrogen.
1:33
So this is called deuteriums.
1:35
Let me go ahead and write deuterium here.
1:38
Deuterium is hydrogen, so it must have one proton
1:43
in the nucleus and it must have one electron outside
1:47
the nucleus, but if you look at the definition
1:50
for isotopes, atoms of a single element that differ
1:53
in the number of neutrons, protium has zero
1:56
neutrons in the nucleus.
1:59
Deuterium has one.
2:00
So let me go ahead and draw in deuterium's one neutron.
2:03
I'll use blue here, so neutrons are going to be blue.
2:07
So deuterium has one neutron and since neutrons have mass,
2:11
deuterium has more mass than protium.
2:14
So isotopes have different masses because they differ
2:17
in terms of number of neutrons.
2:19
Notice though, that they have the same atomic number,
2:21
they have the same number of protons in the nucleus.
2:24
Right, it's one proton in the nucleus.
2:26
And that's important because if you change
2:28
the number of protons, you're changing the element,
2:29
and that's not what we're doing here.
2:32
We're talking about atoms of a single element.
2:34
Deuterium is still hydrogen, it's an isotope.
2:38
Finally, our last isotope, which is tritium.
2:41
So tritium has one proton in the nucleus,
2:45
one electron outside the nucleus, and we draw
2:48
that in here, and it must differ in terms
2:51
of number of neutrons, so tritium has two neutrons.
2:55
Let me go ahead and draw the two
2:57
neutrons here in the nucleus.
2:59
And so those are the isotopes of hydrogen.
3:03
How do we distinguish between the different isotopes?
3:07
Well we're going to write little symbols
3:10
to represent these isotopes.
3:13
And so the symbol that we'll draw here
3:15
for protium is going to have the element symbol,
3:18
which is, of course, hydrogen, and then down here
3:21
we're going to write the atomic number.
3:24
So the subscript is the atomic number which is one,
3:27
because there's one proton in the nucleus,
3:30
and then for the superscript, we're going
3:33
to write in the mass number.
3:35
So let me move down here so we can look
3:38
at the definition for the mass number.
3:40
The mass number is the combined number
3:42
of protons and neutrons in a nucleus,
3:45
so it's protons and neutrons, and it's symbolized by A.
3:51
So A is the mass number, which is equal
3:53
to the number of protons, that's the atomic
3:56
number which we symbolized by Z,
3:58
plus the number of neutrons.
4:01
So A is equal to Z plus N.
4:05
And for protium, let's look at protium here.
4:08
So in the nucleus there's only one proton
4:12
and zero neutrons, so one plus zero
4:15
gives us a mass number of one.
4:18
And I'll use red here for mass number so we can distinguish.
4:21
Alright, so mass number is red and let me use
4:25
a different color here for the atomic number.
4:31
Let me use magenta here.
4:33
So the subscript is the atomic number
4:36
and that's Z, and the superscript
4:39
is the mass number and that's A.
4:43
So this symbol represents the protium isotope.
4:47
Let's draw one for deuterium.
4:50
So it's hydrogen so we put an H here.
4:52
There is still one proton in the nucleus,
4:56
right one proton in the nucleus,
4:58
so we put an atomic number of one.
5:00
The mass number is the superscript,
5:02
it's the combined number of protons and neutrons.
5:05
So we look in the nucleus here.
5:07
There's one proton and one neutron.
5:08
So one plus one is equal to two.
5:12
So we put a two here for the superscript.
5:14
And finally for tritium, it's still hydrogen.
5:17
So we put hydrogen here.
5:20
There's one proton in the nucleus,
5:24
atomic number of one, so we put a one here.
5:26
And then the combined numbers of protons
5:29
and neutrons, that would be three.
5:32
So one proton plus two neutrons gives us three.
5:37
So there's the symbol for tritium.
5:39
So here are the isotopes of hydrogen
5:42
and using these symbols allows us
5:44
to differentiate between them.
5:47
So let's take what we've learned
5:49
and do a few more practice problems here.
5:53
So let's look at a symbol for carbon.
5:56
So here we have carbon with subscript six, superscript 12.
6:02
And if we want to know how many protons,
6:05
electrons and neutrons there are.
6:08
So let's first think about protons.
6:10
Well we know that the subscript is
6:12
the atomic number and the atomic number is
6:14
equal to the number of protons.
6:16
So there are six protons in this atom of carbon.
6:21
And if it's a neutral atom of carbon, the number
6:23
of electrons must be equal to the number of protons.
6:27
So if there are six protons, there
6:29
must also be six electrons.
6:32
And finally, how do we figure out the number of neutrons?
6:36
Well let's go ahead and write down the formula we discussed.
6:40
The mass number is equal to the atomic
6:43
number plus the number of neutrons.
6:47
So the mass number was right here, that's 12.
6:53
So we can put in a 12.
6:55
The atomic number was six, right here.
6:59
So we put in a six.
7:00
Plus the number of neutrons.
7:03
Plus the number of neutrons.
7:04
So the number of neutrons is just equal to
7:06
12 minus six, which is, of course, six.
7:10
So there are six neutrons.
7:11
So just subtract the atomic number
7:14
from the mass number and you'll get
7:16
the number of neutrons in your atom.
7:19
Let's do another one.
7:21
This is carbon and this time we have a superscript of 13.
7:27
The atomic number doesn't change
7:30
when you're talking about an isotope.
7:32
If you change the atomic number,
7:34
you change the element.
7:35
So there's still six protons in the nucleus
7:39
of this atom and in a neutral atom,
7:42
there must be the equal number of electrons.
7:45
So six electrons and then finally,
7:47
how many neutrons are there?
7:50
Well just like we did before, we subtract
7:53
the atomic number from the mass number.
7:57
So we just have to 13 minus six
8:03
to figure out the number of neutrons.
8:05
So 13 minus six is, of course, seven.
8:07
So there are seven neutrons in this atom.
8:11
Another way to represent isotopes,
8:15
let's say we wanted to represent this isotope
8:17
in a different way, sometimes you'll see it
8:19
where you write the name of the element.
8:21
So this is carbon.
8:23
And then you put a hyphen here
8:24
and then you put the mass number.
8:26
So carbon hyphen 13 refers to this isotope
8:30
of carbon and this is called hyphen notation.
8:34
So let me go ahead and write this hyphen notation.
8:38
Alright, let's do one more example here.
8:42
Let's do one that looks a little bit scarier.
8:45
So let's do uranium.
8:48
So U is uranium.
8:50
The atomic number of uranium is 92.
8:52
The mass number for this isotope is 235.
8:56
So how many protons, electrons,
8:59
and neutrons in this atom of uranium?
9:02
So once again for protons, we look
9:05
at the atomic number, that's 92.
9:07
So there must be 92 protons.
9:11
In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal
9:15
to the number of protons.
9:16
So there are 92 electrons and then finally,
9:19
to figure out the number of neutrons,
9:21
we subtract this number from the mass number.
9:26
So we just need to do 235 minus 92.
9:34
And that gives us 143.
9:37
So there are 143 neutrons.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,I-Or4bUAIfo,

0:00
Let's imagine we have a huge cloud
0:02
of hydrogen atoms floating in space.
0:05
Huge, and when I say huge cloud, huge both in distance
0:08
and in mass.
0:09
If you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,
0:11
it would just be this really, really massive thing.
0:15
So you have this huge cloud.
0:16
Well, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually
0:20
attracted to each other.
0:21
It's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.
0:25
But it would slowly affect these atoms.
0:27
And they would slowly draw close to each other.
0:30
It would slowly condense.
0:31
They'd slowly move towards the center
0:34
of mass of all of the atoms.
0:37
They'd slowly move in.
0:39
So if we fast forward, this cloud's
0:42
going to get denser and denser.
0:46
And the hydrogen atoms are going to start
0:48
bumping into each other and rubbing up against each other
0:51
and interacting with each other.
0:53
And so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.
0:56
Now remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.
0:58
So the temperature is going up.
1:03
And it'll-- they'll keep condensing.
1:05
They'll just keep condensing and condensing
1:07
until something really interesting happens.
1:09
So let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here
1:12
in the center.
1:16
And there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.
1:19
It's really dense.
1:20
I could never draw the actual number of atoms here.
1:22
This is really to give you an idea.
1:24
There's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,
1:28
from everything that wants to get
1:29
to that center of mass of our entire cloud.
1:32
The temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.
1:38
And at that point, something neat happens.
1:40
And to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,
1:43
let's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.
1:46
A hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just
1:48
going to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.
1:49
So the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.
1:50
If you want to think about a hydrogen atom,
1:52
it also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.
1:57
And let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.
1:59
And obviously this distance isn't to scale.
2:02
This distance is also not to scale.
2:04
Atoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms
2:05
are actually much, much, much, much smaller
2:07
than the actual radius of an atom.
2:10
And so is the electron.
2:11
But anyway, this just gives you an idea.
2:13
So we know from the Coulomb forces,
2:14
from electromagnetic forces, that these two positively
2:17
charged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere
2:20
near each other.
2:22
But we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four
2:25
forces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,
2:28
that if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures
2:31
and huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close
2:35
enough to each other, then all of a sudden,
2:37
the strong force will overtake.
2:39
It's much stronger than the Coulomb force.
2:41
And then these two hydrogens will actually--
2:43
these nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?
2:48
Well, anyway, they would actually fuse together.
2:50
And so that is what actually happens
2:53
once this gets hot and dense enough.
2:57
You now have enough pressure and enough temperature
2:59
to overcome the Coulomb force and bring
3:02
these protons close enough to each other for fusion
3:05
to occur, for fusion ignition.
3:12
And the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.
3:14
It's not ignition.
3:15
It's not combustion in the traditional sense.
3:16
It's not like you're burning a carbon molecule
3:20
in the presence of oxygen.
3:22
It's not combustion.
3:23
It's ignition.
3:24
And the reason why it's called ignition
3:25
is because when two of these protons,
3:27
or two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus
3:32
has a slightly smaller mass.
3:35
And so in the first stage of this,
3:36
you actually have two protons under enough pressure--
3:42
obviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--
3:44
with enough pressure they get close enough.
3:46
And then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.
3:51
One of these guys degrades into a neutron.
3:56
And the resulting mass of the combined protons
3:59
is lower than the mass of each of the original.
4:01
By a little bit, but that little bit of mass
4:04
results in a lot of energy-- plus energy.
4:11
And this energy is why we call it ignition.
4:13
And so what this energy does is it provides
4:16
a little bit of outward pressure,
4:17
so that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.
4:21
So once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.
4:24
And then that energy provides outward pressure
4:26
to balance what is now a star.
4:30
So now we are at where we actually
4:32
have the ignition at the center.
4:35
We have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying
4:39
to get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.
4:43
Now, what is the hydrogen being fused into?
4:46
Well, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just
4:50
kind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens
4:54
in stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.
5:00
I have trouble spelling.
5:01
Which is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.
5:03
This is still hydrogen because it
5:04
has one proton and one neutron now.
5:07
It is not helium yet.
5:08
This does not have two-- it does not have two protons.
5:12
But then the deuterium keeps fusing.
5:14
And then we eventually end up with helium.
5:19
And we can even see that on the periodic table.
5:21
Oh, I lost my periodic table.
5:22
Well, I'll show you the next video.
5:23
But we know hydrogen in its atomic state
5:30
has an atomic number of 1.
5:32
And it also has a mass of 1.
5:34
It only has one nucleon in its nucleus.
5:38
But it's being fused.
5:39
It goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,
5:42
which is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.
5:46
And then that eventually gets fused--
5:48
and I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--
5:50
into helium.
5:51
And by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.
5:56
So it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,
5:58
in particular, that isotope of helium--
6:00
it has an atomic mass of 4.
6:03
And this process releases a ton of energy.
6:06
Because the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced
6:09
is slightly lower than four times the atomic mass
6:15
of each of the constituent hydrogens.
6:17
So all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it
6:21
needs super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--
6:24
keeps the star from collapsing.
6:28
And once a star is in this stage,
6:31
once it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen
6:35
in its core, where the pressure and the temperature
6:37
is the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.
6:41
This is now a main sequence star.
6:48
And that's actually where the sun is right now.
6:50
Now there's questions of, well, what if there just
6:53
wasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?
6:56
And there actually are things that
6:57
never get to quite that threshold
6:59
to fuse all the way into helium.
7:00
There are a few things that don't quite
7:02
make the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.
7:05
So they are generating some of their heat.
7:06
Or there are even smaller objects
7:08
that just get to the point there's
7:10
a huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually
7:13
occurring inside of the core.
7:15
And something like Jupiter would be an example.
7:17
And you could go several masses above Jupiter
7:20
where you get something like that.
7:21
So you have to reach a certain threshold
7:23
where the mass, where the pressure and the temperature
7:25
due to the heavy mass, get so large that you
7:27
start this fusion.
7:28
And-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,
7:31
the slower the fusion will occur.
7:33
But if you're super massive, the fusion
7:35
will occur really, really fast.
7:37
So that's the general idea of just how stars get formed
7:40
and why they don't collapse on themselves
7:43
and why they are these kind of balls
7:45
of fusion reactions existing in the universe.

teded_682,The burning of which fuel is the main source of industrial smog?,multiple-choices,"On July 26, 1943,
Los Angeles was blanketed by a thick
gas that stung people's eyes
and blocked out the Sun.
Panicked residents believed their city
had been attacked using chemical warfare.
But the cloud wasn't an act of war.
It was smog.
A portmanteau 
of smoke and fog,
the word smog was coined at the beginning
of the 20th century
to describe the thick gray 
haze that covered cities
such as London,
Glasgow,
and Edinburgh.
This industrial smog was known to form
when smoke from coal-burning 
home stoves and factories
combined with moisture in the air.
But the smog behind 
the LA panic was different.
It was yellowish with a chemical odor.
Since the city didn't burn much coal,
its cause would remain a mystery
until a chemist named Arie Haagen-Smit
identified two culprits,
volatile organic compounds, or VOCs,
and nitrous oxides.
VOCs are compounds that easily
become vapors
and may contain elements, such as carbon,
oxygen,
hydrogen,
chlorine,
and sulfur.
Some are naturally produced 
by plants and animals,
but others come from manmade sources,
like solvents,
paints,
glues,
and petroleum.
Meanwhile, the incomplete combustion
of gas in motor vehicles
releases nitrous oxide.
That's what gives this type of smog
its yellowish color.
VOCs and nitrous oxide react with sunlight
to produce secondary pollutants called
PANs and tropospheric,
or ground level, ozone.
PANs and ozone cause eye irritation
and damage lung tissue.
Both are key ingredients 
in photochemical smog,
which is what had been plaguing LA.
So why does smog affect some cities
but not others?
Both industrial and photochemical smog
combine manmade pollution
with local weather and geography.
London's high humidity made it a prime
location for industrial smog.
Photochemical smog is strongest in
urban areas with calm winds
and dry, warm, sunny weather.
The ultraviolet radiation from sunlight
provides the energy necessary
to breakdown molecules that contribute
to smog formation.
Cities surrounded by mountains, like LA,
or lying in a basin, like Beijing,
are also especially vulnerable to smog
since there's nowhere for it to dissipate.
That's also partially due to a phenomenon
known as temperature inversion,
where instead of warm air 
continuously rising upward,
a pollution-filled layer of air remains 
trapped near the Earth's surface
by a slightly warmer layer above.
Smog isn't just an aesthetic eyesore.
Both forms of smog irritate the eyes,
nose,
and throat,
exacerbate conditions like asthma
and emphysema,
and increase the risk 
of respiratory infections like bronchitis.
Smog can be especially harmful 
to young children and older people
and exposure in pregnant women has been
linked to low birth weight
and potential birth defects.
Secondary pollutants found 
in photochemical smog
can damage and weaken crops
and decrease yield,
making them more susceptible to insects.
Yet for decades, smog was seen
as the inevitable price of civilization.
Londoners had become accustomed to 
the notorious pea soup fog
swirling over their streets until 1952,
when the Great Smog of London shut down
all transportation in the city for days
and caused more 
than 4,000 respiratory deaths.
As a result, the Clean Air Act of 1956
banned burning coal in 
certain areas of the city,
leading to a massive reduction in smog.
Similarly, regulations on vehicle 
emissions and gas content in the US
reduced the volatile compounds in the air
and smog levels along with them.
Smog remains a major problem
around the world.
Countries like China and Poland that
depend on coal for energy
experience high levels of industrial smog.
Photochemical smog and airborne particles
from vehicle emissions
affect many rapidly developing cities,
from Mexico City and Santiago
to New Delhi and Tehran.
Governments have tried many methods
to tackle it,
such as banning cars from driving
for days at a time.
As more than half of the world's 
population crowds into cities,
considering a shift to mass transit
and away from fossil fuels
may allow us to breathe easier.

Actually, I'll write it all at once.
0:18
And then we have on the one carbon, we can call this the
0:21
one carbon, and call this the two carbon, we have a bromine
0:25
and a fluorine.
0:26
So we could call this 1-bromo, and we're putting the bromo
0:34
instead of the fluoro because B comes before F
0:36
alphabetically.
0:37
1-bromo-1-fluoro, and then we're dealing with an ethane.
0:46
We have a two-carbon chain, all single bonds,
0:49
fluoroethane.
0:51
That's the name of that molecule there, just a review
0:54
of some of the earlier organic nomenclature
0:56
videos we had done.
0:57
Now, we know immediately, based on the last few videos,
1:00
that this is also a chiral carbon, and if we were to take
1:03
its mirror image, we would get another enantiomer of this
1:10
same molecule, or that they are enantiomers of each other.
1:13
So what is the mirror image of this
1:16
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane look like?
1:19
Well, you'd have the carbon right here.
1:23
I want to get all the colors right.
1:24
You would still have the bromine up above.
1:28
You would have this methyl group that's attached to the
1:31
carbon now pointing in the left direction, CH3.
1:35
The fluorine would now still be behind the carbon, and now
1:42
the hydrogen would still pop out of the page, but it would
1:44
now pop out and to the right.
1:51
That is the hydrogen.
1:53
Now, based on our naming so far, we would name this
1:56
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, and we would also name this
2:01
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, but these are fundamentally two
2:08
different molecules.
2:09
Even though they have the same molecules in them; they have
2:12
the same molecular formula; they have the same
2:15
constitution in that this carbon is connected to a
2:19
hydrogen, a fluorine, and a bromine; this carbon is
2:21
connected to the same things; this carbon is connected to a
2:24
carbon, three hydrogens; so is this one; these are
2:28
stereoisomers.
2:29
These are stereoisomers, and they're mirror images of each
2:32
other, so they're enantiomers.
2:37
And actually, they will, one, polarize light differently,
2:40
and they actually can often have very different chemical
2:45
properties, either in a chemical or biological system.
2:47
So it seems not good that we have the same
2:52
names for both of these.
2:53
So what we're going to focus on in this video is how do you
2:55
differentiate between the two?
3:01
So how do we differentiate between the two?
3:04
So the naming system we're going to use right here is
3:07
called the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, but it's a different
3:12
Cahn, it's not me.
3:13
It's C-A-H-N instead of K-H-A-N.
3:17
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, and it's a way of differentiating
3:26
between this enantiomer, which right now we would call
3:29
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, and this enantiomer,
3:32
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane.
3:34
It's a pretty straightforward thing.
3:36
Really, the hardest part is to just visualize rotating the
3:39
molecules in the right way and figuring out in which
3:41
direction it's kind of-- whether it's kind of a
3:43
left-handed or right-handed molecule.
3:45
We're going to take it step by step.
3:46
So the first thing you do in the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system
3:50
is to, one, identify your chiral molecule.
3:56
Here, it's pretty obvious.
3:57
It's this carbon right here.
4:00
We'll just focus on this left one, the one we started with
4:03
first. It's bonded to three different groups.
4:06
And then what you want to do is you want to rank the groups
4:09
by atomic number.
4:11
So if you go up here, out of bromine, hydrogen, fluorine,
4:18
and a carbon, this is what is bonded directly to this
4:21
carbon, which has the highest atomic number?
4:23
Bromine is over here-- let me do this in a darker color.
4:27
We have bromine at 35, we have fluorine at 9, we have carbon
4:32
at 6, and then we have hydrogen at 1.
4:37
So of all these, bromine is the largest. We'll just call
4:40
this number one.
4:42
Then after that, we have fluorine.
4:44
That is the number two.
4:46
Number three is the carbon.
4:49
And then hydrogen is the smallest, so
4:51
that is number four.
4:55
So now that we've numbered them, the next step is to
4:58
orient this molecule so that the smallest atomic number
5:01
group is sitting into the page.
5:04
It's sitting behind the molecule.
5:08
Right now, this hydrogen is the smallest of all of them.
5:11
Bromine's the largest, hydrogen is the smallest, so
5:13
we want to orient it behind the molecule.
5:15
The way it's drawn right now, it's oriented in
5:17
front of the molecule.
5:18
So to orient it behind the molecule, and this really is
5:21
the hardest part is just to visualize it properly.
5:23
Remember, this fluorine is behind; this is right in the
5:25
plane of the paper; this is popping out of the paper.
5:30
We would want to rotate.
5:31
You could imagine we'd be rotating the molecule in this
5:36
direction so that-- let me redraw it.
5:44
We have the carbon here.
5:46
And now since we've rotated it like this, we've rotated it
5:49
roughly 1/3 around the circle, so it's about 120 degrees.
5:54
Now, this hydrogen is where the fluorine was.
6:01
So that's where the hydrogen is.
6:02
The fluorine is now where this methyl group is.
6:10
These dotted lines show that we're behind now.
6:11
This shows that we're in the plane.
6:13
And the methyl group is now where the hydrogen is.
6:15
It's now popping out of the page.
6:16
It's going to the left and out.
6:18
So this methyl group is now popping out of the page, out
6:24
and to the left.
6:25
That's where our methyl group is.
6:27
So all we've done is we've just rotated this around about
6:29
120 degrees.
6:30
We've just gotten this to go behind, and that's kind of the
6:33
first step after we've identified the chiral carbon
6:36
and ranked them by atomic number.
6:38
And.
6:38
Of course.
6:38
The bromine is still going to be on top.
6:43
Now, once you put the smallest atomic number molecule in the
6:47
back, then you want to look at the rankings
6:49
of one through three.
6:50
And we have four molecules here.
6:52
We look at the largest, which is bromine, number one.
6:57
Then number two is fluorine, number two, and then number
7:00
three is this methyl group.
7:01
That's the carbon that's bonded to this carbon, so it's
7:04
number three right there.
7:06
And in the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, we literally just
7:10
think about what would it take to go from number one to
7:12
number two to number three?
7:13
And in this case, we would go in this direction.
7:16
To go from number one to number two to number three, we
7:19
would go in the clockwise direction.
7:21
We're just ignoring the hydrogen right now.
7:22
That's just sitting behind it.
7:24
That was the first step, to orient it so it's sitting in
7:26
the back, the smallest molecule.
7:28
And then the three largest ones, you just say what
7:30
direction do we have to go to go from number one to number
7:32
two to number three?
7:33
In this case, we have to go clockwise.
7:37
And if we go clockwise now, then we call this a
7:42
right-handed molecule, or we use the Latin word for right,
7:46
which is rectus.
7:49
And so we would call this molecule right here not just
7:54
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, this is R, R for rectus.
8:00
Or you could even think right, although we'll see left is
8:03
used as S, which is sinister, so the Latin is really where
8:05
the R comes from.
8:07
But this is (R)-1-bromo-1-fluoroethane
8:18
That's this one right here.
8:19
So you might guess, well, this must be the opposite, this
8:21
must be the counterclockwise version.
8:23
We can do it really fast.
8:24
So same idea.
8:26
We know the largest one.
8:28
Bromine is number one.
8:29
That's the largest in terms of atomic number.
8:32
Fluorine is number two.
8:34
Carbon is number three.
8:36
Hydrogen is number four.
8:38
What we want to do is put hydrogen in the back, so what
8:40
we're going to have to do is rotate it to the back to where
8:43
fluorine is right now.
8:45
So if we had to redraw this molecule right here, you'd
8:48
have your carbon still.
8:49
You still have your bromine sitting on top.
8:52
But we're going to put the hydrogen now to the back, so
8:55
the hydrogen is now where the fluorine used to be.
8:59
The hydrogen's there.
9:05
This methyl group, this carbon with the three hydrogens, is
9:08
going to be rotated to where the hydrogen used to be.
9:12
It's now going to pop out of the page, because we're
9:15
rotating it in that direction, so this is our methyl group
9:18
right there.
9:19
And then this fluorine is going to be moved where the
9:21
methyl group was, so this fluorine will go right here.
9:26
And now, using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system,
9:30
this is our number one, this is our number two, just by
9:33
atomic number, this is number three.
9:35
You go from number one through number two to number three.
9:38
You go in this direction.
9:40
You're going counterclockwise.
9:45
Or we are going to the left, or we use the Latin word for
9:48
it, which is sinister.
9:51
And the word sinister comes from the Latin word for left,
9:54
so I guess right is good, and people thought either
9:57
left-handed people were bad, or if you're not going to the
9:59
right, it's bad.
9:59
I don't know why sinister took on its sinister meaning now in
10:04
common language.
10:05
But it's now the sinister version of the molecule.
10:09
So we would call this version, this enantiomer of
10:12
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, we would call this S, S for
10:19
sinister, or for left, or for counterclockwise:
10:22
(S)-1-bromo-1-fluoroethane.
10:31
So now we can differentiate the names.
10:33
We know that these are two different configurations.
10:38
And that's what the S and the R tell us, that if you have to
10:40
go from this to this, you would literally have to detach
10:43
and reattach different groups.
10:45
You'd actually have to break bonds.
10:46
You actually have to swap two of these groups in some way in
10:50
order to get from this enantiomer to this enantiomer.
10:53
They're different configurations, really
10:55
fundamentally different molecules, stereoisomers,
10:58
enantiomers, however you want to--",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,DfO27juYly8,
khan_video_0h5Jd7sgQWY_59014,How do viruses start or get created?,MCQ,"•
0:00
Considering that I have a cold right now, I can't imagine a
0:03
more appropriate topic to make a video on than a virus.
0:08
And I didn't want to make it that thick.
0:09
A virus, or viruses.
0:14
And in my opinion, viruses are, on some level, the most
0:19
fascinating thing in all of biology.
0:21
Because they really blur the boundary between what is an
0:25
inanimate object and what is life?
0:30
I mean if we look at ourselves, or life as one of
0:33
those things that you know it when you see it.
0:35
If you see something that, it's born, it grows, it's
0:39
constantly changing.
0:40
Maybe it moves around.
0:41
Maybe it doesn't.
0:42
But it's metabolizing things around itself.
0:44
It reproduces and then it dies.
0:46
You say, hey, that's probably life.
0:48
And in this, we throw most things that we see-- or we
0:50
throw in, us.
0:52
We throw in bacteria.
0:55
We throw in plants.
0:57
I mean, I could-- I'm kind of butchering the taxonomy system
1:00
here, but we tend to know life when we see it.
1:03
But all viruses are, they're just a bunch of genetic
1:07
information inside of a protein.
1:09
Inside of a protein capsule.
1:11
So let me draw.
1:13
And the genetic information can come in any form.
1:16
So it can be an RNA, it could be DNA, it could be
1:22
single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA.
1:24
Sometimes for single stranded they'll write these two little
1:27
S's in front of it.
1:29
Let's say they are talking about double stranded DNA,
1:30
they'll put a ds in front of it.
1:32
But the general idea-- and viruses can come in all of
1:35
these forms-- is that they have some genetic information,
1:38
some chain of nucleic acids.
1:40
Either as single or double stranded RNA or single or
1:43
double stranded DNA.
1:44
And it's just contained inside some type of protein
1:47
structure, which is called the capsid.
1:49
And kind of the classic drawing is kind of an
1:53
icosahedron type looking thing.
1:56
Let me see if I can do justice to it.
1:58
It looks something like this.
2:00
And not all viruses have to look exactly like this.
2:02
There's thousands of types of viruses.
2:05
And we're really just scratching the surface and
2:06
understanding even what viruses are out there and all
2:09
of the different ways that they can essentially replicate
2:14
themselves.
2:15
We'll talk more about that in the future.
2:16
And I would suspect that pretty much any possible way
2:19
of replication probably does somehow exist
2:21
in the virus world.
2:22
But they really are just these proteins, these protein
2:25
capsids, are just made up of a bunch of little
2:27
proteins put together.
2:29
And inside they have some genetic material, which might
2:31
be DNA or it might be RNA.
2:33
So let me draw their genetic material.
2:35
The protein is not necessarily transparent, but if it was,
2:38
you would see some genetic material inside of there.
2:42
So the question is, is this thing life?
2:48
It seems pretty inanimate.
2:49
It doesn't grow.
2:50
It doesn't change.
2:51
It doesn't metabolize things.
2:53
This thing, left to its own devices, is just
2:55
going to sit there.
2:55
It's just going to sit there the way a book on a table just
2:59
sits there.
3:00
It won't change anything.
3:02
But what happens is, the debate arises.
3:06
I mean you might say, hey Sal, when you define it that way,
3:08
just looks like a bunch of molecules put together.
3:10
That isn't life.
3:11
But it starts to seem like life all of a sudden when it
3:14
comes in contact with the things that we normally
3:17
consider life.
3:18
So what viruses do, the classic example is, a virus
3:22
will attach itself to a cell.
3:24
So let me draw this thing a little bit smaller.
3:28
So let's say that this is my virus.
3:30
I'll draw it as a little hexagon.
3:32
And what it does is, it'll attach itself to a cell.
3:34
And it could be any type of cell.
3:35
It could be a bacteria cell, it could be a plant cell, it
3:39
could be a human cell.
3:41
Let me draw the cell here.
3:43
Cells are usually far larger than the virus.
3:48
In the case of cells that have soft membranes, the virus
3:51
figures out some way to enter it.
3:53
Sometimes it can essentially fuse-- I don't want to
3:58
complicate the issue-- but sometimes viruses have their
4:01
own little membranes.
4:02
And we'll talk about in a second where
4:03
it gets their membranes.
4:04
So a virus might have its own membrane like that.
4:08
That's around its capsid.
4:10
And then these membranes will fuse.
4:13
And then the virus will be able to enter into the cell.
4:16
Now, that's one method.
4:18
And another method, and they're seldom
4:19
all the same way.
4:20
But let's say another method would be, the virus
4:24
convinces-- just based on some protein receptors on it, or
4:26
protein receptors on the cells-- and obviously this has
4:29
to be kind of a Trojan horse type of thing.
4:31
The cell doesn't want viruses.
4:33
So the virus has to somehow convince the cell that it's a
4:36
non-foreign particle.
4:38
We could do hundreds of videos on how viruses work and it's a
4:41
continuing field of research.
4:43
But sometimes you might have a virus that just gets consumed
4:47
by the cell.
4:48
Maybe the cell just thinks it's something that it needs
4:49
to consume.
4:50
So the cell wraps around it like this.
4:56
And these sides will eventually merge.
4:58
And then the cell and the virus will go into it.
5:01
This is called endocytosis.
5:03
I'll just talk about that.
5:04
It just brings it into its cytoplasm.
5:06
It doesn't happen just to viruses.
5:11
But this is one mechanism that can enter.
5:12
And then in cases where the cell in question-- for example
5:17
in the situation with bacteria-- if the cell has a
5:20
very hard shell-- let me do it in a good color.
5:25
So let's say that this is a bacteria right here.
5:29
And it has a hard shell.
5:30
The viruses don't even enter the cell.
5:32
They just hang out outside of the cell like this.
5:36
Not drawing to scale.
5:37
And they actually inject their genetic material.
5:40
So there's obviously a huge-- there's a wide variety of ways
5:43
of how the viruses get into cells.
5:45
But that's beside the point.
5:46
The interesting thing is that they do get into the cell.
5:49
And once they do get into the cell, they release their
5:52
genetic material into the cell.
5:54
So their genetic material will float around.
5:56
If their genetic material is already in the form of RNA--
6:01
and I could imagine almost every possibility of different
6:05
ways for viruses to work probably do exist in nature.
6:08
We just haven't found them.
6:09
But the ones that we've already found really do kind
6:11
of do it in every possible way.
6:13
So if they have RNA, this RNA can immediately start being
6:20
used to essentially-- let's say this is the
6:23
nucleus of the cell.
6:25
That's the nucleus of the cell and it normally has the DNA in
6:28
it like that.
6:29
Maybe I'll do the DNA in a different color.
6:30
But DNA gets transcribed into RNA, normally.
6:37
So normally, the cell, this a normal working cell, the RNA
6:39
exits the nucleus, it goes to the ribosomes, and then you
6:43
have the RNA in conjunction with the tRNA and it produces
6:46
these proteins.
6:49
The RNA codes for different proteins.
6:51
And I talk about that in a different video.
6:53
So these proteins get formed and eventually, they can form
6:57
the different structures in a cell.
6:58
But what a virus does is it hijacks this process here.
7:03
Hijacks this mechanism.
7:04
This RNA will essentially go and do what the cell's own RNA
7:08
would have done.
7:09
And it starts coding for its own proteins.
7:11
Obviously it's not going to code for
7:12
the same things there.
7:13
And actually some of the first proteins it codes for often
7:15
start killing the DNA and the RNA that might otherwise
7:19
compete with it.
7:20
So it codes its own proteins.
7:22
And then those proteins start making more viral shells.
7:26
So those proteins just start constructing more and more
7:31
viral shells.
7:33
At the same time, this RNA is replicating.
7:36
It's using the cell's own mechanisms. Left to its own
7:39
devices it would just sit there.
7:40
But once it enters into a cell it can use all of the nice
7:43
machinery that a cell has around to replicate itself.
7:47
And it's kind of amazing, just the biochemistry of it.
7:51
That these RNA molecules then find themselves
7:54
back in these capsids.
7:57
And then once there's enough of these and the cell has
8:00
essentially all of its resources have been depleted,
8:05
the viruses, these individual new viruses that have
8:09
replicated themselves using all of the cell's mechanisms,
8:15
will find some way to exit the cell.
8:17
The most-- I don't want to say, typical, because we
8:20
haven't even discovered all the different types of viruses
8:23
there are-- but one that's, I guess, talked about the most,
8:26
is when there's enough of these, they'll release
8:28
proteins or they'll construct proteins.
8:30
Because they don't make their own.
8:32
That essentially cause the cell to either kill itself or
8:35
its membrane to dissolve.
8:37
So the membrane dissolves.
8:39
And essentially the cell lyses.
8:41
Let me write that down.
8:42
The cell lyses.
8:43
And lyses just means that the cell's membrane just
8:46
disappears.
8:46
And then all of these guys can emerge for themselves.
8:50
Now I talked about before that have some of these guys, that
8:53
they have their own membrane.
8:54
So how did they get there, these
8:56
kind of bilipid membranes?
8:58
Well some of them, what they do is, once they replicate
9:00
inside of a cell, they exit maybe not even killing-- they
9:07
don't have to lyse.
9:08
Everything I talk about, these are specific ways that a virus
9:11
might work.
9:12
But viruses really kind of explore-- well different types
9:15
of viruses do almost every different combination you
9:17
could imagine of replicating and coding for proteins and
9:22
escaping from cells.
9:23
Some of them just bud.
9:24
And when they bud, they essentially, you can kind of
9:26
imagine that they push against the cell
9:28
wall, or the membrane.
9:29
I shouldn't say cell wall.
9:30
The cell's outer membrane.
9:32
And then when they push against it, they take some of
9:36
the membrane with them.
9:38
Until eventually the cell will-- when this goes up
9:41
enough, this'll pop together and it'll take some of the
9:43
membrane with it.
9:44
And you could imagine why that would be useful thing
9:47
to have with you.
9:49
Because now that you have this membrane, you kind of look
9:51
like this cell.
9:52
So when you want to go infect another cell like this, you're
9:55
not going to necessarily look like a foreign particle.
9:58
So it's a very useful way to look like something that
10:02
you're not.
10:03
And if you don't think that this is creepy-crawly enough,
10:06
that you're hijacking the DNA of an organism, viruses can
10:10
actually change the DNA an organism.
10:14
And actually one of the most common examples is HIV virus.
10:18
Let me write that down.
10:21
HIV, which is a type of retrovirus, which is
10:27
fascinating.
10:28
Because what they do is, so they have RNA in them.
10:35
And when they enter into a cell, let's say that they got
10:38
into the cell.
10:39
So it's inside of the cell like this.
10:42
They actually bring along with them a protein.
10:46
And every time you say, where do they get this protein?
10:49
All of this stuff came from a different cell.
10:51
They use some other cell's amino acids and ribosomes and
10:54
nucleic acids and everything to build themselves.
10:56
So any proteins that they have in them came
10:58
from another cell.
11:00
But they bring with them, this protein reverse transcriptase.
11:04
And the reverse transcriptase takes their RNA and
11:07
codes it into DNA.
11:11
So its RNA to DNA.
11:14
Which when it was first discovered was, kind of,
11:16
people always thought that you always went from DNA to RNA,
11:19
but this kind of broke that paradigm.
11:22
But it codes from RNA to DNA.
11:23
And if that's not bad enough, it'll incorporate that DNA
11:29
into the DNA of the host cell.
11:31
So that DNA will incorporate itself into the
11:34
DNA of the host cell.
11:35
Let's say the yellow is the DNA of the host cell.
11:37
And this is its nucleus.
11:41
So it actually messes with the genetic makeup
11:44
of what it's infecting.
11:46
And when I made the videos on bacteria I said, hey for every
11:51
one human cell we have twenty bacteria cells.
11:53
And they live with us and they're useful and they're
11:56
part of us and they're 10% of our dry mass and all of that.
12:00
But bacteria are kind of along for the ride.
12:02
They don't change who we are.
12:03
But these retroviruses, they're actually changing our
12:07
genetic makeup.
12:07
I mean, my genes, I take very personally.
12:10
They define who I am.
12:12
But these guys will actually go in and
12:14
change my genetic makeup.
12:16
And then once they're part of the DNA, then just the natural
12:19
DNA to RNA to protein process will code
12:25
their actual proteins.
12:27
Or their-- what they need to-- so sometimes they'll lay
12:30
dormant and do nothing.
12:31
And sometimes-- let's say sometimes in some type of
12:33
environmental trigger, they'll start coding
12:35
for themselves again.
12:37
And they'll start producing more.
12:38
But they're producing it directly from the organism's
12:41
cell's DNA.
12:43
They become part of the organism.
12:45
I mean I can't imagine a more intimate way to become part of
12:49
an organism than to become part of its DNA.
12:51
I can't imagine any other way to
12:52
actually define an organism.
12:55
And if this by itself is not eerie enough, and just so you
13:00
know, this notion right here, when a virus becomes part of
13:06
an organism's DNA, this is called a provirus.
13:13
But if this isn't eerie enough, they estimate-- so if
13:16
this infects a cell in my nose or in my arm, as this cell
13:23
experiences mitosis, all of its offspring-- but its
13:27
offspring are genetically identical-- are going to have
13:29
this viral DNA.
13:30
And that might be fine, but at least my
13:32
children won't get it.
13:33
You know, at least it won't become part of my species.
13:35
But it doesn't have to just infect somatic cells, it could
13:38
infect a germ cell.
13:41
So it could go into a germ cell.
13:44
And the germ cells, we've learned already, these are the
13:46
ones that produce gametes.
13:49
For men, that's sperm and for women it's eggs.
13:52
But you could imagine, once you've infected a germ cell,
13:55
once you become part of a germ cell's DNA, then I'm passing
13:59
on that viral DNA to my son or my daughter.
14:02
And they are going to pass it on to their children.
14:05
And just that idea by itself is, at least to my mind.
14:10
vaguely creepy.
14:12
And people estimate that 5-8%-- and this kind of really
14:16
blurs, it makes you think about what we as humans really
14:19
are-- but the estimate is 5-8% of the human genome-- so when
14:26
I talked about bacteria I just talked about things that were
14:29
along for the ride.
14:30
But the current estimate, and I looked up this a lot.
14:33
I found 8% someplace, 5% someplace.
14:35
It's all a guess.
14:35
I mean people are doing it based on just looking at the
14:37
DNA and how similar it is to DNA in other organisms. But
14:40
the estimate is 5-8% of the human genome is from viruses,
14:47
is from ancient retroviruses that incorporated themselves
14:51
into the human germ line.
14:53
So into the human DNA.
14:55
So these are called endogenous retroviruses.
15:04
Which is mind blowing to me, because it's not just saying
15:07
these things are along for the ride or that they might help
15:09
us or hurt us.
15:10
It's saying that we are-- 5-8% of our DNA
15:14
actually comes from viruses.
15:16
And this is another thing that speaks to
15:17
just genetic variation.
15:19
Because viruses do something-- I mean this is called
15:24
horizontal transfer of DNA.
15:27
And you could imagine, as a virus goes from one species to
15:30
the next, as it goes from Species A to B, if it mutates
15:37
to be able to infiltrate these cells, it might take some--
15:41
it'll take the DNA that it already has, that
15:43
makes it, it with it.
15:45
But sometimes, when it starts coding for some of these other
15:48
guys, so let's say that this is a provirus right here.
15:52
Where the blue part is the original virus.
15:55
The yellow is the organism's historic DNA.
16:00
Sometimes when it codes, it takes up little sections of
16:04
the other organism's DNA.
16:07
So maybe most of it was the viral DNA, but it might have,
16:11
when it transcribed and translated itself, it might
16:14
have taken a little bit-- or at least when it translated or
16:16
replicated itself-- it might take a little bit of the
16:18
organism's previous DNA.
16:20
So it's actually cutting parts of DNA from one organism and
16:23
bringing it to another organism.
16:24
Taking it from one member of a species to another member of
16:27
the species.
16:27
But it can definitely go cross-species.
16:29
So you have this idea all of a sudden that DNA can jump
16:32
between species.
16:34
It really kind of-- I don't know, for me it makes me
16:36
appreciate how interconnected-- as a species,
16:39
we kind of imagine that we're by ourselves and can only
16:41
reproduce with each other and have genetic variation within
16:45
a population.
16:45
But viruses introduce this notion of horizontal transfer
16:50
via transduction.
16:53
Horizontal transduction is just the idea of, look when I
16:57
replicate this virus, I might take a little bit of the
17:00
organism that I'm freeloading off of, I might take a little
17:04
bit of their DNA with me.
17:06
And infect that DNA into the next organism.
17:09
So you actually have this DNA, this jumping,
17:11
from organism to organism.
17:13
So it kind of unifies all DNA-based life.
17:17
Which is all the life that we know on the planet.
17:20
And if all of this isn't creepy enough-- and actually
17:24
maybe I'll save the creepiest part for the end.
17:28
But there's a whole-- we could talk all about the different
17:30
classes of viruses.
17:31
But just so you're familiar with some of the terminology,
17:33
when a virus attacks bacteria, which they often do.
17:37
And we study these the most because this might be a good
17:41
alternative to antibiotics.
17:42
Because viruses that attack bacteria might-- sometimes the
17:45
bacteria is far worse for the virus-- but these are called
17:47
bacteriaphages.
17:52
And I've already talked to you about how they have their DNA.
17:55
But since bacteria have hard walls, they will just inject
17:57
the DNA inside of the bacteria.
18:00
And when you talk about DNA, this idea of a provirus.
18:06
So when a virus lyses it like this, this is
18:09
called the lytic cycle.
18:11
This is just some terminology that's good to know if you're
18:13
going to take a biology exam about this stuff.
18:16
And when the virus incorporates it into the DNA
18:18
and lays dormant, incorporates into the DNA of the host
18:22
organism and lays dormant for awhile, this is called the
18:25
lysogenic cycle.
18:28
And normally, a provirus is essentially experiencing a
18:32
lysogenic cycle in eurkaryotes, in organisms that
18:35
have a nuclear membrane.
18:38
Normally when people talk about the lysogenic cycle,
18:40
they're talking about viral DNA laying dormant in the DNA
18:44
of bacteria.
18:45
Or bacteriophage DNA laying dormant
18:48
in the DNA of bacteria.
18:51
But just to kind of give you an idea of what this, quote
18:53
unquote, looks like, right here.
18:59
I got these two pictures from Wikipedia.
19:01
One is from the CDC.
19:11
These little green dots you see right here all over the
19:14
surface, this big thing you see here, this is a white
19:17
blood cell.
19:20
Part of the human immune system.
19:21
This is a white blood cell.
19:27
And what you see emerging from the surface, essentially
19:31
budding from the surface of this white blood cell-- and
19:34
this gives you a sense of scale too--
19:36
these are HIV-1 viruses.
19:39
And so you're familiar with the terminology, the HIV is a
19:46
virus that infects white blood cells.
19:51
AIDS is the syndrome you get once your immune system is
19:54
weakened to the point.
19:55
And then many people suffer infections that people with a
19:58
strong immune system normally won't suffer from.
20:01
But this is creepy.
20:03
These things went inside this huge cell, they used the
20:06
cell's own mechanism to reproduce its own DNA or its
20:11
own RNA and these protein capsids.
20:14
And then they bud from the cell and take a little bit of
20:16
the membrane with it.
20:17
And they can even leave some of their DNA behind in this
20:20
cell's own DNA.
20:22
So they really change what the cell is all about.
20:25
This is another creepy picture.
20:26
These are bacteriaphages.
20:34
And these show you what I said before.
20:36
This is a bacteria right here.
20:38
This is its cell wall.
20:41
And it's hard.
20:42
So it's hard to just emerge into it.
20:45
Or you can't just merge, fuse membranes with it.
20:47
So they hang out on the outside of this bacteria.
20:52
And they are essentially injecting their genetic
20:55
material into the bacteria itself.
20:58
And you could imagine, just looking at the
20:59
size of these things.
21:01
I mean, this is a cell.
21:02
And it looks like a whole planet or something.
21:04
Or this is a bacteria and these
21:05
things are so much smaller.
21:06
Roughly 1/100 of a bacteria.
21:08
And these are much less than 1/100 of this cell we're
21:10
talking about.
21:11
And they're extremely hard to filter for.
21:15
To kind of keep out.
21:16
Because they are such, such small particles.
21:20
If you think that these are exotic things that exist for
21:23
things like HIV or Ebola , which they do cause, or SARS,
21:31
you're right.
21:32
But they're also common things.
21:33
I mean, I said at the beginning of this video that I
21:35
have a cold.
21:36
And I have a cold because some viruses have infected the
21:40
tissue in my nasal passage.
21:42
And they're causing me to have a runny nose and whatnot.
21:46
And viruses also cause the chicken pox.
21:48
They cause the herpes simplex virus.
21:50
Causes cold sores.
21:51
So they're with us all around.
21:53
I can almost guarantee you have some virus
21:56
with you as you speak.
21:57
They're all around you.
21:58
But it's a very
22:04
philosophically puzzling question.
22:06
Because I started with, at the beginning, are these life?
22:09
And at first when I just showed it to you, look they
22:11
are just this protein with some nucleic
22:13
acid molecule in it.
22:15
And it's not doing anything.
22:16
And that doesn't look like life to me.
22:17
It's not moving around.
22:18
It doesn't have a metabolism.
22:19
It's not eating.
22:20
It's not reproducing.
22:21
But then all of a sudden, when you think about what it's
22:23
doing to cells and how it uses cells to kind of reproduce.
22:27
It kind of like-- in business terms it's asset light.
22:29
It doesn't need all of the machinery because it can use
22:31
other people's machinery to replicate itself.
22:35
You almost kind of want to view it as a
22:38
smarter form of life.
22:39
Because it doesn't go through all of the trouble of what
22:42
every other form of life has.
22:44
It makes you question what life is, or even what we are.
22:47
Are we these things that contain DNA or are we just
22:51
transport mechanisms for the DNA?
22:54
And these are kind of the more important things.
22:56
And these viral infections are just battles between different
22:59
forms of DNA and RNA and whatnot.
23:02
Anyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.
23:04
But hopefully this gives you a good idea of what viruses are
23:08
and why they really are, in my mind, the most fascinating
23:12

khan_video_pBZ-RiT5nEE_7995,Why is Chlorine not included in the list of the Atom that needed to be bonded with Hydrogen in order to have Hydrogen Bond which have the same electronegativity with Nitrogen?,Essay,"•
0:01
In the video on electronegativity,
0:03
we learned how to determine whether a covalent
0:06
bond is polar or nonpolar.
0:07
In this video, we're going to see how we figure out
0:10
whether molecules are polar or nonpolar
0:12
and also how to apply that polarity to what
0:15
we call intermolecular forces.
0:17
Intermolecular forces are the forces
0:20
that are between molecules.
0:22
And so that's different from an intramolecular force, which
0:25
is the force within a molecule.
0:27
So a force within a molecule would
0:29
be something like the covalent bond.
0:31
And an intermolecular force would
0:33
be the force that are between molecules.
0:36
And so let's look at the first intermolecular force.
0:38
It's called a dipole-dipole interaction.
0:41
And let's analyze why it has that name.
0:43
If I look at one of these molecules of acetone here
0:46
and I focus in on the carbon that's double
0:48
bonded to the oxygen, I know that oxygen
0:51
is more electronegative than carbon.
0:53
And so we have four electrons in this double bond
0:56
between the carbon and the oxygen.
0:58
So I'll try to highlight them right here.
1:00
And since oxygen is more electronegative,
1:03
oxygen is going to pull those electrons closer to it,
1:06
therefore giving oxygen a partial negative charge.
1:09
Those electrons in yellow are moving away from this carbon.
1:12
So the carbon's losing a little bit of electron density,
1:15
and this carbon is becoming partially positive like that.
1:19
And so for this molecule, we're going
1:22
to get a separation of charge, a positive and a negative charge.
1:25
So we have a polarized double bond situation here.
1:27
We also have a polarized molecule.
1:29
And so there's two different poles, a negative
1:32
and a positive pole here.
1:34
And so we say that this is a polar molecule.
1:36
So acetone is a relatively polar molecule.
1:41
The same thing happens to this acetone molecule down here.
1:43
So we get a partial negative, and we get a partial positive.
1:46
So this is a polar molecule as well.
1:49
It has two poles.
1:50
So we call this a dipole.
1:52
So each molecule has a dipole moment.
1:55
And because each molecule is polar
1:57
and has a separation of positive and negative charge,
2:01
in organic chemistry we know that opposite charges attract,
2:04
right?
2:04
So this negatively charged oxygen
2:06
is going to be attracted to this positively charged carbon.
2:09
And so there's going to be an electrostatic attraction
2:13
between those two molecules.
2:15
And that's what's going to hold these two molecules together.
2:18
And you would therefore need energy
2:20
if you were to try to pull them apart.
2:22
And so the boiling point of acetone
2:25
turns out to be approximately 56 degrees Celsius.
2:30
And since room temperature is between 20 and 25,
2:33
at room temperature we have not reached
2:34
the boiling point of acetone.
2:36
And therefore, acetone is still a liquid.
2:38
So at room temperature and pressure, acetone is a liquid.
2:42
And it has to do with the intermolecular
2:44
force of dipole-dipole interactions
2:46
holding those molecules together.
2:49
And the intermolecular force, in turn,
2:51
depends on the electronegativity.
2:54
Let's look at another intermolecular force,
2:56
and this one's called hydrogen bonding.
2:58
So here we have two water molecules.
3:01
And once again, if I think about these electrons
3:05
here, which are between the oxygen and the hydrogen,
3:08
I know oxygen's more electronegative than hydrogen.
3:11
So oxygen's going to pull those electrons closer to it,
3:14
giving the oxygen a partial negative charge like that.
3:18
The hydrogen is losing a little bit of electron density,
3:20
therefore becoming partially positive.
3:22
The same situation exists in the water molecule down here.
3:26
So we have a partial negative, and we have a partial positive.
3:29
And so like the last example, we can
3:31
see there's going to be some sort
3:32
of electrostatic attraction between those opposite charges,
3:35
between the negatively partially charged oxygen,
3:38
and the partially positive hydrogen like that.
3:40
And so this is a polar molecule.
3:42
Of course, water is a polar molecule.
3:43
And so you would think that this would
3:45
be an example of dipole-dipole interaction.
3:48
And it is, except in this case it's
3:51
an even stronger version of dipole-dipole interaction
3:54
that we call hydrogen bonding.
3:56
So at one time it was thought that it
3:59
was possible for hydrogen to form an extra bond.
4:03
And that's where the term originally comes from.
4:06
But of course, it's not an actual intramolecular force.
4:10
We're talking about an intermolecular force.
4:13
But it is the strongest intermolecular force.
4:16
The way to recognize when hydrogen bonding is present as
4:19
opposed to just dipole-dipole is to see
4:22
what the hydrogen is bonded to.
4:24
And so in this case, we have a very electronegative atom,
4:28
hydrogen, bonded-- oxygen, I should say-- bonded
4:31
to hydrogen.
4:32
And then that hydrogen is interacting
4:34
with another electronegative atom like that.
4:37
So we have a partial negative, and we have a partial positive,
4:40
and then we have another partial negative over here.
4:43
And this is the situation that you
4:44
need to have when you have hydrogen bonding.
4:46
Here's your hydrogen showing intermolecular force here.
4:50
And what some students forget is that this hydrogen actually
4:53
has to be bonded to another electronegative atom in order
4:57
for there to be a big enough difference in electronegativity
5:00
for there to be a little bit extra attraction.
5:03
And so the three electronegative elements
5:05
that you should remember for hydrogen bonding
5:08
are fluorine, oxygen, and nitrogen.
5:11
And so the mnemonics that students use is FON.
5:14
So if you remember FON as the electronegative atoms that
5:17
can participate in hydrogen bonding,
5:19
you should be able to remember this intermolecular force.
5:22
The boiling point of water is, of course, about 100 degrees
5:26
Celsius, so higher than what we saw for acetone.
5:31
And this just is due to the fact that hydrogen bonding
5:33
is a stronger version of dipole-dipole interaction,
5:38
and therefore, it takes more energy or more heat
5:40
to pull these water molecules apart
5:42
in order to turn them into a gas.
5:44
And so, of course, water is a liquid at room temperature.
5:48
All right.
5:48
Let's look at another intermolecular force.
5:51
And this one is called London dispersion forces.
5:54
So these are the weakest intermolecular forces,
5:58
and they have to do with the electrons that are always
6:01
moving around in orbitals.
6:03
And even though the methane molecule here,
6:06
if we look at it, we have a carbon
6:08
surrounded by four hydrogens for methane.
6:10
And it's hard to tell in how I've drawn the structure here,
6:13
but if you go back and you look at the video
6:15
for the tetrahedral bond angle proof,
6:17
you can see that in three dimensions,
6:20
these hydrogens are coming off of the carbon,
6:22
and they're equivalent in all directions.
6:24
And there's a very small difference
6:25
in electronegativity between the carbon and the hydrogen.
6:28
And that small difference is canceled out
6:30
in three dimensions.
6:31
So the methane molecule becomes nonpolar as a result of that.
6:35
So this one's nonpolar, and, of course, this one's nonpolar.
6:38
And so there's no dipole-dipole interaction.
6:40
There's no hydrogen bonding.
6:42
The only intermolecular force that's
6:44
holding two methane molecules together
6:46
would be London dispersion forces.
6:48
And so once again, you could think about the electrons that
6:50
are in these bonds moving in those orbitals.
6:54
And let's say for the molecule on the left,
6:58
if for a brief transient moment in time
7:00
you get a little bit of negative charge
7:01
on this side of the molecule, so it might turn out
7:04
to be those electrons have a net negative charge on this side.
7:07
And then for this molecule, the electrons
7:11
could be moving the opposite direction,
7:13
giving this a partial positive.
7:14
And so there could be a very, very small bit
7:17
of attraction between these two methane molecules.
7:19
It's very weak, which is why London dispersion forces are
7:23
the weakest intermolecular forces.
7:24
But it is there.
7:26
And that's the only thing that's holding together these methane
7:28
molecules.
7:30
And since it's weak, we would expect the boiling point
7:33
for methane to be extremely low.
7:35
And, of course, it is.
7:36
So the boiling point for methane is somewhere around negative
7:39
164 degrees Celsius.
7:42
And so since room temperature is somewhere around 20 to 25,
7:46
obviously methane has already boiled,
7:48
if you will, and turned into a gas.
7:50
So methane is obviously a gas at room temperature and pressure.
7:56
Now, if you increase the number of carbons,
7:58
you're going to increase the number of attractive forces
8:03
that are possible.
8:04
And if you do that, you can actually
8:07
increase the boiling point of other hydrocarbons
8:10
dramatically.
8:11
And so even though London dispersion forces
8:13
are the weakest, if you have larger molecules
8:16
and you sum up all those extra forces,
8:18
it can actually turn out to be rather significant when you're
8:21
working with larger molecules.
8:23
And so this is just a quick summary
8:26
of some of the intermolecular forces
8:28
to show you the application of electronegativity
8:32

In most topics you have to get pretty advanced before you
0:03
start addressing the philosophically interesting
0:05
things, but in chemistry it just starts right from the
0:08
get-go with what's arguably the most philosophically
0:11
interesting part of the whole topic, and that's the atom.
0:15
And the idea of the atom, as philosophers long ago, and you
0:18
could look it up on the different philosophers who
0:21
first philosophized about it, they said, hey, you know, if I
0:23
started off with, I don't know, if I started off with an
0:28
apple, and I just kept cutting the apple -- let me draw a
0:32
nice looking apple just so it doesn't look just
0:34
like a heart .
0:36
There you go.
0:36
You have a nice looking apple, And you just kept cutting it,
0:38
smaller and smaller pieces.
0:40
So eventually, you get a piece so small, so tiny, that you
0:44
can't cut it anymore.
0:46
And I'm sure some of these philosophers went out there
0:48
with a knife and tried to do it and they just felt that,
0:50
oh, if I could just get my knife a little bit sharper, I
0:52
could cut it again and again.
0:53
So it's a completely philosophical construct, which
0:56
frankly, in a lot of ways, isn't too different to how the
0:59
atom is today.
1:00
It's really just a mental abstraction that allows us to
1:04
describe a lot of observations we see in the universe.
1:07
But anyway, these philosophers said, well, at some point we
1:10
think that there's going to be some little part of an apple
1:15
that they won't be able to divide anymore.
1:16
And they called that an atom.
1:18
And it doesn't just have to just be for an apple they said
1:19
this is true for any substance or any element to that you
1:23
encounter in the universe.
1:25
And so the word atom is really Greek for uncuttable.
1:29
Uncuttable or indivisible.
1:34
Now we know that it actually is cuttable and even though it
1:37
is not a trivial thing, it's not the smallest form of
1:42
matter we know.
1:43
We now know that an atom is made up of other more
1:47
fundamental particles.
1:48
And let me write that.
1:50
So the we have the neutron.
1:55
And I'll draw in a second how they all fit together and the
1:59
structure of an atom.
2:00
We have a neutron.
2:02
We have a proton.
2:05
And we have electrons.
2:09
Electrons.
2:11
And you might already be familiar with this if you look
2:13
at old videos about atomic projects, you'll see a drawing
2:18
that looks something like this.
2:20
Let me see if I can draw one.
2:21
So you'll have something like that.
2:24
And you'll have these things spinning around
2:27
that look like this.
2:28
They have orbits that look like that.
2:30
And maybe something that looks like that.
2:33
And the general notion behind these kind of nuclear drawings
2:36
-- and I'm sure that they still show up at some
2:39
government defense labs or something like that -- is that
2:41
you have a nucleus at the center of an atom.
2:46
You have a nucleus at the center of an atom.
2:48
And we know that a nucleus has neutrons and protons.
2:52
Neutrons and protons.
2:53
And we'll talk a little bit more about which elements have
2:56
how many neutrons and how many protons.
2:59
And then orbiting, and I'm going to use the word orbit
3:02
right now, although we'll learn in about two minutes
3:05
that the word orbit is actually the incorrect or even
3:08
the mentally incorrect way of visualizing what
3:10
an electron is doing.
3:11
But the old idea was that you have these electrons that are
3:14
orbiting around the nucleus very similar to the way the
3:17
Earth orbits around the Sun or the moon
3:19
orbits around the Earth.
3:21
And it's been shown that that's actually
3:23
a very wrong way.
3:26
And when we cover quantum mechanics we'll learn why this
3:30
doesn't work, what are the contradictions that emerge
3:34
when you try to model an electron like a planet going
3:38
around the Sun.
3:40
But this was kind of the original idea, and frankly I
3:41
think this is kind of the idea that is the most mainstream
3:45
way of viewing an atom.
3:50
Now, I said an atom is philosophically interesting.
3:52
Why is it philosophically interesting?
3:53
Because what we now view as the accepted way of viewing an
3:58
atom really starts to blur the line between our physical
4:04
reality and everything in the world is just information, and
4:09
there really isn't any such thing as true matter or true
4:12
particles as the way we define them in our everyday life.
4:15
You know, for me a particle, oh, it looks
4:16
like a grain of sand.
4:17
I can pick it up, touch it.
4:19
While a wave, that could be like a soundwave. It could be
4:21
just this change in energy over time.
4:23
But we'll learn, especially when we do quantum mechanics,
4:25
that it all gets jumbled up as we start approaching the
4:29
scales or the size of an atom.
4:31
Anyway, I said this was an incorrect way of doing it.
4:34
What's the correct way?
4:37
So it turns out-- this is a picture, not a picture really,
4:40
this is also a depiction.
4:42
So it's an interesting question, what I just said.
4:44
How can you have a picture of an atom?
4:47
Because is actually turns out that most wavelengths of
4:49
light, especially the visible wavelengths of light, are much
4:52
larger than the size of an atom.
4:56
Everything else we quote-unquote, observe in
4:58
life, it's by reflected light.
5:00
But all of a sudden when you're dealing with an atom,
5:02
reflected light you could almost view it as too big, or
5:06
too blunt of an instrument with which to observe an atom.
5:09
Anyway, this is a depiction of a helium atom.
5:14
A helium atom has two protons and two neutrons.
5:18
Or at least this helium atom has two
5:19
protons and two neutrons.
5:21
And the way they depict it here in the nucleus, right
5:24
there, maybe these are the two-- I'm assuming they're
5:26
using red for proton and purple for neutron.
5:32
Purple seems like more of a neutral color.
5:34
And they're sitting at the center of this atom.
5:39
And then this whole haze around there, those are the
5:42
two electrons that helium has, or that at least
5:45
this helium atom has.
5:47
Maybe you could gain or lose an electron.
5:49
But these are the two electrons.
5:50
And you say, hey, Sal, how can two electrons be this blur
5:55
that's kind of smeared around this atom.
5:58
And that's where it gets philosophically interesting.
6:01
So you cannot describe an electron's path around a
6:09
nucleus with the traditional orbit idea that we've
6:12
encountered when we look at planets or if we just imagine
6:16
things at kind of a larger scale.
6:18
It turns out that an electron, you cannot know exactly its
6:24
momentum and location at any given point in time.
6:28
All you can know is a probability distribution of
6:31
where it is likely to be.
6:33
And the way they depicted this, black is a higher
6:36
probability, so you're much more likely to find the
6:39
electron here than you are here.
6:42
But the electron really could be anywhere.
6:43
It could even to be here, even though it's completely white
6:46
there, with some very, very, very, very, very low
6:49
probability.
6:50
And so this function of where an electron is, this is called
6:55
an orbital.
6:56
Orbital.
6:57
Not to be confused with orbit.
7:00
Orbital.
7:02
Remember, an orbit was something like this.
7:05
It's like Venus going around the Sun.
7:08
So it's very physically easy for us to imagine.
7:12
While an orbital is actually a mathematical probability
7:16
function that tells us where we're
7:17
likely to find an electron.
7:18
We'll deal a lot more with that when we cover quantum
7:21
mechanics, but that's not going to be in the scope of
7:23
this kind of introductory set of chemistry lectures.
7:26
But it's interesting, right?
7:28
An electron's behavior is so bizarre at that scale that you
7:32
can't-- I mean, to call it a particle is almost misleading.
7:35
It is called a particle, but it's not a particle in the
7:38
sense that we're used to in our everyday life.
7:40
It's this thing that you can't even say exactly where it is.
7:45
It can be anywhere in this haze.
7:47
And we'll learn later that there are different shapes of
7:49
the hazes is as we add more and more electrons to an atom.
7:53
But to me, it starts to address philosophical issues
7:57
of what matter even is, or do the things we look at, how
8:01
real are they?
8:02
Or how real are they, at least as we've defined reality?
8:04
Anyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.
8:07
But the whole notion of electrons, protons, they're
8:12
all kind of predicated on this notion of charge.
8:15
And we've talked about it before when we learned about
8:17
Coulomb's law.
8:18
You could review Coulomb's laws videos in the physics
8:22
playlist. But the idea is that an electron
8:27
has a negative charge.
8:29
A proton, sometimes written like that,
8:31
has a positive charge.
8:33
And a neutron has no charge.
8:37
And so that's what was tempting about the original
8:39
model of an electron.
8:42
If they say, OK, if this thing has positive charges, right?
8:45
So let's say this is two neutrons and two protons.
8:47
Let's say it's a helium atom.
8:48
Then we'll have some positive charges here.
8:51
We have some negative charges out here.
8:54
Opposite charges attract.
8:56
And so if these things had some velocity, enough
9:03
velocity, they would orbit around this, just the way a
9:08
planet will orbit around the Sun.
9:10
But now we learn, even though this is partially true, that
9:15
the further away an electron is from the nucleus, it does
9:23
have more, it's true, potential energy.
9:27
In that it will want to move towards the nucleus, but
9:31
because of all the mechanics at the quantum level, it won't
9:34
just do something simple like move in a path like that, like
9:37
a comet would do around the Sun, it actually has this kind
9:41
of wave-like behavior, where it just has this probability
9:43
function that describes it.
9:45
But the further away an orbital, it
9:48
does have more potential.
9:50
We're going to go a lot more into that in future videos.
9:53
But anyway, how do you recognize what an element is?
9:56
I've talked a lot about the philosophy and all of that,
9:58
but how do I know that this is helium?
10:00
Is it by the number of neutrons it has?
10:03
Is it by the number of protons it has?
10:05
Is it by the number of electrons?
10:07
Well the answer is, it's by the number of protons.
10:09
So if you know the number of protons in an element, you
10:13
know what that element is.
10:14
And the number of protons, this is defined
10:21
as the atomic number.
10:26
Now, so let's say I said something has four protons.
10:33
How do we know what it is?
10:34
Well if we haven't memorized it, we could look it up on the
10:37
periodic table of elements, which we'll be dealing with a
10:39
lot in this playlist. And you'd say, oh, four protons,
10:43
that is beryllium.
10:45
Right there.
10:46
And the atomic number is the number that you see up there.
10:50
And that' s literally the number of protons.
10:52
And that is what differentiates
10:55
one atom from another.
10:56
If you have fifteen protons, you're dealing with
10:59
phosphorus.
11:00
And all of a sudden, if you have seven protons, you're
11:06
dealing with nitrogen.
11:07
If you have eight, you're dealing with oxygen.
11:09
That is what defines the element.
11:11
Now, we'll talk in the future about what happens with charge
11:15
and all of that.
11:17
Or what happens when you gain or lose electrons.
11:19
But that does not change what element you're dealing with.
11:21
And likewise, when you change the number of neutrons, that
11:26
also does not change the element you're dealing with.
11:30
But that leads to an obvious question of, well, how many
11:32
neutrons and electrons do you have?
11:35
Well, if an atom is charge-neutral, that means it
11:43
has the same number of electrons.
11:46
So let's say that I have carbon.
11:52
Its atomic number is six.
11:53
And let's say its mass number is twelve.
12:00
Now what does this mean?
12:01
And let me say further that this is a neutral particle.
12:05
This is a neutral atom.
12:07
So the atomic number for carbon is six.
12:10
That tells us exactly how many protons it has.
12:13
So if I were to draw a little model here, and this is in no
12:16
way an accurate model.
12:17
I'll draw six-- two, three, four, five, six
12:21
protons in the center.
12:23
And the weight of these protons, each proton is one
12:26
atomic mass unit, and we'll talk more about how that
12:28
relates to kilograms. It's a very small
12:31
fraction of a kilogram.
12:32
Roughly I think it's 1.6 times 10 to the
12:36
minus 27th of a kilogram.
12:38
So let's say each of these are one atomic mass unit, and
12:45
that's approximately equal to, I think, 1.67 times 10 to the
12:48
minus 27 kilograms. This is a very small number.
12:53
It's actually almost impossible to visualize.
12:57
At least it is for me.
12:58
This tells me the mass of the entire carbon atom, of this
13:03
particular carbon atom.
13:04
And this can actually change from carbon
13:05
atom to carbon atom.
13:07
And this is essentially the mass of all of the protons
13:10
plus all of the neutrons.
13:12
And each proton has an atomic mass of one, in atomic mass
13:17
units, and each neutron has an atomic mass of
13:20
one atomic mass unit.
13:22
So this is really the number of protons plus
13:28
the number of neutrons.
13:33
So in this case we have six protons, so we must also have
13:37
six neutrons.
13:39
Six neutrons plus six protons.
13:42
Now, where are the electrons?
13:44
Well, I said it's neutral, so the proton has an equal
13:49
positive charge as the electron's negative charge.
13:51
So this is a neutral atom, and it has six protons, so it also
13:55
has six electrons.
13:56
Let me draw that.
13:57
So we said it has six neutrons in here.
13:59
One, two, three, four, five, six.
14:01
So that's the nucleus right there.
14:04
And then if we were to draw the electons-- well, I could
14:09
draw it as a smear, but if we want to kind of visualize it a
14:12
little better, we could say, OK, there's going to be six
14:13
electrons orbiting.
14:15
One, two, three, four, five, six.
14:18
And they're going to be moving around in this unpredictable
14:21
way that we would have to describe with
14:22
a probability function.
14:24
And so the interesting thing about it is, most of the mass
14:30
of an atom is sitting right in here.
14:32
I mean, you might notice that when people care about the
14:34
mass, when they care about the atomic mass number of an atom,
14:40
they ignore the electrons.
14:41
And that's because the mass of a proton, one proton
14:47
mass-wise, is equal to 1,836 electons.
14:52
So for thinking about the mass of an atom, for all basic
14:58
purposes, you can ignore the mass of an electron.
15:01
It's really the mass of the nucleus that counts as the
15:08
mass of the atom.
15:10
Now, you might see this periodic table here, and you
15:12
say, OK, they gave us the atomic number up there.
15:15
The atomic number of oxygen is eight.
15:18
It means it has eight protons.
15:20
The atomic number of silicon is 14.
15:22
It has 14 protons.
15:24
Now what is this right here?
15:27
Let's see, in carbon.
15:28
In carbon they have this 12.0107.
15:34
That is the atomic weight of carbon.
15:36
Let me write this.
15:41
Atomic weight of carbon.
15:47
The atomic weight of carbon is 12.0107.
15:56
Now, what does that mean?
15:57
Does that mean that carbon has six protons and then the
16:03
remainder, the remaining 6.0107 neutrons, it has kind
16:09
of this fraction of a neutron?
16:11
No.
16:12
It means if you were to average all the different
16:16
versions of carbon you find on the planet and you were to
16:19
average the number of neutrons based on the quantity of the
16:25
different types of carbon, this is the
16:27
average you would get.
16:28
So it turns out that carbon, the two major forms, the main
16:32
one you'll find is carbon-12.
16:35
So that's like this.
16:36
So that has six protons and six neutrons.
16:39
And then another isotope of carbon.
16:42
Now an isotope is the same element with a different
16:45
number of neutrons.
16:46
Another isotope of carbon is carbon-14, which is much more
16:50
scarce on the planet.
16:52
We don't know how much in the universe, but on the planet.
16:55
Now, if you were to average these, not just a straight-up
16:58
average, then you would get carbon-13 and then the atomic
17:01
weight would be 13, but you weight this one much higher
17:04
because this exists in much larger quantities on Earth.
17:07
I mean, this is pretty much all of the
17:08
carbon that you see.
17:09
But there's a little bit of this.
17:10
So if you weight them appropriately, the average
17:13
becomes this.
17:14
So most of the carbon you'll find-- if you just found
17:17
carbon someplace, on average its weight in atomic mass
17:22
units is going to be 12.0107.
17:27
But that idea of an isotope is an interesting one.
17:29
Remember, when you change the neutrons, you're not changing
17:32
the actual, fundamental element.
17:33
You're just getting a different isotope, a different
17:36
version, of the element.
17:37
So these two versions of carbon are both isotopes.
17:41
Now, I want to leave this video with what I think is
17:43
kind of the neatest idea behind atoms. And it's the
17:46
most philosophically interesting things about them.
17:49
It's that the relative size-- so, we have these electrons,
17:54
which represent very little of the mass of an atom.
17:58
It's 1/2000 of the mass of an atom are the electrons.
18:01
And even those, it's hard to even describe them as
18:04
particles, because you can't even tell me exactly where and
18:08
how fast one of these particles is moving.
18:11
They just have a probability function.
18:12
So most of the atom is sitting inside the nucleus.
18:16
And this is the interesting thing.
18:17
If you look at an atom on average, if you
18:21
say this is my atom.
18:23
Let's say I had two atoms that are bonded to each other.
18:26
And I were to say, how much of this is actual stuff?
18:29
And when I say stuff, that's a very abstract concept, because
18:32
we're talking about the nucleus, right?
18:33
Because the nucleus is where all the
18:34
mass is, all the stuff.
18:36
It turns out that it's actually an infinitesimally
18:39
small fraction of the volume of the atom where-- the volume
18:44
of the atom is hard to define, because the electron can
18:45
pretty much be anywhere, but if you view the volume as
18:48
where you're most likely to find the electron, or with 90%
18:52
probability you're likely to find the electron, then the
18:55
nucleus is, in a lot of cases and the way I think about it,
18:59
it's about 1/10,000 of the volume.
19:01
So if you think about it, when you look at something, if you
19:03
look at your hand or if you look at the wall or if you
19:06
look at your computer, 99.999% of it is free space.
19:14
It's nothing.
19:15
It's vacuum.
19:18
If you had ultra-small-- I guess we could call them
19:20
particles or something-- most of them would pass straight
19:23
through whatever you look at.
19:24
So it already starts to kind of
19:26
question our hold on reality.
19:28
What is there when, if-- and this is fact, this isn't
19:32
theory right here-- that if you take anything down to the
19:35
building blocks, down to the atomic level, most of the
19:39
space of that kind of, quote-unquote object, is free
19:43
vacuum space.
19:44
You could go straight through it if you could get down to
19:46
that scale.
19:47
This image of a helium atom, they say right here this is
19:50
one femtometer.
19:52
Right?
19:52
One femtometer.
19:57
This is the scale of the nucleus of a
20:00
helium atom, right?
20:01
One femtometer.
20:03
This is one angstrom, right?
20:04
And they say that equals 100,000 femtometers.
20:06
And just to get a sense of scale, one angstrom is 1 times
20:10
10 to the negative 10 meters, right?
20:13
So the atom is roughly on the scale of an angstrom.
20:15
In the case of helium, the nucleus is
20:17
even a smaller fraction.
20:18
It's 1/100,000.
20:20
So if you had-- let's say you had liquid helium, which you'd
20:23
have to get very cold to get.
20:25
If you're looking at that, most of it is free space.
20:27
If you're looking at an iron bar, the great, great, great,
20:30
great, great, great majority of it is free space.
20:33
And we're not even talking about, maybe there's some free
20:35
space inside the nucleus that we could talk
20:37
about in the future.
20:38
But to me, that just blows my mind that most things we look
20:41
at are not really solid.
20:44
They're really just empty space, but they look solid
20:47
because of the way light reflects on them or the forces
20:50
that repel us.
20:51
But there really isn't something to touch there.
20:55
That most of this right here is all free space.
20:57
I think I've said the word free space now, and I think
21:00
I'll leave further

0:00
My goal in this video and the next video
0:02
is to start giving a sense of the scale
0:06
of the earth and the solar system.
0:08
And as we see, as we start getting
0:09
into to the galaxy and the universe,
0:11
it just becomes almost impossible to imagine.
0:13
But we'll at least give our best shot.
0:16
So I think most of us watching this video
0:18
know that this right here is earth.
0:22
And just to get a sense of scale here,
0:24
I think probably the largest distance
0:27
that we can somehow relate to is about 100 miles.
0:29
You can get into a car for an hour, hour and a half,
0:32
and go about 100 miles.
0:33
And on the earth that would be about this far.
0:36
It would be a speck that would look something like that.
0:40
That is 100 miles.
0:42
And also to get us a bit of scale,
0:44
let's think about a speed that at least we
0:46
can kind of comprehend.
0:47
And that would be, maybe, the speed of a bullet.
0:56
Maybe we can't comprehend it, but I'll
0:58
say this is the fastest thing that we could maybe comprehend.
1:01
It goes about-- and there are different types of bullets
1:05
depending on the type of gun and all of that-- about 280 meters
1:09
per second, which is about 1,000 kilometers per hour.
1:18
And this is also roughly the speed of a jet.
1:27
So just to give a sense of scale here,
1:29
the earth's circumference-- so if you
1:33
were to go around the planet-- is about 40,000 kilometers.
1:47
So if you were to travel at the speed of a bullet
1:51
or the speed of a jetliner, at 1,000 kilometers an hour,
1:55
it would take you 40 hours to circumnavigate the earth.
2:06
And I think none of this information is too surprising.
2:09
You might have taken a 12- or 15-hour flight that
2:12
gets you-- not all the way around the earth--
2:14
but gets you pretty far.
2:15
San Francisco to Australia, or something like that.
2:18
So right now these aren't scales that are too crazy.
2:21
Although, even for me, the earth itself
2:24
is a pretty mind-blowingly large object.
2:27
Now, with that out of the way let's think about the sun.
2:30
Because the sun starts to approach something far huger.
2:34
So this obviously here is the sun.
2:36
And I think most people appreciate
2:38
that the sun is much larger than the earth,
2:42
and that it's pretty far away from the earth.
2:44
But I don't think most people, including myself,
2:47
fully appreciate how large the sun is
2:50
or how far it is away from the earth.
2:53
So just to give you a sense, the sun
2:58
is 109 times the circumference of the earth.
3:10
So if we do that same thought exercise there--
3:13
if we said, OK, if I'm traveling at the speed of a bullet
3:16
or the speed of a jetliner, it would take me 40 hours
3:19
to go around the earth.
3:20
Well, how long would it take to go around the sun?
3:23
So if you were to get on a jet plane
3:26
and try to go around the sun, or if you
3:27
were to somehow ride a bullet and try to go around
3:30
the sun-- do a complete circumnavigation of the sun--
3:34
it's going to take you 109 times as long
3:36
as it would have taken you to do the earth.
3:38
So it would be 100 times-- I could do 109,
3:42
but just for approximate-- it's roughly 100
3:44
times the circumference of the earth.
3:46
So 109 times 40 is equal to 4,000 hours.
3:53
And just to get a sense of what 4,000 is-- actually,
3:56
since I have the calculator out, let's do the exact calculation.
3:59
It's 109 times the circumference of the earth times 40 hours.
4:06
That's what it would take to do the circumference of the Earth.
4:09
So it's 4,360 hours to circumnavigate the sun, going
4:15
at the speed of a bullet or a jetliner.
4:17
And so that is-- 24 hours in the day-- that is 181 days.
4:23
It would take you roughly half a year
4:27
to go around the sun at the speed of a jetliner.
4:30
Let me write this down.
4:31
Half a year.
4:37
The sun is huge.
4:41
Now, that by itself may or may not be surprising--and actually
4:44
let me give you a sense of scale here,
4:45
because I have this other diagram of a sun.
4:49
And we'll talk more about the rest
4:51
of the solar system in the next video.
4:52
But over here, at this scale, the sun,
4:56
at least on my screen-- if I were to complete it,
4:58
it would probably be about 20 inches in diameter.
5:01
The earth is just this little thing over here, smaller
5:04
than a raindrop.
5:09
If I were to draw it on this scale, where the sun is even
5:11
smaller, the earth would be about that big.
5:17
Now, what isn't obvious, because we've all done our science
5:21
projects in third and fourth grade--or we always see these
5:24
diagrams of the solar system that look something like this--
5:27
is that these planets are way further away.
5:29
Even though these are depicted to scale,
5:33
they're way further away from the sun
5:35
than this makes it look.
5:38
So the earth is 150 million kilometers from the sun.
5:48
So if this is the sun right here, at this scale
5:55
you wouldn't even be able to see the earth.
5:57
It wouldn't even be a pixel.
5:59
But it would be 150 million kilometers from the earth.
6:13
And this distance right here is called an astronomical unit--
6:15
and we'll be using that term in the next few videos
6:18
just because it's an easier way to think about distance--
6:21
sometimes abbreviated AU, astronomical unit.
6:30
And just to give a sense of how far this is, light, which
6:34
is something that we think is almost infinitely fast
6:36
and that is something that looks instantaneous,
6:38
that takes eight minutes to travel from the sun
6:41
to the earth.
6:42
If the sun were to disappear, it would take eight minutes for us
6:47
to know that it disappeared on earth.
6:49
Or another way, just to put it in the sense of this jet
6:53
airplane-- let's get the calculator back out.
6:56
So we're talking about 150 million kilometers.
7:07
So if we're going at 1,000 kilometers an hour,
7:11
it would take us 150,000 hours at the speed of a bullet
7:15
or at the speed of a jet plane to get to the sun.
7:18
And just to put that in perspective,
7:20
if we want it in days, there's 24 hours per day.
7:25
So this would be 6,250 days.
7:28
Or, if we divided by 365, roughly 17 years.
7:33
If you were to shoot a bullet straight at the sun
7:35
it would take 17 years to get there,
7:38
if it could maintain its velocity somehow.
7:40
So this would take a bullet or a jet plane
7:42
17 years to get to the sun.
7:49
Or another way to visualize it-- this sun right over here,
7:52
on my screen it has about a five- or six-inch diameter.
7:56
If I were to actually do it at scale, this little dot
7:59
right here, which is the earth, this
8:02
speck-- I would have to put this back about 50 feet
8:09
away from the sun.
8:10
50 or 60 feet away from the sun.
8:12
If you were to look at the solar system--
8:14
and obviously there's other things in the solar system,
8:16
and we'll talk more about them in the next video--
8:18
you wouldn't even notice this speck.
8:19
This is a little dust thing flying around this sun.
8:23
And as we go further and further out of this solar system,
8:25
you're going to see even this distance starts
8:27
to become ridiculously small.
8:29
Or another way to think about it--
8:31
if the sun was about this size, then the earth at this scale
8:39
would be about 200 feet away from it.
8:42
So you could imagine, if you had a football field-- let
8:47
me draw a football field.
8:49
These are the end zones-- one end zone, another end zone.
8:52
And if you were to stick something--
8:53
maybe the size of a medicine ball,
8:55
a little bit bigger than a basketball, at one end zone--
8:58
this little speck would be about 60 yards away,
9:03
roughly 60 meters away.
9:04
So it's this little speck.
9:05
You wouldn't even notice it on the scale of a football
9:07
field, something this size.
9:09
Anyway, I'm going to leave you there.
9:10
Hopefully that just starts to blow your mind
9:13
when you think about the scale of the sun, the earth,
9:17
and how far the earth is away from the sun.
9:19
And then we're going to see even those distances, even
9:22
those scales, are super small when you start thinking
9:24
about the rest of the solar system.
9:27
And especially when we start going beyond the solar system.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,GZx3U0dbASg,
khan_video_eUF59jCFcyQ_137576,"So anywhere you go, you are standing in the center of the universe?",Essay,"•
0:00
Right now, the prevailing theory of how the universe came about
0:04
is commonly called the Big Bang theory.
0:11
And really is just this idea that the universe started
0:14
as kind of this infinitely small point, this infinitely
0:17
small singularity.
0:19
And then it just had a big bang or it just expanded
0:23
from that state to the universe that we know right now.
0:26
And when I first imagined this-- and I
0:28
think if it's also a byproduct of how it's named-- Big Bang,
0:31
you kind of imagine this type of explosion,
0:37
that everything was infinitely packed in together
0:40
and then it exploded.
0:42
And then it exploded outward.
0:44
And then as all of the matter exploded outward,
0:47
it started to condense.
0:48
And then you have these little galaxies
0:51
and super clusters of galaxies.
0:53
And they started to condense.
0:54
And then within them, planets condensed and stars condensed.
0:58
And then we have the type of universe
1:00
that we have right now.
1:01
But this model for visualizing the Big Bang
1:05
has a couple of problems.
1:06
One is when we talk about the Big Bang,
1:08
we're not talking about the matter, just the mass or just
1:12
the matter in the universe being in one point.
1:14
We're talking about actual space expanding.
1:18
So we're not just talking about something inside of space,
1:21
like the physical mass, the physical matter expanding.
1:23
We're talking about space itself.
1:25
And so when you have this type of model,
1:27
you have all of this stuff expanding.
1:29
But you're like, whoa, look, isn't it
1:30
expanding into something else?
1:32
Maybe if the furthest out parts of this matter
1:36
is right over here, what's this stuff over here?
1:40
And so you say, well, wouldn't that be space?
1:43
So how can you say space itself is expanding?
1:46
And another idea that a Big Bang also
1:49
implies is if this is the furthest stuff out there,
1:51
would this be the edge of the universe?
1:55
Does the universe have an edge?
1:58
And the answer to either of those questions,
2:00
and that's what we're going to try to tackle in this,
2:02
is that, one, the universe does not have an edge.
2:05
And two, there is no outside space.
2:09
We are not expanding into another space.
2:11
And I'm going to explain that.
2:12
Hopefully, we'll see why that is the case right now.
2:15
So the best way to view it-- and we're
2:16
going to view it by analogy.
2:19
If I were tell you that I have a two-dimensional space that
2:31
has a finite area, so it has a finite area--
2:37
so it's not infinite.
2:38
And it also has no edge.
2:43
This once again, when you first look at it, seems difficult.
2:47
How do I just construct something
2:49
that has a finite area, but still has no edge?
2:51
Every time I try to draw an area,
2:53
it looks like I have to have some edges.
2:55
And then you might remember, what
2:57
if that two-dimensional space is curved, what happens?
3:00
And I think the easiest example of that
3:02
is the surface of a sphere.
3:06
Let me draw a sphere over here.
3:09
So this right here is a sphere.
3:11
Let me draw some longitude and latitudinal
3:16
lines on this sphere.
3:18
On this sphere, all of a sudden-- and I'll
3:20
shade it in a little bit, make it
3:21
look nice-- this type of a sphere, you have a finite area.
3:25
You could imagine the surface of a balloon,
3:27
or the surface of a bubble, or the surface of the Earth.
3:30
You have a finite area, but you have no edge.
3:33
If you keep going forever in one direction,
3:39
you're going to go all the way around and come back
3:42
to the other side.
3:44
Now, to imagine a three-dimensional space
3:47
that has these same properties, a finite area
3:50
and-- and I don't want to say finite area anymore,
3:52
because we're not talking about a three-dimensional space.
3:55
Let me draw it over here.
3:56
So let's think about a three-dimensional space, so
4:00
a three-dimensional space.
4:07
Instead of area, since we're in three dimensions now,
4:10
I want to talk about a finite volume and no edge.
4:20
How do I do that?
4:21
And when you think about it superficially,
4:23
well, look, if I have a finite volume,
4:25
maybe it'll be contained in some type of a cube.
4:29
And then we clearly have edges in those situations.
4:32
Or you could even think about a finite volume
4:34
as being the inside of a sphere.
4:36
And that clearly has an edge, this entire surface over there.
4:39
So how do you construct a three-dimensional space
4:41
that has a finite volume and no edge?
4:43
And that I'm going to tell you right now,
4:45
it's very hard for us to visualize it.
4:48
But in order to visualize it, I'm
4:49
essentially going to draw the same thing
4:51
as I drew right here.
4:52
What you have to imagine, and you almost
4:54
have to imagine it by analogy, unless you
4:56
have some type of a profound brain wired
4:59
for more than three spatial dimensions, is a sphere.
5:06
So let me make it clear.
5:08
This is a two-dimensional surface.
5:15
On the surface of the sphere, you
5:17
can only move into directions, two perpendicular directions.
5:20
You could move like that or you could move like that.
5:23
You could move left and right or you could move up and down.
5:25
So it's a two-dimensional surface
5:29
of a three-dimensional sphere.
5:35
So if we take it by analogy, let's imagine,
5:38
and it's hard to imagine, a three-dimensional surface.
5:45
And you can do it mathematically.
5:46
The math here is actually not that difficult.
5:48
It's a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere.
6:00
And I'm going to draw it the same way.
6:02
So if we kind of view those three dimensions
6:04
are just these two dimensions of the surface, the same thing.
6:07
It's the same thing.
6:09
And if you imagine that-- I'm not
6:10
saying that this is actually the shape of the universe.
6:12
We don't know the actual shape.
6:15
But we do know that it does have a slight curvature.
6:17
We don't know the actual shape, but a sphere is the simplest.
6:20
There's other ones we could do.
6:22
A toroid would also fit the bill of having a finite volume
6:25
with no edge.
6:26
And another thing, I want to make it clear,
6:28
we actually don't even know whether it
6:29
has just a finite volume.
6:31
That's still an open question.
6:32
But what I want to do is show you
6:34
that it can have a finite volume and also have no edge.
6:38
And most people believe-- and I want to say ""believe"" here
6:43
because we can just go based on evidence and all
6:45
that-- that we are talking about something with a finite volume,
6:49
especially when you talk about the Big Bang theory.
6:52
That kind of, on some dimension, implies a finite volume,
6:56
although it could be a super large, unfathomably large
6:59
volume, it is finite.
7:01
Now, if you have this, let's imagine this sphere.
7:05
Let's imagine this sphere.
7:06
Once again, if you're on this surface
7:09
of this four-dimensional sphere--
7:11
I obviously can not draw a four-dimensional sphere.
7:14
But if you're on the surface of this four-dimensional sphere,
7:17
if you go in any direction, you'll come back out
7:20
and come back to where you started.
7:22
If you go that way, you'll come back around here.
7:25
Now, the universe is super huge.
7:26
So even light, maybe light itself
7:29
will take an unbelievable amount of time to traverse it.
7:32
And if this sphere itself is expanding,
7:35
it might be expanding so fast that light might not ever
7:39
be able to come back around it.
7:40
But in theory, if something were fast enough,
7:42
if something were to keep going around,
7:44
it could eventually go back to this point.
7:47
Now, when we talk about a three-dimensional surface--
7:50
it's a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere--
7:53
that means that any of the three dimensions-- over here,
7:56
on the surface, I can only draw two.
7:57
But that means if this is true, if the universe is
8:01
a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere, that
8:06
means that if you go up and you just keep going up,
8:09
you'll eventually come back from the bottom.
8:12
So if you keep going all the way up,
8:16
you'll eventually come back to the point that you were.
8:18
It might be an unbelievably large distance,
8:20
but you'll eventually get back where you were.
8:23
If you go to the right, you'll eventually
8:25
come back all the way around to the point where you were.
8:28
And if you were to go into the page--
8:29
so if you were to go into the page--
8:31
let me draw it that way-- if you go into the page,
8:33
you would eventually come back from above the page
8:36
and come back to the point that you are.
8:38
So that's what this implication would be.
8:41
That you would eventually get back to where you are.
8:43
So let's go back to the question of an expanding universe,
8:46
a expanding universe that's not expanding into any other space.
8:50
That is all of the space, but it's still expanding.
8:53
Well, this is the model.
8:54
So you could imagine shortly after the Big Bang,
8:57
our four-dimensional sphere looked like this.
9:01
Maybe it was a little small four-dimensional sphere.
9:05
Maybe right at the Big Bang, it was
9:07
like this little unbelievably small sphere.
9:09
Then a little bit later, it's this larger sphere.
9:12
Let me just shade it in to show you
9:15
that it's kind of popping out of the page, that's it's a sphere.
9:18
And then at a later time, the sphere might look like this.
9:21
The sphere might look like this.
9:25
Now, your temptation might be to say, wait,
9:28
Sal, isn't this stuff outside of this sphere,
9:31
isn't that some type of a space that it's expanding into?
9:34
Isn't that somehow part of the universe?
9:37
And I would say if you're talking in three dimensions,
9:40
no, it's not.
9:41
The entire universe is this surface.
9:44
It is this surface of this four-dimensional sphere.
9:47
If you start talking about more dimensions,
9:49
then, yes, you could talk about maybe things outside
9:52
of our three-dimensional universe.
9:56
So as this expands in space/time--
9:59
so one way to view the fourth dimension
10:01
is it is time itself-- things are just
10:03
getting further and further apart.
10:05
And I'll talk about more evidence in future videos
10:07
for why the Big Bang is the best theory we have out there right
10:11
now.
10:12
But as you could imagine, if you have
10:14
two points on this sphere that are that far apart,
10:17
as this sphere expands, this four-dimensional sphere, as
10:20
this bubble blows up or this balloon blows up,
10:23
those two points are just-- let me draw three points.
10:25
Let's say those are three points.
10:26
Those three points are just going
10:28
to get further and further apart.
10:30
And that's actually one of the main points that-- or one
10:35
of the first reasons why it made sense to believe the Big Bang--
10:37
is that everything is expanding, not from some central point.
10:40
But everything is expanding from everything.
10:43
That if you go in any direction from any point in the universe,
10:46
everything else is expanding away.
10:47
And the further away you go, it looks
10:48
like the faster it's expanding away from you.
10:52
So I'll leave you there, something for you
10:53
to kind of think about a little bit.
10:55
And then we'll build on some of this
10:57
to think about what it means to kind of observe
11:00
the observable universe.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,eUF59jCFcyQ,
khan_video_xaz5ftvZCyI_202859,"So let me get this straight, CD-4 t-cells (t-helper cells) can get attached to MHC II on phagocytes,but they can't get attached to MHC II on B-cells?",Essay,"•
0:00
Now that we've touched on all of the major players in the
0:02
specific immune system, what I thought I would do in this
0:05
video is do a summary so it all fits
0:08
together a little bit.
0:09
So the first person or character we got exposed to
0:12
was the B cell, which I always do in blue.
0:18
And what made that interesting is that every B cell has its
0:22
own specific-- or they have membrane bound antibodies, but
0:28
for each B cell, the membrane bound antibodies on each
0:33
specific B cell had its own variable portion.
0:36
So this B cell-- it'll be variable right like that.
0:41
And if I were to draw another B cell right here, I would
0:45
draw the variable portion a little bit different.
0:47
This is why different actual B cells will respond to
0:51
different antigens or different pathogens that have
0:54
entered our system.
0:55
And a B cell gets activated-- let's talk about what happens
1:05
when it gets activated or what needs to happen.
1:10
It needs binding of the pathogen onto one of these
1:15
membrane bound antibodies.
1:28
But that's not all.
1:29
I mean, sometimes that's all you need, but usually you also
1:33
need to be stimulated by a T cell.
1:41
And you might say, where's the helper T cell
1:44
stimulate this guy?
1:46
Well, B cells were also antigen presenting cells so
1:49
he'll suck this guy in, break him out, and present him on an
1:53
MHC II complex.
2:00
Let's say this is an MHC II complex.
2:03
This guy gets cut up, part of him gets presented right here,
2:06
and then an activated helper T cell whose variable portion of
2:12
their T cell receptor is specific to this could come
2:15
along and activate this character.
2:20
I'm not drawing that receptor well, but that right there is
2:24
a helper T cell and that is the B cell.
2:28
Now, once it's activated, it starts differentiating-- and
2:33
it starts cloning itself and it can either turn into
2:35
effector cells-- and this true of B cells or T cells.
2:41
Once they get activated, they keep cloning or they either
2:43
turn into effector cells or memory cells.
2:46
Memory cells stick around a lot longer so that in the
2:49
future you're going to have many more of this
2:51
version of B cells.
2:52
So if you get the same antigen or pathogen in the future, the
2:56
likelihood of it bumping into this type of B cell is going
2:59
to be higher so the response will occur faster.
3:02
The effector B cells produce-- they essentially turn into
3:10
antibody making machines.
3:12
So they'll say, gee, this antibody bonds to this antigen
3:16
that we have in the system now.
3:18
Let me just produce a ton of them.
3:20
So it starts building up all of the cellular machinery and
3:23
it starts producing antibodies like crazy.
3:26
I want to point out one thing that my wife pointed out to me
3:29
when I was-- she overheard me making the last video and
3:32
she's a fellow in hematology and a lot of hematology is
3:35
immunology.
3:36
So I definitely have to defer to her.
3:38
She is the expert on this.
3:41
In the last video, I kind of very hand-wavingly said, B
3:45
cells, once they get activated, if they're the
3:47
effector B cells, they produce antibodies.
3:49
I want to be very clear.
3:50
It is only the effector B cells that produce the
3:52
antibodies and the common term for them-- if someone were to
3:57
walk up to you and say, what cells in the body are
4:01
producing antibodies?
4:02
You wouldn't be wrong if you said effector B cells, but the
4:05
common term that people expect to hear are plasma cells.
4:12
Plasma cells and effector B cells are the same thing, but
4:16
normally when they say, what happens to a B cell when it
4:18
starts producing antibodies?
4:20
They then call it a plasma cell.
4:21
They don't call it a B cell anymore and I want to make
4:23
that very clear because my wife's like, well, I have
4:24
attendings that if they asked me, what cell in the body
4:28
produces antibodies?
4:29
And if you said, B cell, they would say, no, wrong.
4:32
It's a plasma cell-- or if you said effector B cell, they
4:34
wouldn't be happy.
4:35
They wanted to hear plasma cell.
4:36
This is the common term used in immunology and apparently
4:44
rheumatology circles.
4:45
Did I just say my wife is a hematologist?
4:47
No, no.
4:47
She's studying rheumatology.
4:48
I get confused with all the tologies sometimes.
4:51
Anyway, that's what the B cells do.
4:52
And these antibodies can then go attach things and mess up
4:55
viruses and antigen-- well, viruses or instances of
4:58
antigens and bacteria-- and tag them for pick up by
5:02
macrophages or other types of phagocytes.
5:04
Those were the B cells.
5:06
Then you have your T cells.
5:09
And here I'm going to talk about T cells a little bit
5:11
differently than I had in the last few videos.
5:14
Just to give a little bit more of a nuance-- so there's two
5:18
types of T cells.
5:19
You'll say, hey, they are helper T cells and cytotoxic T
5:21
cells-- and you're not wrong, but what I'm going to do is do
5:24
a slightly different differentiation just so that
5:28
you are familiar with these terms. So there's
5:30
two types of T cells.
5:33
All T cells have T cell receptors.
5:44
But they also have these other proteins on them and some of
5:50
them have these proteins called-- CD4 proteins and some
5:58
of them have what's called CD8.
6:09
So this one right here would be called a
6:11
CD8 positive T cell.
6:15
It has the CD8 proteins on it.
6:18
And this would be called a CD4 positive T cell.
6:23
I've never used these words before.
6:25
You're like, gee, where are these coming from?
6:27
Now, the CD4 receptor is the thing that wants to bind--
6:32
this is the thing that helps to go to the MHC II complexes.
6:38
So most CD4 T cells are helper T cells.
6:45
Most of the time-- and I want to make it very clear--
6:47
immunology is a very-- I mean, this field, people are
6:49
discovering things on a regular basis.
6:51
So people are still understanding these things and
6:53
there's all sorts of special cases, but usually when people
6:57
talk about CD4 positive T cells, they're talking about
7:00
helper T cells.
7:02
So this is normally going to be a helper T cell-- or you
7:07
could call it T helper, just like that.
7:10
Likewise, the CD8 proteins, these are attracted
7:13
to the MHC I complex.
7:21
This is what brings them to the cells that have the
7:24
cancer, that have expressed antigens
7:26
on their MHC I complex.
7:28
So most of the time CD8
7:30
positive T cells are cytotoxic.
7:39
And oftentimes, before a cell gets activated, they just
7:42
describe it as a CD4 T cell or a CD8 cell and after it
7:45
becomes activated and starts wanting to kill things, then
7:53
maybe you call it cytotoxic.
7:54
But this is all wordplay.
7:56
I think you get the general idea.
7:58
But just to remember what they do, this guy-- we just said he
8:04
wants to bond to the MHC complex, so you have MHC
8:08
complex plus presenting some antigen.
8:13
This is MHC I right here.
8:15
We learned in the last video, every nucleated cell in the
8:19
body expresses an MHC I complex.
8:22
So this is the case where something wacky is happening
8:25
inside this cell.
8:26
Maybe a virus has infected it.
8:28
Maybe it's cancerous.
8:30
It needs to die, otherwise it's going to keep producing
8:34
viruses if it's infected by a virus, or otherwise it's going
8:37
to keep dividing if it's a cancer and infect
8:39
the rest of the body.
8:40
So the CD8 kills infected cells.
8:45
I'll just say bad cells because I don't if you can--
8:48
cancer really isn't an infection.
8:50
Kills bad cells-- cells that are-- if you don't kill them,
8:53
they're going to keep producing viruses or keep
8:54
splitting and spreading the cancer, while T cells--
9:00
they're attracted to professional antigen
9:03
presenting cells.
9:04
And I always do a dendritic cell right here because those
9:06
are the best antigen presenting cells.
9:09
And they have MHC II complexes and it's digested some antigen
9:16
and it presents it right there and then that activates the
9:21
helper T cell.
9:22
And then when the helper T cell-- all of these guys, once
9:26
they're activated, they all go into effector-- they all start
9:31
differentiating into effector and memory cells.
9:35
An effector helper T cell does a couple of things.
9:40
So if we're talking about a helper T cell, it can activate
9:46
B cells and it also releases cytokines.
9:51
Let's say this guy gets activated.
9:53
He'll also start releasing these chemicals, which are
9:56
really those alarm bells that tell other people to really
10:00
get in gear-- maybe B cells and cytotoxic T cells start
10:03
proliferating more rigorously.
10:05
Actually, part of the cytotoxic T cell activation
10:10
can be assisted or kind of given a boost by these
10:14
cytokines-- of so by these alarm bells.
10:17
So this guy's the alarm ringer, while the CD8 cells or
10:24
the cytotoxic T cells-- in their effector
10:27
mode, they kill cells.
10:31
And of course in the memory mode, there's just a bunch of
10:33
copies of these originals around that are ready and more
10:36
than they were originally were, so that in the future if
10:39
something like this or something like this occurs,
10:41
they're going to be activated faster because they're going
10:43
to be bumped into faster.
10:45
So hopefully that clears up a little bit and I introduced a
10:47
little bit more tough terminology, but I really want
10:48
to stress my wife's point because she said, hey, you
10:50
don't want people out there saying B cells produce
10:53
antibodies even though it is effector B cells-- activated B
10:57
cells that have differentiated into effector B cells.
10:59
Those are what are producing antibodies-- because when they
11:01
go to medical school, people are going to want to hear
11:03

khan_video_6nVysrZQnOQ_25793,"In another billion years, the size and scope of the observable universe will have expanded, right?",Essay,"•
0:00
Right now, the best estimate of when the Big Bang occurred--
0:05
and once again, I don't like the term that much because it
0:08
kind of implies some type of explosion.
0:10
But what it really is is kind of an expansion
0:12
of space, when space started to really start
0:14
to expand from a singularity.
0:16
But our best estimate of when this occurred
0:18
is 13.7 billion years ago.
0:24
And even though we're used to dealing with numbers
0:26
in the billions, especially when we
0:28
talk about large amounts of money and what not,
0:30
this is an unbelievable amount of time.
0:32
It seems like something that is tractable, but it really isn't.
0:35
And in future videos, I'm actually
0:37
going to talk about the time scale.
0:39
So we can really appreciate how long,
0:41
or even start to appreciate, or appreciate
0:43
that we can't appreciate how long 13.7 billion years is.
0:47
And I also want to emphasize that this is the current best
0:51
estimate.
0:52
Even in my lifetime, even in my lifetime that I actually
0:54
knew about the Big Bang and that I would pay attention
0:57
to what the best estimate was, this number's
0:59
been moving around.
1:00
So I suspect that in the future, this number
1:02
might become more accurate or might move around some.
1:04
But this is our best guess.
1:06
Now with that said, I want to think about what this tells us
1:08
about the size of the observable universe.
1:17
So if all of the expansion started 13.7 billion years ago,
1:22
that 13.7 billion years ago, everything
1:25
we know in our three-dimensional universe
1:28
was in a single point, the longest
1:31
that any photon of light could be traveling that's reaching us
1:34
right now-- so let's say that that is my eye right over here.
1:39
That's my eyelashes, just like that-- so some photon of light
1:45
is just to getting to my eye or maybe it's
1:47
just getting to the lens of a telescope.
1:50
The longest that that could have been traveling
1:52
is 13.7 billion years.
1:55
So it could be traveling 13.7 billion years.
2:07
So when we looked at that depiction--
2:09
this I think was two or three videos ago,
2:11
of the observable universe-- I drew, it was this circle.
2:18
And when we see light coming from these remote objects--
2:21
that light is getting to us right here.
2:23
This is where we are.
2:24
This is where I guess in the depiction
2:27
the remote object was.
2:28
But the light from that remote object
2:30
is just now getting to us.
2:32
And that light took 13.7 billion years to get to us.
2:43
Now, what I'm going to hesitate to do,
2:45
because we're talking over such large distances
2:48
and we're talking on such large time scales and time scales
2:51
over which space itself is expanding--
2:55
we're going to see in this video that you cannot say that this
2:59
object over here, this is not necessarily, this is NOT,
3:03
I'll put it in caps, this is NOT 13.7 billion light years away.
3:13
If we were talking about smaller time scales
3:15
or I guess smaller distances, you
3:18
could say approximately that.
3:20
The expansion of the universe itself would not make as much
3:23
of a difference.
3:24
And let me make it even more clear.
3:26
I'm talking about an object over there.
3:28
But we could even talk about that coordinate in space.
3:33
And actually, I should say that coordinate in space-time,
3:35
because we're viewing it at a certain instant as well.
3:37
But that coordinate is not 13.7 billion light years away
3:43
from our current coordinate.
3:44
And there's a couple of reasons to think about it.
3:46
First of all, think about it, that light
3:48
was emitted 13.7 billion years ago.
3:51
When that light was emitted, we were
3:53
much closer to that coordinate.
3:55
This coordinate was much closer to that.
3:57
Where we are in the universe right now
3:59
was much closer to that point in the universe.
4:01
The other thing to think about is
4:04
as this-- let me actually draw it.
4:06
So let's go 300,000 years after that initial expansion
4:16
of that singularity.
4:17
So we're just 300,000 years into the universe's history
4:21
right now.
4:22
So this is roughly 300,000 years into the universe's life.
4:30
I guess we could view it that way.
4:33
And first of all, at that point things haven't differentiated
4:37
in a meaningful way yet right now.
4:39
And we'll talk more about this when
4:40
we talk about the cosmic microwave background radiation.
4:43
But at this point in the universe,
4:45
it was kind of this almost uniform white-hot plasma
4:49
of hydrogen.
4:50
And then we're going to talk about it.
4:51
It was emitting microwave radiation.
4:53
And we'll talk more about that in a future video.
4:55
But let's just think about two points in this early universe.
5:01
So in this early universe, let's say you have that point.
5:03
And let's say you have the coordinate where we are right
5:05
now.
5:06
You have the coordinate where we are right now.
5:10
And in fact, I'll just make that roughly-- I won't make it
5:12
the center just because I think it makes it easier
5:14
to visualize if it's not the center.
5:15
And let's say at that very early stage in the universe,
5:19
if you were able to just take some rulers instantaneously
5:22
and measure that, you would measure this distance
5:26
to be 30 million light years.
5:36
And let's just say right at that point,
5:38
this object over here-- I'll do it in magenta--
5:40
this object over here emits a photon, maybe
5:43
in the microwave frequency range.
5:45
And we'll see that that was the range that it was emitting in.
5:48
But it emits a photon.
5:50
And that photon is traveling at the speed of light.
5:52
It is light.
5:53
And so that photon, says, you know what, I only
5:55
got 30 million light years to travel.
5:56
That's not too bad.
5:57
I'm going to get there in 30 million years.
6:00
And I'm going to do it discrete.
6:01
The math is more complicated than what I'm doing here.
6:04
But I really just want to give you
6:05
the idea of what's going on here.
6:07
So let's just say, well, that photon
6:09
says in about 10 million years, in roughly 10 million years,
6:13
I should be right about at that coordinate.
6:18
I should be about one third of the distance.
6:20
But what happens over the course of those 10 million years?
6:26
Well, over the course of those 10 million years,
6:28
the universe has expanded some.
6:30
The universe has expanded maybe a good deal.
6:32
So let me draw the expanded universe.
6:35
So after 10 million years, the universe might look like this.
6:40
Actually it might even be bigger than that.
6:42
Let me draw it like this.
6:44
After 10 million years, the universe
6:47
might have expanded a good bit.
6:49
So this is 10 million years into the future.
6:53
Still on a cosmological time scale, still almost at kind
6:58
of the infancy of the universe because we're
7:00
talking about 13.7 billion years.
7:02
So let's say 10 million years.
7:04
10 million years go by.
7:07
The universe has expanded.
7:09
This coordinate, where we're sitting today
7:10
at the present time, is now all the way over here.
7:15
That coordinate where the photon was originally emitted
7:19
is now going to be sitting right over here.
7:24
And that photon, it said, OK, after 10 million light years,
7:26
I'm going to get over there.
7:28
And I'm approximating.
7:29
I'm doing it in a very discrete way.
7:30
But I really just want to give you the idea.
7:32
So that coordinate, where the photon roughly
7:35
gets in 10 million light years, is about right over here.
7:38
The whole universe has expanded.
7:39
All the coordinates have gotten further away from each other.
7:42
Now, what just happened here?
7:44
The universe has expanded.
7:45
This distance that was 30 million light years now--
7:49
and I'm just making rough numbers here.
7:52
I don't know the actual numbers here.
7:53
Now, it is actually-- this is really just
7:55
for the sake of giving you the idea of why-- well, giving you
8:01
the intuition of what's going on.
8:03
This distance now is no longer 30 million light years.
8:08
Maybe it's 100 million.
8:10
So this is now 100 million light years away from each other.
8:16
The universe is expanding.
8:17
These coordinates, the space is actually spreading out.
8:20
You could imagine it's kind of a trampoline
8:22
or the surface of a balloon.
8:23
It's getting stretched thin.
8:25
And so this coordinate where the light happens
8:27
to be after 10 million years, it has
8:29
been traveling for 10 million years,
8:32
but it's gone a much larger distance.
8:37
That distance now might be on the order of-- maybe
8:40
it's on the order of 30 million light years.
8:42
And the math isn't exact here.
8:44
I haven't done the math to figure it out.
8:47
So it's done 30 million light years.
8:50
And actually I shouldn't even make it the same proportion.
8:53
Because the distance it's gone and the distance it has to go,
8:56
because of the stretching, it's not
8:58
going to be completely linear.
8:59
At least when I'm thinking about it in my head, it shouldn't be,
9:02
I think.
9:02
But I'm going to make a hard statement about that.
9:06
But the distance that it reversed, maybe this distance
9:10
right here is now 20 million light years
9:15
because it got there.
9:16
Every time it moved some distance, the space that it
9:20
had traversed is now stretched.
9:23
So even though its traveled for 10 million years,
9:27
the space that it traversed is no longer
9:29
just 10 million light years.
9:31
It's now stretched to 20 million light years.
9:34
And the space that it has left to traverse
9:35
is no longer only 20 million light years.
9:38
It might now be 80 million light years.
9:41
It is now 80 million light years.
9:44
And so this photon might be getting frustrated.
9:47
There's an optimistic way of viewing it.
9:48
It is like, wow, I was able to cover
9:50
20 million light years in only 10 million years.
9:53
It looks like I'm moving faster than the speed of light.
9:55
The reality is it's not because the space coordinates
9:58
themselves are spreading out.
10:00
Those are getting thin.
10:01
So the photon is just moving at the speed of light.
10:04
But the distance that it actually
10:05
traversed in 10 million years is more than 10 million
10:10
light years.
10:10
It's 20 million light years.
10:12
So you can't just multiply a rate times time
10:15
on these cosmological scales, especially when the coordinates
10:19
themselves, the distance coordinates are actually
10:23
moving away from each other.
10:24
But I think you see, or maybe you might see,
10:27
where this is going.
10:29
OK, this photon says, oh, in another-- let me write this.
10:33
This is 80 million light years-- in another 40 million
10:35
light years, maybe I'm going to get over here.
10:40
But the reality is over that next 40 million light years--
10:43
sorry, in 40 million years, I might get right over here,
10:47
because this is 80 million light years.
10:49
But the reality is after 40 million years--
10:52
so another 40 million years go by-- now, all of a sudden,
10:56
the universe has expanded even more.
10:59
I won't even draw the whole bubble.
11:01
But the place where the photon was emitted from
11:04
might be over here.
11:07
And now our current position is over here.
11:11
Where the light got after 10 million years is now over here.
11:18
And now, where the light is after 40 million years,
11:24
maybe it's over here.
11:27
So now this distance, the distance
11:29
between these two points, when we started,
11:32
it was 10 million light years.
11:33
Then it became 20 million light years.
11:36
Maybe now, it's on the order of-- I don't know-- maybe it's
11:39
a billion light years.
11:41
Maybe now it's a billion light years.
11:43
And maybe this distance over here-- and I'm
11:45
just making up these numbers.
11:46
In fact, that's probably be too big for that point-- maybe this
11:49
is now 100 million light years.
11:52
This is now 100 million light years.
11:55
And now, maybe this distance right
11:59
here is-- I don't know-- 500 million light years.
12:01
And maybe now the total distance between the two points
12:04
is a billion light years.
12:05
So as you can see, the photon might getting frustrated.
12:08
As it covers more and more distance,
12:10
it looks back and says, wow, in only 50 million years,
12:13
I've been able to cover 600 million light years.
12:16
That's pretty good.
12:16
But it's frustrated because what it thought
12:18
was it only had to cover 30 million light years
12:22
in distance.
12:23
That keeps stretching out because space
12:25
itself is stretching.
12:26
So the reality, just going to the original idea,
12:32
this photon that is just reaching us,
12:36
that's been traveling for-- let's say
12:38
it's been traveling for 13.4 billion years.
12:41
So it's reaching us is just now.
12:43
So let me just fast forward 13.4 billion years
12:46
from this point now to get to the present day.
12:49
So if I draw the whole visible universe right over here,
12:54
this point right over here is going
12:56
to be-- where it was emitted from is right over there.
13:00
We are sitting right over there.
13:04
And actually, let me make something clear.
13:06
If I'm drawing the whole observable universe,
13:08
the center actually should be where we are.
13:10
Because we can observe an equal distance.
13:12
If things aren't really strange, we
13:14
can observe an equal distance in any direction.
13:16
So actually maybe we should put us at the center.
13:19
So if this was the entire observable universe,
13:21
and the photon was emitted from here 13.4 billion years ago--
13:26
so 300,000 years after that initial Big Bang,
13:29
and it's just getting to us, it is true
13:35
that the photon has been traveling
13:41
for 13.7 billion years.
13:47
But what's kind of nutty about it is this object, since we've
13:50
been expanding away from each other, this object is now,
13:53
in our best estimates, this object
13:56
is going to be about 46 billion light years away from us.
14:08
And I want to make it very clear.
14:10
This object is now 46 billion light years away from us.
14:13
When we just use light to observe it, it looks like,
14:16
just based on light years, hey, this light
14:18
has been traveling 13.7 billion years to reach us.
14:21
That's our only way of kind with light
14:22
to kind of think about the distance.
14:24
So maybe it's 13.4 or whatever-- I
14:27
keep changing the decimal-- but 13.4 billion light years away.
14:31
But the reality is if you had a ruler today, light year rulers,
14:36
this space here has stretched so much
14:38
that this is now 46 billion light years.
14:41
And just to give you a hint of when
14:43
we talk about the cosmic microwave background
14:45
radiation, what will this point in space
14:47
look like, this thing that's actually
14:49
46 billion light years away, but the photon only
14:52
took 13.7 billion years to reach us?
14:54
What will this look like?
14:56
Well, when we say look like, it's
14:59
based on the photons that are reaching us right now.
15:02
Those photons left 13.4 billion years ago.
15:05
So those photons are the photons being
15:07
emitted from this primitive structure,
15:10
from this white-hot haze of hydrogen plasma.
15:16
So what we're going to see is this white-hot haze.
15:19
So we're going to see this kind of white-hot plasma, white hot,
15:26
undifferentiated not differentiated
15:28
into proper stable atoms, much less stars and galaxies,
15:32
but white hot.
15:33
We're going to see this white-hot plasma.
15:36
The reality today is that point in space
15:38
that's 46 billion years from now,
15:40
it's probably differentiated into stable atoms, and stars,
15:45
and planets, and galaxies.
15:46
And frankly, if that person, that person,
15:49
if there is a civilization there right now
15:51
and if they're sitting right there, and they're observing
15:52
photons being emitted from our coordinate,
15:54
from our point in space right now,
15:56
they're not going to see us.
15:57
They're going to see us 13.4 billion years ago.
16:01
They're going to see the super primitive state
16:05
of our region of space when it really
16:07
was just a white-hot plasma.
16:09
And we're going to talk more about this in the next video.
16:11
But think about it.
16:12
Any photon that's coming from that period in time,
16:15
so from any direction, that's been traveling
16:17
for 13.4 billion years from any direction,
16:21
it's going to come from that primitive state
16:23
or it would have been emitted when the universe was
16:27
in that primitive state, when it was just
16:29
that white-hot plasma, this undifferentiated mass.
16:32
And hopefully, that will give you
16:33
a sense of where the cosmic microwave background

Voiceover: The purpose of the immune system
0:03
is to fight things.
0:05
To fight bacteria and viruses and other things
0:07
that you don't want in your body.
0:10
That's what it does.
0:11
The question we can ask is
0:12
how does the immune system know not
0:14
to attack your own body,
0:16
and that might seem like a strange question
0:18
or an obvious question
0:19
but it's actually not obvious the answer to it.
0:23
In this video we're gonna go into why it's not obvious
0:26
and then how the body actually
0:28
does prevent its immune system from attacking itself.
0:31
Another way of saying is this
0:33
how does the body distinguish self versus non-self?
0:39
By that we mean how does it tell the difference
0:41
between your own body, your own proteins,
0:44
your own cells
0:45
and foreign proteins or cells
0:48
or things that shouldn't be in your body.
0:50
How does it know to attack these
0:52
and not to attack this.
0:54
To find out why the question itself is not obvious
0:57
let's go back to B cells and talk about B cells.
1:01
Here we have a B cell
1:02
and here is its nucleus with some DNA
1:04
and the most important part of the B cell
1:07
that we care most about is its B cell receptor
1:11
which later if it becomes active
1:13
can be released as an antibody.
1:17
Now this B cell receptor is what's gonna bind
1:19
to foreign, pieces of foreign bacteria or viruses
1:23
and these antibodies are gonna bind to those things
1:25
and help your body get rid of them.
1:28
The important thing to remember about B cells
1:30
is that these antibodies
1:31
or these B cell receptors are coded
1:33
in the DNA of the B cell,
1:35
but that they're different for every B cell.
1:38
Every B cell has a unique set of antibodies
1:42
and B cell receptors that it makes.
1:45
We'll give them slightly different colors
1:47
to make that obvious.
1:48
Here's one with slightly different DNA
1:50
and a slightly different B cell receptor.
1:53
The really critical point to remember
1:54
is that these B cell receptors that will become antibodies
1:58
are generated at random.
2:00
Your body kind of shuffles the DNA here
2:03
and creates a unique B cell receptor
2:05
and antibody for each B cell.
2:08
It's precisely that fact
2:10
which is that they're created at random
2:12
which means that your body is in danger of creating
2:15
B cell receptors and antibodies
2:17
that can react to your own body
2:19
because while this guy might be good,
2:21
while he might react to let's say
2:23
a bacteria out here that you want to get rid of,
2:26
while that's good.
2:28
This guy might easily create a B cell receptor
2:31
and later an antibody that can react
2:33
to something you don't want it to react to.
2:35
For example, let's say this is
2:37
an important protein in your body
2:39
maybe it's insulin.
2:41
You would not want a B cell to be created
2:43
which will react to insulin
2:45
because then maybe it will start creating antibodies
2:47
that bind all the insulin in your blood
2:50
and if you don't know what insulin does
2:51
don't worry about it but by binding to insulin
2:53
it will prevent insulin from doing its function
2:55
which is very important.
2:58
How can you keep your body from making B cells
3:00
that would react to yourself?
3:04
In fact there's no way to do it
3:06
because as I said,
3:07
this process of creating different
3:10
B cell receptors and antibodies is totally random.
3:12
There's no way to keep your body
3:14
from making B cell receptors
3:16
or B cells that will react to yourself.
3:19
What does that mean?
3:20
That means that you're gonna make them
3:21
but you need to find a way to figure out
3:23
which ones are reacting to you
3:25
and to get rid of them.
3:26
You need to figure out a way
3:27
to kill the ones you don't want.
3:30
By the way we're talking about B cells here.
3:33
B cells.
3:34
Everything we're saying is equally applicable to T cells.
3:38
Let me draw one here.
3:40
T cells it's equally applicable
3:42
because T cells also have a T cell receptor
3:45
that's generated at random
3:46
and you only want that T cell receptor
3:48
to react to foreign things.
3:50
To non-self things and not to self things.
3:55
The processes we're gonna talk about are
3:56
equally true, maybe even in some cases
3:58
more so true for T cells and B cells.
4:01
Let's go to the bone marrow
4:03
to figure out how this process works,
4:05
and we're going to the bone marrow
4:07
because that's where B cells come from.
4:09
It's where they get their unique antibody,
4:12
your B cell receptor.
4:14
They get that by changing their DNA
4:16
a tiny little bit by shuffling pieces around.
4:18
Let's look at a couple of these B cells
4:20
which are still young.
4:22
They haven't yet been allowed out of the bone marrow.
4:24
They haven't been vetted
4:25
to see if they should be allowed out.
4:28
Each one has its unique receptor.
4:31
Let's draw a few of those receptors here.
4:34
Let's say that one of these guys reacts to self.
4:39
One of them reacts to some protein in your own body
4:42
that you don't want it to.
4:44
Again, that just happened at random
4:46
because you're creating these receptors
4:47
really at random.
4:49
Let's say that the guy
4:51
that we're gonna want to get rid of this one
4:53
because he reacts to let's say it's insulin again
4:55
like up there.
4:56
Really we should have drawn insulin in yellow
4:59
to show that it goes with this receptor.
5:02
Let's say this guy reacts to insulin.
5:04
How can you figure out that this guy reacts to self?
5:08
The answer is actually quite simple.
5:09
The answer is that you just need to keep around
5:11
the various proteins that your body uses.
5:15
You need to keep them around in the bone marrow
5:16
while these B cells are being vetted.
5:20
For example here you'll have a little insulin.
5:23
Very small amount but it will be there.
5:26
You'll have a little bit of some other protein.
5:29
Let's say maybe hemoglobin.
5:32
You'll have some other protein here.
5:35
You'll have yet another protein over here.
5:39
All these proteins will be around.
5:42
What your body does at this stage and development
5:45
is it says whatever B cell binds to something,
5:49
wherever B cell binds to something
5:50
with its B cell receptor
5:52
in the bone marrow will be killed.
5:57
This B cell right here
5:59
that recognizes this insulin protein
6:03
the fact that it recognizes it,
6:04
it means that it will bind
6:05
and that will cause a little bit of a chemical change
6:08
in the B cell or something,
6:09
and one thing will lead to another
6:11
and the whole system will be programmed
6:12
so that as a result this guy will die.
6:16
Every B cell that recognizes self
6:20
if it sees that self molecule in the bone marrow
6:24
it will be killed.
6:27
This works because your bone marrow
6:28
will have most of the abundant proteins in your body.
6:32
They'll be present there so that you can make sure
6:35
that you weed out all the B cells that react to self.
6:39
Now what happens after this step is that
6:41
these guys who have been vetted
6:43
they can proceed onwards to maybe a lymph node.
6:47
Somewhere where they can begin to actually be active
6:50
now that they've sort of gone through
6:53
basic training here in the bone marrow.
6:56
You might ask yourself, well, what about here?
6:58
What about here when one of these B cells
7:01
that doesn't react to self,
7:02
what about when it interacts with a bacteria
7:05
that you actually want it to fight?
7:08
Is the same thing gonna happen?
7:09
Is it going to die just because it recognizes
7:12
the molecule that its made to bind to?
7:17
The answer is obviously not.
7:18
You don't want this guy to die because you need him.
7:21
Because you want to fight this bacteria.
7:23
The reason why he doesn't die is because
7:25
well, we're in a different environment.
7:27
There are different rules,
7:28
there are different other cells around
7:29
and this B cell has matured and become different.
7:33
The rules are different
7:34
and he's not going to die.
7:35
This weeding out of B cells
7:37
that react to self proteins is
7:41
sort of the first of two mechanisms
7:44
that I'd like to talk about that the body uses
7:47
to not react to self.
7:49
Actually the same thing exact thing happens for T cells
7:53
except it doesn't happen in the bone marrow,
7:55
it happens in the thymus
7:56
because that's where T cells mature.
8:00
In the thymus we have really the identical process
8:03
where T cells differentiate
8:05
and each one has a unique receptor
8:07
and the ones that reacts to self in the thymus
8:10
too strongly are killed.
8:13
It's not a foolproof method
8:14
or else we wouldn't need step two.
8:16
Every once in a while a B cell will get out there.
8:20
A B cell will escape which reacts to self.
8:25
It's just because every process has its mistakes
8:28
and maybe you don't have
8:29
every single protein here in the bone marrow
8:32
and enough abundance to find the B cells
8:35
that reacts to a protein of your own body.
8:38
Let's say this is a B cell that escaped the bone marrow
8:40
even though it reacts to self.
8:42
What's gonna happen now?
8:44
It's gonna find that protein
8:47
that it was sort of made at random to react with.
8:50
It's gonna find that protein
8:51
that your body makes and that your body needs
8:53
and it's going to bind to it.
8:55
What's it gonna do now?
8:56
If you remember it's now going to take that protein
9:00
ingest it, break it up into little pieces
9:03
and then present it on an MHC II molecule.
9:12
If you recall it will just present
9:13
a small piece of that protein on the MHC II molecule.
9:16
Maybe it will present a different piece of protein
9:18
on a different MHC II molecule over here,
9:21
something like that.
9:22
The reason it does this is
9:25
because it needs a T cell to come along.
9:28
Here's a T cell.
9:30
It needs a T cell to come along
9:31
that will recognize that same piece
9:35
that is put there on its surface.
9:38
It needs that in order to activate it.
9:40
It's going to sit there
9:40
and wait for this T cell to come along
9:42
who has the perfect receptor.
9:45
Here's that T cell.
9:47
They're going to interact
9:49
and they're gonna have some kind of
9:51
intracellular kiss
9:53
that's going to finally allow this B cell to activate.
9:57
Usually without the T cell coming
10:00
and recognizing the antigen that the B cell reacts to
10:04
the B cell cannot activate.
10:06
It needs this T cell to recognize it.
10:08
This is exactly the second mechanism of defense
10:12
that I'd like to bring to your attention
10:15
which is that even if a B cell escapes
10:18
that reacts to self.
10:20
Almost always it's also going to need a T cell
10:23
that reacts to self to come and activate it.
10:26
You need both the B cell to escape
10:28
the weeding out in the bone marrow
10:31
and the T cell to escape the weeding out in the thymus
10:35
for you to get an active B cell
10:37
that's now going to start putting out antibodies
10:40
that react to self.
10:43
By the way, this cellular kiss here
10:46
is usually going on in the lymph node.
10:49
Looking at this whole process
10:51
you might have a few complaints.
10:53
I encourage you think about how it might go wrong.
10:57
One way you might think it could go wrong is
10:59
what if bacteria got into the bone marrow
11:02
and certainly that's very, very possible
11:04
because when you get infections
11:05
the thing that's infecting you
11:06
can move around your body.
11:08
If this bacterium gets into your bone marrow
11:11
does that mean that now this B cell
11:13
is going to bind to it
11:15
and therefore it's going to be killed?
11:17
Because at this stage whenever the B cells
11:18
bind to something they're killed.
11:20
The answer is yes.
11:21
This is exactly what happens.
11:23
The reason why it's not too much of a problem is that
11:26
even if you have this bacterium here in the bone marrow
11:29
for a week or two or maybe a month,
11:33
after that once this bacterium goes away or it's killed
11:36
then it won't be there anymore
11:37
and you can start producing these B cells
11:39
that react to that bacterium again.
11:42
Hopefully you already had a bunch of these B cells
11:44
that could react to this bacterium
11:46
that you had made previously
11:48
and that were already out in the lymph nodes.
11:51
Those guys will be there to fight the infection
11:54
while maybe the infection might be in your bone marrow
11:56
preventing you from making more of those B cells
11:59
to kill it.
12:00
You already have some of those B cells
12:01
out there in the lymph nodes
12:03
and they can proliferate out there
12:04
and sort of lead the battle from there.
12:07
Now even though your body has these mechanisms
12:09
to keep your immune system
12:11
from reacting to yourself
12:12
it still happens sometimes.
12:15
The process still goes wrong sometimes
12:16
and the result is autoimmune disease.
12:23
It's called autoimmune because you're immune to yourself.
12:27
Your immune system basically starts attacking your own body
12:30
and some pretty terrible disease can result.
12:33
To kind of bring it to life
12:34
where I'd like to tell you about one example of this.
12:38
This is a muscle fiber
12:40
and the way your muscle fibers are activated
12:45
because you don't want to be flexing
12:46
all of your muscles all the time
12:48
the way that they're activated is that
12:49
they have a little receptor which I'll draw here.
12:53
This receptor is ready to receive
12:57
little molecules from a neuron, part of a nerve.
13:03
It receives little molecules from this neuron
13:05
that activate this receptor
13:07
and therefore activate the muscle fiber.
13:10
If you want to tighten this muscle fiber
13:12
you just need to send the signal down a neuron
13:15
and they'll release the little molecules
13:16
which will activate the muscle fiber.
13:19
In one example of autoimmune disease
13:21
you get antibodies against this receptor here on the muscle.
13:27
They bind to it
13:29
and that either stops it from functioning.
13:31
It makes it impossible for it to react to the neuron signals
13:35
or causes that receptor to be destroyed.
13:38
Those are two mechanisms that have been seen.
13:42
In this autoimmune disease what do you think will happen?
13:45
What happens is that
13:47
your body can no longer
13:49
activate muscle fibers as easily.
13:51
The disease is called myasthenia gravis
13:58
and the etymology of that is ""my"" it means muscle
14:03
and ""asthenia"" means weakness.
14:06
Muscle weakness and gravis just means it's serious
14:09
because it gets serious over time.
14:11
If you can't activate the muscle fibers in your body
14:13
you slowly become paralyzed.
14:16
You don't need to remember this exact mechanism.
14:20
That's not really important
14:21
but I just wanted to give an example of
14:23
one kind of autoimmune disease and how it works.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,afM6_VFaIss,

Let's talk about a concept that probably
0:03
confuses chemistry students the most on some level.
0:06
But on some level it's also one of the simplest concepts.
0:09
And that's the idea of a mole,
0:12
which in chemistry is different
0:13
that the thing digging up your backyard,
0:15
or the thing you want to get removed from your left eye.
0:19
A mole in chemistry is just a number.
0:21
It's just a number,
0:23
and the number is 6.02 times 10 to the 23.
0:28
So it's a very huge number.
0:29
And this is also called Avogadro's number.
0:31
Maybe I will do a video on Avogadro.
0:35
Avogadro's number
0:39
But that's all you need to know.
0:41
A mole is just a number.
0:43
There are kind of more Byzantine definitions of a mole.
0:47
This actually is not
0:49
-- actually, let me copy and paste it from Wikipedia.
0:51
This is Wikipedia's definition of a mole.
0:55
And you hopefully at the end of this video
0:58
you'll see that they're equivalent.
0:59
But if you're just getting exposed to the concept,
1:01
this to me, it's just not an easy concept.
1:07
Basically, ""a mole is defined as the amount of substance
1:10
of a system that contains as many elemental entities
1:16
as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon 12.""
1:19
Well, I just told you that a mole is 6.02 times 10 to the 23.
1:24
So if you just take the last part,
1:26
atoms in 12 grams of carbon 12.
1:30
So that means that there are 1 mole of carbon 12
1:39
-- let me write it like that -- carbon 12.
1:42
There are 1 mole of carbon 12 atoms in 12 grams of carbon.
1:57
And so that's why a mole is useful.
1:59
So I could have just instead of writing 1 mole,
2:02
I could have replaced this as there's 6.02 times 10
2:06
to the 23 carbon atoms, carbon 12 atoms in 12 grams of carbon.
2:12
How do you figure that out?
2:13
Or I guess, what else does this mean?
2:15
I mean, we just added in carbon,
2:17
they said it's the amount of substance of any molecule,
2:19
if you convert between atomic mass units and grams.
2:22
This I find very confusing.
2:24
How can we apply this in other places?
2:26
So the first thing to realize is a mole is just a way
2:29
of translating between grams and atomic mass units.
2:32
One carbon 12 atom is what?
2:35
What's its mass number?
2:37
It's 12.
2:39
That's why it's called carbon 12 instead of carbon 14.
2:41
So its mass is 12 atomic mass units.
2:46
So if you have something that has a mass of 12 atomic mass units
2:50
and you have a mole of them,
2:52
or you have 6.02 times 10 to the 23 of them,
2:55
all of those atoms combined will have a mass of 12 grams.
3:01
So another way to think about it is
3:04
1 gram is equal to 1 mole of atomic mass units.
3:13
I'll write amu's like that.
3:16
Or you can write 1 gram is equal to 6.02
3:22
times 10 to the 23 atomic mass units.
3:26
And the reason why this is useful
3:28
-- and it's kind of addressed in this Wikipedia definition there
3:30
-- is it helps us translate between the atomic world
3:33
-- where we deal with atomic mass units and we deal with,
3:36
oh, we've got an extra neutron now,
3:37
let's add one to our atomic mass number
3:41
-- and translating between that atomic world
3:43
and our everyday world where we deal in grams.
3:45
And just so you know, a gram is still
3:47
a pretty small amount of mass.
3:50
It's 1/1,000 of a kilogram.
3:52
A kilogram is about 2 pounds.
3:54
So this is about 1/500 of a pound.
3:56
So this is not much.
3:58
So there's a ton of atoms in a very small amount of
4:02
-- in 1 gram of carbon, or at least in 12 grams of carbon,
4:06
you have a ton of atoms. You have 6.02 times 10 to the 23.
4:10
And just to hit the point home,
4:12
I probably should have talked about this in the atom.
4:13
This is a huge number.
4:15
To maybe visualize it, if you think of -- I was told that
4:22
in the diameter of a hair, if this is a hair
4:25
and this is diameter of the hair,
4:27
if you go this way there 1 million carbon atoms.
4:32
1 million carbon atoms that way.
4:35
Or if you were to take an apple
4:41
and you were to try to figure out what fraction,
4:45
if you were to make one of the atoms of an apple
4:48
-- and obviously,
4:50
an apple has a bunch of different types of atoms in it
4:52
-- but if you were to take one of the atoms
4:53
and make it the size of the apple,
4:55
then the apple would be the size of the earth.
4:58
So an apple atom is to an apple
5:00
as an apple is to the earth.
5:03
So these are obviously-- it's hard for us
5:06
to even process things of this size.
5:08
When you just have one gram of
5:12
-- well, let's say you have 1 gram of hydrogen.
5:14
1 gram of hydrogen. 1 gram of hydrogen.
5:22
If you have 1 gram of hydrogen,
5:24
that means you have 1 mole of hydrogen.
5:29
How do I know that?
5:31
Because hydrogen's atomic mass number is 1.
5:34
So in general, if you just take any element
5:39
-- so what is the mass of,
5:41
let me just pick, 1 mole of aluminum?
5:45
So if I were to take 6.02 times 10 to the 23 aluminum atoms,
5:54
what is the mass of that collection?
5:56
Well, each of them have an atomic mass number of 13.
6:00
So it's 13 amu's-- I don't have to put the s there
6:08
-- times six point
6:11
-- well, I won't write that way, actually.
6:14
That'll probably just confuse you.
6:15
The easy way to think about is if you have a mole of an atom,
6:18
you take its mass-- I was taking its atomic number,
6:21
that's not good-- you take its mass number.
6:23
In this case let's say it's 27.
6:26
So we're dealing with aluminum 27.
6:30
You take its mass number, and if you have 1 mole of it,
6:34
then the mass of that will be 27 grams.
6:41
So that literally, when you have one mole of an atom
6:44
it's a direct translation between its mass number and grams.
6:48
1 mole of iron, let's say iron 56--
6:53
there's obviously many isotopes or iron
6:55
-- let's say we're dealing with iron 56.
6:58
You normally don't hear it like that,
6:59
but let's say we're dealing with the isotope of iron
7:02
that has a mass number of 56.
7:04
So if I have 1 mole of this, 1 mole of this atom right here,
7:11
that's going to have a mass of
7:15
-- the math isn't difficult here
7:16
-- 56 grams. Right? And if you think about it,
7:23
how many atomic mass units is this?
7:24
Well, this is 56 atomic mass units per atom.
7:30
Then you have a mole of those, so you have
7:32
6.02 times 10 to the 23 times 56 atomic mass units.
7:37
And then you divide it
7:39
by the number of atomic mass units per gram.
7:41
And you end up with 56 grams.
7:43
But the easy way to think about it is
7:44
you just take whatever the mass number is.
7:46
If you have silicon, if you have a mole of silicon,
7:49
a mole of silicon will have a mass
7:52
-- I don't want to say weight
7:53
because this should apply to any planet
7:54
-- of 28 grams.
7:56
What about 2 moles of silicon? 2 moles of silicon.
8:04
And I'll write its mass number.
8:05
Let's say silicon has a mass number of 28.
8:10
Two moles of silicon.
8:12
Well, 1 more would have a mass of 28 grams,
8:15
so 2 moles is going to have a mass of 56 grams.
8:23
If I were to say, let's say I had 4 moles of oxygen,
8:29
which has a mass number of 16.
8:32
What is the mass of that?
8:34
This is a huge number of oxygen atoms
8:37
-- what would be the mass of that?
8:38
Well, it would be 4 times-- 1 mole of oxygen
8:44
would have a mass of 16 grams,
8:47
so 4 moles has 64 grams.
8:52
It's confusing because we're not used to using a word
8:55
like moles as a number, but all it is, is a number.
8:58
And the easy way to think about is that it lets us
9:00
translate between this atomic mass unit number and grams.
9:06
And you say, well, how do I get that many grams?
9:08
Well, I have to have 6.02 times 10 to the 23 carbon atoms
9:12
for that collection of carbon to have a mass of 12 grams.
9:16
That's all that mole means.
9:18
It's just a number.
9:19
And I encourage you to kind of play around
9:21
with a lot of what we talked about.
9:22
Because it's super important
9:24
to have the intuition behind moles,
9:25
otherwise, you'll get confused later on
9:27
when we start getting into energies
9:29
in terms of it requires kilojoules per mole,
9:31
and what is the energy of this reaction
9:34
and all that type of stuff.
9:35
So just really try to make sure
9:37
you digest this as well as possible.
9:38
And let me know if you don't
9:40
and I'll maybe make another video on this
9:42
because it's so important.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,AsqEkF7hcII,
khan_video_rLNM8zI4Q_M_161159,But my doubt is if some objects reflect less light then where the rest of light energy goes?,Essay,"•
0:00
What I want to do in this video is give ourselves
0:02
a basic introduction to the phenomenon of light.
0:07
And light is, at least to me, mysterious.
0:11
Because on one level it really defines our reality.
0:14
It's maybe the most defining characteristic of our reality.
0:17
Everything we see, how we perceive reality,
0:20
is based on light bouncing off of objects
0:23
or bending around objects or diffracting around objects,
0:26
and then being sensed by our eyes,
0:29
and then sending signals into our brain that
0:32
create models of the world we see around us.
0:35
So it really is, almost, the defining characteristic
0:37
of our reality.
0:38
But at the same time, when you really go down to experiment
0:42
and observe with light, it starts
0:44
to have a bunch of mysterious properties.
0:47
And to a large degree it is not fully understood yet.
0:51
And probably the most amazing thing about light--
0:54
well, actually there's tons of amazing things about light--
0:56
but one of the mysterious things is when you really get down
0:59
to it-- and this is actually not just true of light,
1:01
this is actually true of almost anything
1:03
once you get onto a small enough quantum mechanical level--
1:07
light behaves as both a wave and a particle.
1:12
And this is probably not that intuitive to you,
1:15
because it's not that intuitive to me.
1:17
In my life, I'm used to certain things behaving as waves,
1:19
like sound waves or the waves of an ocean.
1:22
And I'm used to certain things behaving like particles,
1:25
like basketballs or-- I don't know-- my coffee cup.
1:29
I'm not used to things behaving as both.
1:32
And it really depends on what experiment you run
1:34
and how you observe the light.
1:36
So when you observe it as a particle,
1:38
and this comes out of Einstein's work
1:40
with the photoelectric effect-- and I won't go into the details
1:43
here, maybe in a future video when
1:44
we start thinking about quantum mechanics--
1:47
you can view light as a train of particles moving
1:54
at the speed of light, which I'll talk about in a second.
1:56
We call these particles photons.
2:00
If you view light in other ways-- and you see it
2:02
even when you see light being refracted by a prism here--
2:07
it looks like it is a wave.
2:10
And it has the properties of a wave.
2:12
It has a frequency, and it has a wavelength.
2:16
And like other waves, the velocity of that wave
2:19
is the frequency times its wavelength.
2:23
Now even if you ignore this particle aspect of light,
2:28
if you just look at the wave aspect of the light,
2:30
it's still fascinating.
2:32
Because most waves require a medium to travel through.
2:36
So for example, if I think about how sound travels through air--
2:40
so let me draw a bunch of air particles.
2:44
I'll draw a sound wave traveling through the air particles.
2:47
What happens in a sound wave is you compress some of the air
2:52
particles and those compress the ones next to them.
2:54
And so you have points in the air that have higher,
2:57
I guess you could say, higher pressure
2:59
and points that have lower pressure,
3:00
and you could plot that.
3:02
So we have high pressure over here.
3:03
High pressure, low pressure, high pressure, low pressure.
3:07
And as these things bump into each other,
3:08
and this wave essentially travels to the right--
3:11
and if you were to plot that you would see this wave
3:13
form traveling to the right.
3:15
But this is all predicated, or this is all
3:17
based on, this energy traveling through a medium.
3:22
And I'm used to visualizing waves in that way.
3:26
But light needs no medium.
3:34
Light will actually travel fastest through nothing,
3:37
through a vacuum.
3:39
And it will travel at an unimaginably fast speed--
3:42
3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second.
3:47
And just to give you a sense of this,
3:49
this is 300 million meters per second.
3:51
Or another way of thinking about it is it
3:54
would take light less than a seventh of a second
3:59
to travel around the earth.
4:00
Or it would travel around the earth more than seven times
4:03
in one second.
4:04
So unimaginably fast.
4:06
And not only is this just a super fast speed,
4:10
but once again it tells us that light
4:12
is something fundamental to our universe.
4:14
Because it's not just an unimaginable fast speed.
4:17
It is the fastest speed not just known to physics, but possible
4:21
in physics.
4:22
So once again something very unintuitive to us
4:25
in our everyday realm.
4:26
We always imagine that, OK, if something
4:29
is going at some speed, maybe if there was an ant riding on top
4:31
of that something and it was moving in the same direction,
4:34
it would be going even faster.
4:35
But nothing can go faster than the speed of light.
4:39
It's absolutely impossible based on our current understanding
4:43
of physics.
4:44
So it's not just a fast speed, it
4:46
is the fastest speed possible.
4:55
And this right here is an approximation.
4:57
It's actually 2.99 something something times 10
5:01
to the eighth meters per second.
5:02
But 3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second
5:04
is a pretty good approximation.
5:07
Now within the visible light spectrum-- and I'll
5:10
talk about what's beyond the visible light spectrum
5:13
in a second-- you're probably familiar with the colors.
5:15
Maybe you imagine them as the colors of the rainbow.
5:18
And rainbows really happen because the light
5:20
from the sun, the white light, is being refracted
5:24
by these little water particles.
5:27
And you can see that in a clearer way when
5:29
you see light being refracted by a prism right over here.
5:33
And the different wavelengths of light-- so white light
5:36
contains all of the visible wavelengths--
5:39
but the different wavelengths get refracted differently
5:42
by a prism.
5:44
So in this case the higher-frequency wavelengths,
5:47
the violet and the blue, get refracted more.
5:50
Its direction gets bent more than the low-frequency
5:53
wavelengths, than the reds and the oranges right over here.
5:59
And if you want to look at the wavelength of visible light,
6:02
it's between 400 nanometers and 700 nanometers.
6:05
And the higher the frequency, the higher the energy of that
6:09
light.
6:09
And that actually goes into when you
6:11
start talking about the quantum mechanics of it--
6:13
that the higher frequency means that each of these photons
6:16
have higher energy.
6:17
They have a better ability to give kinetic energy
6:20
to knock off electrons or whatever else they need to do.
6:23
So higher frequency-- let me write
6:25
that down-- higher frequency means higher energy.
6:35
Now I keep referring to this idea of the visible light.
6:39
And you might say, what is beyond visible light?
6:41
And what you'll find is that light is just
6:43
part of a much broader phenomenon,
6:46
and it's just the part that we happen to observe.
6:49
And if we want to broaden the discussion a little bit,
6:54
visible light is just really part
6:56
of the electromagnetic spectrum.
6:59
So light is really just electromagnetic radiation.
7:09
And everything that I told you about light just now--
7:11
it has a wave property and it has particle properties--
7:15
this is not just specific to visible light.
7:17
This is true of all of electromagnetic radiation.
7:22
So at very low frequencies or very long wavelengths--
7:25
we're talking about things like radio waves,
7:27
the things that allow a radio to reach your car;
7:31
the things that allow your cellphone
7:34
to communicate with cell towers; microwaves, the things that
7:38
start vibrating water molecules in your food
7:40
so that they heat up; infrared, which
7:43
is what our body releases, and that's
7:45
why you can detect people through walls
7:46
with infrared cameras; visible light; ultraviolet light,
7:50
the UV light coming from the sun that'll give you sunburn;
7:53
X-rays, the radiation that allows
7:55
us to see through the soft material and just visualize
7:58
the bones; gamma rays,
7:59
the super high energy that comes from quasars
8:03
and other certain types of physical phenomena-- these
8:05
are all examples of the exact same thing.
8:08
We just happen to perceive certain frequencies
8:11
of this as visible light.
8:14
And you might say, hey, Sal, how come we only
8:15
perceive certain frequencies of this?
8:18
How can we only see these frequencies?
8:23
Literally we can see those frequencies
8:25
with our unaided eye.
8:26
And the reason, or at least my best guess
8:28
of the reason of that, is that's the frequency where
8:30
the sun dumps out a lot of electromagnetic radiation.
8:34
So it's inundating the Earth.
8:36
And if, as a species, you wanted to observe things
8:38
based on reflected electromagnetic energy,
8:42
it is most useful to be able to perceive the things where there
8:46
is the most electromagnetic radiation.
8:48
So it is possible that in other realities or other planets
8:51
there are species that perceive more
8:53
in the ultraviolet range or the infrared range.
8:55
And even on Earth, there are some
8:57
that perform better at either end of the range.
8:59
But we see really well in the part of the spectrum
9:02
where the sun just happens to dump a lot of radiation on us.
9:08
Now I'll leave you there.
9:09
I think that's a pretty good overview of light.
9:11
And if any of this stuff seems kind
9:14
of unintuitive or daunting, or really
9:17
on some level confusing-- this wave-particle duality,
9:20
this idea of a transfer of energy through nothing--
9:25
and it seems unintuitive, don't worry.
9:27
It seems unintuitive even for the best of physicists.

0:00
- [Voiceover] All right, now we're gonna talk
0:01
about the idea of an electric current.
0:04
The story about currents starts with the idea of charge.
0:08
We've learned that we have two kinds of charges,
0:11
positive and negative charge.
0:13
We'll just make up two little charges like that.
0:17
And we know if they're the opposite sign,
0:20
that there'll be a force of attraction between them.
0:24
And if they have two like signs,
0:27
here's two charges that are both positive,
0:31
and these charges are gonna repel each other.
0:34
So this is the basic electrostatics idea,
0:37
and the same thing for two minus charges.
0:39
They also repel.
0:40
So like charges repel, and unlike charges attract.
0:47
That's one idea.
0:48
We have the idea of charge.
0:49
And now we need a place to get some charge.
0:52
One of the places we like to get charge from
0:54
is copper, copper wires.
0:58
A copper atom looks like this.
0:59
Copper atom has a nucleus
1:03
with some protons in it,
1:05
and it also has electrons flying around the outside,
1:09
electrons in orbits around the outside.
1:11
So we'll draw the electrons like this.
1:13
There'll be orbits around this nucleus.
1:19
Pretty good circles.
1:22
And there'll be electrons in these.
1:25
Little minus signs.
1:27
There's electrons stacked up in this.
1:32
And even farther out, there's electrons.
1:39
So there's kind of a interesting looking copper atom.
1:43
Copper, the symbol for copper is Cu,
1:46
and its atomic number is 29.
1:51
That means there's 29 protons inside here,
1:53
and there's 29 electrons outside.
1:56
It turns out, just as a coincidence for copper,
1:59
that the last orbital out here
2:03
has just one electron in it,
2:05
that guy right there.
2:08
And that's the one
2:10
that is the easiest to pull away from copper
2:13
and have it go participate in conduction,
2:17
in electric current.
2:21
If I have a chunk of copper,
2:22
every copper atom will have the opportunity
2:28
to contribute one, this one lonely electron out here.
2:33
If we look at another element, like for instance silver,
2:37
silver has this same kind of electron configuration,
2:41
where there's just one out here.
2:42
And that's why silver and copper
2:44
are such good, good conductors.
2:48
Now we're gonna build,
2:49
let's build a copper wire.
2:51
Here's sort of a copper wire.
2:55
It's just made of solid copper.
2:57
It's all full of copper atoms.
3:01
And I'm gonna put a voltage across this.
3:08
There's our little battery.
3:09
This is the minus sign, this is the plus side.
3:12
And we'll hook up a battery to this.
3:19
What's going on in here?
3:20
Inside this copper is a whole bunch of electrons
3:27
that are
3:31
associated with atoms.
3:32
It's a neutral piece of metal.
3:35
There's the same number of protons as there is electrons.
3:38
But these electrons are a little bit loose.
3:40
So if I put a plus over there,
3:43
that's this situation right here,
3:44
where a plus is attracting a minus.
3:46
So an electron is gonna sort of wander
3:49
over this way and go like that.
3:51
And that's gonna leave a net positive charge in this region.
3:55
So these electrons are all gonna
3:56
start moving in this direction.
4:00
And down at the end,
4:02
here, an electron is gonna come out of this battery,
4:06
travel in here,
4:08
and it's gonna go in there and make up the difference.
4:10
So if I had a net positive charge here
4:13
from the electrons leaving and going to the left,
4:16
this battery would fill those in.
4:18
And I'm gonna get a net movement of charge,
4:21
of negative charge, around in this direction, like this.
4:26
The question is, how do I measure that?
4:28
How do I measure or give a number
4:29
to that amount of stuff that's going on?
4:32
So we wanna quantify that, we wanna assign a number
4:34
to the amount of current happening here.
4:37
What we do is, in our heads,
4:39
we put a boundary across here.
4:40
So just make that up in your head.
4:43
And it cuts all the way through the copper.
4:45
And what we know, we're gonna stand right here.
4:50
We're gonna keep our eye
4:52
right on this boundary down in here.
4:55
As we watch, what we're gonna do is,
4:57
we're gonna count the number of electrons
5:01
that move by here,
5:04
and we're gonna have a stop watch
5:05
and we're gonna time that.
5:07
So we're gonna get, basically,
5:08
this is charge,
5:10
it's negative charge,
5:12
and it's moving to the side.
5:13
What we're gonna do is, at one little spot right here,
5:15
we're just gonna count the number that go by in one second.
5:18
So we're gonna get charge per second.
5:23
It's gonna be a negative charge moving by.
5:27
That's what we call current.
5:32
It's the same as water flowing by in a river.
5:34
That's the same idea.
5:38
Now I'm gonna set up a different situation
5:42
that also produces a current.
5:43
And this time, we're gonna do it with water,
5:45
water and salt.
5:49
Let's build a tube of salt, of salt water, like this.
5:55
We're gonna pretend this is some tube
5:56
that's all full of water.
5:57
I'm also gonna put a battery here.
5:59
Let's put another battery.
6:07
And we'll stick the wire into there.
6:10
We'll stick the wire into there.
6:13
This is the plus side of the battery,
6:15
and this is the minus side of the battery.
6:18
Water is H20,
6:23
and this does not conduct.
6:24
There's no free electrons available here.
6:26
But what I'm gonna do is,
6:27
I'm gonna put some table salt in it.
6:29
This is ordinary salt that you put on your food.
6:31
It's made of sodium, that's the symbol for sodium,
6:36
and chloride, Cl is chloride.
6:39
Sodium chloride is table salt.
6:41
If we sprinkle some table salt into water,
6:44
what happens is, these dissolve
6:46
and we get a net plus charge here
6:49
and a net minus charge on the chlorine.
6:53
So out here is floating around Na's with plus signs
6:58
and Cl's nearby, really close nearly, with minuses.
7:13
Let's keep it even.
7:18
Now, when I dip my battery wires into this water,
7:21
what's gonna happen is,
7:22
this plus charge,
7:23
this plus charge over here from the battery
7:27
is gonna attract the minus Cl's.
7:30
So the Cl's gonna move that way a little bit.
7:34
And over here, the same thing is happening.
7:35
There's a minus sign here.
7:37
There's a minus from the battery.
7:42
That's going to attract this,
7:45
and it's also gonna repel Cl minuses.
7:49
So what we get is a net motion
7:52
of positive charge, plus q going this way,
7:59
and we get minus q going this way.
8:06
How do we measure that current?
8:08
How do we measure that current?
8:09
Well, we do it the same way as we did up there with copper.
8:12
We put a boundary through here in our heads.
8:14
We stand here
8:17
and we watch the charges moving by.
8:21
What we're gonna get is some sodiums, Na's,
8:25
moving this way,
8:28
and chlorines moving this way.
8:30
Just like we showed here.
8:31
Na
8:35
moving this way.
8:36
So there's gonna be plus charges moving through the boundary
8:38
and minus charges moving through the boundary
8:41
in the opposite direction.
8:42
If I take the total sum of that.
8:45
For example, if I see one Na go this way
8:47
and one Cl go this way,
8:50
that's equivalent to two charges
8:52
moving through the boundary.
8:54
Hope that makes sense.
8:55
It's equivalent to two charges,
8:58
one going this way and one going this way.
9:00
Because they have opposite signs,
9:02
they add together and make two charges.
9:05
In this case, current
9:12
is equal, again, to charge per second.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,ZRLXDiiUv8Q,

0:01
- We've been treating light as a wave,
0:03
and we've been drawing it with this continuous wave pattern
0:06
of oscillating electric and magnetic fields
0:09
that are traveling in some direction.
0:11
And why shouldn't we treat it as a wave?
0:14
If you sent it through a small opening,
0:16
this electromagnetic radiation would spread out,
0:20
There'd be diffraction, and that's what waves do.
0:22
Or, if you let it overlap with itself,
0:25
if you had some wave in some region,
0:27
and it lined up perfectly
0:29
with some other electromagnetic wave,
0:32
you'd get constructive interference.
0:33
If it was out of phase, you'd get destructive interference.
0:37
That's what waves do.
0:38
Why shouldn't we call electromagnetic radiation a wave?
0:43
And that's what everyone thought.
0:44
But, in the late 1800s and early 1900s,
0:48
physicists discovered something shocking.
0:51
They discovered that light,
0:53
and all electromagnetic radiation,
0:55
can display particle-like behavior, too.
0:58
And I don't just mean localized in some region of space.
1:03
Waves can get localized.
1:04
If you sent in some wave here that was a wave pulse,
1:10
well, that wave pulse is pretty much localized.
1:13
When it's traveling through here, it's going to
1:15
kind of look like a particle.
1:16
That's not really what we mean.
1:18
We mean something more dramatic.
1:20
We mean that light, what physicists discovered,
1:23
is that light and light particles
1:25
can only deposit certain amount of energy,
1:30
only discrete amounts of energy.
1:34
There's a certain chunk of energy that light can deposit,
1:37
no less than that.
1:39
So this is why it's called quantum mechanics.
1:43
You've heard of a quantum leap.
1:45
Quantum mechanics means a discrete jump, no less than that.
1:50
And so what do we call these particles of light?
1:52
We call them photons.
1:55
How do we draw them?
1:56
That's a little trickier.
1:58
We know now light can behave like a wave and a particle,
2:02
so we kind of split the difference sometimes.
2:04
Sometimes you'll see it like this,
2:05
where it's kind of like a wavy particle.
2:08
So there's a photon, here's another photon.
2:11
Basically, this is the problem.
2:13
This is the main problem with wave particle duality,
2:17
it's called.
2:18
The fact that light, and everything else, for that matter,
2:21
can behave in a way that shows wavelike characteristics,
2:25
it can show particle-like characteristics,
2:27
there's no classical analog of this.
2:30
We can't envision in our minds anything that we've ever seen
2:33
that can do this, that can both behave like a wave
2:37
and a particle.
2:39
So it's impossible, basically,
2:40
to draw some sort of visual representation,
2:44
but, you know, it's always good to draw something.
2:46
So we draw our photons like this.
2:47
And so, what I'm really saying here is,
2:49
if you had a detector sitting over here
2:51
that could measure the light energy that it receives
2:55
from some source of light, what I'm saying is,
2:58
if that detector was sensitive enough,
3:01
you'd either get no light energy or one jump,
3:07
or no light energy or, whoop, you absorbed another photon.
3:10
You couldn't get in between.
3:13
If the quantum jump was three units of energy ...
3:16
I don't want to give you a specific unit yet, but, say,
3:19
three units of energy you could absorb,
3:21
if that was the amount of energy for that photon,
3:24
if these photons were carrying three units of energy,
3:27
you could either absorb no energy whatsoever
3:30
or you could absorb all three.
3:32
You can't absorb half of it.
3:35
You can't absorb one unit of energy or two units of energy.
3:39
You could either absorb the whole thing or nothing.
3:42
That's why it's quantum mechanics.
3:44
You get this discrete behavior of light
3:47
depositing all its energy in a particle-like way,
3:50
or nothing at all.
3:51
How much energy?
3:53
Well, we've got a formula for that.
3:55
The amount of energy in one photon
3:59
is determined by this formula.
4:01
And the first thing in it is Planck's constant.
4:04
H is the letter we use for Planck's constant,
4:07
and times f.
4:08
This is it.
4:09
It's a simple formula.
4:10
F is the frequency.
4:11
What is Planck's constant?
4:13
Well, Planck was basically the father of quantum mechanics.
4:18
Planck was the first one to figure out
4:20
what this constant was and to propose
4:22
that light can only deposit its energy in discrete amounts.
4:26
So Planck's constant is extremely small; it's
4:30
6.626 times 10 to the negative 34th joule times seconds.
4:41
10 to the negative 34th?
4:42
There aren't many other numbers in physics that small.
4:46
Times the frequency -- this is regular frequency.
4:50
So frequency, number of oscillations per second,
4:53
measured in hertz.
4:55
So now we can try to figure out,
4:56
why did physicists never discover this before?
4:59
And the reason is, Planck's constant is so small
5:03
that the energy of these photons are extremely small.
5:07
The graininess of this discrete amount of energy
5:10
that's getting deposited is so small
5:12
that it just looks smooth.
5:14
You can't tell that there's a smallest amount,
5:16
or at least it's very hard to tell.
5:17
So instead of just saying 'three units,'
5:20
let's get specific.
5:21
For violet light, what's the energy of one violet photon?
5:31
Well, the frequency of violet light is
5:35
7.5 times 10 to the 14th hertz.
5:40
So if you take that number times this Planck's constant,
5:43
6.626 times 10 to the negative 34th,
5:47
you'll get that the energy of one violet photon
5:51
is about five times 10 to the negative 19th joules.
5:59
Five times ten to the negative 19th,
6:01
that's extremely small.
6:03
That's hard to see.
6:04
That's hard to notice,
6:05
that energy's coming in this discrete amount.
6:08
It's like water.
6:09
I mean, water from your sink.
6:11
Water flowing out of your sink looks continuous.
6:14
We know there's really discrete water molecules in there,
6:17
and that you can only get one water molecule,
6:20
no water molecules, 10 water molecules,
6:23
discrete amounts of these water molecules,
6:25
but there's so many of them and they're so small,
6:27
it's hard to tell that it's not just completely continuous.
6:31
The same is happening with this light.
6:33
This energy's extremely small.
6:35
Each violet photon has an extremely small amount of energy
6:38
that it contributes.
6:39
In fact, if you wanted to know how small it is,
6:42
a baseball, a professional baseball player,
6:46
throwing a ball fast, you know,
6:47
it's about 100 joules of energy.
6:50
If you wanted to know how many of these photons,
6:53
how many of these violet photons would it take
6:55
to equal the energy of one baseball
6:58
thrown at major league speed?
7:00
It would take about two million trillion
7:08
of these photons to equal the energy
7:11
in a baseball that's thrown.
7:13
That's why we don't see this on a macroscopic scale.
7:17
For all intents and purposes, for all we care,
7:20
at a macroscopic level, light's basically continuous.
7:24
It can deposit any energy whatsoever,
7:27
because the scale's so small here.
7:29
But if you look at it up close,
7:30
light can only deposit discrete amounts.
7:33
Now, I don't mean that light can only deposit
7:36
small amounts.
7:38
Light can deposit an enormous amount of energy,
7:40
but it does so in chunks.
7:42
So think about it this way ...
7:43
Let's get rid of all this.
7:45
Think about it this way:
7:46
let's say you had a detector that's going to register
7:51
how much energy it's absorbing,
7:52
and we'll graph it.
7:54
We'll graph what this detector's going to measure,
7:57
the amount of energy per time that it measures.
8:00
So we'll get the amount of energy per time.
8:04
Now, you can absorb huge amounts of energy.
8:07
And on the detector, on a macroscopic scale,
8:10
it just might look like this.
8:11
You know, you're getting more and more light energy.
8:13
You're absorbing more and more energy,
8:15
collecting more and more energy.
8:17
But what I'm saying is that, microscopically,
8:20
if you look at this,
8:21
what's happening is, you've absorbed one photon here.
8:25
You absorbed another one,
8:26
absorbed another one,
8:27
absorbed a bunch of them.
8:28
You keep absorbing a bunch of these photons.
8:30
You can build up a bunch of energy.
8:33
That's fine.
8:34
It's just if you looked at it close enough,
8:36
you have this step pattern
8:39
that's absorbing photons at a time,
8:42
certain numbers of them.
8:43
Maybe it absorbs three at one moment,
8:45
four at another moment.
8:47
But you can't absorb anything in between.
8:49
It can't be completely continuous.
8:52
It has to be a discrete all-or-nothing moment
8:57
of absorption of energy that, on a macroscopic scale,
9:00
looks smooth but on a microscopic scale is highlighted
9:04
by the fact that light energy is coming in discrete chunks,
9:09
described by this equation
9:12
that gives you the energy of individual photons of light.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Zqt3btS1FwE,

0:01
There's a classic story out there
0:04
and it has to do with a character named Jack.
0:06
And you may have heard this story,
0:08
but I'm sure that there is parts of that story
0:10
that you have not heard.
0:11
And so I'm actually going to just try to fill in those parts
0:14
that you get a complete idea of what happened.
0:18
Now Jack came across, a long time ago, a famous, now famous
0:24
beanstalk.
0:25
So this beanstalk was growing and growing
0:29
and had these huge leaves.
0:31
And actually Jack used these leaves
0:34
to make his way up this beanstalk.
0:36
And so, this is how this beanstalk became very famous.
0:40
Because it basically allowed Jack to use it like a ladder.
0:44
Now the part that we don't hear about
0:46
is what was going on between Jack and the beanstalk.
0:48
He was exercising, right?
0:49
So he was actually making a lot of carbon dioxide.
0:54
He was making a lot of this gas, this carbon dioxide gas,
0:58
as kind of a waste product as he was running,
1:01
scampering up the beanstalk.
1:03
And the beanstalk was helping him physically, but also
1:07
was actually providing him with very precious oxygen.
1:11
In fact, if the beanstalk didn't do that,
1:13
he may not have even made it.
1:15
And we also, we don't know for sure,
1:18
but we think that perhaps some of this story
1:20
may have taken place during the day.
1:23
And in fact, we know that sunlight
1:25
is quite important for this process.
1:27
And we think that this process, the name that we give it
1:31
for the beanstalk anyway, is photosynthesis.
1:35
And so what is really happening-- we're actually
1:38
going to kind of write it out here-- between Jack
1:42
and the beanstalk, and really between all plants and animals?
1:45
What is this process between them?
1:47
We know that on the one hand, you
1:48
have beanstalks doing photosynthesis,
1:51
and on the other hand, you have folks like Jack
1:54
doing cellular respiration.
1:57
And there's this really kind of interesting symbiosis.
2:01
And by that I just mean that the two are
2:03
kind of relying on each other to really work.
2:07
So you kind of need both of them to work well.
2:09
And so let's actually take a moment
2:11
to write out these processes that
2:13
are happening between Jack and the beanstalk.
2:16
So let's start with the process of photosynthesis,
2:19
the beanstalk.
2:20
So on the one hand, you've got what?
2:23
You've got water because, of course,
2:25
the beanstalk needs water, and you've got carbon dioxide.
2:31
And I'm going to do carbon oxide in orange.
2:34
So it's taking in water and carbon dioxide.
2:37
And it's going to put out, it's going
2:41
to actually take these ingredients
2:43
if you want to think of it as kind of cooking,
2:45
it's going to take these ingredients
2:46
and it's going to put out.
2:49
It's going to put out what?
2:51
Oxygen and glucose.
2:54
So I'll put glucose up top and oxygen down below.
2:59
So these are the inputs and outputs of photosynthesis.
3:04
And on the other side, you've got something very similar.
3:07
You've got inputs.
3:08
You've got glucose and oxygen going in.
3:11
You're going to start seeing some serious similarities here.
3:16
You've got glucose and oxygen going in.
3:18
So Jack is taking in those two things.
3:21
And he is again, of course, processing them.
3:25
And he's putting out water and carbon dioxide.
3:31
So this looks really, really nice, right?
3:34
Looks perfect actually.
3:35
Because everything is nice and balanced.
3:38
And you can see how it makes perfect sense that,
3:41
not only did Jack need the beanstalk,
3:42
but actually it sounds like the beanstalk needed Jack,
3:45
based on how I've drawn it.
3:46
Now remember, none of this would even
3:48
happen if there was no sunlight.
3:50
So we actually need light energy.
3:52
In fact, that's the whole purpose of this, right?
3:54
Getting energy.
3:56
So you have to have some light energy.
3:58
I'm going to put a big plus sign,
4:00
and I might even circle it because it's so important.
4:02
I don't want you to lose track of it.
4:04
And on the other side, of course,
4:05
Jack is getting something as well.
4:08
He's getting chemical energy.
4:11
In fact, he's using the chemical energy
4:14
to help him climb the beanstalk.
4:16
And so the chemical energy comes in the form
4:18
of what we call ATP, which is just a molecule of high energy.
4:24
And so Jack and the beanstalk are basically
4:28
going from light energy to chemical energy using these two
4:33
equations.
4:33
Now here's the part that people don't always appreciate.
4:36
And I'm actually going to take just a moment to show you
4:39
that this isn't the full story.
4:41
There's actually something else going on as well.
4:44
And that is that there's actually
4:47
some cellular respiration happening on the plant's side.
4:51
So remember, not only does the human, or the Jack,
4:55
need energy, but so does the plant.
4:58
The plant needs energy as well.
5:00
And in fact, if it takes in light energy right here,
5:03
it needs to find a way to actually,
5:04
eventually get some chemical energy itself,
5:07
so that it can do all the things it needs to do.
5:10
It doesn't need to run because plants don't
5:12
move in that sense, but it might need to make new roots,
5:15
and may need to make a flower, and all these things
5:18
take energy.
5:20
So actually, photosynthesis is happening during the day,
5:26
but at all times plants are also capable of doing
5:31
cellular respiration, just like humans are.
5:34
So humans and plants have actually more
5:37
in common than you might think.
5:39
So, this brings up an obvious question.
5:41
Why in the world would a plant send its glucose and oxygen
5:48
this way, when it needs it itself?
5:51
You know, why would it actually get rid of it?
5:54
Well, the truth is, that the glucose ends up oftentimes
5:57
in fruits and vegetables that we eat.
5:59
But as far as the oxygen goes, it makes an excess of oxygen.
6:04
So there is actually enough oxygen
6:06
to go both to us, or to Jack and to be used by itself.
6:12
So it actually has an excess of oxygen that it's making.
6:15
So this is actually kind of interesting and good to know.
6:17
Now if you think about it, if I was to,
6:19
let's say sketch out a planet.
6:22
Let's draw a little planet over here, and ask you the question.
6:27
If this was your planet Earth, and you've
6:29
got thousands, instead of just one Jack, let's say now
6:32
you have thousands of Jacks and thousands of beanstalks,
6:36
in fact, not even thousands.
6:37
Let's say billions, because really, that's what we have.
6:41
We have a planet full of humans, and full of other animals,
6:44
and full of plants.
6:46
What would the atmosphere look like?
6:48
This is the atmosphere.
6:50
What would the atmosphere look like?
6:52
Well you'd guess that the atmosphere is gas.
6:57
And so what would those gases be?
6:59
Well, the way I've drawn things again,
7:02
it looks like I've got lots of oxygen and lots
7:05
of carbon dioxide.
7:06
So I would say well, I guess there must be, I don't know,
7:09
maybe 50-50 carbon dioxide and oxygen
7:12
based on what we know so far.
7:15
And the truth is, that's actually not true.
7:17
That if you actually look at air, if you actually break down
7:21
the atmosphere or air-- I'm just going to write ""air"" here--
7:25
if you actually break it down, turns out
7:27
that the ratios are actually a little different.
7:30
So for example, oxygen makes up about 21% of our air.
7:35
This is our air breakdown.
7:40
And carbon dioxide makes up about less than 1%.
7:44
So, that leaves you wondering, what the heck is making up
7:47
all that other parts of air?
7:50
What is it made of?
7:51
And in truth, it's about 78% nitrogen.
7:57
Now you know, you've got nitrogen in your proteins,
8:00
we've got nitrogen in our DNA.
8:03
So nitrogen is part of us and is part of many, many living
8:07
things.
8:08
But nitrogen gas, specifically, is actually N2.
8:13
And N2, this nitrogen gas, really is not too reactive.
8:18
It kind of just hangs out by itself,
8:20
does not like to react with things.
8:22
So, looking at our little atmosphere graph,
8:25
if you want to now think about it,
8:26
knowing that we've got very little carbon dioxide and about
8:30
21% oxygen-- you could think of oxygen being,
8:34
let's say, something like that-- well then relative
8:36
to that nitrogen would be much more.
8:40
You have much more nitrogen hanging out.
8:45
And so this is really what our atmosphere looks like.
8:47
It looks more filled with nitrogen than anything else.
8:52
And in terms of carbon dioxide, it's
8:54
just got a little smidge of carbon dioxide.
8:56
Maybe right there.
8:58
That could be carbon dioxide, maybe even less than that.
9:01
So this is really what our atmosphere looks like,
9:03
visually.
9:04
And the nitrogen again, it's making up the majority.
9:07
And if you actually wonder where all that nitrogen is coming
9:10
from, because I didn't mention it in any of the equations,
9:13
most of that nitrogen has been around,
9:15
scientists think, since the beginning
9:17
of when earth even had an atmosphere.
9:20
And that nitrogen, we're just kind
9:21
of carrying with us at all times.
9:24
And that's why it just remains around 78%,
9:27
and will probably remain there for many, many years to come.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,lzWUG4H5QBo,

0:00
- [Voiceover] In the last videos, we constructed
0:01
a little bit of a conundrum for us.
0:03
We had the situation where I'm drifting through space,
0:07
and right at time equal zero,
0:09
one of my friends, she passes me by
0:13
in a spaceship going half the speed of light
0:15
in the positive x direction, relative to me.
0:18
And at time equal zero,
0:20
is exactly where she is at my position.
0:23
And then she keeps traveling, and so I draw
0:26
the path that she is taking.
0:28
So after one second, she would be here,
0:30
after two seconds, she would be there,
0:32
and we set up our scales
0:33
so that on our time axis,
0:36
one second is the same length
0:39
as on our space axis, or on our path axis,
0:42
three times ten to the eighth meters.
0:44
And we did that so that at least in my frame of reference,
0:47
the speed of light would be at a 45 degree angle,
0:50
or would have a slope of one.
0:52
But the conundrum we hit was
0:54
is that the speed of light would be perceived,
0:56
based on this model I set up,
0:57
would be perceived differently
0:59
based on which frame of reference you're in.
1:01
The photon that I emit from my flashlight,
1:04
right at time equals zero,
1:05
well sure I'm going to see that as moving
1:08
at the speed of light in the positive x direction.
1:10
But my friend, since she's already moving
1:13
in that positive x direction at half of the speed of light,
1:16
if we assumed a Newtonian world,
1:18
she would see that photon going at half the speed of light.
1:21
And likewise, if she emitted a photon from her flashlight,
1:26
to her, it would look like it's going at the speed of light,
1:28
but to me, it would look like it's going faster
1:31
than the speed of light.
1:33
And the reason why that is a conundrum
1:35
is we know from observation of the universe around us,
1:39
and this is profound, this is a little mind-blowing,
1:41
this is counterintuitive to our everyday experience,
1:44
but we know from observation
1:46
that the speed of light is absolute,
1:49
that it doesn't matter your inertial frame of reference.
1:52
As long as you're in an inertial frame of reference,
1:54
it doesn't matter your relative velocity
1:56
relative to another inertial frame of reference.
1:59
You will always measure the speed of light
2:01
at three times ten to the eighth meters per second.
2:04
But that's at a direct contradiction
2:06
with what our model just set up.
2:08
So it really forces us to question all of our assumptions.
2:12
So what are the assumptions that we made
2:14
in this Newtonian world?
2:15
Well, we assumed that time is absolute.
2:19
Time is absolute.
2:21
And what do I mean by that?
2:22
Well, we assumed that one second passing for me
2:25
is going to be one second passing for my friend.
2:28
That's just our everyday notion.
2:30
If I'm in a car and you're not in a car,
2:33
and we both have watches, and we synchronize our watches,
2:35
they seem to say synchronized.
2:38
But maybe we need to loosen this assumption.
2:42
We also assumed that space is absolute.
2:45
Space is absolute.
2:49
And what do I mean by that?
2:50
Well in our everyday experience,
2:52
regardless of what our relative frames of reference are,
2:55
we seem to agree that, well if that meter stick over there,
2:59
that's riding on that train,
3:01
that is a meter stick, whether I'm sitting on the train
3:03
or whether I'm not.
3:04
But maybe things start to break down a little bit
3:07
as we think about higher velocities.
3:11
And maybe they break down even at the slower velocities,
3:13
but we just don't notice them
3:14
because it's a very small error.
3:15
And maybe there's something even more interesting.
3:18
In our everyday experience,
3:19
we just assume that time is somehow
3:23
something very different than space,
3:26
that you can move in the time direction
3:28
without moving in the space direction,
3:30
or you can move in the space direction
3:32
without moving in the time direction,
3:33
and that they're independent regardless
3:35
of which inertial frame of reference you're in.
3:38
But maybe they aren't separate things.
3:40
In fact, maybe they're all one continuum of spacetime,
3:45
and I don't mean space dash time,
3:47
I mean spacetime.
3:48
I mean the word spacetime,
3:53
where space and time really aren't different things.
3:54
It's just one continuum, spacetime.
3:57
And I keep saying it fast like that,
3:59
because it's not space dash time,
4:03
like thinking about the different dimensions,
4:05
or thinking about two different things.
4:07
We're renaming one thing called spacetime.
4:11
So these are the things that we're going to start
4:13
to hold into question.
4:14
So what if we loosen these, and we assume the thing
4:18
that we have observed in the universe,
4:20
that the speed of light is absolute,
4:22
regardless of your inertial frame of reference.
4:26
So let's word from there, do a little thought experiment,
4:28
and then think about what type of a model we can construct,
4:31
in which case the speed of light is absolute.
4:35
And to do that, we're still going to use
4:36
our little model here,
4:38
and we're going to focus on my friend's frame of reference,
4:41
my friend who's on a spaceship,
4:42
who right at time equal zero, is passing me by
4:45
at half the speed of light.
4:47
And we assumed that she's in this train of spaceships.
4:50
So we assumed already that she's,
4:52
there are these spaceships that are all moving
4:54
at half the speed of light in the positive x direction,
4:56
relative to me,
4:57
and they're all three times ten to the eighth meters apart.
5:01
So they're like that.
5:02
So let's say, and I did these axes in blue,
5:05
because we're assuming this is my friend's
5:07
frame of reference, so you could say
5:08
this is the S prime frame of reference,
5:10
this is Sally's frame of reference
5:12
from a couple of videos ago.
5:14
Let's say a second before she gets to me,
5:16
and I'm also assuming, the way I've drawn these axes,
5:18
and we're going to modify them in the future
5:20
where we're actually going to use the same units
5:22
for space and time.
5:22
Right now, I'm still sticking to what we've classically done
5:25
where we use seconds for time
5:26
and meters for our path or our space,
5:29
but in the future, we'll actually use meters for both.
5:31
But we'll get to that, I don't want to do
5:33
too many things at once.
5:34
But the way I've drawn it
5:37
along my space axis,
5:39
three times ten to the eighth meters
5:41
is going to be the exact same length as one second,
5:44
and I'm doing that so that the path of light
5:47
on my diagram
5:49
can be a 45 degree angle.
5:51
So this is three times ten to the eighth meters
5:55
right over there.
5:56
So let's say a second before Sally gets to me,
5:59
she releases a photon from her spaceship
6:03
in the direction of the spaceship that is in front of her.
6:06
How far is it in front of her?
6:07
It's three times ten to the eighth meters in front of her.
6:10
And let's say on the back of that spaceship,
6:12
there is a mirror.
6:14
So she's pointing her flashlight at that mirror.
6:17
So what's going to happen from her frame of reference
6:19
after one second?
6:21
So for one second, from her frame of reference,
6:23
she is stationary, so this is Sally still here.
6:26
She is going to be still at x prime equals zero
6:30
in her frame of reference,
6:31
and that ship is still going to be
6:34
three times ten to the eighth meters in front of her.
6:36
They're all moving, relative to me, at the same velocity,
6:39
but relative to each other, they seem to be stationary.
6:41
And so what would be the path of that photon?
6:43
Well that photon will have gone from Sally's flashlight
6:47
from her headlamp, or whatever it is,
6:49
to that spaceship in front of her
6:50
would've just reached that mirror
6:52
on the back of that spaceship.
6:54
And so we can draw the path of light.
6:56
It will be, so let me,
6:59
so that path of light
7:01
will look like that on this diagram.
7:05
And then right at this moment,
7:07
right at t prime equals zero seconds,
7:10
the photon will be reflected back to Sally.
7:13
Well how long will it take to get back to Sally?
7:16
Well Sally's gonna receive the reflection of that photon
7:19
after one second, because that's how long
7:20
it's going to take it to go
7:21
three times ten to the eighth meters.
7:23
So the path of that very first photon,
7:26
the path of that very first photon
7:28
is going to look like that.
7:31
All right, well hopefully this is pretty
7:33
straightforward here.
7:35
This is what would happen from Sally's frame of reference.
7:37
A second before she reaches me,
7:39
at t prime equals negative one seconds,
7:43
emits a photon at t equals zero seconds,
7:45
and gets to the spaceship
7:47
that's three times ten to the eighth meters in front of her,
7:50
essentially one light-second in front of her,
7:53
and then a second later,
7:54
it's reflecting back, a second later,
7:56
she gets the reflection.
7:58
And so that's what this diagram is describing.
8:01
But now let's draw it projected on top
8:03
of my frame of reference.
8:05
And this is when things are going to get
8:06
really, really, really, really interesting.
8:09
So I've drawn my frame of reference here,
8:10
and I've intentionally not marked off the seconds
8:13
or the meters on my frame of reference,
8:14
because once again, I'm not going to assume
8:16
that a second in my frame of reference
8:18
is a second in hers, or a meter in my frame of reference
8:20
is a meter in hers.
8:22
I have drawn her t prime axis at the same angle
8:25
as I did before,
8:27
because for every second
8:31
we move into the future,
8:34
she's going to move half a light-second in distance,
8:37
in the positive x direction.
8:39
So this slope right here, one way to think about it,
8:41
the way I've drawn it,
8:42
this is a slope of two.
8:47
For every unit she moves in the x direction,
8:50
she will move two in the time direction.
8:54
And what we're going to do again
8:55
is assume that on her axis,
8:58
I haven't drawn the x prime axis.
8:59
In fact, this is an exercise to think about
9:00
where should the x prime axis be.
9:03
Should it be coincident with the x axis
9:04
like we assumed before?
9:05
Or is it going to be in a different place?
9:07
But we're going to assume that the lengths I draw
9:10
for one second on, let's say,
9:12
in the S prime frame of reference,
9:15
is going to be the same as the length I would draw
9:17
for three times ten to the eighth meters.
9:20
And we're also going to assume
9:21
that the speed of light is absolute,
9:22
so it's always going to moving at a 45 degree angle
9:25
with respect to either frame of reference.
9:29
So that's where things are going to get a little bit whacky,
9:31
but let's see what's going to happen.
9:32
So at negative one seconds,
9:35
we still have Sally turning on her flashlight.
9:38
She wants to bounce it off of the spaceship in front of her.
9:41
And so that photon's going to move with the speed of light
9:44
in either frame of reference.
9:46
And so let me draw that.
9:48
Let me draw that,
9:49
so it's going to look like this.
9:53
I'm drawing at a 45 degree angle.
9:55
So actually, I don't know where it gets reflected.
9:57
It's gonna get reflected where it hits that x prime axis,
9:59
but I don't know where that is.
10:01
But we do know that it then gets reflected,
10:03
and then it gets back to Sally at one second in the future.
10:06
So the return path of that photon
10:09
is going to look something
10:11
is going to look something like this.
10:13
And that point that it changes direction,
10:14
I could have,
10:16
let me,
10:16
I could have done it like this,
10:18
whoops,
10:19
I could've done it like this.
10:20
But the interesting point is where it changes direction
10:22
because that's where that spaceship in front of her
10:25
must be at that point in spacetime.
10:28
Because now we're going to start thinking of mixing up
10:30
space and time,
10:31
but I'm not going to get too much involved in that.
10:33
Now why is this interesting?
10:35
Because from Sally's point of view,
10:38
from Sally's point of view,
10:39
this point here where the light changes direction,
10:44
from Sally's frame of reference,
10:45
is happening simultaneously with when she reaches me.
10:50
This is happening at t prime
10:52
is equal to zero for Sally.
10:55
So anything that is t prime is equal to zero for Sally
10:59
must be on the x prime axis.
11:02
So this must sit on the x prime axis.
11:05
Once again, why do I know that?
11:06
Because everything on the x prime axis,
11:08
any event on the x prime axis,
11:11
let me do it in a different color,
11:13
I keep doing black.
11:15
Any event on the x prime axis
11:18
is going to be at t prime is equal to zero seconds,
11:22
and from Sally's frame of reference
11:24
is going to be simultaneous with when she passes me up.
11:27
So based on that, we know that this is going to be,
11:32
we know that this point,
11:34
which is where Sally is,
11:36
that's going to be the origin from her frame of reference.
11:38
And we know that this point sits on the x prime axis,
11:43
so based on that, we can draw the x prime axis.
11:45
You just need two points to define a line,
11:47
and so let me try to do it.
11:50
So let me try to draw.
11:52
I can do a better job than that.
11:54
Let me try to draw
11:55
the x prime axis.
11:57
It's going to look like,
12:00
it's going to look like this.
12:02
That right over there is the x prime axis.
12:04
Now at this point, you should find this mildly mind-blowing.
12:07
Actually, even more than mildly mind-blowing.
12:10
'Cause it's saying some pretty, pretty crazy things.
12:12
First of all, let's just make sure we know how to read this.
12:15
So for any event,
12:17
and now we're going to start thinking
12:18
in terms of spacetime,
12:20
although I'm still using different units for space and time,
12:23
but we'll address that in the future.
12:25
If I want to read its coordinates in my frame of reference,
12:27
well if I want to read its x coordinate,
12:29
I go parallel to the t axis,
12:31
and if I wanna read its t coordinate,
12:33
I go parallel to the x axis.
12:35
But for Sally's frame of reference,
12:36
well I essentially do the same thing.
12:38
If I want its x prime coordinates,
12:40
I go parallel to the t prime axis,
12:43
and if I want the t prime coordinates,
12:46
I go parallel to the x prime axis.
12:49
But what's really interesting,
12:51
and I'll go even deeper into this into the next videos,
12:55
that moment,
12:56
that moment right over here,
12:58
that from Sally's frame of reference,
13:01
it looks like it's simultaneous with her passing me up.
13:04
It looks like it's happening at t prime equals zero.
13:07
In fact, it is happening at t prime equals zero.
13:08
From her frame of reference,
13:09
it's happening at t prime equals zero.
13:12
From our frame of reference,
13:14
it is happening after Sally passes us up.
13:17
Notice, it is happening at t equals some positive value.
13:20
It's not happening at t equals zero.
13:23
So this is starting to get a little bit whacky.
13:25
One second, and simultaneous, time, and space,
13:30
and things being simultaneous,
13:33
we're not going to agree on those,
13:35
depending on which frame of reference we're in.

khan_video_WLGTx6sSIOc_195341,How do you know that one carbon atom does have three hydrogen and the other has 1?,Essay,"•
0:00
- In the last video, we saw how to draw dot structures
0:03
for molecules with single covalent bonds.
0:05
In this video, we'll talk about multiple covalent bonds,
0:08
and so we start the same way we did in the last video.
0:10
If I wanted to draw out a dot structure for C2H4,
0:13
I would find carbon over here,
0:16
and once again, carbon in is group four,
0:18
so it has four valence electrons,
0:20
so I'm gonna go ahead and put in once carbon
0:22
with four valence electrons,
0:24
and I know I have another carbon in my dot structure.
0:27
It also has four valence electrons, like that,
0:29
and so immediately, I can see there's going to be
0:32
a single covalent bond between my two carbons, like that.
0:36
Four hydrogens, and I know that, since hydrogen is
0:39
in group one on our periodic table,
0:43
hydrogen has one valence electron.
0:45
Now, it makes sense to go ahead and put two hydrogens
0:47
on each carbon, so if I put one hydrogen over here
0:51
and then another hydrogen on this carbon,
0:54
I have two more hydrogens, and so I can go ahead
0:56
and put in those two hydrogens on the carbon on the right.
0:59
When I connect my dots, I can see that I have a bond
1:02
between carbon and hydrogen here,
1:05
and this is not the correct dot structure,
1:07
because if you count up the number of electrons
1:10
around carbons, let's go ahead and do it.
1:12
Let's do the carbon on the left.
1:14
I'm going to get two,
1:16
four,
1:18
six,
1:19
and then seven electrons,
1:21
so with only seven electrons around each carbon,
1:24
carbon does not satisfy the octet rule,
1:27
so the only way for carbon to get
1:29
an octet of electrons around it would be
1:32
if this magenta electron moved in here,
1:36
and this electron moves in here
1:38
to form a double covalent bond between those two carbons,
1:42
and so now, instead of only having one bond
1:45
between those carbons, now there are going to be two bonds
1:48
around it like that,
1:49
so I can go ahead and put in my hydrogens,
1:51
so two on each carbon,
1:52
and that is the correct dot structure
1:54
for ethene or ethylene.
1:56
We can double check by checking the octet rule here,
2:00
so if I look at each carbon, there would be two electrons,
2:03
four,
2:04
six,
2:06
and then eight,
2:07
so each carbon is following the octet rule
2:09
for my dot structure.
2:11
Let's do one for CH20,
2:14
so if I want to draw the dot structure
2:17
for the molecular formula CH20,
2:21
once again, I start with carbon in the center,
2:24
so four valence electrons like that,
2:27
and two hydrogens, so I'll just put one hydrogen over here
2:31
on the left and another hydrogen over here on the right.
2:34
Oxygen, let's go back to our organic periodic table
2:37
to refresh our memory about how many valence electrons
2:41
oxygen will have, and we can see
2:44
it's in group six over here, so six valence electrons,
2:47
so I can go ahead and put in my six valence electrons
2:51
for oxygen, and so we'll go one,
2:54
and then two,
2:56
and then three,
2:58
and then four,
3:00
and then five,
3:02
and then six, like that.
3:04
And when I start connecting my bonds here,
3:07
I know there's a bond between carbon and hydrogen
3:10
on the left and I know there's a bond
3:11
between carbon and hydrogen on the right.
3:12
I know there's a bond between this carbon and oxygen,
3:16
and unfortunately, I still don't have an octet of electrons
3:19
around my carbon or around my oxygen, alright?
3:22
So if I go ahead and highlight the electrons around carbon,
3:24
once again, I have two,
3:26
four,
3:28
six,
3:29
and then seven,
3:30
so I still don't have an octet of electrons around carbon,
3:33
and so I need to share an electron with oxygen here,
3:37
so carbon is going to contribute an electron,
3:40
and oxygen is going to contribute an electron like that,
3:43
and so, instead of a single bond between carbon and oxygen,
3:46
there's actually going to be a double bond, like that.
3:49
There's still two lone pairs of electrons
3:51
around that oxygen, and then I have my two hydrogens
3:54
coming off of my carbon like that,
3:57
so that is the correct dot structure for formaldehyde.
4:00
We can go ahead and double check an octet.
4:02
Alright, so if I look at this carbon here,
4:04
it's gonna be two,
4:06
four,
4:07
six,
4:08
and eight, and obviously, there's also an octet
4:11
around that oxygen as well,
4:12
so this is the dot structure for formaldehyde.
4:16
Let's do one more example
4:19
of a molecule with a multiple covalent bond, so C2H2.
4:24
So, once again, carbon with four valence electrons,
4:27
and I have two carbons this time,
4:30
so I go ahead and put in my second carbon
4:31
with four valence electrons like that.
4:34
I can see, immediately, a single covalent bond
4:37
between my two carbons.
4:38
Now I have two hydrogens,
4:40
so once again, I'm gonna put one hydrogen
4:42
on the carbon on the left and connect that
4:45
for a single covalent bond,
4:46
and it would make sense to put the other hydrogen
4:48
over here on the right and connect that for another bond.
4:51
Now, once again, if I look at the valence electrons
4:54
for carbon, I have a total of two,
4:57
four,
4:58
five,
5:00
and six, and carbon wants to get to eight.
5:02
It wants an octet, so it needs to share two more electrons,
5:07
so each carbon needs to share two more electrons
5:09
so each carbon can get to an octet,
5:11
so we're gonna go ahead and move this electron in here,
5:14
and this electron in here,
5:16
and then we'd also have to move these electrons
5:19
in here as well,
5:20
so we're going to end up with a triple,
5:22
a triple bond between my two carbon atoms there.
5:26
So, if I go ahead and show now three bonds
5:29
between my two carbons, and then a hydrogen on either side,
5:32
we can double check the octets on the carbon here,
5:35
so I'll get out the magenta again,
5:37
so two,
5:38
four,
5:39
six,
5:40
and eight, so there is now an octet,
5:43
and so this is the correct dot structure
5:45
for ethyne or acetylene,
5:47
and so we've seen how to draw molecules
5:49
with single and multiple covalent bonds,
5:52
and next we're going to talk about

teded_1065,"It is apparent that the spent radioactive fuel of nuclear reactors needs to be safely stored here on Earth, however the radioactive lifetimes of the fuel products may long outlast the lifetime of social and political creations like states and nations. What new challenges for international cooperation might this unique storage problem pose?",open-ended,"On a December afternoon in Chicago
during the middle of World War II,
scientists cracked open the nucleus
at the center of the uranium atom
and turned nuclear mass into energy
over and over again.
They did this by creating 
for the first time
a chain reaction inside a new
engineering marvel:
the nuclear reactor.
Since then, the ability to mine great
amounts of energy from uranium nuclei
has led some to bill nuclear power
as a plentiful utopian
source of electricity.
A modern nuclear reactor generates enough
electricity from one kilogram of fuel
to power an average American household
for nearly 34 years.
But rather than dominate the global
electricity market,
nuclear power has declined from
an all-time high of 18% in 1996
to 11% today.
And it's expected to drop further
in the coming decades.
What happened to the great promise
of this technology?
It turns out nuclear power 
faces many hurdles,
including high construction costs
and public opposition.
And behind these problems lie 
a series of unique engineering challenges.
Nuclear power relies on the fission
of uranium nuclei
and a controlled chain reaction
that reproduces this splitting
in many more nuclei.
The atomic nucleus is densely packed
with protons and neutrons
bound by a powerful nuclear force.
Most uranium atoms have a total
of 238 protons and neutrons,
but roughly one in every 140
lacks three neutrons,
and this lighter isotope is less
tightly bound.
Compared to its more abundant cousin,
a strike by a neutron easily splits
the U-235 nuclei
into lighter, radioactive elements
called fission products,
in addition to two to three neutrons,
gamma rays,
and a few neutrinos.
During fission, some nuclear mass
transforms into energy.
A fraction of the newfound energy
powers the fast-moving neutrons,
and if some of them strike uranium nuclei,
fission results in a second 
larger generation of neutrons.
If this second generation of neutrons
strike more uranium nuclei,
more fission results in an even
larger third generation, and so on.
But inside a nuclear reactor,
this spiraling chain reaction is tamed
using control rods
made of elements that capture excess 
neutrons and keep their number in check.
With a controlled chain reaction,
a reactor draws power steadily
and stably for years.
The neutron-led chain reaction
is a potent process driving nuclear power,
but there's a catch that can result
in unique demands 
on the production of its fuel.
It turns out, most of the neutrons emitted
from fission have too much kinetic energy
to be captured by uranium nuclei.
The fission rate is too low
and the chain reaction fizzles out.
The first nuclear reactor built in Chicago
used graphite as a moderator
to scatter and slow down 
neutrons just enough
to increase their capture by uranium
and raise the rate of fission.
Modern reactors commonly use
purified water as a moderator,
but the scattered neutrons are still
a little too fast.
To compensate 
and keep up the chain reaction,
the concentration of U-235 is enriched
to four to seven times 
its natural abundance.
Today, enrichment is often done by
passing a gaseous uranium compound
through centrifuges
to separate lighter U-235 
from heavier U-238.
But the same process can be continued
to highly enrich U-235
up to 130 times its natural abundance
and create an explosive chain reaction
in a bomb.
Methods like centrifuge processing
must be carefully regulated
to limit the spread of bomb-grade fuel.
Remember, only a fraction 
of the released fission energy
goes into speeding up neutrons.
Most of the nuclear power goes into the
kinetic energy of the fission products.
Those are captured inside the reactor
as heat by a coolant,
usually purified water.
This heat is eventually used to drive
an electric turbine generator by steam
just outside the reactor.
Water flow is critical 
not only to create electricity,
but also to guard against the most dreaded
type of reactor accident,
the meltdown.
If water flow stops because a pipe
carrying it breaks,
or the pumps that push it fail,
the uranium heats up very quickly
and melts.
During a nuclear meltdown,
radioactive vapors escape 
into the reactor,
and if the reactor fails to hold them,
a steel and concrete containment building
is the last line of defense.
But if the radioactive gas pressure
is too high,
containment fails and the gasses
escape into the air,
spreading as far 
and wide as the wind blows.
The radioactive fission products
in these vapors
eventually decay into stable elements.
While some decay in a few seconds,
others take hundreds 
of thousands of years.
The greatest challenge 
for a nuclear reactor
is to safely contain these products
and keep them from harming humans
or the environment.
Containment doesn't stop mattering
once the fuel is used up.
In fact, it becomes an even greater
storage problem.
Every one to two years,
some spent fuel is removed from reactors
and stored in pools of water 
that cool the waste
and block its radioactive emissions.
The irradiated fuel is a mix of uranium
that failed to fission,
fission products,
and plutonium, a radioactive material
not found in nature.
This mix must be isolated from
the environment
until it has all safely decayed.
Many countries propose deep time storage
in tunnels drilled far underground,
but none have been built,
and there's great uncertainty about
their long-term security.
How can a nation that has existed
for only a few hundred years
plan to guard plutonium
through its radioactive half-life
of 24,000 years?
Today, many nuclear power plants
sit on their waste, instead,
storing them indefinitely on site.
Apart from radioactivity, there's an
even greater danger with spent fuel.
Plutonium can sustain a chain reaction
and can be mined from the waste
to make bombs.
Storing spent fuel is thus not only
a safety risk for the environment,
but also a security risk for nations.
Who should be the watchmen to guard it?
Visionary scientists from the early years
of the nuclear age
pioneered how to reliably tap 
the tremendous amount of energy
inside an atom -
as an explosive bomb
and as a controlled power source
with incredible potential.
But their successors have learned
humbling insights
about the technology's not-so-utopian
industrial limits.
Mining the subatomic realm makes for
complex, expensive, and risky engineering.

(music)
0:27
Animals are made up of your
0:28
run-of-the-mill eukaryotic cells.
0:30
These are called eukaryotic because they
0:32
have a true kernel in the Greek, a good nucleus.
0:36
That contains the DNA and calls the shots
0:38
for the rest of the cell, also containing
0:40
a bunch of organelles.
0:41
There's a bunch of different kinds of organelles
0:43
and they all have very specific functions.
0:45
All of this is surrounded by the cell membrane.
0:48
Of course, plants are eukaryotic cells too,
0:50
but theirs are set up a little bit differently.
0:51
Of course, they have oranelles that allow them
0:53
to make their own food, which is super nice.
0:55
We don't have those.
0:56
Also, their cell membrane is actually a cell wall
0:58
that's made of cellulose.
0:59
It's rigid which is why plants can't dance.
1:01
If you want to know all about plant cells,
1:03
we did a whole video on it and you can click on it hit here,
1:06
if it's online yet; it might not be.
1:08
A lot of the stuff in this video is going to apply
1:10
to all eukaryotic cells, which includes
1:12
plants and fungi and protists.
1:14
Rigid cell walls, that's cool and all,
1:16
but one of the reasons that animals
1:17
have been so successful is that their
1:19
flexible membrane, in addition to allowing
1:21
them the ability to dance, gives animals
1:23
the flexibility to create a bunch of different
1:24
cell types and organ types and tissue types
1:27
that could never be possible in a plant.
1:29
Cell walls that protect plants and give them structure
1:31
prevent them from evolving complicated nerve structures

They move around with cilia and flagella and that kind of thing.
2:01
Way back in 1665, British scientist
2:04
Robert Hooke discovered cells with his
2:06
kind of crude beta version microscope.
2:08
He called them cells because they looked like
2:10
bare, spartan Monk's bedrooms with
2:13
not much going on inside.
2:14
Hooke was a smart guy and everything,
2:16
but he could not have been more wrong
2:18
about what was going on inside of a cell.
2:19
There is a whole lot going on inside of a eukaryotic cell.
2:22
It's more like a city than a Monk's cell.
2:24
In fact, let's go with that.
2:25
A cell is like a city.
2:27
It has defined geographical limits,
2:29
a ruling government, power plants, roads,
2:31
waste treatment plants, a police force,
2:32
industry, all the things a booming metropolis
2:35
needs to run smoothly.
2:36
But, this city does not have one of those
2:38
hippy governments where everybody votes on stuff
2:40
and talks things out at town hall meetings
2:42
and crap like that.
2:42
Nope.
2:43
Think fascist Italy circa 1938.
2:46
Think Kim Jong-Il's, I mean Kim Jong-Un's
2:48
North Korea and you might be getting a closer
2:50
idea of how eukaryotic cells do their business.
2:52
Let's start out with city limits.
2:53
As you approach the city of Eukaryopolis,
2:56
there's a chance that you will notice something
2:58
that a traditional city never has,
3:00
which is either cilia or flagella.
3:01
Some eukaryotic cells have either one or the other
3:04
of these structures; cilia being a bunch
3:06
of tiny little arms that wriggle around,
3:07
flagella being one long whip-like tail.
3:10
Some cells have neither.
3:11
Sperm cells, for instance, have flagella
3:13
and our lungs and throat cells have cilia
3:15
that push mucus up and out of our lungs.
3:17
Cilia and flagella are made out of long
3:19
protein fibers called microtubules,
3:21
and they both have the same basic structure;
3:22
nine pairs of microtubules forming a ring
3:25
around two central microtubles,
3:26
this is often called the 9+2 structure.
3:29
Anyway, that's just so you know when you're
3:31
approaching the city, watch out
3:32
for the cilia and flagella.
3:34
If you make it past the cilia, you will encounter
3:36
what is called a cell membrane, which is
3:38
a kind of squishy, not rigid plant cell wall,
3:41
which totally encloses the city and all of its contents.
3:44
It's also in charge of monitoring
3:46
what comes in and out of the cell,
3:47
kind of like the fascist border police.
3:49
The cell membrane has selective pemeability,
3:51
meaning that it can choose what molecules
3:53
come in and out of the cells, for the most part.
3:56
I did an entire video on this
3:58
which you can check out right here.
4:01
The landscape of Eukaryopolis, important to note,
4:03
is kind of wet and squishy; it's a bit of a swampland.
4:07
Each eukaryotic cell is filled with a solution
4:09
of water and nutrients called cytoplasm.
4:11
Inside of the cytoplasm is a scaffolding
4:14
called the cytoskeleton.
4:15
It's basically just a bunch of protein strands
4:17
that reinforce the cell.
4:18
Centrosomes are a special part of this reinforcement.
4:21
They assemble long microtubules out of proteins
4:23
that act like steel girders that hold
4:25
all the cities' building together.
4:26
The cytoplasm provides the infrastructure
4:28
necessary for all the organelles to do all of their
4:31
awesome amazing business, with the notable exception
4:33
of the nucleus, which has its own kind of cytoplasm
4:36
called the nucleoplasm, which is a more luxurious, premium
4:40
environment befitting the cell's beloved leader.
4:43
We'll get to that in a minute.
4:43
First, let's talk about the cell's highway system.
4:46
The endoplasmic reticulum, or just ER,
4:48
are organelles that create a network of membranes
4:50
that carry stuff around the cell.
4:52
These membranes are phospolipid bilayers
4:53
same as in the cell membrane.
4:54
There are two types of ER.
4:56
There's the rough and the smooth;
4:57
fairly similar, but slightly different shapes,
4:59
slightly different functions.
5:00
The rough ER looks all bumpy because it has
5:02
ribosomes attached to it and the smooth ER
5:04
doesn't, so it's a smooth network of tubes.
5:06
The smooth ER acts as a kind of factory warehouse
5:09
in the cell city.
5:10
It contains enzymes that help with the creation
5:11
of important lipids, which you'll recall
5:13
from our talk about biological molecules,
5:15
phospolipids and steroids that turn out to be sex hormones.
5:19
Other enzymes in the smooth ER specialize in detoxifying
5:22
substance like noxious stuff derived from drugs
5:25
and alcohol which they do by adding
5:27
a carboxyl group to them, making them soluble in water.
5:30
Finally, the smooth ER also stores ions in solutions
5:32
that the cell may need later on, especially
5:34
sodium ions which are used for energy in muscle cells.
5:37
The smooth ER helps makes lipids while the rough ER
5:40
helps in the synthesis and packaging of proteins.
5:42
Those proteins are created by another
5:45
type of organelle, the ribosome.
5:47
Ribosomes can float freely throughout the cytoplasm
5:49
or be attached to the nuclear envelope
5:51
which is where they're spat out from.
5:53
Their job is to assemble amino acids into polypeptides.
5:57
As the ribosome builds an amino acid chain,
5:59
the chain is pushed into the ER.
6:02
When the protein chain is complete,
6:03
the ER pinches it off and sends it to the golgi apparatus.
6:07
In the city that is the cell, the golgi is the post office,
6:10
processing proteins and packaging them up
6:13
before sending them wherever they need to go.
6:15
Calling it an apparatus makes it sound like a bit
6:17
of complicated machinery, which it kind of is
6:20
because it's made up of these stacks
6:22
of membranous layers that are sometimes called golgi bodies.
6:25
The golgi bodies can cut up large proteins
6:28
into smaller hormones and can combine
6:30
proteins with carbohydrates to make various molecules,
6:32
like, for instance, snot.
6:34
The bodies package these little goodies
6:36
into sacks called vassicles which have
6:37
phopholipid walls just like the main cell membrane,
6:40
then ship them out either to other parts of the cell
6:43
or outside the cell wall.
6:44
We learn more about how vessicles do this
6:46
in the next episode of Crash Course.
6:49
The golgi bodies also put the finishing touches
6:50
on the lysosomes.
6:52
Lysosomes are basically the waste treatment plants
6:54
and recycling centers of the city.
6:56
These organelles are basically sacks full of enzymes
6:58
that break down cellular waste and debris
7:01
from outside of the cell and turn it into
7:03
simple compounds which are transferred into
7:05
the cytoplasm as new cell building materials.
7:07
Now, finally, let us talk about the nucleus,
7:10
the beloved leader.
7:11
The nucleus is a highly specialized organelle
7:14
that lives in its own double-membraned,
7:16
high security compound with its buddy the nucleolus.
7:19
Within the cell, the nucleus is in charge
7:21
in a major way, because it stores the cell's DNA.
7:24
It has all the information the cell needs to do its job.
7:27
The nucleus makes all the laws for the city
7:30
and orders all the other organelles around
7:32
telling them how and when to grow,
7:33
what to metabolize,
7:34
what proteins to synthesize,
7:36
how and when to divide.
7:37
The nucleus does all this by using the information
7:39
blueprinted in its DNA to build proteins
7:41
that will facilitate a specific job getting done.
7:45
For instance, on January 1, 2012
7:48
let's say a liver cell needs to help break down
7:51
an entire bottle of champagne.
7:53
The nucleus in that liver cell would start
7:55
telling the cell to make alcohol dehydrogenase,
7:58
which is the enzyme that makes alcohol not alcohol anymore.
8:01
This protein synthesis business is complicated.
8:04
Lucky for you we will have, or may already have,
8:08
an entire video about how it happens.
8:10
The nucleus holds its precious DNA
8:12
along some proteins in a web-like substance
8:14
called a chromatin.
8:16
When it comes time for the cell to split,
8:18
the chromatin gathers into rod-shaped chromosomes,
8:21
each of which holds DNA molecules.
8:23
Difference species of animals
8:25
have different numbers of chromosomes.
8:26
We humans have 46.
8:28
Fruitflies have eight.
8:29
Hedgehogs, which are adorable, but less
8:31
complex than humans, have 90.
8:33
The nucleolus, which lives inside of the nucleus,
8:36
is the only organelle not enveloped by its own membrane.
8:39
It's just a gooey splotch of stuff within the nucleus.
8:43
It's main job is creating ribosomal RNA, or rRNA,
8:46
which it then combines with some proteins
8:48
to form the basic units of ribosomes.
8:50
Once these units are done, the nucleolus
8:52
spits them out of the nuclear envelope
8:54
where they are fully assembled into ribosomes.
8:57
The nucleus then sends orders in the form
8:59
of messenger RNA, or mRNA, to those ribosomes,
9:02
which are the henchmen that carry out the orders
9:05
in the rest of the cell.
9:06
How exactly the ribosomes do this
9:08
is immensely complex and awesome;
9:11
so awesome, in fact, that we're going to give it
9:13
the full Crash Course treatment; an entire episode.
9:16
Now, for what is, totally, objectively speaking, of course,
9:19
the coolest part of the animal cell,
9:21
its power plants, the mitochondria, the smooth
9:25
oblong organelles where the amazing
9:28
and super important process of respiration takes place.
9:31
This is where energy is derived from carbohydrates,
9:34
fats and other fuels and is converted into
9:36
adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, which is like
9:39
the main currency that drives life in Eukaryopolis.
9:42
You can learn more about ATP and respiration
9:44
in an episode that we did on that.
9:46
Now, of course, some cells like muscle cells
9:48
or neuron cells need a lot more power than
9:50
the average cell in the body, so those cells
9:52
have a lot more mitochondria per cell.
9:55
Maybe the coolest thing about mitochondria
9:57
is that long ago animal cells didn't have them.
10:00
They existed as their own sort of bacterial cell.
10:04
One day, one of these things ended up inside
10:07
of an animal cell, probably because the animal
10:09
cell was trying to eat it, but instead of eating it,
10:11
it realized that this thing was really super smart
10:14
and good at turning food into energy, and it just kept it.
10:19
It stayed around.
10:20
To this day they sort of act like their own
10:21
separate organisms.
10:23
They do their own thing within the cell.
10:25
The replicate themselves.
10:26
They even contain a small amount of DNA.
10:28
What may be even more awesome, if that's possible,
10:30
is that mitochondria are in the egg cell
10:34
when an egg gets fertilized.
10:36
Those mitochondria have DNA.
10:37
Because mitochondria replicate themselves
10:39
in a separate fashion, it doesn't get mixed
10:41
with the DNA of the father.
10:42
It's just the mother's mitochondrial DNA.
10:44
That means that your and my mitochondrial DNA
10:46
is exactly the same as the mitochondrial DNA of our mothers.
10:50
Because this special DNA is isolated in this way,
10:53
scientists can actually track back and back and back
10:55
and back to a single mitochondrial Eve
10:58
who lived about 200,000 years ago in Africa.
11:01
All of that complication and mystery and beauty
11:03
in one of the cells of your body.
11:07
It's complicated, yes, but worth understanding.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,1aJBToJrlvA,
khan_video_bmjg7lq4m4o_58541,"What would the empirical formula be for a hydrogen molecule (H2), or other single element molecules?",Essay,"•
0:00
- What I want to do in this video is think about
0:02
the different ways to represent a molecule.
0:06
So the most obvious way is its name.
0:10
So, for example, you could be referring to
0:13
a molecule of benzene.
0:16
Benzene.
0:17
But just the word ""benzene"" tells you very little
0:20
about what actually makes up this molecule.
0:22
And there's other naming conventions that do
0:24
give more information, but you might say,
0:26
well, I actually want to know more about
0:28
the actual particular elements that make it up.
0:31
Well, that might be, in that case,
0:34
it might be useful to move up to the empirical formula.
0:37
Empirical, empirical.
0:41
Empirical.
0:44
Empirical formula.
0:46
And you might be thinking, what does
0:48
empirical mean?
0:50
In general, the word ""empirical"" is referring to something
0:53
that comes from observation or comes through experiments.
0:57
If you could say hey, you know, I from empirical evidence
1:01
I now believe this, this means that you saw data.
1:03
This means that you have some observations that
1:06
make you think this new thing.
1:08
The reason why we call what I'm about to write down
1:10
the empirical formula, is because early chemists,
1:14
they can't look, they weren't able to look at
1:16
just one molecule, but they could at least come up
1:18
with, they could observe the ratios of the different
1:22
elements that they had in a molecule.
1:25
So an empirical formula gives you a ratio
1:27
of the elements in the molecule.
1:30
So an empirical formula for benzene is ...
1:34
It is ...
1:37
One carbon for
1:39
every, for every hydrogen.
1:43
Now you might say, OK, that's nice,
1:45
I now know that if I'm dealing with benzene
1:47
I have one carbon for every hydrogen
1:48
or one hydrogen for every carbon,
1:50
but what does, how many of each of these do you actually
1:53
have in a benzene molecule?
1:58
To answer that question, that's when you would want
2:00
to go to the molecular formula.
2:03
Molecular.
2:05
Molecular formula.
2:09
And the molecular formula for benzene, which is
2:11
now going to give us more information than
2:13
the empirical formula, tells us that each benzene
2:16
molecule has six hydrogens, and,
2:21
sorry, six carbons and six,
2:24
(laughs) I'm really having trouble today,
2:27
six hydrogens, (laughs) six carbons, and,
2:31
six hydrogens.
2:32
Now, the ratio is still one to one, you get that
2:34
right over here, it's very easy to go from
2:36
a molecular formula to an empirical formula.
2:39
You essentially are losing information.
2:41
You're just saying the ratio, OK, look,
2:43
it's a ratio of six to six,
2:44
which is the same thing as one to one.
2:46
If we wanted to, we could write this as C one
2:51
H one just like that to show us that the ratio
2:53
for every carbon we have a hydrogen.
2:56
And we see that that's actually the case in one molecule,
2:58
for every six carbons you have six hydrogens,
3:01
which is still a one to one ratio.
3:03
That may not satisfy you, you might say,
3:05
well, OK, but how are these six carbons
3:07
and six hydrogens actually structured?
3:10
I want more information.
3:12
And for that, you would wanna go to
3:15
a structural formula.
3:17
Structural formula,
3:20
which will actually give you the structure,
3:23
or start to give you the structure of a benzene molecule.
3:26
A benzene molecule would be drawn like...
3:30
So you would have six carbons in a hexagon.
3:33
So one, going to write this way, one, two,
3:37
three, four, five, six
3:42
carbons in a hexagon just like that.
3:44
And then you have a double bond, every other
3:47
of these bonds on the hexagon is a double bond.
3:51
Each of these carbons are also attached to a hydrogen,
3:54
also bonded to a hydrogen.
3:56
Each of these lines that I'm drawing,
3:58
this is a bond, it's a covalent bond,
4:01
we go into much more depth in other videos on that,
4:03
but it's a sharing of electrons, and that's what keeps
4:05
these carbons near each other and what keeps
4:07
the hydrogens kind of tied to each, or,
4:09
the hydrogens tied to the carbons and the carbons
4:11
tied to the hydrogens.
4:12
So let me draw it just like this.
4:15
And this is only one variant of a structural,
4:19
it's hard to see this one I just drew,
4:22
so let me see if I can do a little bit...
4:24
Oh, that's about as good, hopefully you see there's
4:26
a hydrogen there, and there's a hydrogen right over there.
4:28
This is one variant of a structural formula,
4:30
some structural formulas will actually give you
4:32
some 3D information, will tell you whether a molecule
4:35
is kind of popping in or out of the page.
4:37
Others might not be as explicit,
4:40
once you go into organic chemistry
4:43
chains of carbons are just done, they're just ...
4:47
You might see something like this for benzene,
4:50
where the carbons are implicit as the vertex of each,
4:54
there's an implicit carbon at each of these vertices,
4:57
and then you say, OK, carbon's gotta have,
4:59
not gotta, but it's typically going to have
5:01
four bonds in its stable state, I only see one, two, three.
5:05
Well, if it's not drawn, then it must be a hydrogen.
5:07
That's actually the convention that people
5:09
use in organic chemistry.
5:10
So there's multiple ways to do a structural formula,
5:13
but this is a very typical one right over here.
5:16
As you see, I'm just getting more and more
5:18
and more information as I go from empirical
5:20
to molecular to structural formula.
5:23
Now, I want to make clear, that empirical
5:25
formulas and molecular formulas aren't always different
5:29
if the ratios are actually, also show the
5:33
actual number of each of those elements
5:36
that you have in a molecule.
5:37
A good example of that would be water.
5:41
Let me do water.
5:43
Let me do this in a different color that I,
5:45
well, I've pretty much already used every color.
5:48
Water.
5:50
So water we all know, for every two hydrogens,
5:54
for every two hydrogens, and since I
5:56
already decided to use blue for hydrogen let me
5:58
use blue again for hydrogen,
6:00
for every two hydrogens you have an oxygen.
6:05
You have an oxygen.
6:06
It just so happens to be, what I just wrote down
6:09
I kind of thought of in terms of empirical formula,
6:11
in terms of ratios, but that's actually the case.
6:14
A molecule of hydrogen, sorry, a molecule of water
6:18
has exactly two hydrogens and,
6:21
and one oxygen.
6:23
If you want to see the structural formula,
6:25
you're probably familiar with it or you
6:27
might be familiar with it.
6:28
Each of those oxygens in a water molecule
6:33
are bonded to two hydrogens,
6:36
are bonded to two hydrogens.
6:38
So hopefully this at least begins to
6:42
appreciate different ways of referring to
6:44
or representing a molecule.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,bmjg7lq4m4o,

0:00
- [Voiceover] I could imagine
0:00
that even the earliest human beings,
0:02
or possibly pre-human beings
0:04
had asked themselves the questions,
0:06
""Why am I here? What is the nature of reality?
0:10
""Why is the universe organized the way that it is?""
0:13
And these questions are what we attempt to answer
0:17
in the field of physics...
0:21
In the field of physics,
0:22
which you could view
0:23
maybe right after mathematics
0:24
as the purest of the sciences.
0:27
So you have math, which is very pure,
0:30
and then on that foundation of math
0:33
you have physics.
0:34
And physics really does try to use that mathematics
0:39
along with some core ideas
0:41
to explain the phenomena,
0:43
all the phenomena,
0:44
of the universe.
0:45
And physicists will the the first to admit
0:47
that they are just beginning to understand
0:49
the nature of reality,
0:51
the nature of everything around us.
0:53
Now a lot of times, we think physics
0:54
is only limited to things like cosmological phenomena
0:59
or getting rockets into space,
1:01
or how waves move or building structures.
1:04
But physics is the foundation for
1:07
all of the other sciences.
1:09
When we think about chemistry,
1:10
when we think about chemistry,
1:12
which is at the end of the day
1:13
interactions between atoms,
1:15
those interactions are really physics-based interactions.
1:18
So chemistry, chemistry is actually laid down
1:22
on a foundation of physics.
1:25
And then even when we think about ourselves,
1:28
our bodies, even our consciousness, our brains,
1:30
it really all boils down to chemistry and physics.
1:35
It boils down to interactions between atoms
1:37
and even mechanical properties of our bodies.
1:40
And so even biology,
1:43
even what we are,
1:45
is built on a foundation of chemistry.
1:49
So this is biology right over here,
1:53
which is built on a foundation of physics,
1:54
which is highly dependent on some of the math
1:57
that you've been learning your whole life
1:59
and that you will continue to learn.
2:00
And that fundamental question that you might have said,
2:03
""Well you know, hey, why am I learning this math?""
2:04
Well one, 'cause the math is beautiful,
2:06
but also you will see that it starts to,
2:08
in almost the most pure way,
2:10
describe the structure of the universe.
2:13
And we're going to see that more and more and more
2:15
as we go into physics.
2:17
All of this complex phenomena
2:19
that you see around us,
2:20
whether we're looking at a galaxy
2:21
or we're looking at ocean waves,
2:22
or we're looking at even biological systems,
2:25
we'll see that a shocking amount of them
2:28
can start to be described using some fairly elegant
2:31
mathematics that we can build on
2:33
and continue to build on.
2:34
Simple or elegant mathematics
2:36
like force is equal to mass times acceleration.
2:40
And we're gonna talk about force and acceleration
2:43
as vector quantities.
2:45
We're gonna think about things like displacement,
2:48
and I'll put it as a vector quantity,
2:50
and we'll soon learn more about vector
2:52
and scalar quantities are.
2:53
Displacement is equal to velocity times time.
2:58
We'll learn things like accelaration
3:00
is equal to change in velocity over change in time.
3:04
What we'll see with even a handful
3:06
of very simple ideas like this.
3:09
We'll go into much more depth in future videos.
3:11
You can explain all sorts of complex phenomena.
3:14
And the one thing that I always loved about physics,
3:16
and I don't think it's always fully appreciated,
3:18
sometimes as you start to learn physics,
3:20
you'll see all these complicated formula,
3:21
all of these kind of complicated problems,
3:24
but it's super valuable to realize
3:27
it's all coming from some of these basic ideas.
3:29
Some of the things that I just mentioned,
3:31
these ideas, we're gonna explore ideas of energy.
3:34
We're going to explore Newton's laws.
3:37
We're going to explain, we're gonna think about
3:39
what are the the different types of forces out there,
3:41
and why they might, why they might actually exist.
3:44
At its essence, it's all about trying to
3:48
explain the complexity of the universe,
3:51
predict what is going to happen
3:52
based on simple ideas.
3:55
And that's what physics is all about.
3:58
Now when we think of physics,
3:59
it's been studied by humanity for a very, very long time.
4:02
In fact, I'm sure we don't know
4:04
who the first physicists were.
4:07
But some of the,
4:08
I guess you could say foundational thinkers
4:11
in physics are these gentlemen that I have here.
4:14
And this is just a...
4:15
You could kind of say
4:16
this is some of the most prominent thinkers in physics,
4:19
but this is by no means a complete list.
4:21
First and foremost, we'd wanna include Isaac Newton.
4:25
Especially when you start to study physics,
4:27
you're starting to understand the world
4:30
as Newton understood it.
4:31
He understood, ""Hey, you know,
4:32
""things don't fall to the ground
4:34
""just 'cause they always fall to,
4:35
""just 'cause that's the way the universe is.
4:37
""That's a force that's acting on it,
4:39
""and maybe that same force that's causing me
4:41
""to be stuck to my chair right now
4:44
""is what keeps Earth orbiting around the Sun
4:46
""or the moon orbiting around the Earth.""
4:50
He developed Law of Gravitation,
4:53
Newton's Laws, and we're going to study that
4:54
as we delve into our basic physics.
4:57
And what we'll see,
4:58
even classical mechanics,
5:00
the physics that Newton established,
5:03
can explain a large range of phenomena
5:05
with amazing precision.
5:07
But as we get into the early 20th century,
5:10
physics starts to get even more wild
5:12
as we start to look at the scales
5:14
of the super small,
5:15
and we have Max Planck giving us quantum mechanics,
5:18
and then we have Albert Einstein
5:20
as we start thinking about super fast speeds,
5:23
the speed of light, and we realize that's an absolute.
5:26
That nothing can travel faster than the speed of light,
5:29
which is this mind-boggling thing
5:31
that we have these notions
5:33
of general and special relativity,
5:35
and we start realizing that the universe
5:37
is in some ways more bizarre, and more mysterious,
5:40
and more fascinating than we ever could have imagined.
5:43
But all of the work, even to understand the modern physics
5:46
of Max Planck and Albert Einstein,
5:49
it's based on a lot of the core ideas
5:52
that were given to us by Isaac Newton,
5:54
even people before Isaac Newton.
5:56
So as you go into your study of physics,
5:58
and I'm kind of a physicist wannabe.
6:01
I wanted to be a physicist.
6:03
I imagined kind of,
6:04
'cause it's all about, we all wonder,
6:06
why are we here?
6:07
What is the nature of reality?
6:09
Why do things happen the way they are?
6:12
And these are the questions that physics
6:14
is attempting to answer.
6:16
And so as you go into your study of physics,
6:19
I wanna leave you with some quotes
6:21
from these three gentlemen.
6:22
So the first two are from Isaac Newton.
6:25
""Truth is ever to be found in simplicity,
6:29
""and not in the multiplicity and the confusion of things.""
6:32
And I really wanted to stress this,
6:34
because a lot of times in your studies,
6:35
you might be finding yourself memorizing formulas
6:37
and vocabulary, but that's,
6:41
if you're doing that, you're just at the very surface.
6:43
But if you really start to think about it,
6:45
really start to think about where these things come from,
6:48
it'll come to simpler and simpler and more intuitive ideas.
6:51
And then, you are getting closer to the truth.
6:54
Now, I love this second quote from Isaac Newton.
6:57
""I do not know what I may appear to...
7:00
""I do not know what I may appear to the world,
7:03
""but to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy
7:07
""playing on the seashore,
7:08
""and diverting myself in now and then
7:11
""finding a smoother pebble
7:12
""or prettier shell than ordinary,
7:14
""whilst the great ocean of truth
7:17
""lay all undiscovered before me.""
7:20
I like to imagine there's so much,
7:22
we, even though we think we know so much,
7:24
that we haven't even learned a small fraction
7:27
of how the universe really is.
7:29
And even a great thinker like Isaac Newton,
7:31
he recognized this.
7:32
He's like, ""Hey, I'm just kind of dabbling
7:34
""into the seashore and picking up a pebble there,
7:36
""but there's this vast ocean
7:37
""that I can't even begin to understand.""
7:39
You can even imagine alien civilizations
7:41
that are thousands of years ahead of us
7:43
technologically or scientifically
7:45
or even millions of years,
7:47
how they might perceive the reality,
7:49
and they might see us as ants
7:50
in that we are just beginning
7:51
to scrape the surface of how the world works.
7:55
This is from Max Planck.
7:56
""When you change the way you look at things,
7:59
""the things you look at change.""
8:01
And I find this to be pretty profound,
8:03
because it is true.
8:04
As you study physics,
8:05
you will start to see, whoa,
8:06
most of what we consider to be reality,
8:08
our current understanding is based
8:09
on these forces, but what are these forces?
8:11
And even these things that we think are solid,
8:14
when we go down to the atomic level,
8:15
we see it's mostly empty space
8:17
and it's really just the interaction of forces
8:18
that make us think that something
8:20
is solid or there or tangible is some way.
8:23
And you realize these very tangible things
8:24
aren't so tangible after all.
8:27
At the end of the day, the whole world
8:28
is just a mental model that we have.
8:31
In some ways,
8:32
it's an illusion
8:34
that our mind creates so that we can operate inside of it.
8:37
But we're just beginning to understand it.
8:40
And last but not least,
8:42
and there's actually a ton of great quotes
8:43
from these folks and others,
8:44
but especially Albert Einstein.
8:46
""The most beautiful experience
8:48
""we can have is the mysterious.
8:50
""It is the fundamental emotion that stands
8:53
""at the cradle of true art and true science.""
8:56
And I really want you to take this to heart
8:58
as you study your physics.
9:00
There will be times where we're going
9:02
to be building our tool kits.
9:03
What's a vector?
9:04
What's a scalar?
9:04
Going into some mathematics,
9:06
proving some formulas.
9:07
Those are the tool kits,
9:09
but then we're gonna try to understand
9:10
fundamental phenomena.
9:12
How does the universe actually work?
9:14
And if when we start to think about these,
9:16
you don't get a few chills on your skin,
9:18
a few goosebumps, and feel that the universe
9:21
is more mysterious than you thought,
9:23
then we're not studying physics
9:25
the say that we should be studying physics.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,uIojjqSm0m4,
khan_video_aubZU0iWtgI_47954,"When you talk about making the concentration equal on both sides, does that refer to making the ratio of solute to the solvent equal, or does it mean making the density of molecules on each sides equal?",Essay,"•
0:00
In this video, I want to cover several topics
0:02
that are all related.
0:03
And on some level, they're really simple, but on a whole
0:05
other level, they tend to confuse people a lot.
0:07
So hopefully we can make some headway.
0:10
So a good place to start-- let's just imagine that I have
0:12
some type of container here.
0:15
Let's say that's my container and inside of that container,
0:18
I have a bunch of water molecules.
0:21
It's just got a bunch of water molecules.
0:24
They're all rubbing against each other.
0:25
It's in its liquid form, this is liquid water.
0:27
and inside of the water molecules, I
0:30
have some sugar molecules.
0:33
Maybe I'll do sugar in this pink color.
0:35
So I have a bunch of sugar molecules right here.
0:40
I have many, many more water molecules though.
0:43
I want to make that clear.
0:49
Now in this type of situation, we call the thing that there's
0:55
more of, the solvent.
1:00
So in this case, there's more water molecules and you can
1:03
literally just view more as the number of molecules.
1:07
I'm not going to go into a whole discussion of moles and
1:10
all of that because you may or may not have been exposed to
1:13
that yet, but just imagine whatever there's more of,
1:15
that's what we're going to call the solvent.
1:17
So in this case, water is the solvent.
1:24
And whatever there is less of-- in this case, that is the
1:30
sugar-- that is considered the solute.
1:36
It doesn't have to be sugar.
1:37
It can be any molecule that there's less of, in the water,
1:40
in this case.
1:45
And we say that the sugar has been dissolved into the water.
2:03
And this whole thing right here, the combination of the
2:06
water and the sugar molecules, we call a solution.
2:10
We call this whole thing a solution.
2:14
And a solution has the solvent and the solute.
2:16
The solvent is water.
2:18
That's the thing doing the dissolving and the thing that
2:21
is dissolved is the sugar.
2:23
That's the solute.
2:24
Now all of this may or may not be review for you, but I'm
2:27
doing it for a reason-- because I want to talk about
2:32
the idea of a diffusion.
2:39
And the idea is actually pretty straightforward.
2:43
If I have, let's say, the same container.
2:46
Let me do it in a slightly different container here, just
2:49
to talk about diffusion.
2:50
We'll go back to water and sugar--
2:52
especially back to water.
2:54
Let's say we have a container here and let's say it just has
2:58
a bunch of-- let's say it just has some air particles in it.
3:00
It could be anything-- oxygen or carbon dioxide.
3:03
So let me just draw a couple of air molecules here.
3:07
So let's say that that is a gaseous-- just for the sake of
3:11
argument-- gaseous oxygen.
3:12
So each of this is an O2-- each of those, right?
3:14
And let's say that this is the current configuration, that
3:16
all of this is a vacuum here and that there's some
3:19
temperatures.
3:20
So these water molecules, they have some
3:22
type of kinetic energy.
3:25
They're moving in some type of random directions right there.
3:29
So my question is, what is going to happen in this type
3:34
of container?
3:35
Well, any of these guys are going to be randomly bumping
3:38
into each other.
3:39
They're more likely to bump into things in this down-left
3:43
direction than they are in the up-right direction.
3:45
So if this guy was happening to go in this down-left
3:47
direction, he's going to bump into something and then
3:50
ricochet into the up-right direction.
3:52
But in the up-right direction, there's
3:53
nothing to bounce into.
3:55
So in general, everything is moving in random directions,
3:57
but you're more likely to be able to move in
4:00
the rightward direction.
4:01
When you go to the left, you're more likely to bump
4:02
into something.
4:04
So it's almost common sense.
4:06
Over time, if you just let this system come to some type
4:09
of equilibrium-- I'm not going to go into detail
4:11
on what that means.
4:12
You can watch the thermodynamics videos if you'd
4:14
like to see that.
4:15
You'll eventually see the container will look
4:18
something like this.
4:19
I can't guarantee it.
4:20
There's some probability it would actually stay like this,
4:22
but very likely that those five particles are going to
4:25
get relatively spread out.
4:27
This is diffusion and so it's really just the spreading of
4:32
particles or molecules from high concentration to low
4:36
concentration areas, right?
4:39
In this case, the molecules are going to spread in that
4:41
direction from a high concentration to a low
4:43
concentration area.
4:45
Now you're saying, Sal, what is concentration?
4:47
And there's many ways to measure concentration and you
4:51
can go into molarity and molality and all of that.
4:54
But the very simple idea is, how much of that particle do
4:57
you have per unit space?
4:59
So here, you have a lot of those particles per unit space
5:02
and here you have very few of those
5:04
particles per unit space.
5:05
So this is a high concentration and that's a low
5:09
concentration.
5:09
So you could imagine other experiments like this.
5:12
You could imagine a solution like-- let's do
5:17
something like this.
5:21
Let's say I have two containers.
5:25
Let's go back to the solution situation.
5:27
This was a gas, but I started off with that example so let's
5:29
stay with that example.
5:31
So let's say that I have a door right there that's larger
5:35
than either the water or the sugar molecules.
5:38
On either side, I have a bunch of water molecules.
5:52
So I have a lot of water molecules.
5:53
So if I just had water molecules here-- they're all
5:55
bouncing around in random directions-- and so the odds
5:58
of a water molecule going this way, equivalent to odds of a
6:01
water molecule going that way, assuming that both sides have
6:04
the same level of water molecule, otherwise the
6:06
pressures would be different.
6:07
But let's say that the top of this is the same
6:10
as the top of this.
6:11
So there's no more pressure going in one
6:12
direction or another.
6:13
So if for whatever reason, a bunch more water molecules
6:17
were going in the rightward direction, then all of a
6:18
sudden this would fill up with more water and we know that
6:20
that isn't likely to occur.
6:22
So this is just two containers of water.
6:28
Now let's put some solute in it.
6:30
Let's dissolve some solute in it and let's say we do all the
6:33
dissolving on the left-hand side.
6:35
So we put some sugar molecules on the left-hand side.
6:40
And these are small enough to fit through this little pipe.
6:42
That's one assumption that I'm making.
6:44
So what's going to happen?
6:45
All of these things have some type of kinetic energy.
6:47
They're all bouncing around.
6:52
Well, over time, the water's going back and forth.
6:56
This water molecule might go that way.
6:57
That water molecule might go that way, but they net each
7:00
other out, but over time one of these big sugar molecules
7:03
will be going in just the right direction to go
7:06
through-- maybe this guy's, instead of going that
7:08
direction, he starts off going in that direction.
7:10
He goes just through this tunnel connecting the two
7:15
containers and he'll end up there, right?
7:18
And this guy will still be bouncing around.
7:20
There's some probability he goes back, but there's still
7:23
more sugar particles here than there.
7:25
So there's still more probability that one of these
7:31
guys will go to that side than one of these guys
7:33
will go to that side.
7:34
So you can imagine if you're doing this with gazillions of
7:36
particles-- I'm only doing it with four-- over time, the
7:40
particles will have spread out so that their concentrations
7:43
are roughly equal.
7:44
So that maybe you'll have two here over time.
7:46
But when you're only dealing with three or four or five
7:49
particles, there's some probability it doesn't happen,
7:51
but when you're doing it with a gazillion and they're super
7:53
small, it's a very, very, very high likelihood.
7:56
But anyway, this whole process-- we went from a
7:59
container of high concentration to a container
8:02
of low concentration and the particles would have spread
8:06
from the low concentration container to the high
8:08
concentration container.
8:09
So they diffused.
8:11
This is diffusion.
8:16
And just so that we learn some other words that tend to be
8:18
used with the idea of diffusion-- when we started
8:21
off, this had a higher concentration.
8:24
The left-hand side container had higher concentration.
8:33
It's all relative, right?
8:34
It's higher than this guy.
8:37
And this right here had a lower concentration.
8:42
And there are words for these things.
8:44
This solution with a high concentration is called a
8:47
hypertonic solution.
8:50
Let me write that in yellow.
8:58
Hyper, in general, meaning having a lot of something,
9:01
having too much of something.
9:02
And this lower concentration is hypotonic.
9:13
You might have heard maybe one of your relatives, if they
9:16
haven't had a meal in awhile say, I'm hypoglycemic.
9:20
That means that they have not-- they're feeling
9:22
lightheaded.
9:22
There's not enough sugar in their bloodstream and they
9:24
want to pass out so they want a meal.
9:26
If you just had a candy bar, maybe you're hyperglycemic--
9:29
or maybe you're just hyper in general.
9:32
So these are just good prefixes to know, but
9:35
hypertonic-- you have a lot of the solute.
9:38
You have a high concentration.
9:40
And then in hypotonic, not too much of the solute so you have
9:44
a low concentration.
9:46
These are good words to know.
9:47
So in general, diffusion-- if there's no barriers to the
9:51
diffusion like we had here, you will have the solute go
9:54
from a high concentration or hypertonic solution if they
9:58
can travel to a hypotonic solution, to a hypo, where the
10:03
concentration is lower.
10:05
Now let's do an interesting experiment here.
10:08
We've talked about diffusion and so far we've been talking
10:10
about the diffusion of the solute, right?
10:14
And in general-- and this is not always the case-- if you
10:17
want to be as general as possible, the solute is
10:19
whatever you have less of, the solvent is whatever
10:22
you have more of.
10:23
And the most common solvent tends to be water, but it
10:26
doesn't have to be water.
10:27
It could be some type of alcohol.
10:28
It could be mercury.
10:31
It could be a whole set of molecules, but water in most
10:34
biological or chemical systems tends to be the
10:38
most typical solvent.
10:39
It's what other things are dissolved into.
10:41
But what happens if we have a tunnel where the solute is too
10:46
big to travel, but water is small enough to travel?
10:51
Let's think about that situation.
10:55
In order to think about it, I'm going to do something
10:57
interesting.
10:58
Let's say we have a container here.
11:02
Actually, I won't even draw a container.
11:03
Let's just say we have an outside environment that has a
11:07
bunch of water.
11:09
This is the outside environment and then you have
11:12
some type of membrane.
11:19
Water can go in and out of this membrane.
11:22
So it's semi-permeable.
11:23
Well, it's permeable to water, but the solute cannot go
11:26
through the membrane.
11:27
So let's say that the solute is sugar.
11:28
So we have water on the outside and
11:33
also inside the membrane.
11:36
So these are little small water molecules.
11:39
This is a membrane right here.
11:43
And let's say that we have some sugar molecules again--
11:46
I'm just picking on sugar.
11:47
It could have been anything.
11:48
So we have some sugar molecules here that are just a
11:51
little bit bigger-- or they could be a lot bigger.
11:55
Actually, they're a lot bigger than water molecules.
11:57
You have a bunch of-- and I only draw four, but you have a
11:59
gazillion of them, right?
12:01
You have that much more water molecules.
12:03
I'm just trying to show you have more water molecules than
12:05
sugar molecules.
12:06
And this membrane is semi-permeable.
12:13
Permeable means it allows things to pass.
12:15
Semi-permeables means it's not completely permeable.
12:18
So semi-permeable-- in this context, I'm saying I allow
12:20
water to pass through the membrane.
12:22
So water can pass, but sugar cannot.
12:28
Sugar is too large.
12:35
So if we were to zoom in on the actual membrane itself--
12:39
maybe the membrane looks like this.
12:40
I'm going to zoom in on this membrane.
12:44
So it has little holes in the membrane, just like that.
12:48
And maybe the water molecules are about that size.
12:51
So they can go through those holes.
12:53
So the water molecules can go back and forth through the
12:56
holes, but the sugar molecules are about that big.
13:01
So they cannot go through that hole.
13:04
They're too big for this opening right here to go back
13:07
and forth between them.
13:08
Now what do you think is going to happen in this situation?
13:12
So first of all, let's use our terminology.
13:14
Remember, sugar is our solute.
13:15
Water is our solvent.
13:17
Semi-permeable membrane.
13:18
Which side of the membrane has a higher or lower
13:21
concentration of solute?
13:24
Well, the inside does.
13:25
The inside is hypertonic.
13:32
The outside has a lower
13:33
concentration so it's hypotonic.
13:44
Now, if these openings were big enough, based on what we
13:47
just talked about-- these guys are bouncing around, water is
13:51
travelling in either direction, and equal
13:53
probability or-- actually I'm going to talk
13:56
about that in a second.
13:58
If everything was wide open, it would be equal probability,
14:01
but if it was wide open, these guys eventually would bounce
14:03
their ways over to this side and you'd probably end up with
14:06
equal concentrations eventually.
14:08
And so you would have your traditional diffusion, where
14:10
high concentration of solute to low
14:13
concentrations of solute.
14:14
But in this case, these guys-- they can't
14:17
fit through the hole.
14:18
Only water can go back and forth.
14:20
If these guys were not here, water would have an equal
14:25
likelihood of going in this direction as they would be
14:28
going in that direction, a completely equal likelihood.
14:33
But because these guys are on the right-hand side of-- or in
14:40
this case, on the inside of our membrane.
14:42
This is our inside of our membrane zoomed up-- it's less
14:47
likely because these guys might be in the approach
14:50
position of the holes-- that's slightly less likely for water
14:55
to be in the approach position for the holes so it's actually
14:58
more probable that water could enter than water exit.
15:02
And I want to make that very clear.
15:04
If these sugar molecules were not here, obviously it's
15:07
equally likely for water to go in either direction.
15:09
Now that these sugar molecules are there, these sugar
15:12
molecules might be on the right-hand side.
15:15
They might be blocking-- I guess the best way to think
15:18
about it is blocking the approach to the hole.
15:20
They'll never be able to go through the hole themselves
15:22
and might not even be blocking the hole, but they're going in
15:24
some random direction.
15:25
So if a water molecule was approaching-- it's all
15:29
probabilistic and we're dealing with gazillions of
15:31
molecules-- it's that much more likely to be blocked to
15:34
get outside.
15:35
But the water molecules from the outside-- there's nothing
15:37
blocking them to get in so you're going to have a flow of
15:40
water inside.
15:41
So in this situation, with a semi-permeable membrane,
15:44
you're going to have water.
15:45
You're going to have a net inward flow of water.
15:49
And so this is kind of interesting.
15:51
We have the solvent flowing from a hypotonic situation to
15:56
a hypertonic solution, but it's only
15:59
hypotonic in the solute.
16:07
But water-- if you flip it the other way-- if you've used
16:11
sugar as the solvent, then you could say, we're going from a
16:15
high concentration of water to a low concentration of water.
16:19
I don't want to confuse you too much.
16:20
This is what tends to confuse people, but just think about
16:23
what's going to happen.
16:24
No matter in what situation, the solution is going to do
16:27
what it can to try to equilibriate the
16:30
concentration.
16:30
To make the concentrations on both
16:32
sides as close as possible.
16:33
And it's not just some magic.
16:35
It's not like the solution knows.
16:36
It's all based on probabilities and these things
16:38
bumping around, but in this situation, water is more
16:41
likely to flow into the container.
16:43
So it's actually going to go from the hypotonic side when
16:46
we talk about low concentration of solute to the
16:50
side that has high concentrations of solute, of
16:53
sugar-- and actually, if this thing is stretchable, more
16:57
water will keep flowing in and this membrane
17:01
will stretch out.
17:04
I won't go to too much detail here, but this idea of water--
17:08
of the solvent-- if in this case, water is the solvent--
17:12
of water as a solvent diffusing through a
17:15
semi-permeable membrane, this is called osmosis.
17:22
You've probably heard learning by osmosis-- if you put a book
17:25
against your head, maybe it'll just seep into your brain.
17:27
Same idea.
17:28
That's where the word comes from.
17:29
This idea of water seeping through membranes to try to
17:33
make concentrations more equal.
17:35
So if you say, well, I have high concentration here, low
17:38
concentration here.
17:39
If there was no membrane here, these big molecules would
17:43
exit, but because there's this semi-permeable membrane here,
17:48
they can't.
17:48
So the system just probabilistically-- no magic
17:52
here-- more water will enter to try to equilibriate
17:56
concentration.
17:57
Eventually-- if maybe there's a few molecules out here-- not
18:01
as high concentration here-- eventually if everything was
18:06
allowed to happen fully, you'll get to the point where
18:08
you have just as many-- you have just as high
18:11
concentration on this side as you have on the right-hand
18:13
side because this right-hand side is going to fill with
18:16
water and also probably become a larger volume.
18:19
And then, once again, the probabilities of a water
18:21
molecule going to the right and to the left will be the
18:23
same and you'll get to some type of equilibrium.
18:25
But I want to make it very clear-- diffusion is the idea
18:29
of any particle going from higher concentration and
18:33
spreading into a region that has a lower concentration and
18:35
just spreading out.
18:36
Osmosis is the diffusion of water.
18:41
And usually you're talking about the diffusion of water
18:44
as a solvent and usually it's in the context of a
18:47
semi-permeable membrane, where the actual solute cannot
18:51
travel through the membrane.
18:53

teded_2658,How much has Earth's average surface temperature increased since 1750?,multiple-choices,"Cloudy climate change:
How clouds affect Earth's temperature.
Earth's average surface temperature
has warmed by .8 Celsius since 1750.
When carbon dioxide concentrations
in the atmosphere have doubled,
which is expected before the end
of the 21st century,
researchers project global temperatures
will have risen by 
1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius.
If the increase is near the low end,
1.5 Celsius,
then we're already halfway there,
and we should be more able to adapt
with some regions becoming drier
and less productive,
but others becoming warmer,
wetter and more productive.
On the other hand, a rise of 4.5 degrees
Celsius would be similar in magnitude
to the warming that's occurred since
the last glacial maximum 22,000 years ago,
when most of North America was under
an ice sheet two kilometers thick.
So that would represent a 
dramatic change of climate.
So it's vitally important for scientists
to predict the change in temperature
with as much precision as possible
so that society can plan for the future.
The present range of uncertainty
is simply too large
to be confident of how best
to respond to climate change.
But this estimate of 1.5 to 4.5 Celsius
for a doubling of carbon dioxide
hasn't changed in 35 years.
Why haven't we been able 
to narrow it down?
The answer is that we don't yet understand
aerosols and clouds well enough.
But a new experiment at CERN
is tackling the problem.
In order to predict how
the temperature will change,
scientists need to know something
called Earth's climate sensitivity,
the temperature change in response
to a radiative forcing.
A radiative forcing is 
a temporary imbalance
between the energy received from the Sun
and the energy radiated back out to space,
like the imbalance caused by an
increase of greenhouse gases.
To correct the imbalance,
Earth warms up or cools down.
We can determine Earth's
climate sensitivity
from the experiment that we've already
performed in the industrial age 
since 1750
and then use this number to determine
how much more it will warm
for various projected radiative forcings
in the 21st century.
To do this, we need to know
two things:
First, the global temperature rise
since 1750,
and second, the radiative forcing
of the present day climate
relative to the pre-industrial climate.
For the radiative forcings,
we know that human activities
have increased greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere,
which have warmed the planet.
But our activities have at the same time
increased the amount
of aerosol particles in clouds,
which have cooled the planet.
Pre-industrial greenhouse gas
concentrations are well measured
from bubbles trapped in ice cores
obtained in Greenland and Antarctica.
So the greenhouse gas forcings
are precisely known.
But we have no way of directly measuring
how cloudy it was in 1750.
And that's the main source of uncertainty
in Earth's climate sensitivity.
To understand pre-industrial cloudiness,
we must use computer models
that reliably simulate
the processes responsible for 
forming aerosols in clouds.
Now to most people, aerosols are the thing
that make your hair stick,
but that's only one type of aerosol.
Atmospheric aerosols are tiny liquid
or solid particles suspended in the air.
They are either primary,
from dust, sea spray salt
or burning biomass,
or secondary, formed by gas to
particle conversion in the atmosphere,
also known as particle nucleation.
Aerosols are everywhere in the atmosphere,
and they can block out the sun
in polluted urban environments,
or bathe distant mountains in a blue haze.
More importantly, a cloud droplet cannot
form without an aerosol particle seed.
So without aerosol particles,
there'd be no clouds,
and without clouds,
there'd be no fresh water.
The climate would be much hotter,
and there would be no life.
So we owe our existence
to aerosol particles.
However, despite their importance,
how aerosol particles form
in the atmosphere
and their effect on clouds 
are poorly understood.
Even the vapors responsible
for aerosol particle formation
are not well established
because they're present in only
minute amounts,
near one molecule per million million
molecules of air.
This lack of understanding
is the main reason
for the large uncertainty 
in climate sensitivity,
and the corresponding wide range
of future climate projections.
However, an experiment underway at CERN,
named, perhaps unsurprisingly, ""Cloud""
has managed to build a steel vessel
that's large enough
and has a low enough contamination,
that aerosol formation can,
for the first time, be measured under
tightly controlled atmospheric conditions
in the laboratory.
In its first five years of operation,
Cloud has identified the vapors
responsible for aerosol particle
formation in the atmosphere,
which include sulfuric acid,
ammonia, amines,
and biogenic vapors from trees.
Using an ionizing particle beam
from the CERN proton synchrotron,
Cloud is also investigating
if galactic cosmic rays
enhance the formation of 
aerosols in clouds.
This has been suggested as a possible
unaccounted natural climate forcing agent
since the flux of cosmic rays raining
down on the atmosphere
varies with solar activity.
So Cloud is addressing two big questions:
Firstly, how cloudy was the 
pre-industrial climate?
And, hence, how much have
clouds changed due to human activities?
That knowledge will help sharpen
climate projections in the 21st century.
And secondly, could the puzzling
observations of solar climate variability
in the pre-industrial climate be explained
by an influence
of galactic cosmic rays on clouds?
Ambitious but realistic goals
when your head's in the clouds.

DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Art historians generally
0:05
like to discuss, things that they do know,
0:07
things that they discovered, things that they're sure of,
0:10
but so often, we don't know much.
0:13
DR. BETH HARRIS: And that's certainly the case
0:14
with this stunning portrait by Petrus Christus
0:17
called only, ""Portrait of a Young Woman.""
0:20
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So let's start with what we do know.
0:22
We know that this is a young woman.
0:24
We know who the artist is.
0:25
We know that the artist is Flemmish,
0:27
and the portrait was made around 1470.
0:29
We, of course, know its dimensions.
0:30
It's quite small.
0:32
It's made out of oil, and it's on panel.
0:34
And we know that it's exquisite.
0:36
And we also know that this portrait
0:38
is somewhat revolutionary.
0:40
Petrus Christus was the first artist in Flanders
0:43
to place his subjects in an actual space.
0:45
And although there's not much, we
0:47
do see a bit of molding, a rear wall,
0:51
and that it does place her in space.
0:53
DR. BETH HARRIS: So what do we want
0:55
to know that we don't know about her?
0:56
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: I'm really hungry for information.
0:58
I want to know so much.
1:00
I want to know, who she is.
1:02
DR. BETH HARRIS: I want to know what she's thinking about.
1:04
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: I want to know where she's looking.
1:06
DR. BETH HARRIS: I want to know what, if anything,
1:08

1:10
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: I want to know
1:12
who this portrait was made for.
1:14
Who commissioned it?

And what was its purpose?

0:00
What I've done here is listed a bunch
0:02
of events that might occur in a given period.
0:05
And what I want to think about in this video
0:07
is how, if at all, they might be accounted for in GDP,
0:11
especially in this expenditure view of GDP.
0:13
And I encourage you to pause this video
0:16
and try it out yourself.
0:17
See how, if each of these events happen in the period
0:20
for which we are trying to calculate GDP,
0:23
how would they be accounted for, according to the buckets
0:26
we thought about, the composition of the expenditure
0:28
view of GDP.
0:30
So now I'm assuming that you have unpaused,
0:31
you've tried it yourself, and so let's try to go through it.
0:34
So Khan Academy is a firm.
0:36
It's a not-for-profit firm.
0:37
No one really owns Khan Academy.
0:39
I guess society owns Khan Academy, but it is a firm.
0:43
So Khan Academy employs a software engineer
0:45
and pays them $100,000.
0:47
Well, this is a firm making the expenditure.
0:50
And arguably and even conceptually,
0:52
this also is an investment.
0:53
Because this $100,000 is going to be used to develop code
0:57
that has future benefit.
0:58
So this is going to be the investment category.
1:02
Let me do it in that same color.
1:04
So I, investment, is going to get plus $100,000.
1:11
In general, the spending by firms goes into investment.
1:15
Now, let's look at the second scenario.
1:17
Accenture, which is another firm, and this
1:19
is a for-profit firm, earns $10 million-- or maybe I should say
1:23
gets $10 million in revenue, just
1:28
to be clear what we're talking about-- by building
1:33
a new IT system for California.
1:35
And the important thing to think about, you might say,
1:38
oh, OK, wait, this is OK, Accenture is a firm,
1:40
but California is clearly the government.
1:44
So how do you account for this?
1:46
And it's the expenditure view of GDP.
1:48
So in this situation, California is spending $10 million
1:53
in the period for a new IT system.
1:57
So this is going to be government.
1:59
The government category is going to be increased by $10 million,
2:03
because of this expenditure.
2:06
Now next one.
2:07
My mother sells her house in New Orleans
2:09
to a Swedish woman for $200,000.
2:11
Once again, a house is being sold
2:14
from someone in the country to someone who was foreign,
2:17
what do we do?
2:18
But the important thing to realize
2:20
is that this is not a new house.
2:22
This is a transfer of an existing house.
2:24
Nothing was produced here.
2:26
So this has no contribution to GDP.
2:30
It doesn't matter it's a Swedish woman or anything like that.
2:32
The house existed before.
2:34
It just changed hands.
2:35
A new house did not get produced.
2:37
So nothing happens to GDP here.
2:40
Next one.
2:41
I-- and I'm assuming that I am here,
2:43
sitting here in Mountain View, California,
2:45
American citizen-- I buy a Japanese made
2:47
lawn mower for $200.
2:50
Now this one is interesting.
2:53
Because if you think about it theoretically,
2:55
nothing was produced in the United States,
2:57
so nothing should be added to GDP on a net-net basis.
3:00
And we'll see that that is actually the case.
3:01
But it's going to show up by adding to consumption
3:04
and then taking away from net exports.
3:07
So two things are going to happen here.
3:08
We'll say, OK, Sal is an American consumer.
3:12
If we just look at how much more he spent,
3:14
he spent $200 more, so it's going to be added there.
3:17
But then we're going to take it out of net exports.
3:21
So net exports-- let me do it in that same green color-- net
3:27
exports.
3:28
Everything else is neutral.
3:30
So in this thing right over here,
3:31
there was no foreign purchases.
3:33
But there is me buying a foreign product.
3:36
And let me subtract that out.
3:38
So I'm going to subtract out $200 right over there.
3:41
So net exports will be lower by $200,
3:45
because essentially this was a $200 import.
3:47
And that completely cancels out the $200
3:49
increase in consumption.
3:51
And so this will have zero net effect on GDP.
3:54
These two terms will cancel out.
3:57
Now I buy a new home in California for $500,000.
4:03
Now household spending for the most part
4:05
is considered C, except when you are buying a new home.
4:10
So even though I am not a firm, because I
4:14
am buying a house, a new house, this will go into investment.
4:19
So investment will go up by $500,000.
4:24
And then finally American Airlines buys a new Airbus jet,
4:28
and Airbus jets are made in Europe.
4:30
So what's going to happen here?
4:32
So once again, net-net, nothing was
4:35
produced in the United States.
4:36
So on a net basis, this should not contribute to GDP.
4:40
And we'll see that on net basis, it will break out,
4:42
it will be neutral, but it will be like this situation.
4:46
There's an American firm that made a purchase--
4:48
and actually, I didn't put the amount here.
4:49
So let's say it was $100 million.
4:52
I think that's actually about what a passenger plane might
4:54
actually cost, for $100 million.
4:57
So the way we would account for it,
4:59
investment would go up by $100 million.
5:03
You have an American firm making a purchase, $100 million.
5:08
Conceptually, it makes sense.
5:09
It's going to provide future goods and services,
5:11
going to give transportation to people.
5:13
But it's going to be netted out, because you have a net import.
5:20
So what this is going to do to net exports,
5:23
on this side of it, you're going to have $100 million,
5:25
because this was an import.
5:26
So you're going to have negative $100 million,
5:28
when you think of it from an export point of view.
5:30
And you had no corresponding positive export.
5:34
So you're going to have net exports-- net exports is
5:37
going to go down $100 million.
5:40
This was a net import of $100 million,
5:42
so it makes sense that net exports would go down.
5:44
It would be negative net exports.
5:46
And these two, once again, are going
5:48
to cancel out with each other, so that you

Where we left off after the meiosis videos is that we had
0:03
two gametes.
0:04
We had a sperm and an egg.
0:07
Let me draw the sperm.
0:08
So you had the sperm and then you had an egg.
0:11
Maybe I'll do the egg in a different color.
0:14
That's the egg, and we all know how this story goes.
0:18
The sperm fertilizes the egg.
0:20
And a whole cascade of events start occurring.
0:23
The walls of the egg then become impervious to other
0:27
sperm so that only one sperm can get in, but that's not the
0:30
focus of this video.
0:31
The focus of this video is how this fertilized egg develops
0:35
once it has become a zygote.
0:38
So after it's fertilized, you remember from the meiosis
0:42
videos that each of these were haploid, or that they had--
0:48
oh, I added an extra i there-- that they had half the
0:51
contingency of the DNA.
0:56
As soon as the sperm fertilizes this egg, now, all
1:00
of a sudden, you have a diploid zygote.
1:03
Let me do that.
1:04
So now let me pick a nice color.
1:07
So now you're going to have a diploid zygote that's going to
1:10
have a 2N complement of the DNA material or kind of the
1:16
full complement of what a normal cell in our human body
1:20
would have. So this is diploid, and it's a zygote,
1:25
which is just a fancy way of saying the fertilized egg.
1:30
And it's now ready to essentially
1:31
turn into an organism.
1:33
So immediately after fertilization, this zygote
1:36
starts experiencing cleavage.
1:39
It's experiencing mitosis, that's the mechanism, but it
1:42
doesn't increase a lot in size.
1:44
So this one right here will then turn into-- it'll just
1:48
split up via mitosis into two like that.
1:52
And, of course, these are each 2N, and then those are going
1:55
to split into four like that.
2:01
And each of these have the same exact genetic complement
2:05
as that first zygote, and it keeps splitting.
2:08
And this mass of cells, we can start calling it, this right
2:14
here, this is referred to as the morula.
2:20
And actually, it comes from the word for mulberry because
2:22
it looks like a mulberry.
2:24
So actually, let me just kind of simplify things a little
2:26
bit because we don't have to start here.
2:28
So we start with a zygote.
2:32
This is a fertilized egg.
2:33
It just starts duplicating via mitosis, and you end up with a
2:38
ball of cells.
2:40
It's often going to be a power of two, because these cells,
2:43
at least in the initial stages are all duplicating all at
2:46
once, and then you have this morula.
2:51
Now, once the morula gets to about 16 cells or so-- and
2:54
we're talking about four or five days.
2:56
This isn't an exact process-- they started differentiating a
3:01
little bit, where the outer cells-- and this kind of turns
3:04
into a sphere.
3:05
Let me make it a little bit more sphere like.
3:08
So it starts differentiating between-- let me make some
3:12
outer cells.
3:13
This would be a cross-section of it.
3:15
It's really going to look more like a sphere.
3:18
That's the outer cells and then you have your inner cells
3:22
on the inside.
3:24
These outer cells are called the trophoblasts.
3:32
Let me do it in a different color.
3:40
Let me scroll over.
3:42
I don't want to go there.
3:43
And then the inner cells, and this is kind of the crux of
3:46
what this video is all about-- let me scroll
3:48
down a little bit.
3:49
The inner cells-- pick a suitable color.
3:54
The inner cells right there are called the embryoblast.
4:01
And then what's going to happen is some fluid's going
4:03
to start filling in some of this gap between the
4:06
embryoblast and the trophoblast, so you're going
4:08
to start having some fluid that comes in there, and so
4:14
the morula will eventually look like this, where the
4:18
trophoblast, or the outer membrane, is kind of this huge
4:21
sphere of cells.
4:22
And this is all happening as they keep replicating.
4:25
Mitosis is the mechanism, so now my trophoblast is going to
4:29
look like that, and then my embryoblast is going
4:34
to look like this.
4:36
Sometimes the embryoblast-- so this is the embryoblast.
4:46
Sometimes it's also called the inner cell mass, so let me
4:51
write that.
4:56
And this is what's going to turn into the organism.
4:58
And so, just so you know a couple of the labels that are
5:01
involved here, if we're dealing with a mammalian
5:03
organism, and we are mammals, we call this thing that the
5:07
morula turned into is a zygote, then a morula, then
5:10
the cells of the morula started to differentiate into
5:13
the trophoblast, or kind of the outside cells, and then
5:16
the embryoblast. And then you have this space that forms
5:22
here, and this is just fluid, and it's called the
5:26
blastocoel.
5:32
A very non-intuitive spelling of the coel part of
5:35
blastocoel.
5:37
But once this is formed, this is called a blastocyst. That's
5:40
the entire thing right here.
5:41
Let me scroll down a little bit.
5:44
This whole thing is called the blastocyst, and this is the
5:49
case in humans.
5:54
Now, it can be a very confusing topic, because a lot
5:57
of times in a lot of books on biology, you'll say, hey, you
5:59
go from the morula to the blastula or the
6:02
blastosphere stage.
6:04
Let me write those words down.
6:06
So sometimes you'll say morula,
6:10
and you go to blastula.
6:14
Sometimes it's called the blastosphere.
6:20
And I want to make it very clear that these are
6:22
essentially the same stages in development.
6:25
These are just for-- you know, in a lot of books, they'll
6:28
start talking about frogs or tadpoles or things like that,
6:32
and this applies to them.
6:33
While we're talking about mammals, especially the ones
6:35
that are closely related to us, the stage is the
6:38
blastocyst stage, and the real differentiator is when people
6:41
talk about just blastula and blastospheres.
6:44
There isn't necessarily this differentiation between these
6:47
outermost cells and these embryonic, or this
6:51
embryoblast, or this inner cell mass here.
6:54
But since the focus of this video is humans, and really
6:57
that's where I wanted to start from, because that's what we
6:59
are and that's what's interesting, we're going to
7:01
focus on the blastocyst.
7:03
Now, everything I've talked about in this video, it was
7:06
really to get to this point, because what we have here,
7:10
these little green cells that I drew right here in the
7:14
blastocysts, this inner cell mass, this is what will turn
7:18
into the organism.
7:19
And you say, OK, Sal, if that's the organism, what's
7:21
all of these purple cells out here?
7:24
This trophoblast out there?
7:27
That is going to turn into the placenta, and I'll do a future
7:30
video where in a human, it'll turn into a placenta.
7:34
So let me write that down.
7:35
It'll turn into the placenta.
7:38
And I'll do a whole future video about I guess how babies
7:41
are born, and I actually learned a ton about that this
7:44
past year because a baby was born in our house.
7:47
But the placenta is really kind of what the embryo
7:51
develops inside of, and it's the interface, especially in
7:54
humans and in mammals, between the developing fetus and its
7:59
mother, so it kind of is the exchange mechanism that
8:02
separates their two systems, but allows the necessary
8:05
functions to go on between them.
8:06
But that's not the focus of this video.
8:08
The focus of this video is the fact that these cells, which
8:12
at this point are-- they've differentiated themselves away
8:15
from the placenta cells, but they still haven't decided
8:18
what they're going to become.
8:20
Maybe this cell and its descendants eventually start
8:24
becoming part of the nervous system, while these cells
8:27
right here might become muscle tissue, while these cells
8:31
right here might become the liver.
8:36
These cells right here are called embryonic stem cells,
8:40
and probably the first time in this video you're hearing a
8:43
term that you might recognize.
8:45
So if I were to just take one of these cells, and actually,
8:48
just to introduce you to another term, you know, we
8:52
have this zygote.
8:54
As soon as it starts dividing, each of these cells are called
8:59
a blastomere.
9:00
And you're probably wondering, Sal, why does this word blast
9:04
keep appearing in this kind of embryology video, these
9:08
development videos?
9:09
And that comes from the Greek for spore: blastos.
9:13
So the organism is beginning to spore out or grow.
9:19
I won't go into the word origins of it, but that's
9:21
where it comes from and that's why everything has
9:23
this blast in it.
9:23
So these are blastomeres.
9:25
So when I talk what embryonic stem cells, I'm talking about
9:28
the individual blastomeres inside of this embryoblast or
9:34
inside of this inner cell mass.
9:36
These words are actually unusually fun to say.
9:39
So each of these is an embryonic stem cell.
9:43
Let me write this down in a vibrant color.
9:47
So each of these right here are embryonic stem cells, and
9:52
I wanted to get to this.
9:56
And the reason why these are interesting, and I think you
9:58
already know, is that there's a huge debate around these.
10:00
One, these have the potential to turn into anything, that
10:03
they have this plasticity.
10:05
That's another word that you might hear.
10:07
Let me write that down, too: plasticity.
10:12
And the word essentially comes from, you know, like a plastic
10:14
can turn into anything else.
10:17
When we say that something has plasticity, we're talking
10:19
about its potential to turn into a lot
10:21
of different things.
10:22
So the theory is, and there's already some trials that seem
10:26
to substantiate this, especially in some lower
10:28
organisms, that, look, if you have some damage at some point
10:31
in your body-- let me draw a nerve cell.
10:36
Let me say I have a-- I won't go into the actual mechanics
10:40
of a nerve cell, but let's say that we have some damage at
10:43
some point on a nerve cell right there, and because of
10:46
that, someone is paralyzed or there's some nerve
10:50
dysfunction.
10:51
We're dealing with multiple sclerosis or who knows what.
10:54
The idea is, look, we have these cell here that could
10:57
turn into anything, and we're just really understanding how
11:02
it knows what to turn into.
11:04
It really has to look at its environment and say, hey, what
11:06
are the guys around me doing, and maybe that's what helps
11:08
dictate what it does.
11:10
But the idea is you take these things that could turn to
11:12
anything and you put them where the damage is, you layer
11:16
them where the damage is, and then they can turn into the
11:19
cell that they need to turn into.
11:21
So in this case, they would turn into nerve cells.
11:24
They would turn to nerve cells and repair the damage and
11:29
maybe cure the paralysis for that individual.
11:32
So it's a huge, exciting area of research, and you could
11:35
even, in theory, grow new organs.
11:37
If someone needs a kidney transplant or a heart
11:39
transplant, maybe in the future, we could take a colony
11:43
of these embryonic stem cells.
11:44
Maybe we can put them in some type of other creature, or who
11:48
knows what, and we can turn it into a replacement heart or a
11:52
replacement kidney.
11:52
So there's a huge amount of excitement about
11:56
what these can do.
11:57
I mean, they could cure a lot of formerly uncurable diseases
12:01
or provide hope for a lot of patients who
12:03
might otherwise die.
12:05
But obviously, there's a debate here.
12:07
And the debate all revolves around the issue of if you
12:10
were to go in here and try to extract one of these cells,
12:15
you're going to kill this embryo.
12:17
You're going to kill this developing embryo, and that
12:21
developing embryo had the potential to
12:23
become a human being.
12:27
It's a potential that obviously has to be in the
12:28
right environment, and it has to have a willing mother and
12:33
all of the rest, but it does have the potential.
12:35
And so for those, especially, I think, in the pro-life camp,
12:40
who say, hey, anything that has a potential to be a human
12:44
being, that is life and it should not be killed.
12:47
So people on that side of the camp, they're against the
12:52
destroying of this embryo.
12:54
I'm not making this video to take either side to that
12:57
argument, but it's a potential to turn to a human being.
13:01
It's a potential, right?
13:04
So obviously, there's a huge amount of debate, but now, now
13:07
you know in this video what people are talking about when
13:10
they say embryonic stem cells.
13:12
And obviously, the next question is, hey, well, why
13:14
don't they just call them stem cells as opposed to embryonic
13:16
stem cells?
13:17
And that's because in all of our bodies, you do have what
13:20
are called somatic stem cells.
13:22
Let me write that down.
13:24
Somatic or adults stem cells.
13:29
And we all have them.
13:30
They're in our bone marrow to help produce red blood cells,
13:32
other parts of our body, but the problem with somatic stem
13:36
cells is they're not as plastic, which means that they
13:41
can't form any type of cell in the human body.
13:44
There's an area of research where people are actually
13:46
maybe trying to make them more plastic, and if they are able
13:50
to take these somatic stem cells and make them more
13:52
plastic, it might maybe kill the need to have these
13:56
embryonic stem cells, although maybe if they do this too
13:58
good, maybe these will have the potential to turn into
14:01
human beings as well, so that could
14:03
become a debatable issue.
14:04
But right now, this isn't an area of debate because, left
14:08
to their own devices, a somatic stem cell or an adult
14:12
stem cell won't turn into a human being, while an
14:15
embryonic one, if it is implanted in a willing mother,
14:19
then, of course, it will turn into a human being.
14:21
And I want to make one side note here, because I don't
14:24
want to take any sides on the debate of-- well, I mean,
14:30
facts are facts.
14:31
This does have the potential to turn into a human being,
14:33
but it also has the potential to save millions of lives.
14:36
Both of those statements are facts, and then you can decide
14:39
on your own which side of that argument you'd like to or what
14:42
side of that balance you would like to kind of
14:45
put your own opinion.
14:47
But there's one thing I want to talk about that in the
14:50
public debate is never brought up.
14:51
So you have this notion of when you-- to get an embryonic
14:55
stem cell line, and when I say a stem cell line, I mean you
14:58
take a couple of stem cells, or let's say you take one stem
15:00
cell, and then you put it in a Petri dish, and then you allow
15:04
it to just duplicate.
15:06
So this one turns into two, those two turn to four.
15:09
Then someone could take one of these and then put it in their
15:12
own Petri dish.
15:13
These are a stem cell line.
15:15
They all came from one unique embryonic stem cell or what
15:20
initially was a blastomere.
15:21
So that's what they call a stem cell line.
15:24
So the debate obviously is when you start an embryonic
15:28
stem cell line, you are destroying an embryo.
15:31
But I want to make the point here that embryos are being
15:33
destroyed in other processes, and namely, in-vitro
15:37
fertilization.
15:40
And maybe this'll be my next video: fertilization.
15:44
And this is just the notion that they take a set of eggs
15:48
out of a mother.
15:49
It's usually a couple that's having trouble having a child,
15:52
and they take a bunch of eggs out of the mother.
15:54
So let's say they take maybe 10 to 30
15:56
eggs out of the mother.
15:59
They actually perform a surgery, take them out of the
16:02
ovaries of the mother, and then they fertilize them with
16:06
semen, either it might come from the father or a sperm
16:09
donor, so then all of these becomes zygotes once they're
16:13
fertilized with semen.
16:15
So these all become zygotes, and then they allow them to
16:17
develop, and they usually allow them to develop to the
16:19
blastocyst stage.
16:21
So eventually all of these turn into blastocysts.
16:25
They have a blastocoel in the center, which is
16:30
this area of fluid.
16:32
They have, of course, the embryo, the inner cell mass in
16:37
them, and what they do is they look at the ones that they
16:41
deem are healthier or maybe the ones that are at least
16:44
just not unhealthy, and they'll take a couple of these
16:47
and they'll implant these into the mother, so all of this is
16:50
occurring in a Petri dish.
16:52
So maybe these four look good, so they're going to take these
16:55
four, and they're going to implant these into a mother,
16:57
and if all goes well, maybe one of these will turn into--
17:01
will give the couple a child.
17:02
So this one will develop and maybe the other ones won't.
17:05
But if you've seen John & Kate Plus 8, you know that many
17:09
times they implant a lot of them in there, just to
17:12
increase the probability that you get at least one child.
17:14
But every now and then, they implant seven or eight, and
17:17
then you end up with eight kids.
17:18
And that's why in-vitro fertilization often results in
17:21
kind of these multiple births, or reality
17:25
television shows on cable.
17:27
But what do they do with all of these other perfectly--
17:30
well, I won't say perfectly viable, but these are embryos.
17:33
They may or may not be perfectly viable, but you have
17:36
these embryos that have the potential, just like this one
17:41
right here.
17:42
These all have the potential to turn into a human being.
17:46
But most fertility clinics, roughly half of them, they
17:50
either throw these away, they destroy them, they
17:52
allow them to die.
17:54
A lot of these are frozen, but just the process of freezing
17:56
them kills them and then bonding them kills them again,
17:59
so most of these, the process of in-vitro fertilization, for
18:04
every one child that has the potential to develop into a
18:08
full-fledged human being, you're actually destroying
18:10
tens of very viable embryos.
18:14
So at least my take on it is if you're against-- and I
18:18
generally don't want to take a side on this, but if you are
18:21
against research that involves embryonic stem cells because
18:33
of the destruction of embryos, on that same, I guess,
18:36
philosophical ground, you should also be against
18:40
in-vitro fertilization because both of these involve the
18:47
destruction of zygotes.
18:49
I think-- well, I won't talk more about this, because I
18:52
really don't want to take sides, but I want to show that
18:54
there is kind of an equivalence here that's
18:56
completely lost in this debate on whether embryonic stem
19:00
cells should be used because they have a destruction of
19:02
embryos, because you're destroying just as many
19:04
embryos in this-- well, I won't say just as many, but
19:08
you are destroying embryos.
19:09
There's hundreds of thousands of embryos that get destroyed
19:12
and get frozen and obviously destroyed in that process as
19:16
well through this in-vitro fertilization process.
19:19
So anyway, now hopefully you have the tools to kind of
19:22
engage in the debate around stem cells, and you see that
19:25
it all comes from what we learned about meiosis.
19:29
They produce these gametes.
19:33
The male gamete fertilizes a female gamete.
19:35
The zygote happens or gets created and starts splitting
19:39
up the morula, and then it keeps splitting and it
19:42
differentiates into the blastocyst, and then this is
19:45
where the stem cells are.
19:47
So you already know enough science to engage in kind of a
19:50
very heated debate.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,-yCIMk1x0Pk,

What I want to do with this video is talk about
0:02
nucleophilicity.
0:14
This is really just how good of a nucleophile something is.
0:17
Or I'll just make up a definition right now: the
0:20
ability for an atom slash ion slash molecule to act as a
0:35
nucleophile, or to give away extra electrons and bond with
0:51
a nucleus or with something else.
0:53
I'll say with a nucleus.
1:01
I want to say with a nucleus, because that's what
1:03
nucleophilicity is saying.
1:04
It loves nucleuses, especially positive ones, that it can
1:07
give its extra electrons to it.
1:09
Now, as a first cut, if you want to identify a good
1:13
nucleophile, it should have extra electrons to give away.
1:32
The best things that have extra electrons to give away
1:35
are negative ions or anions, so just at a very high level,
1:40
something like the fluoride anion.
1:44
Normally, fluorine has seven valence electrons: one, two,
1:48
three, four, five, six, seven, but it's so electronegative,
1:53
it might be able swipe off another electron from
1:55
something else and then it becomes the fluoride anion.
1:59
Then it becomes the fluoride anion with a negative charge.
2:03
You can do that for all of the halides.
2:05
You could do that for chlorine.
2:06
It can become chloride.
2:07
Bromine can be bromide.
2:09
Iodine could be iodide.
2:11
Let me do iodine, too.
2:13
Iodine, once again, it's a halide.
2:15
It has seven valence electrons.
2:16
It has many, many more electrons than fluorine, but
2:19
if you just look at its valence shell,
2:21
it has seven electrons.
2:23
And then it is also reasonably electronegative, not as
2:26
electronegative as fluorine.
2:28
Remember, the trend goes like this from the bottom left to
2:32
the top right.
2:32
So fluorine is extremely electronegative, but iodine is
2:36
still pretty electronegative.
2:39
It is a halogen so it also might be able to swipe off an
2:43
electron from someone else and become iodide.
2:48
In general, things with extra electrons, lone pairs of
2:52
electrons, and especially a negative charge, are going to
2:54
be pretty good nucleophiles.
2:59
Another example that's not a halide is the
3:01
hydroxide anion, so OH.
3:05
This is an example of something that is a molecule.
3:09
Maybe traditionally water would look like this.
3:12
Traditionally, this is just neutral water, and oxygen has
3:17
two lone pairs like that, but oxygen is pretty
3:19
electronegative.
3:20
It is already kind of taking the electrons away from one of
3:23
the hydrogens, and at some point, it might just take it
3:26
altogether and then you have the hydroxide anion.
3:31
This would look like this.
3:33
You have your original two lone pairs, just like that,
3:36
and then you have this pair that's going to be taken.
3:39
It already had that electron.
3:40
It takes that electron from the hydrogen, so now it has
3:42
two more electrons.
3:44
Let me color code it so you see what it took.
3:45
It took this electron from the hydrogen and now this also has
3:49
a negative charge.
3:50
That's also a reasonably good nucleophile.
3:55
And, of course, you have your hydrogen now.
3:56
It lost its one electron.
3:58
It only has a proton in its nucleus.
4:01
Whenever you see H plus, this is really just a proton.
4:03
There's nothing else to that hydrogen.
4:05
So that's hydroxide.
4:06
These are all reasonably good nucleophiles in that they have
4:11
something to give away.
4:12
They have extra charge.
4:14
Now, what I want to do is think about between these, how
4:17
do you think about what's going to be a stronger or
4:19
weaker nucleophile?
4:21
And here, it becomes a little bit more nuanced.
4:25
What we're going to do is differentiate what happens in
4:27
a protic solvent versus what happens in an aprotic solvent.
4:31
Let me write down.
4:33
Let me start with a protic solvent.
4:40
I'll make two columns here, protic solvent and then we'll
4:43
do aprotic solvent right over here.
4:54
Once again, these are fancy words, but they mean something
4:56
pretty simple.
4:57
Protic solvent is something that has hydrogens that can be
5:01
taken away or might have free protons floating around.
5:04
An example of a protic solvent is water
5:07
or really any alcohol.
5:08
Water is the simplest example or maybe the most common.
5:12
The reason why you might have protons floating around is
5:15
exactly this reaction I showed right here.
5:18
Maybe every now and then a hydroxide anion forms. Even
5:21
more likely, maybe a water takes a hydrogen from one of
5:26
the other waters.
5:27
One of the water molecules takes hydrogen from one of the
5:29
other water molecules and becomes a hydronium, where
5:33
it's not a proton necessarily, but it's an oxygen.
5:41
Let's say if you start with water and one of these
5:44
electrons were to be given to some proton floating around,
5:48
it would look like this.
5:50
And it has a positive charge and then this
5:53
proton is very available.
5:56
You can almost imagine it's almost floating around because
5:58
that oxygen really wants to take back that electron.
6:01
So protic solvent is water.
6:03
In water, you might see a little bit of hydroxide, a
6:05
little bit of proton, a little bit a hydronium.
6:07
You see all of it in there, but the bottom line is that
6:09
there are protons that can react with other things.
6:15
Let me clear this away so that I have some real estate.
6:19
Let me just write down water.
6:21
Water is a protic solvent.
6:24
Now, wait.
6:25
Is that always the case?
6:27
It seems like hydrogens are everywhere.
6:28
Well, no, it's not always the case.
6:29
Let me show you an aprotic solvent.
6:32
Diethyl ether looks like this.
6:41
And just so you know the naming, it's an ether because
6:43
it has oxygen, and it's diethyl because it has two
6:46
ethyl groups.
6:47
That's one ethyl group right there and that is the second.
6:50
So it's diethyl ether.
6:53
Now, you might say, hey, this guy's got hydrogens lying
6:56
around as well.
6:56
Maybe those can get released.
6:58
But, no, these hydrogens are bonded to the carbon and
7:01
carbon is not anywhere near as electronegative as oxygen.
7:06
Carbon is unlikely to steal these hydrogens' electrons and
7:10
these hydrogens to be loose.
7:12
If they were bonded to the oxygen, that would have been a
7:14
possibility.
7:16
With water, you have obviously H-O-H.
7:20
In alcohols, you have some maybe carbon chain bonded to
7:27
an oxygen, which is then bonded to a hydrogen.
7:29
So in either of these cases, in either water or alcohol,
7:32
you have these hydrogens where the electron might be taken by
7:36
the oxygen because it's so electronegative and then the
7:38
hydrogen floats around.
7:39
Anyway, that's a review of protic versus aprotic.
7:42
In a protic solvent-- and this is actually a general rule of
7:45
thumb-- if a nucleophile is likely to react with its
7:51
solvent, it will be bad at being a nucleophile.
7:54
Think about it.
7:54
If it's reacting with the solvent, it's not going to be
7:57
able to do this.
7:58
It's not going to be able to give its electrons away to
8:01
what it needs to give it away, to maybe what we saw in an
8:04
Sn2-type reaction.
8:07
In a protic solvent, what happens is that the things
8:09
that are really electronegative and really
8:11
small, like a fluoride anion-- let me draw a fluoride anion.
8:19
In a protic solvent, what's going to happen is it's going
8:26
to be blocked by hydrogen bonds.
8:29
It's very negative, right?
8:30
It has a negative charge.
8:31
And it's also tightly packed.
8:33
As you can see right here, its electrons are
8:36
very close, tied in.
8:38
It's a much smaller atom or ion, in this case.
8:42
If we looked at iodide, iodide has 53
8:45
electrons, many orbitals.
8:48
Actually, iodide would have 54.
8:49
It would have the same as iodine plus one.
8:52
Fluoride will have 10 electrons, nine from fluorine
8:55
plus it gains another one, so it's a much smaller atom.
9:00
So when you have water hanging around it, let's say you have
9:03
something like water.
9:04
That has a negative charge.
9:06
Water is polar.
9:11
Actually, both of these are polar, so I should write down
9:14
polar for both of these.
9:15
This is a polar protic solvent.
9:18
This is a polar aprotic solvent.
9:21
In this case, water is still more electronegative than the
9:23
carbon, so it still has a partial negative charge.
9:26
These parts still have a partial negative.
9:27
Water still has a partial negative charge.
9:30
The hydrogen has a partial positive charge so it is going
9:33
to be attracted to the fluorine.
9:35
This is going to happen all around the fluorine.
9:38
And if these waters are attracted to the fluorine in
9:40
kind of forming a tight shell around it, it makes it hard
9:44
for fluorine to react.
9:52
So it's a worse nucleophile than, say, iodide or hydroxide
9:58
in a polar protic solvent.
10:00
Hydroxide has the same issue.
10:02
It's still forming hydrogen bonds, but if you wanted to
10:05
compare them, iodide is much bigger.
10:10
Maybe I'll draw it like this.
10:12
I'll draw its valence shell like this.
10:14
It's a much bigger ion.
10:20
It has all these electrons in here.
10:22
And so, it still will form hydrogen bonds with the water.
10:26
It still will form hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen end of
10:29
the water because they're partially positive, but it's
10:31
going to be less tightly packed.
10:34
And on top of that, iodide is more polarizable, which means
10:47
that its electron cloud is so big and the valence electrons
10:50
are so far away from the nucleus that they can be
10:53
influenced by things and then be more likely to react.
10:56
So let's say this iodide is getting close to a carbon that
11:00
has a partial positive charge.
11:02
So let's say carbon is attached to a bromine and then
11:09
it's attached to three hydrogens.
11:12
We've seen that this will have a partial negative charge.
11:14
It's more electronegative than the carbon, which will have a
11:17
partial positive charge.
11:19
When this guy, this big guy with the electrons really far
11:22
away, gets close to this, more of the electron cloud is going
11:28
to be attracted to the partial positive charge.
11:30
It'll get distorted a little bit and so it is more likely
11:33
to react in a polar protic solvent.
11:37
Fluoride, on the other hand, is very tightly packed,
11:40
blocked by the hydrogen bonds.
11:43
It's less likely to react.
11:45
If you were to look at the Periodic Table, if you look at
11:49
just the halogens in a polar protic solvent, the halides--
11:57
this would be the ion version of the halogens-- the halide's
12:00
iodide will be the best nucleophile.
12:03
Fluoride will be the worst. So in a polar protic solvent--
12:07
let me write this down-- we have a situation where the
12:21
iodide is the best nucleophile, followed by
12:25
bromide, followed by chloride, and then last
12:30
of all is the fluoride.
12:33
The exact opposite is true in an aprotic solvent.
12:38
In an aprotic solvent, the fluoride, which is-- fluorine
12:42
is far more electronegative.
12:44
Fluoride is more basic.
12:48
It will be more stable if it is able to form a bond with
12:52
something than iodide.
12:54
Iodide is pretty stable.
12:56
If you look at a hydrogen iodide, it's actually a highly
13:01
acidic molecule.
13:02
So iodide itself, the conjugate base of hydrogen
13:05
iodide, is going to be a very bad base.
13:09
When you're dealing with an aprotic solvent, you go in the
13:12
direction of basicity.
13:14
We're going to learn in the next video that actually
13:15
basicity and nucleophilicity are related, but they aren't
13:19
the same concept.
13:20
We're going to talk about that in a little bit.
13:23
If you're in an aprotic solvent, you're not reacting
13:27
with the solvent as much.
13:28
And then in this situation, fluoride is actually the best
13:32
nucleophile, followed by chloride, followed by bromide,
13:37
followed by iodide.
13:39
So here, you're going in the direction of basicity.
13:42
This is the best. This is the worse in an aprotic solvent.
13:47
If it was in a protic solvent, this is flipped around.
13:50
This becomes the best and this becomes the worst.",Khan Academy Video,Science,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Z9Jh-Q59xso,

0:00
- All right now we have another combustion reaction.
0:03
Instead of ethylene, we now have ethane, C2H6,
0:08
has two carbons and six hydrogen
0:11
atoms in each molecule of ethane,
0:15
and it is reacting.
0:16
It's ethane gas, it is reacting with molecular oxygen
0:19
in gaseous form and they combust to
0:22
form carbon dioxide gas and liquid water,
0:26
and like we've seen in previous examples,
0:28
this chemical equation is not balanced.
0:31
How can we tell?
0:32
Well here on the left hand side we have two carbons.
0:35
Here on the right hand side we have one carbon.
0:37
Here on the left hand side we have six hydrogens.
0:38
Here on the right hand side we only have two hydrogens.
0:42
Here on the left hand side we have two oxygens.
0:46
On the right hand side we have two plus, three oxygens,
0:49
so none of the elements here are balanced.
0:53
But like we did in the example of ethylene,
0:56
whenever you see this where you have several
0:58
somewhat complex molecules involved,
1:01
it's good to save the element that
1:05
is in a molecule by itself for last,
1:08
because you can just tweak this
1:10
to change the number of oxygens
1:11
without it having any other side effects
1:13
on the number of carbons or hydrogens.
1:15
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to first balance,
1:17
like we've done before,
1:18
the carbons and the hydrogens,
1:20
which are going to have implications on the oxygens
1:22
because if I change the number here,
1:23
it's going to change the number of oxygens.
1:25
If I change the number here it's going to
1:26
change the number of oxygens.
1:28
But lucky for me I have this dioxygen molecule
1:30
on the left hand side that I can just tweak at the end
1:33
to balance the entire chemical equation.
1:36
So let's start with, you know last time
1:38
we started with carbon, let's start with hydrogen this time.
1:40
Just for kicks.
1:42
So over here I have six hydrogens
1:44
on the left hand side, of the entire left hand side
1:46
I only have six hydrogen atoms.
1:48
On the right hand side I only have two right now,
1:50
so if I want to have six I would multiply these two by three
1:55
so now I have three water molecules,
1:57
each of them have two hydrogen atoms,
1:59
so I'm going to have six, six hydrogen atoms
2:03
on the right hand side.
2:04
Fair enough.
2:06
Now let's go to the carbon.
2:07
Remember I'm saving oxygen for last.
2:09
Carbon on the left hand side I have two carbons.
2:12
How many carbons do I have on the right hand side?
2:14
Well right now I only have one,
2:16
but I can change that very easily.
2:18
Instead of having one molecule of carbon dioxide,
2:20
I can have two molecules of carbon dioxide.
2:23
And so now my carbons are balanced,
2:24
two carbons, two carbons.
2:26
And now let's go to the oxygens.
2:29
So right now, right now on, I'll do this in a mauve color,
2:34
right now on the left hand side I have two oxygens,
2:38
but on the right hand side what do I have?
2:40
Let's see, I have two times two,
2:42
so this right over here is four oxygens,
2:45
and then I have three water molecules,
2:47
each of them have one oxygen atom,
2:49
so three times one, so this is going to be three
2:52
right over here.
2:54
So on the entire right hand side I have seven oxygen atoms
2:58
and on the left I only have two.
3:00
So what can I do here?
3:01
What can multiply by two to get to seven?
3:05
Two times what is equal to seven?
3:07
Well two times three-and-a-half is equal to seven.
3:11
So two times three-and-a-half is equal to seven.
3:14
Remember I have two here, I'm saying two times
3:17
something is equal to seven.
3:19
I want to get to the four plus the three.
3:22
Well I multiply it by three point five,
3:25
and now I have seven, seven oxygen atoms
3:29
on both sides of my chemical equation.
3:32
But like we've seen in previous videos,
3:34
it is not standard to just leave a three-and-a-half here,
3:37
it's kind of this weird notion of
3:38
three-and-a-half molecules,
3:40
we like to have whole numbers here.
3:42
So how do we make sure we have all whole number
3:45
coefficients in front of our molecules?
3:48
Well we could just multiply everything by two,
3:50
then this thing is going to become a seven,
3:52
this thing is going to become a two,
3:53
this is going to become a four,
3:55
this is going to become a six,
3:57
so let's just do that.
3:58
I'll write the whole reaction over again.
4:00
So I have my ethane, and I won't write
4:03
actually what state it's in just to save some time,
4:06
plus some molecular oxygen.
4:09
They combust, they yield,
4:11
so these are the reactants,
4:12
the products are carbon dioxide gas
4:15
and liquid water, and liquid water.
4:19
So let's see, you multiply, if you say that there
4:22
was a one out here before,
4:24
we're going to multiply that by two to get two.
4:26
We had a three point five here, multiply that by two,
4:30
you get a seven here.
4:32
We had a two right over here, multiply that by two
4:36
you get a four.
4:38
Once again I'm just multiplying all the coefficients
4:40
by two just like you did in algebraic equations
4:41
in your algebra classes.
4:43
And then finally three times two is six.
4:47
And we're all balanced.
4:48
We were balanced here but we didn't
4:50
have whole number coefficients.
4:51
Multiplying everything by two gave us
4:53
the whole number coefficients and we are much happier.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,cmi8EnJQA84,

0:00
We've talked a little bit about the law of demand which
0:02
tells us all else equal, if we raise the price of a product,
0:08
then the quantity demanded for that product will go down.
0:11
Common sense.
0:12
If we lower the price, than the quantity demanded will go up,
0:14
and we'll see a few special cases for this.
0:16
But what I want to do in this video is focus
0:18
on these other things that we've been holding equal,
0:21
the things that allow us to make this statement, that
0:23
allow us to move along this curve,
0:25
and think about if we were to change one of those things,
0:27
that we were otherwise considering
0:29
equal, how does that change the actual curve?
0:32
How does that actually change the whole quantity
0:34
demanded price relationship?
0:37
And so the first of these that I will focus on,
0:40
the first is the price of competing products.
0:50
So if you assume that the price of-- actually I
0:53
shouldn't say competing products,
0:54
I'll say the price of related products,
0:56
because we'll see that they're not competing.
0:59
The price of related products is one of the things
1:04
that we're assuming is constant when we, it's beheld equal when
1:08
we show this relationship.
1:10
We're assuming that these other things aren't changing.
1:13
Now, what would happen if these things changed?
1:16
Well, imagine we have, say, other ebooks-- books
1:28
is price-- price goes up.
1:32
The price of other ebooks go up.
1:35
So what will that do to our price
1:37
quantity demanded relationship?
1:40
If other ebooks prices go up, now all of a sudden, my ebook,
1:44
regardless of what price point we're at,
1:47
at any of the price points, my ebook
1:49
is going to look more desirable.
1:51
At $2, it's more likely that people will want it,
1:55
because the other stuff's more expensive.
1:57
At $4 more people will want it, at $6 more people will want it,
2:00
$8 more people will want it, at $10 more people will want it.
2:03
So if this were to happen, that would actually
2:05
shift the entire demand curve to the right.
2:09
So it would start to look something like this.
2:17
That is scenario one.
2:18
And these other ebooks, we can call them
2:20
substitutes for my product.
2:23
So this right over here, these other ebooks,
2:25
these are substitutes.
2:31
People might say, oh, you know, that other book looks
2:33
kind of comparable, if one is more expensive
2:35
or one is cheaper, maybe I'll read one or the other.
2:38
So in order to make this statement, in order
2:40
to stay along this curve, we have
2:42
to assume that this thing is constant.
2:44
If this thing changes, this is going to move the curve.
2:47
If other ebooks prices go up, it'll
2:49
probably shift our curve to the right.
2:50
If other ebooks prices go down, that
2:53
will shift our entire curve to the left.
2:55
So this is actually changing our demand.
2:58
It's changing our whole relationship.
3:00
So it's shifting demand to the right.
3:02
So let me write that.
3:03
So this is going to shift demand.
3:08
So the entire relationship, demand, to the right.
3:12
I really want to make sure that you have this point clear.
3:15
When we hold everything else equal,
3:17
we're moving along a given demand curve.
3:20
We're essentially saying the demand, the price
3:23
quantity demanded relationship, is held constant,
3:26
and we can pick a price and we'll
3:27
get a certain quantity demanded.
3:29
We're moving along the curve.
3:32
If we change one of those things,
3:33
we might actually shift the curve.
3:36
We'll actually change this demand schedule,
3:38
which will change this curve.
3:40
Now, there other related products,
3:43
they don't just have to be substitutes.
3:45
So, for example, let's think about scenario two.
3:49
Or maybe the price of a Kindle goes up.
3:59
Let me write this this way.
4:02
Kindle's price goes up.
4:06
Now, the Kindle is not a substitute.
4:07
People don't either buy an ebook or they won't either
4:11
buy my ebook or a Kindle.
4:13
Kindle is a compliment.
4:14
You actually need a Kindle or an iPad or something like it
4:17
in order to consume my ebook.
4:20
So this right over here is a complement.
4:25
So if a complement's price becomes more expensive,
4:28
and this is one of the things people
4:30
might use to buy my book, then it would actually,
4:32
for any given price, lower the quantity demanded.
4:36
So in this situation, if my book is
4:37
$2, since fewer people are going to have Kindles,
4:40
or since maybe they used some of their money
4:42
already to buy the Kindle, they're
4:43
going to have less to buy my book or just fewer
4:45
people will have the Kindle, for any given price is going
4:48
to lower the quantity demanded.
4:53
And so it'll essentially will shift,
4:54
it'll change the entire demand curve will shift the demand
4:57
curve to the left.
4:59
So this right over here is scenario two.
5:01
And you could imagine the other way,
5:03
if the Kindle's price went down, then
5:05
that would shift my demand curve to the right.
5:07
If the price of substitutes went down,
5:10
then that would shift my entire curve to the left.
5:13
So you can think about all the scenarios,
5:14
and actually I encourage you to.
5:15
Think about drawing yourself, think about for products,
5:17
that could be an ebook or could be some other type of product,
5:20
and think about what would happen.
5:22
Well, one, think about what the related products are,
5:24
the substitutes and potentially complements, and then
5:26
think about what happen as those prices change.
5:29
And always keep in mind the difference between demand,
5:32
which is this entire relationship, the entire curve
5:35
that we can move along if we hold everything else equal
5:38
and only change price, and quantity demanded,
5:41
which is a particular quantity for our particular price
5:44
holding everything else equal.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,-oClpRv7msg,

We now know how to find the area of rectangles.
0:03
What I want to do in this video,
0:04
is think about how we can find the areas of triangles.
0:07
So, we're starting here with a right triangle,
0:11
has a 90 degree angle right over here.
0:13
Right triangle ABC.
0:14
And let's think about how we can find this area.
0:17
Well, maybe we can construct a rectangle out of triangle ABC.
0:21
And if we can construct a rectangle out if it, and then, maybe we can
0:24
somehow find our area of part of that rectangle.
0:26
And the best way to construct a rectangle is to really duplicate ABC,
0:30
and then flip it over and put it right on top of this.
0:33
And just to verify, that definitely will be a rectangle.
0:36
So we know that this is 90 degrees right over here.
0:38
Let's say that this is x degrees right over there.
0:41
We have x + 90 + this thing have to be equal to 180.
0:45
So, this thing and this thing have to add up to 90.
0:48
Let's just call this 90-x.
0:51
Now, let's flip this thing and rotate it around,
0:54
so that it will look like this.
0:56
So, then you would have another triangle
0:58
that would look just like this.
1:00
Where now, this right angle,
1:03
on the flipped version is that right angle right over there.
1:06
This angle right over here, this x,
1:08
is now this angle right over there.
1:10
And this 90-x is now this angle, right over there.
1:14
And you can see x + 90-x, that'll give you a right angle.
1:18
And then you have x + 90-x, that gives you a right angle.
1:22
And you have four sides and four right angles,
1:25
you're definitely dealing with a rectangle.
1:27
And this rectangle has two of our original triangles in it.
1:31
So, we can write, we can write that the area of triangle ABC,
1:37
the area of triangle ABC, that's what the brackets mean,
1:40
area of triangle ABC,
1:42
is going to be equal to ? * the area of our entire rectangle.
1:47
And our entire rectangle, let me add another point here.
1:49
Let me call this D, is going to be ? the area of rectangle ABCD.
1:55
And we know how to find the area of rectangle ABCD.
2:00
It's going to be equal to,
2:02
it's going to be equal to the base of the rectangle.
2:05
So, this is going to be equal to ? * and so this part right over here.
2:10
Let me just use a different color.
2:11
The area of ABCD is equal to the base or the width of the rectangle.
2:16
So, that's just the length of BC.
2:19
I'm just putting this in parentheses, it doesn't mean！I just,
2:23
BC is just the length of this segment right over here
2:25
I'm just putting in the parentheses
2:26
so that we don't get the letters jumbled up.
2:28
So it's going to be this width or this base right here
2:30
times the height of the rectangle.
2:33
So, times AD.
2:35
Times！sorry, times AB.
2:38
So, it's this base * this height
2:41
gives us the area of the entire rectangle.
2:42
And the area of a right triangle is half of that.
2:45
So, there we have it.
2:46
It's ? * this base * this height.
2:52
It's the area of a right triangle.
2:54
So, in general if you ever have a right triangle,
2:56
if you ever have a right triangle,
2:57
and this is a right angle right over there which is,
3:01
you need one right angle in order for it to be a right triangle.
3:04
And this base has length B, and this side over here has length H.
3:08
You know that the area,
3:10
the area is going to be equal to ? * the base of the triangle.
3:19
That's the base of the triangle BC * the height of the triangle.
3:23
So you can view it this way, if you look at the actual letter points.
3:27
And if you just use these measures as a base * height,
3:29
it's just ? base * height.
3:30
And we only that this works right now for a right triangle.
3:34
Now, let's think about it for other types of triangles
3:36
that aren't necessarily right triangles.
3:38
So, here I have a kind of an arbitrary triangle ABC.
3:42
And to approach figuring out its area,
3:45
what I wanna do is just split this up into two right triangles.
3:48
So what I'm gonna do is draw a perpendicular from B,
3:52
so I'm just gonna really, if this was, if this was an actual structure,
3:55
you'll just literally drop something straight down from here,
3:57
and that line is going to be perpendicular
3:58
to this base right over here, to AC.
4:01
And let me call that point, let me call that point D.
4:05
And what's useful here is now we've constructed,
4:07
we've turned that one triangle into two right triangles.
4:11
So we can say that the area, let me write it this way,
4:15
we can say the area of triangle ABC,
4:18
that's what we wanna figure out.
4:20
It's equal to the area of this character right here.
4:24
So it's equal to the area of triangle ABD + the area of triangle,
4:35
+ the area of this magenta triangle.
4:38
So, plus the area of BCD, of BCD.
4:45
And this is useful
4:46
because we know how to find the area of right triangles.
4:48
Now, obviously this is 90 degrees
4:49
and this is also going to be 90 degrees.
4:51
The area of ABD is ? base * height.
4:54
So it's going to be ? * the base, which is the length AD.
4:59
So ? * AD, * the height, which is the length of BD right over here,
5:05
assuming that we can figure that out.
5:07
So this * that length, so, BD.
5:11
So that's the area of the blue triangle,
5:13
and I'll find the area of the magenta triangle.
5:14
Well, once again it's a right triangle.
5:16
It's gonna be ?, let me do that in magenta.
5:19
Let me do that in magenta.
5:20
So it's going to be ? * the length of this base right over here,
5:25
which is DC, the length of segment DC * the length of BD again.
5:30
Now, you can factor out a ?, we can factor out a ? BD
5:39
from both of these terms, ? BD.
5:42
So you get ? BD * AD, we're left with AD,
5:50
and that's not the same shade of blue.
5:53
We're left with AD + DC.
6:02
We close the parenthesis.
6:04
And what is AD + DC?
6:06
AD is the length, that length.
6:08
And then DC is this length.
6:10
So if you will add those two lengths, you get the length of AC.
6:13
So this whole thing, this whole thing is the length AC.
6:18
So, we're left with the area of ABC is equal to,
6:22
I'll use in a new color, it's equal to ?,
6:26
and I'll just switch the orders right over here.
6:27
? *, which I'm gonna write in that same color, * AC * BD.
6:34
Now, what is this again?
6:38
Well, this is now ? * the base, which is this AC, * the height,
6:43
which is BD.
6:44
So that's pretty cool.
6:45
It worked for right triangles, and it actually,
6:46
if we know the height of a triangle.
6:48
Now, this isn't one of the sides now.
6:49
For a right triangle, it was one of the sides.
6:51
Now, for this arbitrary triangle, it isn't.
6:53
But if we know it, the area of this triangle
6:56
is still ? * the base * the height.
6:59
Now, what about a triangle like this?
7:02
How can we figure out its area?
7:04
Well, let's try doing the same thing.
7:06
Let's see if we can somehow,
7:07
either construct this out of right triangles,
7:10
or maybe out a right triangle of this
7:12
to make it into another right triangle.
7:14
And the easiest way to do that is,
7:15
we could kind of just drop a rock from right over there.
7:18
And then this, and then where it kind of hits the ground
7:21
would form a right angle.
7:22
And let's call this point D.
7:24
And what we care about, what we wanna find in this,
7:27
what we wanna find the area of,
7:29
we wanna find the area of triangle ABC.
7:32
So that's what we care about.
7:34
Triangle ABC is what we wanna find the area.
7:36
But the area of triangle ABC is gonna be the area
7:40
of this larger right triangle that we've set up.
7:42
That's gonna be this larger triangle.
7:53
Minus the area of this smaller one right over here.
7:57
So, minus the area of ADC, of ADC.
8:03
So I just, this blue one ADB, this is just the whole thing.
8:07
This is the whole thing, just so we're clear of what we're talking about.
8:11
Now, what is the area of ADB.
8:13
Well, we know how to find the area of right triangles.
8:16
ADB, the area of ADB is going to be, is going to be ? * our base,
8:24
which is DB, the length of segment DB * our height,
8:30
which is the length of AD.
8:31
Times AD.
8:34
And then from that we wanna subtract the area of the smaller triangle.
8:37
So that's gonne be ? * our base, which is DC,
8:42
that's the length of our base, DC, * the length of our height,
8:46
which is AD, AD.
8:49
So, here we can factor out a ?, and we can factor an AD.
8:53
A ?, and an AD, so let's do that.
8:56
So we factor out a ? * AD.
8:59
And what's left inside is a DB - a DC.
9:11
Let me put the parenthesis in a white again.
9:16
Well, if you take the length, DB is the length of this whole thing.
9:20
You subtract from that the length DC, you're gonna be left with CB.
9:25
So this character right over here, this is C, this is CB.
9:31
And so the area of ABC is going to be equal to ? * CB,
9:38
I'm just switching the order of multiplication, with a yellow color.
9:42
? * CB * AD
9:46
Now, what is this?
9:49
Once again, it's ? * our base * our height.
9:54
And once again the height in this case,
9:56
'cause it's not a right triangle, it's not one of the sides.
10:00
Someone would have to give you that information.
10:02
You'd have to figure out what this actual height is.
10:05
But what's needed is,
10:06
in any form of triangle the area is ? base * height.
10:09
The height is, kind of, if you have the sides of a right triangle,
10:12
it's easy to figure out.
10:14
For these others, if it's not given,
10:16
you might have to do it in some tricky way,
10:18
figure out the height somehow.
10:20
But anyway, I hope that you find that useful.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,YOYQys52sPs,
khan_video_frBJEYvyd-8_110788,Is the absolute value just the number?,MCQ,"•
0:00
We're told to plot these values on a number line.
0:04
And you see every one of these values have an
0:06
absolute value sign.
0:08
So let's take a little bit of a review of what absolute
0:11
value even is.
0:18
The way I think about it, there's two ways
0:19
to think about it.
0:21
The first way to think about it is, how far is
0:23
something from 0?
0:25
So let me plot this negative 3 here.
0:28
So let me do a number line.
0:29
This isn't the number line for our actual answer, or to this
0:33
command-- plot these values on a number line.
0:36
I'm just first going to plot the numbers inside the
0:38
absolute value sign, and then we're going to take the
0:40
absolute value and plot those, just like they're
0:42
asking us to do.
0:44
So on this number line, if this is 0, if we go to the
0:47
negative, we're going to go to the left of 0.
0:49
So this is negative 1, negative 2, negative 3.
0:55
Negative 3 sits right over there, so this is negative 3
0:58
right there.
1:01
The absolute value of negative 3 is essentially saying, how
1:04
far are you away from 0?
1:07
How far is negative 3 from 0?
1:10
And you say, well, it's 1, 2, 3 away from 0.
1:15
So you'd say that the absolute value of negative 3 is equal
1:19
to positive 3.
1:22
Now that's really the conceptual way to imagine
1:25
absolute value.
1:26
How far are you away from 0?
1:31
But the easy way to calculate absolute value signs, if you
1:34
don't care too much about the concept, is whether it's
1:37
negative or positive, the absolute value of it's always
1:40
going to be positive.
1:41
Absolute value of negative 3 is positive 3.
1:44
Absolute value of positive 3 is still positive 3.
1:47
So you're always going to get the positive version of the
1:49
number, so to speak.
1:50
But conceptualy, you're just saying how far away
1:53
are you from 0.
1:55
So let's do what they asked.
1:56
So that first value, on this number line, so all of these
2:01
are absolute values.
2:02
So they're all going to be positive values.
2:03
So they're all going to be greater than 0.
2:05
So let me draw my number line, like this.
2:08
I can do a straighter number line than that.
2:10
Let's see.
2:11
Well, that's a little bit straighter.
2:14
And let's say, if this is 0, this would be negative 1, then
2:18
you'd have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
2:25
I think that'll do the trick.
2:26
So this first quantity here-- I'll do it in orange --the
2:30
absolute value of negative 3, we just figured out, that is
2:33
positive 3.
2:34
So I'll plot it right over there, positive 3.
2:38
Then this next value, right here, the absolute value of 7.
2:43
If we look over here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
2:48
7 is how far away from 0?
2:50
It is 7 away from 0.
2:53
So the absolute value of 7 is equal to 7.
2:58
So you already see the pattern there.
3:00
If it's negative, it just becomes positive.
3:01
If it's already positive, it just equals itself.
3:05
So plotting this value, I'll just place
3:07
it right over there.
3:10
So the absolute value of 7 is 7.
3:12
Absolute value of negative 3 is positive 3.
3:16
Let me mark out the 0 a little bit better, so you see
3:20
relative to 0.
3:22
Now we have the absolute value of 8 minus 12.
3:29
Well, first of all, let's figure out what 8 minus 12 is.
3:32
So if you take 12 away from 8, you're at negative 4.
3:37
12 less than 8 is negative 4.
3:39
And you can do that on a number line if you don't quite
3:44
remember how to do this.
3:45
But if you, you know, if you take 8 away from 8, you're at
3:49
0, and then you take another one, you're at negative 1,
3:51
negative 2, negative 3, all the way to negative 4.
3:55
So this is equal to the absolute value of negative 4.
3:59
If we just plot negative 4, we go 1, 2, 3, negative 4 is
4:05
right over there.
4:06
But if we're taking its absolute value, we're saying
4:09
how far is negative 4 from 0?
4:11
Well it's 4 away from 0.
4:13
1, 2, 3, 4.
4:16
So this is equal to positive 4.
4:18
So we'll plot it right here.
4:20
This number line is the answer to this command up here.
4:23
So the absolute value of 8 minus 12, which is negative 4,
4:29
is positive 4.
4:31
Then we have the absolute value of 0.
4:37
So how far is 0 from 0?
4:40
Well, it's 0 away from 0.
4:42
The absolute value of 0 is 0, so you can just plot it right
4:47
over there.
4:48
And we have one left.
4:49
Let me pick a suitable color here.
4:53
The absolute value of 7 minus 2.
4:59
Well, 7 minus 2 is 5, so this is the same thing as the
5:02
absolute value of 5.
5:04
How far is 5 away from 0?
5:06
Well, it's just 5 away.
5:08
It's almost, you know, too easy.
5:10
That's what makes it confusing.
5:11
If I were to plot 5, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
5:15
It is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 spaces from 0.
5:18
So the absolute value of 5 is 5.
5:21
So you plot it just like that.
5:24
So conceptually, it's how far you are away from 0.
5:27
But if you think about it in kind of just very simple
5:29
terms, if it's a negative number, it becomes a positive
5:32
version of it.
5:33

Say you're me and you're in math class,
0:01
and you're doodling flowery petally things.
0:03
If you want something with lots of overlapping petals,
0:05
you're probably following a loose sort of rule
0:07
that goes something like this.
0:09
Add new petals where there's gaps between old petals.
0:12
You can try doing this precisely.
0:14
Start with some number of petals, say five,
0:16
then add another layer in between.
0:18
But the next layer, you have to add 10, then the next has 20.
0:21
The inconvenient part of this is that you
0:23
have to finish a layer before everything is even.
0:25
Ideally, you'd have a rule that just
0:27
lets you add petals until you get bored.
0:29
Now imagine you're a plant, and you
0:31
want to grow in a way that spreads out
0:32
your leaves to catch the most possible sunlight.
0:35
Unfortunately, and I hope I'm not
0:37
presuming too much in thinking that, as a plant,
0:39
you're not very smart.
0:41
You don't know how to add number to create a series,
0:43
you don't know geometry and proportions,
0:45
and can't draw spirals, or rectangles, or slug cats.
0:48
But maybe you could follow one simple rule.
0:51
Botanists have noticed that plants
0:53
seem to be fairly consistent when
0:54
it comes to the angle between one leaf and the next.
0:57
So let's see what you could do with that.
0:59
So you grow your first leaf, and if you didn't change angle
1:01
at all, then the next leaf you grow
1:02
would be directly above it.

So that's no good, because it blocks
1:05
all the light or something.
1:06
You can go 180 degrees, to have the next leaf directly
1:09
opposite, which seems ideal.
1:10
Only once you go 180 again, the third leaf
1:12
is right over the first.
1:14
In fact, any fraction of a circle
1:16
with a whole number as a base is going
1:17
to have complete overlap after that number of turns.
1:20
And unlike when you're doodling, as a plant
1:22
you're not smart enough to see you've gone all the way around
1:25
and now should switch to adding things in between.
1:27
If you try and postpone the overlap
1:29
by making the fraction really small,
1:31
you just get a ton of overlap in the beginning,
1:33
and waste all this space, which is completely disastrous.
1:36
Or maybe other fractions are good.
1:37
The kind that position leaves in a star like pattern.
1:40
It will be a while before it overlaps,
1:41
and the leaves will be more evenly spaced in the meantime.
1:45
But what if there were a fraction that
1:46
never completely overlapped?
1:48
For any rational fraction, eventually the star will close.
1:51
But what if you used an irrational number?
1:53
The kind of number that can't be expressed as a whole number
1:56
ratio.
1:56
What if you used the most irrational number?
1:59
If you think it sounds weird to say one irrational number is
2:02
more irrational than another, well, you
2:03
might want to become a number theorist.
2:05
If you are a number theorist, you
2:06
might tell us that phi is the most irrational number.
2:09
Or you might say, that's like saying, of all the integers,
2:12
1 is the integer-iest.
2:13
Or you might disagree completely.
2:14
But anyway, phi.
2:16
It's more than 1, but less than 2, more than 3/2,
2:19
less than 5/3.
2:20
Greater than 8/5, but 13/8 is too big.
2:24
21/13 is just a little too small,
2:26
and 34/21 is even closer, but too big, and so on.
2:30
Each pair of adjacent Fibonacci numbers
2:33
creates a ratio that gets closer and closer
2:35
to Phi as the numbers increase.
2:37
Those are the same numbers on the sides of these squares.
2:40
Now stop being a number theorist,
2:42
and start being a plant again.
2:44
You put your first leaf somewhere, and the second leaf
2:46
at an angle, which is one Phi-th of a circle.
2:49
Which depending on whether you're
2:50
going one way or the other, could be about 222.5 degrees,
2:54
or about 137.5.
2:56
Great, your second leaf is pretty far from the first,
2:59
gets lots of space in the sun.
3:00
And now let's add the next one a Phi-th of the circle away.
3:03
And again, and again.
3:05
You can see how new leaves tend to pop up
3:07
in the spaces left between old leaves,
3:09
but it never quite fills things evenly.
3:11
So there's always room for one more leaf,
3:13
without having to do a whole new layer.
3:15
It's very practical and as a plant you probably like this.
3:18
It would also be a good way to give lots of room
3:20
to seed pods and petals and stuff.
3:22
As a plant that follows this scheme,
3:24
you'd be at an advantage.
3:26
Where do spirals come in?
3:28
Let's doodle a pinecone using this same method.
3:30
By the way, you can make your own phi angle-a-tron
3:32
by dog-earing a corner of your notebook.
3:34
If you folded it so the edges of the line--
3:36
You have 45 degrees plus 90, which is 135.
3:40
Pretty close to 137.5.
3:43
If you're careful, you can slip in a couple more degrees.
3:45
Detach your angle-a-tron and you're good to go.
3:48
Add each new pine cone-y thing a phi angle around,
3:50
and make them a little farther out each time.
3:53
Which you can keep track of by marking
3:54
the distance on your angle-a-tron.
3:56
Check it out!
3:56
The spirals form by themselves.
3:59
And if we count the number of arms, look it's five and eight.
4:02
If you're wondering why spirals would form,
4:04
and why always with Fibonacci numbers,
4:06
you could morph back into a number theorist, or a geometer
4:09
or something.
4:09
But here's just a little bit of intuition.
4:11
One simple way to do a flower is to start
4:13
with a certain number of petals, say five.
4:15
And when you go back around, add the next layer
4:17
close to the first, but bigger.
4:18
Each layer adds five new petals and the five arms spiral out.
4:22
Looks pretty spiral-ey to me.
4:23
Now go back to phi.
4:24
You put out three petals before you go back around.
4:27
And if I make them really wide, the next lap
4:29
adds three petals that overlap a bunch with the first,
4:32
and so on.
4:33
If I started with skinnier petals though,
4:35
the second time you go around it doesn't quite overlap so much.
4:38
And it takes eight petals before it goes around twice
4:41
and they overlap enough for you to see the spirals.
4:43
So this time I get 8 and 13.
4:45
I mean none of the spirals are actually physically there
4:48
on any of these plants, it's just the plant bits
4:50
are close enough that you can see the pattern.
4:52
So all the plant needs to do to get awesome Fibonacci
4:54
numbers of spirals, is add new bits at 137.5 degree angles.
5:00
The rest takes care of itself.
5:02
That the Fibonacci series is in so many things
5:05
really says less about those things,
5:07
and more about mathematics.
5:08
I mean that's what mathematics is all about.
5:10
Simple rules, complex consequences.
5:12
A process so easy that even a plant can do it,
5:14
can turn into these amazing structures all around us.
5:18
Just like a few simple postulates
5:19
can give us an incredibly powerful geometry.
5:22
I mean that's all assuming that a plant can do it.
5:24
But measuring the angles between plant bits,
5:26
you can see they obviously do do it, somehow.
5:28
I mean, it's not like they have angle-trons,
5:30
but plants have been around a long time,
5:32
and have had a lot of practice, so that probably
5:34
explains everything.
5:36
And so we always get spirals of 5 and 8 on this flower, 5 and 8
5:39
on this artichoke, 5 and 8 on this pine cone,
5:41
even this cauliflower has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-- um, anyway,
5:47
we always get 1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-- Huh.
5:51
And 1, 2, 3, 4?
5:54
It's easy to dismiss these as mutant anomalies,
5:56
but just because they're different and unusual,
5:58
doesn't mean we should ignore them.
6:00
4?
6:00
7?
6:01
11?
6:02
What could these numbers mean?

0:00
So I've got this crazy discontinuous function here,
0:03
which we'll call f of x.
0:05
And my goal is to try to draw its derivative right over here.
0:11
So what I'm going to need to think about
0:13
is the slope of the tangent line,
0:15
or the slope at each point in this curve,
0:17
and then try my best to draw that slope.
0:21
So let's try to tackle it.
0:23
So right over here at this point, the slope is positive.
0:28
And actually, it's a good bit positive.
0:32
And then as we get larger and larger x's, the slope
0:34
is still positive, but it's less positive-- and all the way up
0:39
to this point right over here, where it becomes 0.
0:44
So let's see how I could draw that over here.
0:46
So over here we know that the slope
0:48
must be equal to 0-- right over here.
0:50
Remember over here, I'm going to try
0:52
to draw y is equal to f prime of x.
0:58
And I'm going to assume that this
1:00
is some type of a parabola.
1:02
And you'll learn shortly why I had to make that assumption.
1:05
But let's say that, so let's see, here
1:08
the slope is quite positive.
1:10
So let's say the slope is right over here.
1:13
And then it gets less and less and less positive.
1:15
And I'll assume it does it in a linear fashion.
1:17
That's why I had to assume that it's some type of a parabola.
1:20
So it gets less and less and less positive.
1:21
Notice here, for example, the slope is still positive.
1:26
And so when you look at the derivative,
1:29
the slope is still a positive value.
1:31
But as we get larger and larger x's up to this point,
1:34
the slope is getting less and less positive,
1:36
all the way to 0.
1:37
And then the slope is getting more and more negative.
1:41
And at this point, it seems like the slope is just as negative
1:46
as it was positive there.
1:47
So at this point right over here,
1:49
the slope is just as negative as it
1:52
was positive right over there.
1:54
So it seems like this would be a reasonable view
1:58
of the slope of the tangent line over this interval.
2:04
Now let's think about as we get to this point.
2:07
Here the slope seems constant.
2:10
Our slope is a constant positive value.
2:13
So once again, our slope here is a constant positive line.
2:17
Let me be careful here because at this point,
2:20
our slope won't really be defined, because our slope,
2:23
you could draw multiple tangent lines
2:26
at this little pointy point.
2:28
So let me just draw a circle right over there.
2:33
But then as we get right over here,
2:34
the slope seems to be positive.
2:40
So let's draw that.
2:41
The slope seems to be positive, although it's
2:45
not as positive as it was there.
2:47
So the slope looks like it is-- I'm just trying to eyeball it--
2:53
so the slope is a constant positive this entire time.
2:56
We have a line with a constant positive slope.
2:59
So it might look something like this.
3:02
And let me make it clear what interval I am talking about.
3:08
I want these things to match up.
3:11
So let me do my best.
3:13
So this matches up to that.
3:17
This matches up over here.
3:21
And we just said we have a constant positive slope.
3:25
So let's say it looks something like that over this interval.
3:30
And then we look at this point right over here.
3:32
So right at this point, our slope is going to be undefined.
3:34
There's no way that you could find the slope over--
3:36
or this point of discontinuity.
3:38
But then when we go over here, even
3:39
though the value of our function has gone down,
3:41
we still have a constant positive slope.
3:43
In fact, the slope of this line looks
3:45
identical to the slope of this line.
3:47
Let me do that in a different color.
3:49
The slope of this line looks identical.
3:51
So we're going to continue at that same slope.
3:53
It was undefined at that point, but we're
3:55
going to continue at that same slope.
3:59
And once again, it's undefined here
4:01
at this point of discontinuity.
4:03
So the slope will look something like that.
4:06
And then we go up here.
4:07
The value of the function goes up,
4:09
but now the function is flat.
4:11
So the slope over that interval is 0.
4:13
The slope over this interval, right over here, is 0.
4:17
So we could say-- let me make it clear
4:21
what interval I'm talking about-- the slope
4:24
over this interval is 0.
4:27
And then finally, in this last section--
4:32
let me do this in orange-- the slope becomes negative.
4:37
But it's a constant negative.
4:40
And it seems actually a little bit more negative
4:42
than these were positive.
4:43
So I would draw it right over there.
4:48
So it's a weird looking function.
4:50
But the whole point of this video
4:51
is to give you an intuition for thinking about what
4:53
the slope of this function might look like at any point.
4:57

0:00
In most topics you have to get pretty advanced before you
0:03
start addressing the philosophically interesting
0:05
things, but in chemistry it just starts right from the
0:08
get-go with what's arguably the most philosophically
0:11
interesting part of the whole topic, and that's the atom.
0:15
And the idea of the atom, as philosophers long ago, and you
0:18
could look it up on the different philosophers who
0:21
first philosophized about it, they said, hey, you know, if I
0:23
started off with, I don't know, if I started off with an
0:28
apple, and I just kept cutting the apple -- let me draw a
0:32
nice looking apple just so it doesn't look just
0:34
like a heart .
0:36
There you go.
0:36
You have a nice looking apple, And you just kept cutting it,
0:38
smaller and smaller pieces.
0:40
So eventually, you get a piece so small, so tiny, that you
0:44
can't cut it anymore.
0:46
And I'm sure some of these philosophers went out there
0:48
with a knife and tried to do it and they just felt that,
0:50
oh, if I could just get my knife a little bit sharper, I
0:52
could cut it again and again.
0:53
So it's a completely philosophical construct, which
0:56
frankly, in a lot of ways, isn't too different to how the
0:59
atom is today.
1:00
It's really just a mental abstraction that allows us to
1:04
describe a lot of observations we see in the universe.
1:07
But anyway, these philosophers said, well, at some point we
1:10
think that there's going to be some little part of an apple
1:15
that they won't be able to divide anymore.
1:16
And they called that an atom.
1:18
And it doesn't just have to just be for an apple they said
1:19
this is true for any substance or any element to that you
1:23
encounter in the universe.
1:25
And so the word atom is really Greek for uncuttable.
1:29
Uncuttable or indivisible.
1:34
Now we know that it actually is cuttable and even though it
1:37
is not a trivial thing, it's not the smallest form of
1:42
matter we know.
1:43
We now know that an atom is made up of other more
1:47
fundamental particles.
1:48
And let me write that.
1:50
So the we have the neutron.
1:55
And I'll draw in a second how they all fit together and the
1:59
structure of an atom.
2:00
We have a neutron.
2:02
We have a proton.
2:05
And we have electrons.
2:09
Electrons.
2:11
And you might already be familiar with this if you look
2:13
at old videos about atomic projects, you'll see a drawing
2:18
that looks something like this.
2:20
Let me see if I can draw one.
2:21
So you'll have something like that.
2:24
And you'll have these things spinning around
2:27
that look like this.
2:28
They have orbits that look like that.
2:30
And maybe something that looks like that.
2:33
And the general notion behind these kind of nuclear drawings
2:36
-- and I'm sure that they still show up at some
2:39
government defense labs or something like that -- is that
2:41
you have a nucleus at the center of an atom.
2:46
You have a nucleus at the center of an atom.
2:48
And we know that a nucleus has neutrons and protons.
2:52
Neutrons and protons.
2:53
And we'll talk a little bit more about which elements have
2:56
how many neutrons and how many protons.
2:59
And then orbiting, and I'm going to use the word orbit
3:02
right now, although we'll learn in about two minutes
3:05
that the word orbit is actually the incorrect or even
3:08
the mentally incorrect way of visualizing what
3:10
an electron is doing.
3:11
But the old idea was that you have these electrons that are
3:14
orbiting around the nucleus very similar to the way the
3:17
Earth orbits around the Sun or the moon
3:19
orbits around the Earth.
3:21
And it's been shown that that's actually
3:23
a very wrong way.
3:26
And when we cover quantum mechanics we'll learn why this
3:30
doesn't work, what are the contradictions that emerge
3:34
when you try to model an electron like a planet going
3:38
around the Sun.
3:40
But this was kind of the original idea, and frankly I
3:41
think this is kind of the idea that is the most mainstream
3:45
way of viewing an atom.
3:50
Now, I said an atom is philosophically interesting.
3:52
Why is it philosophically interesting?
3:53
Because what we now view as the accepted way of viewing an
3:58
atom really starts to blur the line between our physical
4:04
reality and everything in the world is just information, and
4:09
there really isn't any such thing as true matter or true
4:12
particles as the way we define them in our everyday life.
4:15
You know, for me a particle, oh, it looks
4:16
like a grain of sand.
4:17
I can pick it up, touch it.
4:19
While a wave, that could be like a soundwave. It could be
4:21
just this change in energy over time.
4:23
But we'll learn, especially when we do quantum mechanics,
4:25
that it all gets jumbled up as we start approaching the
4:29
scales or the size of an atom.
4:31
Anyway, I said this was an incorrect way of doing it.
4:34
What's the correct way?
4:37
So it turns out-- this is a picture, not a picture really,
4:40
this is also a depiction.
4:42
So it's an interesting question, what I just said.
4:44
How can you have a picture of an atom?
4:47
Because is actually turns out that most wavelengths of
4:49
light, especially the visible wavelengths of light, are much
4:52
larger than the size of an atom.
4:56
Everything else we quote-unquote, observe in
4:58
life, it's by reflected light.
5:00
But all of a sudden when you're dealing with an atom,
5:02
reflected light you could almost view it as too big, or
5:06
too blunt of an instrument with which to observe an atom.
5:09
Anyway, this is a depiction of a helium atom.
5:14
A helium atom has two protons and two neutrons.
5:18
Or at least this helium atom has two
5:19
protons and two neutrons.
5:21
And the way they depict it here in the nucleus, right
5:24
there, maybe these are the two-- I'm assuming they're
5:26
using red for proton and purple for neutron.
5:32
Purple seems like more of a neutral color.
5:34
And they're sitting at the center of this atom.
5:39
And then this whole haze around there, those are the
5:42
two electrons that helium has, or that at least
5:45
this helium atom has.
5:47
Maybe you could gain or lose an electron.
5:49
But these are the two electrons.
5:50
And you say, hey, Sal, how can two electrons be this blur
5:55
that's kind of smeared around this atom.
5:58
And that's where it gets philosophically interesting.
6:01
So you cannot describe an electron's path around a
6:09
nucleus with the traditional orbit idea that we've
6:12
encountered when we look at planets or if we just imagine
6:16
things at kind of a larger scale.
6:18
It turns out that an electron, you cannot know exactly its
6:24
momentum and location at any given point in time.
6:28
All you can know is a probability distribution of
6:31
where it is likely to be.
6:33
And the way they depicted this, black is a higher
6:36
probability, so you're much more likely to find the
6:39
electron here than you are here.
6:42
But the electron really could be anywhere.
6:43
It could even to be here, even though it's completely white
6:46
there, with some very, very, very, very, very low
6:49
probability.
6:50
And so this function of where an electron is, this is called
6:55
an orbital.
6:56
Orbital.
6:57
Not to be confused with orbit.
7:00
Orbital.
7:02
Remember, an orbit was something like this.
7:05
It's like Venus going around the Sun.
7:08
So it's very physically easy for us to imagine.
7:12
While an orbital is actually a mathematical probability
7:16
function that tells us where we're
7:17
likely to find an electron.
7:18
We'll deal a lot more with that when we cover quantum
7:21
mechanics, but that's not going to be in the scope of
7:23
this kind of introductory set of chemistry lectures.
7:26
But it's interesting, right?
7:28
An electron's behavior is so bizarre at that scale that you
7:32
can't-- I mean, to call it a particle is almost misleading.
7:35
It is called a particle, but it's not a particle in the
7:38
sense that we're used to in our everyday life.
7:40
It's this thing that you can't even say exactly where it is.
7:45
It can be anywhere in this haze.
7:47
And we'll learn later that there are different shapes of
7:49
the hazes is as we add more and more electrons to an atom.
7:53
But to me, it starts to address philosophical issues
7:57
of what matter even is, or do the things we look at, how
8:01
real are they?
8:02
Or how real are they, at least as we've defined reality?
8:04
Anyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.
8:07
But the whole notion of electrons, protons, they're
8:12
all kind of predicated on this notion of charge.
8:15
And we've talked about it before when we learned about
8:17
Coulomb's law.
8:18
You could review Coulomb's laws videos in the physics
8:22
playlist. But the idea is that an electron
8:27
has a negative charge.
8:29
A proton, sometimes written like that,
8:31
has a positive charge.
8:33
And a neutron has no charge.
8:37
And so that's what was tempting about the original
8:39
model of an electron.
8:42
If they say, OK, if this thing has positive charges, right?
8:45
So let's say this is two neutrons and two protons.
8:47
Let's say it's a helium atom.
8:48
Then we'll have some positive charges here.
8:51
We have some negative charges out here.
8:54
Opposite charges attract.
8:56
And so if these things had some velocity, enough
9:03
velocity, they would orbit around this, just the way a
9:08
planet will orbit around the Sun.
9:10
But now we learn, even though this is partially true, that
9:15
the further away an electron is from the nucleus, it does
9:23
have more, it's true, potential energy.
9:27
In that it will want to move towards the nucleus, but
9:31
because of all the mechanics at the quantum level, it won't
9:34
just do something simple like move in a path like that, like
9:37
a comet would do around the Sun, it actually has this kind
9:41
of wave-like behavior, where it just has this probability
9:43
function that describes it.
9:45
But the further away an orbital, it
9:48
does have more potential.
9:50
We're going to go a lot more into that in future videos.
9:53
But anyway, how do you recognize what an element is?
9:56
I've talked a lot about the philosophy and all of that,
9:58
but how do I know that this is helium?
10:00
Is it by the number of neutrons it has?
10:03
Is it by the number of protons it has?
10:05
Is it by the number of electrons?
10:07
Well the answer is, it's by the number of protons.
10:09
So if you know the number of protons in an element, you
10:13
know what that element is.
10:14
And the number of protons, this is defined
10:21
as the atomic number.
10:26
Now, so let's say I said something has four protons.
10:33
How do we know what it is?
10:34
Well if we haven't memorized it, we could look it up on the
10:37
periodic table of elements, which we'll be dealing with a
10:39
lot in this playlist. And you'd say, oh, four protons,
10:43
that is beryllium.
10:45
Right there.
10:46
And the atomic number is the number that you see up there.
10:50
And that' s literally the number of protons.
10:52
And that is what differentiates
10:55
one atom from another.
10:56
If you have fifteen protons, you're dealing with
10:59
phosphorus.
11:00
And all of a sudden, if you have seven protons, you're
11:06
dealing with nitrogen.
11:07
If you have eight, you're dealing with oxygen.
11:09
That is what defines the element.
11:11
Now, we'll talk in the future about what happens with charge
11:15
and all of that.
11:17
Or what happens when you gain or lose electrons.
11:19
But that does not change what element you're dealing with.
11:21
And likewise, when you change the number of neutrons, that
11:26
also does not change the element you're dealing with.
11:30
But that leads to an obvious question of, well, how many
11:32
neutrons and electrons do you have?
11:35
Well, if an atom is charge-neutral, that means it
11:43
has the same number of electrons.
11:46
So let's say that I have carbon.
11:52
Its atomic number is six.
11:53
And let's say its mass number is twelve.
12:00
Now what does this mean?
12:01
And let me say further that this is a neutral particle.
12:05
This is a neutral atom.
12:07
So the atomic number for carbon is six.
12:10
That tells us exactly how many protons it has.
12:13
So if I were to draw a little model here, and this is in no
12:16
way an accurate model.
12:17
I'll draw six-- two, three, four, five, six
12:21
protons in the center.
12:23
And the weight of these protons, each proton is one
12:26
atomic mass unit, and we'll talk more about how that
12:28
relates to kilograms. It's a very small
12:31
fraction of a kilogram.
12:32
Roughly I think it's 1.6 times 10 to the
12:36
minus 27th of a kilogram.
12:38
So let's say each of these are one atomic mass unit, and
12:45
that's approximately equal to, I think, 1.67 times 10 to the
12:48
minus 27 kilograms. This is a very small number.
12:53
It's actually almost impossible to visualize.
12:57
At least it is for me.
12:58
This tells me the mass of the entire carbon atom, of this
13:03
particular carbon atom.
13:04
And this can actually change from carbon
13:05
atom to carbon atom.
13:07
And this is essentially the mass of all of the protons
13:10
plus all of the neutrons.
13:12
And each proton has an atomic mass of one, in atomic mass
13:17
units, and each neutron has an atomic mass of
13:20
one atomic mass unit.
13:22
So this is really the number of protons plus
13:28
the number of neutrons.
13:33
So in this case we have six protons, so we must also have
13:37
six neutrons.
13:39
Six neutrons plus six protons.
13:42
Now, where are the electrons?
13:44
Well, I said it's neutral, so the proton has an equal
13:49
positive charge as the electron's negative charge.
13:51
So this is a neutral atom, and it has six protons, so it also
13:55
has six electrons.
13:56
Let me draw that.
13:57
So we said it has six neutrons in here.
13:59
One, two, three, four, five, six.
14:01
So that's the nucleus right there.
14:04
And then if we were to draw the electons-- well, I could
14:09
draw it as a smear, but if we want to kind of visualize it a
14:12
little better, we could say, OK, there's going to be six
14:13
electrons orbiting.
14:15
One, two, three, four, five, six.
14:18
And they're going to be moving around in this unpredictable
14:21
way that we would have to describe with
14:22
a probability function.
14:24
And so the interesting thing about it is, most of the mass
14:30
of an atom is sitting right in here.
14:32
I mean, you might notice that when people care about the
14:34
mass, when they care about the atomic mass number of an atom,
14:40
they ignore the electrons.
14:41
And that's because the mass of a proton, one proton
14:47
mass-wise, is equal to 1,836 electons.
14:52
So for thinking about the mass of an atom, for all basic
14:58
purposes, you can ignore the mass of an electron.
15:01
It's really the mass of the nucleus that counts as the
15:08
mass of the atom.
15:10
Now, you might see this periodic table here, and you
15:12
say, OK, they gave us the atomic number up there.
15:15
The atomic number of oxygen is eight.
15:18
It means it has eight protons.
15:20
The atomic number of silicon is 14.
15:22
It has 14 protons.
15:24
Now what is this right here?
15:27
Let's see, in carbon.
15:28
In carbon they have this 12.0107.
15:34
That is the atomic weight of carbon.
15:36
Let me write this.
15:41
Atomic weight of carbon.
15:47
The atomic weight of carbon is 12.0107.
15:56
Now, what does that mean?
15:57
Does that mean that carbon has six protons and then the
16:03
remainder, the remaining 6.0107 neutrons, it has kind
16:09
of this fraction of a neutron?
16:11
No.
16:12
It means if you were to average all the different
16:16
versions of carbon you find on the planet and you were to
16:19
average the number of neutrons based on the quantity of the
16:25
different types of carbon, this is the
16:27
average you would get.
16:28
So it turns out that carbon, the two major forms, the main
16:32
one you'll find is carbon-12.
16:35
So that's like this.
16:36
So that has six protons and six neutrons.
16:39
And then another isotope of carbon.
16:42
Now an isotope is the same element with a different
16:45
number of neutrons.
16:46
Another isotope of carbon is carbon-14, which is much more
16:50
scarce on the planet.
16:52
We don't know how much in the universe, but on the planet.
16:55
Now, if you were to average these, not just a straight-up
16:58
average, then you would get carbon-13 and then the atomic
17:01
weight would be 13, but you weight this one much higher
17:04
because this exists in much larger quantities on Earth.
17:07
I mean, this is pretty much all of the
17:08
carbon that you see.
17:09
But there's a little bit of this.
17:10
So if you weight them appropriately, the average
17:13
becomes this.
17:14
So most of the carbon you'll find-- if you just found
17:17
carbon someplace, on average its weight in atomic mass
17:22
units is going to be 12.0107.
17:27
But that idea of an isotope is an interesting one.
17:29
Remember, when you change the neutrons, you're not changing
17:32
the actual, fundamental element.
17:33
You're just getting a different isotope, a different
17:36
version, of the element.
17:37
So these two versions of carbon are both isotopes.
17:41
Now, I want to leave this video with what I think is
17:43
kind of the neatest idea behind atoms. And it's the
17:46
most philosophically interesting things about them.
17:49
It's that the relative size-- so, we have these electrons,
17:54
which represent very little of the mass of an atom.
17:58
It's 1/2000 of the mass of an atom are the electrons.
18:01
And even those, it's hard to even describe them as
18:04
particles, because you can't even tell me exactly where and
18:08
how fast one of these particles is moving.
18:11
They just have a probability function.
18:12
So most of the atom is sitting inside the nucleus.
18:16
And this is the interesting thing.
18:17
If you look at an atom on average, if you
18:21
say this is my atom.
18:23
Let's say I had two atoms that are bonded to each other.
18:26
And I were to say, how much of this is actual stuff?
18:29
And when I say stuff, that's a very abstract concept, because
18:32
we're talking about the nucleus, right?
18:33
Because the nucleus is where all the
18:34
mass is, all the stuff.
18:36
It turns out that it's actually an infinitesimally
18:39
small fraction of the volume of the atom where-- the volume
18:44
of the atom is hard to define, because the electron can
18:45
pretty much be anywhere, but if you view the volume as
18:48
where you're most likely to find the electron, or with 90%
18:52
probability you're likely to find the electron, then the
18:55
nucleus is, in a lot of cases and the way I think about it,
18:59
it's about 1/10,000 of the volume.
19:01
So if you think about it, when you look at something, if you
19:03
look at your hand or if you look at the wall or if you
19:06
look at your computer, 99.999% of it is free space.
19:14
It's nothing.
19:15
It's vacuum.
19:18
If you had ultra-small-- I guess we could call them
19:20
particles or something-- most of them would pass straight
19:23
through whatever you look at.
19:24
So it already starts to kind of
19:26
question our hold on reality.
19:28
What is there when, if-- and this is fact, this isn't
19:32
theory right here-- that if you take anything down to the
19:35
building blocks, down to the atomic level, most of the
19:39
space of that kind of, quote-unquote object, is free
19:43
vacuum space.
19:44
You could go straight through it if you could get down to
19:46
that scale.
19:47
This image of a helium atom, they say right here this is
19:50
one femtometer.
19:52
Right?
19:52
One femtometer.
19:57
This is the scale of the nucleus of a
20:00
helium atom, right?
20:01
One femtometer.
20:03
This is one angstrom, right?
20:04
And they say that equals 100,000 femtometers.
20:06
And just to get a sense of scale, one angstrom is 1 times
20:10
10 to the negative 10 meters, right?
20:13
So the atom is roughly on the scale of an angstrom.
20:15
In the case of helium, the nucleus is
20:17
even a smaller fraction.
20:18
It's 1/100,000.
20:20
So if you had-- let's say you had liquid helium, which you'd
20:23
have to get very cold to get.
20:25
If you're looking at that, most of it is free space.
20:27
If you're looking at an iron bar, the great, great, great,
20:30
great, great, great majority of it is free space.
20:33
And we're not even talking about, maybe there's some free
20:35
space inside the nucleus that we could talk
20:37
about in the future.
20:38
But to me, that just blows my mind that most things we look
20:41
at are not really solid.
20:44
They're really just empty space, but they look solid
20:47
because of the way light reflects on them or the forces
20:50
that repel us.
20:51
But there really isn't something to touch there.
20:55
That most of this right here is all free space.
20:57
I think I've said the word free space now, and I think
21:00
I'll leave further
21:02
mind-blowing to the next video.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,1xSQlwWGT8M,

0:00
What I want to do in this video is talk a little bit
0:02
about the kidney-- and this is a big picture of a kidney--
0:05
and to talk about how it operates at its-- I guess you
0:08
could call it its smallest functional level and that's
0:10
the nephron.
0:11
So we're going to talk about the kidney and the nephron.
0:16
And I think you might already know the kidney.
0:18
We have two of them.
0:19
They're the organ that, I guess, is most famous for
0:23
producing or allowing us to excrete waste.
0:27
But part of that process, it also helps us maintain our
0:32
water, the correct level, and actually the amount of salts
0:36
or electrolytes we have and our blood pressure, but I'll
0:39
just say maintain water.
0:40
And it also produces hormones and things, and I'm not going
0:42
to go into a lot of detail on that right now.
0:45
I really just want to focus on these first two to kind of
0:48
just understand the overview function of the kidney.
0:52
And most of us have two of these.
0:54
They're kind of closer to our back on either sides of our
0:57
spine behind our liver.
0:59
And this is a zoomed-in version of it.
1:02
If you're watching this in full screen, it's not going to
1:04
be as big as this picture is, but we've sliced it so we can
1:07
see what's going on inside the kidney.
1:10
Just to understand the different parts here, just
1:15
because it will actually be significant when we start
1:17
talking about the functional units or the nephron within
1:20
the kidney, this area right here from here to here, this
1:24
is called the renal cortex.
1:28
Whenever we talk about something with the kidney, if
1:31
you see a renal anything, that's actually referring to
1:34
the kidney.
1:34
So this right here is a renal cortex, that
1:36
outer part right there.
1:38
And then this area right here, this is the renal medulla.
1:44
And medulla comes from middle.
1:46
So you can almost view it as the middle of the kidney.
1:52
Besides just understanding these words, we're going to
1:55
see that they actually play a very important role in this
1:58
actual filtration or this excretion of waste and this
2:01
ability to not dump too much water or excrete too much
2:05
water when we're trying to filter out our blood.
2:09
So I've said before, and you might have heard it already
2:11
from other lectures or from other teachers, that the
2:14
functional unit of the kidney is the nephron.
2:22
And the reason why it's called a functional unit-- I'll put
2:25
it in quotes-- is because that's the level at which
2:28
these two things are happening.
2:30
The two major functions of the kidney: the waste excretion
2:32
and the maintenance of the water level
2:36
in our blood system.
2:37
So just to get an idea of how a nephron fits in within this
2:41
picture of a kidney-- I got this picture from Wikipedia.
2:45
The artist tried to draw a couple of nephrons over here.
2:48
So a nephron will look something like this, and it
2:50
dips down into the medulla, and then it goes back into the
2:53
cortex, and then it dumps into collecting ducts, and
2:56
essentially the fluid will end up in the ureters right here
2:59
and end up in our urinary bladder that we can later
3:02
excrete when we find a suitable time.
3:05
But that's about-- I guess you can imagine
3:07
the length of a nephron.
3:10
This is where it starts and then it dips down again.
3:13
So multiple nephrons are going to keep doing that, but
3:14
they're super thin.
3:15
These tubes or these tubules, maybe I should
3:18
say, are super thin.
3:20
Your average kidney will contain on the order of one
3:26
million nephrons.
3:31
You can't really say, my nephrons are microscopic.
3:34
They kind of have a-- at least their length when they dip
3:39
down, you can say, I can see that distance.
3:41
You can still jam a lot of them inside of one kidney.
3:45
With that said, let's actually figure out how a nephron
3:49
filters the blood and actually makes sure that not too much
3:52
water or not too much of the good stuff in our blood ends
3:56
up the urine.
3:58
So let me draw here a nephron.
4:04
So I'm going to start like this.
4:07
We'll start with the blood flow.
4:08
So the blood's going to come in an arterial-- that's an
4:13
arterial capillary, you could say.
4:15
So it's going to come in like that.
4:17
This is actually called the afferent arterial.
4:21
You don't have to know the names, but you
4:23
might see that sometime.
4:26
Blood is coming in.
4:28
Then it goes into this big windy place.
4:32
It really winds around like that.
4:34
This is called the glomerulus.
4:43
And then it leaves via the efferent arterial.
4:57
Efferent just means away from the center.
4:58
Afferent towards, efferent away from the center.
5:02
And I'll talk about it more in the future, but it's
5:04
interesting that we're still dealing with an
5:05
artery at this point.
5:07
It's still oxygenated blood.
5:08
Normally, when we leave a capillary system like the
5:12
glomerulus right there, we're normally dealing with the
5:14
venous system, but here we're still an arterial system.
5:18
And it's probably because arterial systems have higher
5:21
blood pressure, and what we need to do is we need to
5:22
squeeze fluid and stuff that's dissolved in the fluid out of
5:28
the blood and in the glomerulus right here.
5:30
So this glomerulus is very porous and it's surrounded by
5:35
other cells.
5:37
This is kind of a cross-section.
5:44
It's surrounded like that by this structure, and these are
5:49
cells here so you can imagine these are all cells over here.
5:53
And, of course, the actual capillaries have cells that
5:56
line them so there are cells here.
5:58
So when I draw these lines, these lines are actually made
6:01
up of little cells.
6:03
What happens is the blood comes in
6:04
at really high pressure.
6:05
This is very porous.
6:06
These cells out here, they're called podocytes.
6:10
They're a little bit more selective in what gets
6:11
filtered out, and essentially about a fifth of the fluid
6:14
that's coming in ends up going into this space right here
6:20
that's called the Bowman's space.
6:22
Well, actually, this whole thing is called
6:23
the Bowman's capsule.
6:28
It's a sphere with an opening in here that the capillary can
6:30
kind of wind around in, and the space right here, this is
6:34
the Bowman's space.
6:36
It's the space inside the Bowman's capsule, and the
6:41
whole thing has cells.
6:42
All these structures are obviously made-- or maybe not
6:44
so obviously-- they're made up of cells.
6:46
And so we end up having filtrate in it.
6:48
Filtrate is just the stuff that gets squeezed out.
6:53
We can't call it urine just yet because there's a lot of
6:56
steps that have to occur for it to earn the name urine.
7:01
So it's only filtrate right now, and essentially what get
7:04
squeezed out, I said it's about a fifth of the fluid,
7:07
and things that are easily dissolved in fluid, so small
7:10
ions, sodium, maybe some small molecules like glucose, maybe
7:16
some amino acids.
7:19
There are tons of stuff in here, but this is
7:21
just to give an idea.
7:22
The things that do not get filtered are things like red
7:25
blood cells or larger molecules, larger proteins.
7:31
They will not get filtered.
7:32
It's mainly the micromolecules that'll get filtered, that'll
7:36
be part of this filtrate that shows up here
7:40
in the Bowman space.
7:42
Now, the rest of what the nephron does, the Bowman's
7:45
capsule is kind of the beginning of the nephron, and
7:46
just to get an idea of our big picture of our kidney, let's
7:51
say we're near an arterial.
7:54
This is a Bowman's capsule right here.
7:56
It looks something like that, and the whole nephron is going
7:59
to be convoluted like this.
8:00
It's going to dip down into the medulla, and then come
8:03
back, and then it's going to eventually dump into a
8:06
collecting duct, and I'll talk more about that.
8:07
So what I've drawn just here, this is a zoomed-in version of
8:12
that part right there.
8:14
Now what I want to do is zoom out a little bit because I'm
8:16
going to run out of space.
8:17
So let me zoom out.
8:19
So we had our arterial go in.
8:23
It gets all bunched in the glomerulus, and then most of
8:26
the blood leaves, but one-fifth of it gets
8:30
essentially filtered in to the Bowman's capsule.
8:33
That's the Bowman's capsule right there.
8:34
I've just zoomed out a little bit.
8:36
So we have our filtrate here.
8:39
Maybe I'll make it a little bit yellow.
8:44
The filtrate that just comes out at this point, sometimes
8:46
it's called the glomerular filtrate because it's been
8:49
filtered by the glomerulus, but it's also been filtered by
8:52
those podocyte cells on the inside of
8:55
the Bowman's capsule.
8:56
But now it's ready to go to the proximal tubule.
9:03
Let me draw something like this.
9:06
And obviously, this is not exactly what it looks like,
9:08
but it gives you the sense.
9:09
This right here, this is the proximal tubule.
9:17
And it sounds like a very fancy word, but proximal just
9:20
means near and tubule, you can imagine, is just a small tube.
9:23
So it's a small tube that's near the beginning.
9:25
That's why it's called a proximal tubule.
9:27
And it has two parts.
9:29
The whole thing is often called a
9:31
proximal convoluted tubule.
9:35
That's because it's all convoluted.
9:37
The way I've drawn it is all curvy.
9:38
And I just drew it curvy in two dimensions.
9:40
It's actually curvy in three dimensions.
9:43
But the reality is there's a curvy part and then there's a
9:45
straight part near the end of the proximal tubule.
9:48
So we'll call this whole thing the proximal tubule.
9:50
This is the convoluted part.
9:52
That's the straight part, but we don't
9:53
have to get too picky.
9:55
But the whole point of this part of the nephron-- and just
9:59
to remember where we are, we're now at this point of the
10:02
nephron right there-- the whole point is to start
10:05
reabsorbing some of the stuff that is in the filtrate that
10:09
we don't want to lose.
10:10
We don't want to lose glucose.
10:11
That's hard-earned stuff that we ate that
10:13
was good for energy.
10:15
We don't want to lose necessarily as much sodium.
10:18
We've seen in multiple videos that that's a useful ion to
10:24
have around.
10:24
We don't want to lose amino acids.
10:26
Those are useful for building up proteins and other things.
10:30
So these are things we don't want to lose so we start
10:32
absorbing them back.
10:33
I'll do a whole video on exactly how that happens, but
10:35
it's done actively.
10:37
Since we're using ATP, and just as a bit of a summary,
10:40
you're using ATP to actually pump out the sodium and then
10:43
that actually helps bring in the other things.
10:45
That's just kind of a tidbit on what's happening.
10:48
So we're reabsorbing, so just imagine what's happening.
10:52
You have cells lining the proximal tubule right now.
10:56
And actually, they have little things that jut out.
10:58
I'll do a whole video on that because it's actually
10:59
interesting.
11:00
So you have cells out here.
11:01
On the other side of the cells, you have an arterial
11:04
system, or a capillary system, I should say, actually.
11:08
So let's say you have a capillary system here that is
11:12
very close to the cells lining the proximal tubule, and so
11:16
this stuff actually gets actively pumped, especially
11:19
the sodium, but all of it, using energy, gets pumped back
11:23
into the blood selectively, and maybe a
11:24
little bit of our water.
11:25
So we're pumping back some sodium, some glucose, and
11:32
we'll start pumping a little bit of the water back in
11:34
because we don't want to lose all of that water.
11:36
If all of the water that was originally in the filtrate we
11:38
were just leaving in our urine, we'd be excreting
11:41
gallons and gallons of water every day, which we do not
11:44
want to do.
11:45
So that's the whole point.
11:46
We're starting the absorption process.
11:49
And then we'll enter the loop of Henle, and actually, this
11:51
is, in my mind, the most
11:52
interesting part of the nephron.
11:55
So we're entering the loop of Henle, and it dips down, and
11:59
then comes back up.
12:03
And so most of the length of the nephron
12:05
is the loop of Henle.
12:07
And if I go back to this diagram right here, if I'm
12:10
talking about the loop of Henle, I'm talking about this
12:13
whole thing right there.
12:15
And you can see something interesting here.
12:17
It crosses the border between the cortex, this light brown
12:21
part, and the renal medulla, this kind of reddish or orange
12:24
part right there, and it does that for a very good reason.
12:27
I'm going to draw it here.
12:28
So let's say this is the dividing line right here.
12:32
This right here was the cortex.
12:35
This right here is the medulla.
12:39
So the whole point-- well, there's two points
12:42
of the loop of Henle.
12:48
One point is to make the renal medulla salty, and it does
12:57
this by actively pumping out salts.
13:00
So it actively pumps out salts, and it does that in the
13:03
ascending part of the loop of Henle.
13:06
So it actively pumps out salts: sodium, potassium,
13:12
chloride, or chlorine, I should say.
13:14
Chlorine ions.
13:17
It actively pumps out these salts right here to make the
13:21
entire medulla salty, or if we think about it in terms of
13:27
kind of osmosis, make it hypertonic.
13:29
You have more solute out here than you have in the filtrate
13:33
that's going through the tubules.
13:36
And it uses ATP to do this.
13:37
All of this stuff requires ATP to actively pump against a
13:39
concentration gradient.
13:41
So this is salty and it's salty for a reason.
13:46
It's not just to take back these salts from the filtrate,
13:50
although that's part of the reason, but by making this
13:53
salty, the ascending part is only permeable to these salts
13:57
and these ions.
13:59
It's not permeable to water.
14:06
The descending part of the loop of Henle is only
14:09
permeable to water.
14:13
So what's going to happen?
14:14
If this is all salty because the ascending part is actively
14:17
pumping out salt, what's going to happen to water as it goes
14:21
down the descending loop?
14:23
Well, it's hypertonic out here.
14:24
Water will naturally want to go and kind of try to make the
14:28
concentrations balance out.
14:30
I've done a whole video on that.
14:31
It doesn't happen by magic.
14:33
And so the water will-- because this is hypertonic,
14:36
it's more salty, and this is only permeable to water, the
14:39
water will leave the membrane on the descending part of the
14:42
loop of Henle right now.
14:44
And this is a major part of water reabsorption.
14:48
I've thought a lot about why don't we use ATP somehow to
14:52
actively pump water?
14:54
And the answer there is, there's no
14:55
easy way to do that.
14:56
Biological systems are good at using ATP to pump out ions,
15:01
but it can't actively pump out water.
15:03
Water's kind of a hard thing for proteins to operate on.
15:06
So the solution is to make it salty out here by pumping out
15:09
ions and then water, if you make this porous only to
15:12
water, water will naturally flow out.
15:14
So this is a major mechanism of gaining back a lot of the
15:18
water that gets filtered out up here.
15:20
And the reason why this is so long is to give time for this
15:23
water to secrete out, and that's why it dips nice and
15:27
pretty far down into this salty portion.
15:31
So then we'll leave the loop of Henle and then we're almost
15:34
done with the nephron.
15:36
Then we're in another convoluted tubule, and you
15:38
might even guess the name of this convoluted tubule.
15:41
If this was the proximal one, this is the distal one.
15:44
And actually, just to make my drawing correct, it actually
15:47
passes very close to the Bowman's capsule, so let me do
15:51
it in a different color.
15:57
The distal convoluted tubule actually goes pretty close to
16:01
the Bowman's capsule.
16:03
And once again, I've made it all convoluted in two
16:06
dimensions, but it's actually convoluted in three.
16:07
And it's not that long, but I just had to get over here and
16:09
I wanted to get over that point right there.
16:11
It's called distal.
16:12
Distal is further away.
16:14
It's convoluted and it's a tubule.
16:16
So this right here is the distal convoluted tubule, and
16:24
here we have more reabsorption: calcium, more
16:27
sodium reabsorption.
16:28
We're just reabsorbing more things that we didn't want to
16:31
lose in the first place.
16:32
There's a lot of things we could talk about what get
16:34
reabsorbed, but this is just the overview.
16:36
And we're also reabsorbing a little bit of more water.
16:39
But then at the end right here, our
16:41
filtrate has been processed.
16:42
A lot of the water's been taken out.
16:44
It's a lot more concentrated.
16:45
We've reabsorbed a lot of the salts,
16:47
electrolytes that we want.
16:49
We've reabsorbed the glucose and a lot of the amino acids.
16:52
Everything that we want, we've taken back.
16:53
We've reabsorbed.
16:55
And so this is mainly waste products and water that we
16:59
don't need anymore and then this gets dumped into
17:01
collecting ducts.
17:05
And you can kind of view this as the trash chute of the
17:07
kidney, where multiple nephrons are going
17:12
to dump into this.
17:13
So that might be the distal tubule of another nephron
17:16
right here and this is a collecting duct, which is just
17:22
a tube that's collecting all the
17:23
byproducts of the nephrons.
17:27
And the interesting thing is that the collecting duct
17:28
further goes into the medulla again.
17:31
It goes into the medulla again to the salty part again.
17:34
So if we're talking about the collecting duct, maybe the
17:36
collecting duct's coming back into the medulla, collecting
17:40
all of the filtrate from the different nephrons.
17:43
And because it goes back through that super salty spot
17:46
in the medulla, we actually have four hormones called
17:50
anti-diarrhetic hormone that can dictate how porous this
17:54
collecting tube is, and if it makes it very porous, it
18:00
allows more water to leave as we go to the medulla, because
18:04
this is very salty, so the water will
18:06
leave if this is porous.
18:07
And when we do that, what that does is it makes the
18:10
filtrate-- and we can maybe start calling it urine now--
18:13
even more concentrated so we lose even less water, and it
18:17
keeps collecting, collecting, collecting until we end up
18:19
here, and it leaves the kidney and goes via our ureters to
18:23
the urinary bladder.
18:25
So hopefully, you found that helpful.
18:27
I think the neatest thing here is just how we actively
18:29
reabsorb the water and how we-- well, actually, in my
18:33
mind, that is the neatest part in the loop of Henle.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,cc8sUv2SuaY,

- [Instructor] I'm going to construct a sequence.
0:02
We're going to start with some number.
0:04
Let's say I start with the number, a.
0:05
And then each successive term of the sequence,
0:08
I'm going to multiply the,
0:09
to get each successive term of the sequence,
0:11
I'm going to muliply the previous term
0:13
by some fixed non-zero number,
0:16
and I'm going to call that r.
0:17
So the next term is going to be a,
0:19
is going to be a times r.
0:22
And then the term after that,
0:24
I'm going to multipy this thing times r.
0:27
So it's going to be a,
0:28
if you multiply ar times r,
0:30
that's going to be ar-squared.
0:34
And then if you were going to multiply this term times r,
0:38
you would get a times r to the third power.
0:43
And you could keep going on and on and on and on.
0:46
And this type of sequence or this type of progression
0:49
is called a geometric.
0:51
Geometric Sequence or Progression.
0:55
Geometric Sequence.
0:58
You start with some first value.
1:00
Let me circle that in a different color,
1:02
since I already used the green.
1:03
So you start with some first value,
1:05
and then to get each successive term,
1:08
you multiply by this fixed number.
1:10
In this case, this fixed number is r.
1:13
And so we call r, our common ratio.
1:16
Our common ratio.
1:19
Why is it called a common ratio?
1:21
Well take any two successive terms.
1:23
Take this term and this term,
1:25
and divide this term by this term right over here,
1:28
ar to the third, divided by ar-squared.
1:31
So if you find the ratio between these two things.
1:34
Let me rewrite this in the same colors.
1:36
So if you took ar to the third power,
1:40
and were to divide it by the term before it.
1:43
So if you were to divide it by ar-squared,
1:47
what are you going to be left with?
1:49
Well a divided by a is one,
1:51
r to the third divided by r-squared is just going to be r.
1:55
And this is true if you divide any term
1:57
by the term before it.
1:59
Or if you find the ratio between any term
2:02
and the term before it,
2:02
it's going to be r.
2:04
And so that's why it's called a common ratio.
2:07
And so let's look at some examples of geometric sequences.
2:11
So if I start with the number,
2:13
if I start with the number five, so my a is five
2:17
and then each time I'm going to multiply,
2:20
I'm going to multiply by, I don't know.
2:23
Let's say I multiply by 1/7.
2:25
So then the next term is going to be five over seven.
2:32
What's the next term going to be?
2:34
Well, I'm going to multiply this thing times 1/7.
2:37
So that's going to be 5/7 times 1/7 is 5/49.
2:41
So it's going to be five over seven-squared or 49.
2:47
If I were to multiply this times 1/7,
2:49
what am I going to get?
2:51
I'll just change the notation.
2:52
I'll get five times,
2:55
I don't actually know in my head
2:56
what seven to the third power is,
2:57
I guess I could calculate it, 280 plus 63,
3:03
let's see, so that would be
3:04
let's see seven times 40 is 280,
3:06
seven times nine is 63,
3:09
so you're going to get to 343, I believe.
3:13
Let me see, did I do that right?
3:15
Seven times 280,
3:17
plus 63 is 343,
3:20
and you can just keep going.
3:22
So this right over here is an example
3:24
of a geometric,
3:26
of a geometric sequence.
3:28
Started with some first value
3:30
and each successive value, I multiplied by 1/7.
3:33
1/7 is the common ratio here.
3:36
Let me give you another one.
3:38
Let's say I have this,
3:40
let's say I have three and then let's say I have six,
3:45
and let's say I have 12.
3:48
Then I have 24,
3:51
then I have 48.
3:53
Is this a geometric series?
3:55
And if it is, what is the common ratio here?
3:59
Well you could figure out the common ratio
4:01
by just taking any two successive terms and dividing.
4:04
Well first, you could try it with two terms.
4:07
A 12 divided by six is two.
4:10
So we have to multiply by two.
4:12
To go from 12 to 24, you multipled by two.
4:15
To go from 24 to 48, you have to multiply by two.
4:19
To go from three to six, we have to multiply by two.
4:21
So you get a fixed common ratio.
4:22
For any of these terms, if we multiplied by two
4:25
and say multiplied by three,
4:27
and so we didn't multiply by the same thing,
4:29
then it wouldn't be a geometric sequence anymore.
4:34
So this clearly is a geometric sequence,

0:00
But what I think about now is the if we're given some triangle,
0:05
and here we have triangle ABC
0:06
What are the medians of the triangle
0:08
and how do they relate to each other
0:10
and do they have some interesting properties,
0:12
and you might guess that they do
0:13
So the median is, if we start at one of the vertices
0:16
so let's start at this one right over here
0:18
And then we bisect the opposite sides
0:21
So this right here would be a median
0:23
And so it started there, and it bisects this side right over here
0:26
So the length from B to let's call this D
0:29
is equal to the length from D to C
0:32
Now, let's do that with every side
0:33
I can draw a median over here, like that
0:36
So, let's call this point E
0:39
So the length from A to E
0:40
is going to be equal to the length from E to C
0:44
Although it's kind of a little lopsided,
0:45
but that gets it pretty close
0:47
And then we're gonna draw another median
0:48
And I'm not gonna prove it in this video,
0:50
but all the medians, and this is another neat thing, that, you know,
0:53
when you have three lines that will always intersect at one point,
0:56
that all the medians do intersect at one point
0:59
They all are concurrent
1:00
They all hit one common point in the center
1:03
So, let's draw it that way
1:05
I'm not gonna prove it in this video, so this length,
1:07
let's call this point right over here F
1:09
So this length right over here,
1:11
this length right over there is equal to that length over there
1:15
And the point at which these medians intersect
1:18
is called the centroid, the centroid
1:22
And when you start studying physics,
1:23
if you're actually and this was a uniform triangle
1:25
and you were to throw it,
1:26
it would rotate around the centroid right over here
1:30
But we'll study it geometrically for now
1:32
So let's call this ten centroid well, we've already gone up to F
1:35
So let's call this centroid G right over there
1:38
Now, what I wanna that by itself is neat that you have a centroid,
1:42
that if you were to throw it, if it was a uniform mass,
1:44
it would rotate around the centroid
1:45
But what's even neater about this,
1:47
is that we can see that we've divided this triangle
1:49
into six smaller triangles
1:51
What's really cool,
1:53
even though these aren't congruent triangles necessarily,
1:56
but they do have the same area
1:58
And that's what we're going to prove in this video
2:01
That these six triangles all have the same area
2:04
Now, to start off, I'm just going to look at two
2:07
I'm gonna look at different pairs of triangles
2:09
So let's look at let's look at these two triangles right over here
2:12
Let's look at those two triangles over here
2:14
And to show that those two have the same area,
2:16
we're just going to invoke a very simple principle
2:20
So, imagine rotating, just those two triangles over
2:23
So just rotating, just those two triangles over
2:26
It would look something like this
2:28
It would look something like this
2:30
Let me try my best to draw it
2:32
Where this would be point G I'll even try to color code it the same
2:35
that is point G
2:37
That is that side right over there
2:39
This is point C
2:41
This is point B, that is point B
2:44
And then this right over here
2:46
would be the second part of that median right over there
2:49
That over there would be point D
2:51
Now, we know and I didn't draw it I should, at nicely over here
2:54
We know that this length is equal to this length right over here
2:58
And these two triangles, if we're starting to think about the area,
3:00
they have the same base
3:02
And we know area
3:04
Area is equal to ? base * height
3:07
So, they definitely have the same base
3:09
What about their heights?
3:11
Well, they also have the same heights
3:12
Both of their heights, both of their height is exactly that tall
3:17
They both have the same height
3:19
So both of them have the same base
3:20
They both have the same height
3:22
On an ob on an obtuse triangle right here, the altitude sits outside of it
3:26
So that might be a little kind *unclear 00:03:26 7*
3:28
So if you have an obtuse triangle like that
3:29
I say obtuse cause this is more than 90 degrees
3:32
Your altitude, your height *unclear 00:03:33 4*
3:34
sit outside of the triangle, but that's okay
3:36
Both of these triangles have the same base, and the same height,
3:39
so they must have the same area
3:41
So if this one right here has area x,
3:44
this one right here will have area x as well
3:47
And you can use the exact same logic to say, well, look
3:50
This guy and this guy, they have the same base,
3:53
and they both have the same height
3:56
So if this one right over here is of area y,
3:59
then this one over here is also going to be of area y
4:02
They will have the same area
4:04
And then finally,
4:05
we could do the same thing for these two characters up here
4:07
They both have the same base
4:09
This was BF is equal to FA, and they both have the same height
4:13
We drop an altitude like that
4:15
And so if we call this area, if we call this area right over here Z,
4:19
you could call that area Z, as well
4:21
So, so far, we've shown that we can divide this
4:24
into three pairs of triangles that have the same area
4:27
But we wanna now show that they all have the same area
4:29
And to do that, we can invoke this same principle,
4:32
but we'll do it with different sets of triangles
4:35
So now, let's look at triangle let's look at triangle BAE
4:40
Look at triangle BAE, triangle BAE
4:45
So the area of triangle BAE,
4:47
area of BAE, is going to be equal to z + z + y
4:54
z + z + y
4:56
And let's look at the area of triangle BEC, BEC right over there
5:03
That's going to be,
5:04
this triangle right over here, is going to be x + x + y
5:08
So the area of BEC is going to be x + x + y, but the same principle
5:16
They both have the same base, and they both have the same height
5:20
We could drop an altitude like this
5:21
This one is obtuse, so that the altitude sits outside of it,
5:24
but they have the exact same height
5:26
So these two areas need to be equal to each other
5:29
So you have Z, well, let me just add that up
5:32
Now you have 2z + y is going to be equal to,
5:37
is going to be equal to 2x + y
5:42
2x + y
5:43
Subtract y from both sides
5:45
You get 2z is equal to 2x
5:47
Divide both sides by 2
5:49
You get z is equal to x
5:52
And so we could say, we could write an x here, and an x there
5:56
So we know that all of these will have the same area,
5:58
but we still have to worry about these y's here
6:00
And to do that,
6:01
we just have to kind of rotate the way that we look at it
6:04
And now look at triangle ADC
6:08
Let me do that in a different color
6:10
Triangle ADC, which I'm highlighting right over here
6:14
Triangle ADC, whose area, so the area of ADC is going to be 2y + x,
6:22
is equal to 2y + x
6:25
And then look at triangle let's see, what color have I not used yet
6:29
Let me use this green
6:31
Triangle ADB, triangle ADB
6:37
Triangle ADB is going to be equal to,
6:41
well, you could say it's 2z + x,
6:44
but we know that the z's are equal to x
6:45
It's really just x + x + x
6:47
It's really equal to ADB is equal to 3x
6:50
And we have the same idea here
6:52
ADB has this base, which is the same as ADC's base,
6:57
and they both have the same height
6:59
We can draw up an altitude like this,
7:01
we can draw up an altitude like that
7:02
They have the same height
7:03
We're just invoking this principle over and over and over again
7:06
So these things have to equal each other
7:08
So we get 2y + x is equal to 3x, is equal to 3x
7:15
Subtract x from both sides
7:17
You get 2y is equal to 2x, or, or y is equal to x
7:25
So that's a really neat result
7:26
You go from each of the vertices of a triangle to the opposite side,
7:30
and you bisect that opposite side, and you do that three times,
7:33
you have three medians
7:34
These lines are called medians, where they intersect as a centroid
7:38
You know what's really cool is,
7:39
it divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Xt4sT0fV9Pw,
khan_video_D_smr0GBPvA_107320,"At 0:45, how does Sal know which angle of the triangle is angle cos(2 x angleABC)?",MCQ,"•
0:00
We have triangle ABC here, which looks like a right triangle.
0:03
And we know it's a right triangle
0:05
because 3 squared plus 4 squared is equal to 5 squared.
0:08
And they want us to figure out what cosine of 2 times angle
0:12
ABC is.
0:12
So that's this angle-- ABC.
0:16
Well, we can't immediately evaluate that,
0:18
but we do know what the cosine of angle ABC is.
0:22
We know that the cosine of angle ABC-- well, cosine
0:27
is just adjacent over hypotenuse.
0:29
It's going to be equal to 3/5.
0:32
And similarly, we know what the sine of angle ABC is.
0:39
That's opposite over hypotenuse.
0:41
That is 4/5.
0:43
So if we could break this down into just cosines of ABC
0:46
and sines of ABC, then we'll be able to evaluate it.
0:49
And lucky for us, we have a trig identity at our disposal
0:52
that does exactly that.
0:55
We know that the cosine of 2 times an angle
1:00
is equal to cosine of that angle squared
1:03
minus sine of that angle squared.
1:05
And we've proved this in other videos,
1:07
but this becomes very helpful for us here.
1:10
Because now we know that the cosine--
1:13
Let me do this in a different color.
1:15
Now, we know that the cosine of angle ABC
1:21
is going to be equal to-- oh, sorry.
1:23
It's the cosine of 2 times the angle ABC.
1:25
That's what we care about.
1:27
2 times the angle ABC is going to be
1:30
equal to the cosine of angle ABC squared minus sine of the angle
1:40
ABC squared.
1:45
And we know what these things are.
1:47
This thing right over here is just
1:52
going to be equal to 3/5 squared.
1:55
Cosine of angle a ABC is 3/5.
1:57
So we're going to square it.
1:58
And this right over here is just 4/5 squared.
2:01
So it's minus 4/5 squared.
2:05
And so this simplifies to 9/25 minus 16/25,
2:14
which is equal to 7/25.
2:21
Sorry.
2:22
It's negative.
2:23
Got to be careful there.
2:24
16 is larger than 9.
2:27
Negative 7/25.
2:29
Now, one thing that might jump at you
2:30
is, why did I get a negative value here
2:33
when I doubled the angle here?
2:36
Because the cosine was clearly a positive number.
2:38
And there you just have to think of the unit circle-- which
2:41
we already know the unit circle definition of trig functions
2:45
is an extension of the Sohcahtoa definition.
2:49
X-axis.
2:49
Y-axis.
2:50
Let me draw a unit circle here.
2:52
My best attempt.
2:54
So that's our unit circle.
2:57
So this angle right over here looks like something like this.
3:04
And so you see its x-coordinate-- which
3:06
is the cosine of that angle-- looks positive.
3:08
But then, if you were to double this angle,
3:11
it would take you out someplace like this.
3:15
And then, you see-- by the unit circle definition--
3:18
the x-coordinate, we are now sitting in the second quadrant.
3:21
And the x-coordinate can be negative.

0:00
We're asked, what is the prime factorization of 36?
0:04
Let me get my little scratch paper out.
0:07
So the prime factorization of 36.
0:11
So let's start with the smallest prime number we know,
0:14
and that is 2.
0:15
And think about, does 2 go into 36?
0:17
Well, sure, it does.
0:18
36 is 2 times 18.
0:21
So we can write that down.
0:22
36 is 2 times 18.
0:27
So now we have 36 as a product of a prime number,
0:30
and 18 is clearly a composite number.
0:32
It has factors other than 1 and 18.
0:35
So let's try to factor this further.
0:37
So is this divisible by 2?
0:39
Sure.
0:40
18 is 2 times 9.
0:46
So now 9 is a composite number that we haven't fully factored.
0:49
Obviously, the 2's are both prime.
0:51
9 is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 3.
0:55
9 is 3 times 3.
0:59
So we can say that 36 is equal to 2 times 2 times 3 times 3.
1:08
This is its prime factorization.
1:10
All of these numbers are prime.
1:12
So now let's input that to make sure we got it right.
1:17
2 times 2 times 3 times 3.
1:22
And you can check yourself.
1:23
If you have the product of numbers that are all prime
1:26
and the product actually is 36, you have successfully
1:29
prime factorized the number.
1:32
Let's do a couple more of these.
1:35
What is the prime factorization of 30?
1:37
So I'll get my scratch paper out again.
1:39
So we'll do the same process.
1:41
So 30-- well, it's divisible by 2.
1:44
So we can write that as 2 times 15.
1:48
15 isn't divisible by 2.
1:50
But it is divisible by 3.
1:52
It's the same thing as 3 times 5.
1:56
And both 3 and 5 are prime numbers.
1:58
They are only divisible by 1 and themselves.
2:01
So the prime factorization of 30 is 2 times 3 times 5.
2:07
Let's enter that in.
2:09
So it is 2 times 3 times 5.
2:15
Let's do one more of these.
2:19
What is the prime factorization of 73?
2:22
Now, 73 is interesting.
2:26
I'll get my scratch paper out for this.
2:28
We could try to factor 73.
2:31
So you might try 2.
2:32
Well, this is clearly an odd number.
2:33
So 2 isn't going to be divisible into 73.
2:35
You might try 3.
2:37
You would immediately see, well, 3 is divisible into 72.
2:39
If you divide into 73, you have a remainder of 1.
2:42
Well, 4 isn't a prime number, so we wouldn't even try.
2:45
5 isn't divisible into 73.
2:46
It doesn't end in a 5 or 0.
2:49
7 is not divisible into 73.
2:52
7 goes into 70, so you'd have a remainder of 3.
2:55
11 isn't divisible into 73.
2:57
It's divisible into 66 or 77, so not 73.
3:02
As I test more and more numbers, it
3:04
doesn't look like there's any easy thing that
3:07
divides into 73.
3:10
So I'm willing to go with 73 itself is a prime number.
3:15
So this is its prime factorization.
3:18
It's just 73.
3:19
So let's write that down.
3:21
So the answer here, let's just write 73.
3:24
And you don't want to write 1 times 73,
3:25
because 1 is not a prime number.
3:28
Remember, 1 only has one factor, itself.
3:34
A prime number has two factors, 1 and itself.
3:37
Two different prime factors-- 1 and itself.
3:39
And itself is not one.
3:41
So we just want to write prime numbers here.
3:43
73 is a prime number.
3:44
Let's check our answer.

0:00
Voiceover: So let's talk a little bit about
0:02
how we all came into being.
0:04
What we see right over here, this is a picture
0:08
of a sperm cell fusing with an egg cell.
0:14
So that's a sperm cell and this is an egg cell
0:17
or we could call this an ovum.
0:21
And even this scene depicted right over here,
0:23
this is the end of an epic competition because
0:28
this sperm cell is one of one of two to three
0:30
hundred million that is vying for this ovum.
0:36
So there's two to three hundred million of these characters
0:38
and they're all vying for this ovum and the one
0:43
that you see that's about to fuse for it,
0:45
this is the winner of this incredibly -
0:47
remember two to three hundred,
0:49
200 million to 300 million sperm are trying to get here
0:54
so this is a major victory and to some degree
0:57
we should all feel pretty good about ourselves
1:00
because we are all the by-product of that
1:03
one in 200 to 300 million sperm cells
1:07
that won this race getting to our mother's ovum.
1:11
So the sperm cell came from our father and the egg cell,
1:15
this is all happening inside of our mothers,
1:18
the egg cell is from our mother.
1:21
Now, once this happens,
1:22
let's talk a little bit about the terminology.
1:24
So once these two fuse, or the process of them fusing,
1:29
we call that fertilization.
1:33
Fertilization.
1:39
And it produces a cell that then differentiates
1:42
into all of the cells of our body,
1:45
so you can imagine that this is an important process.
1:47
So let's make sure that we understand the different
1:49
terminology, the different words for the different things
1:53
that are acting in this process.
1:56
So each of these sex cells, I guess we could say,
2:01
the sperm cell and the ovum, these are each called gametes.
2:05
So this right over here is a gamete
2:11
and the ovum is a gamete,
2:13
the egg cell is also a gamete.
2:17
And as we'll see, each gamete has half the number
2:21
of chromosomes as your body cells or most of
2:26
the somatic cells of your body so outside of your sex cells
2:30
that might be in your ovaries or your testes,
2:35
depending on whether you're male or female,
2:38
these have half the number
2:40
so let's dig a little bit deeper into what I mean there.
2:43
So let's just do a blow up
2:46
of this sperm cell right over here,
2:51
so a blow up of a sperm cell and I'm not
2:54
going to draw it to scale, you see the sperm cell
2:56
is much smaller than the egg cell but just
2:58
to get a sense, so let me draw the nucleus
3:01
of this sperm cell, so just like that.
3:05
If we're talking about a human being, and I'm assuming
3:08
you are a human being, so that might be
3:10
of interest to you, this will have 23
3:13
chromosomes from your father so let's do them.
3:16
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
3:18
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
3:22
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22
3:25
and for the 23rd one, that's going to be
3:29
your sex-determining chromosome
3:31
so if your father contributes an x,
3:34
you are going to be female,
3:36
if your father contributes a y,
3:39
you are going to be male.
3:42
So these are the chromosomes in
3:44
the male gamete or I guess I should say the gamete
3:47
that your father's contributing, the sperm.
3:50
So this is a gamete right over here and that's going to
3:53
fuse with the egg, the ovum that your mother is contributing
3:57
and once again, I'm not drawing that to scale.
4:00
So this is the egg, and let me draw it's nucleus.
4:06
So that's it's nucleus, once again
4:07
none of this is drawn to scale.
4:09
And your mother is also going to contribute 23 chromosomes.
4:12
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
4:15
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
4:17
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22
4:21
and then she will contribute an x chromosome
4:25
for the sex determining so your sex determining
4:28
chromosomes are going to be xy, you're going to be male,
4:30
if this was xx, you're going to be female
4:33
so this is also a gamete here.
4:36
So a gamete is the general term for either a sperm or an egg.
4:41
Now once these two things are fused, what do we have?
4:49
Once they're fused, then we're going to have
4:53
you could say a fertilized egg
4:55
but we are going to call that a zygote
4:57
so let me draw that.
4:58
I'm going to do this in a new color,
5:00
and I'm running out of space and I want this all to fit
5:02
on the same screen so I'll draw it not quite at scale
5:09
and so let me draw the nucleus of the zygote,
5:11
I'm going to make the nucleus fairly large so that we can
5:13
focus on the chromosomes in it,
5:15
once again none of this is drawn to scale.
5:17
So you're going to have the 23 chromosomes
5:19
from your father, so let me do that.
5:22
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
5:28
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
5:31
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23,
5:38
and then the 23 chromosomes from your mother.
5:40
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
5:48
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
5:53
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23
6:02
so you got that x chromosome from your mother.
6:05
And as you might have notice, I've drawn them in pairs
6:08
so you now have a total, let me make it clear,
6:10
you have 23 chromosomes here,
6:13
23 chromosomes in the sperm,
6:18
you have 23 chromosomes in the egg
6:25
and now you have 46 chromosomes in the fertilized egg,
6:30
46 chromosomes, and now that we have
6:33
a full contingent of chromosomes
6:36
and then this cell can now keep replicating,
6:39
keep splitting and differentiating into all of what
6:41
makes you, you, we call this right over here,
6:44
we call this a zygote.
6:49
So one way to think about it, the gametes are the sex cells
6:53
that have half the number of chromosomes
6:55
and the zygote is the cell that's now ready to differentiate
6:58
into an actual organism that has double the number
7:01
or that has a full contingency of chromosomes,
7:04
that has 46 chromosomes, and you see that
7:07
I've made them in pairs and these pairs,
7:09
we call these homologous pairs
7:11
and in each of these pairs,
7:12
this is a pair of homologous chromosomes.
7:25
So what does that mean?
7:26
Well that means that in general, these two chromosomes,
7:29
you got one from your father, one from your mother,
7:32
they code for the same things, they code for the same
7:36
proteins but there are different variants of how they code
7:39
for those proteins, those traits that you have
7:43
so gross oversimplification is,
7:46
let's say that there is a gene on,
7:52
that one from your father that helps code for hair color
7:56
well there would be a similar,
7:57
there would be another variant of that gene
8:00
on the chromosome from your mother
8:02
that helps code for hair color as well.
8:05
So these are homologous chromosomes,
8:06
these two chromosomes code, in general,
8:10
for the same things and so the zygote now has,
8:13
you could say it has 46 chromosomes or you could say
8:16
it has 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes.
8:20
And this is, once again, this is the case for human beings.
8:23
If we're talking about some other species, instead of
8:25
23 pairs of homologous chromosomes or 46 chromosomes
8:29
in total, you might be talking about 10 pairs of
8:31
homologous chromosomes with 20 chromosomes in general.
8:36
Now to help biologists, to help clarify when they're
8:41
talking about the number of chromosomes for
8:43
a given species, they introduce two words,
8:46
haploid and diploid.
8:49
And haploid is referring to when you have half
8:52
the full contingency of chromosomes.
8:56
So for human beings, the haploid number is 23.
9:01
So, this is the haploid number, it is 23.
9:11
For another species it would be something else
9:14
and haploid is based on the prefix ""hapl"",
9:18
that's the prefix for single, so you have a single member
9:24
I guess you could think of it,
9:25
of each of the pairs and now you have both
9:29
of each pair, you have both chromosomes in each
9:32
pair or you have the full contingency and this 46 chromosomes,
9:37
this is called the diploid number for humans.
9:45
The diploid number right over here.
9:47
And when people talk in general, and we will speak in general
9:49
when we start talking about mitosis and meiosis
9:52
for a given species they will refer to the haploid number,
9:55
they will refer to the haploid number as n chromosomes
9:59
and they will refer to the diploid number as just twice that,
10:01
as two n chromosomes.
10:04
So hopefully this gets you familiar with some of the vocabulary
10:08
around fertilization and haploid and diploid
10:11
and zygotes and gametes and also makes you feel
10:14
a little bit better about yourself that, just to exist,
10:17
at least half of your chromosomes had to win
10:20
an incredibly competitive race.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,dNp7vErqlaA,
khan_video_ZiMYRBtDB2M_24952,Can you tell me what programme you use to plot vector fields?,Essay,"•
0:00
- [Voiceover] So in the last video,
0:00
I talked about 3-dimensional vector fields.
0:03
And I finished things off
0:04
with a sort of identity function example
0:06
where at an input point x, y, z
0:09
the output vector is also x, y, z.
0:12
And here, I want to go through
0:13
a slightly more intricate example.
0:16
So I'll go ahead and get rid of this vector field
0:19
and in this example,
0:21
the x component of the output will be y times z.
0:26
The y component of the output will be x times z.
0:30
And the z component of the output will be x times y.
0:34
So I'll just show this vector field
0:36
and then we can start to get a feel for
0:38
how the function that I just wrote
0:40
relates to the vectors that you're seeing.
0:42
So you see some of the vectors
0:43
are kind of pointing away from the origin.
0:45
Some are pointing in towards the origin.
0:50
So how can we understand this vector field
0:52
in terms of the function itself?
0:54
And a good step is to just zero in
0:55
on one of the components.
0:57
So in this case, I'll choose the z component
0:59
of the output
1:00
which is made up of x times y
1:03
and kind of start to understand
1:03
what that should be.
1:04
The z component will represent
1:06
how much the vector's pointing up or down.
1:08
This is the z axis
1:10
and the x-y plane here
1:11
so I'll point the z axis straight at our face.
1:13
This is the x axis, this is the y axis.
1:16
The values of x and y are going to completely determine
1:18
that z component.
1:20
So I'm going to go off to the side here
1:21
and just draw myself a little x-y plane for reference.
1:25
So this is my x value,
1:28
this is my y value.
1:30
And I want to understand the meaning
1:31
of the term ""x times y.""
1:35
So when both x and y are positive,
1:37
the product is positive.
1:39
And when both of them are negative,
1:40
the product is also positive.
1:43
If x is negative and y is positive,
1:45
the product is negative,
1:46
but if x is positive and y is negative,
1:48
the product is also negative.
1:50
So what this should mean,
1:51
in terms of our vector field,
1:52
is that when we're in this first quadrant,
1:54
vectors tend to point up in the z direction,
1:56
same over here in the third quadrant.
1:59
But over in the other two
1:59
they should tend to point down.
2:01
So let's focus in on that first quadrant
2:02
and try to look at what's going on.
2:04
So, you see like this vector here applies, this vector.
2:07
And all of them generally point upwards,
2:09
they have a positive z component.
2:11
So that seems in line with what we were predicting.
2:13
Whereas over here,
2:13
which corresponds to the fourth quadrant
2:15
of the x-y plane,
2:16
the z component of each vector tends to be down.
2:19
And they're doing other things
2:22
in terms of the x and y components,
2:23
it's not just z component action,
2:24
but right now we're just focusing on up and down.
2:26
And if you look over in the third quadrant,
2:29
they tend to be pointing up,
2:31
and that corresponds to the fact
2:32
that x times y will be positive.
2:34
And when you look at it,
2:35
it all starts to align that way.
2:36
And because I chose a rather symmetric function
2:38
you could imagine doing this where you,
2:40
you analyze also the y component here,
2:43
you analyze the x component in terms of y and z,
2:46
and it's actually going to look very similar
2:47
for understanding when the x component of a vector
2:50
tends to be positive,
2:51
like up here,
2:51
or when it turns out to be negative,
2:53
like over here,
2:54
and same with when the y component of the vector
2:55
tends to be negative,
2:56
or if the y component tends to be positive.
2:58
And overall, it's a very complicated image to look at,
3:02
but you can slowly piece by piece get a feel for it.
3:05
And just like with 2-dimensional vector fields,
3:07
the kind of neat thing to do
3:08
is imagine that this represents a fluid flow.
3:11
So you imagine like maybe air around you,
3:12
flowing in towards the origin here,
3:14
flowing out away from the origin there,
3:17
it would kind of be rotating around here,
3:19
and later on in multi-variable calculus,
3:21
you'll learn about various ways you can study
3:23
just the function itself and just the variables
3:25
and get a feel for how that fluid itself would behave,
3:28
even though it's a very complicated thing to think about,
3:30
it's even complicated to draw
3:31
or use graphic software with,
3:33
but just with analytic tools,
3:35
you can get very powerful results.
3:38
And these kind of things come up in physics all the time
3:40
because you're thinking in 3-dimensional space
3:42
and it doesn't just have to be fluid flow,
3:44
it could be a force field like an electric force field
3:47
or gravitational force field,
3:48
where each vector tells you
3:49
how a particle tends to get pushed.
3:52
And as we continue on with multi-variable calculus,
3:54
you'll get to see lots more examples.
3:56
But hopefully this helps give a small feel
3:57
for how you can go piece by piece
3:59
and understand something
4:00
that's kind of a complicated expression.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,ZiMYRBtDB2M,
khan_video_FmQoSenbtnU_55781,Do the electrons in the 2s orbital ever have any probability of being in the 1st orbital?,Essay,"•
0:00
In the last few videos we learned that
0:02
the configuration of electrons in an atom
0:05
aren't in a simple, classical,
0:08
Newtonian orbit configuration.
0:10
And that's the Bohr model of the electron.
0:12
And I'll keep reviewing it,
0:13
just because I think it's an important point.
0:14
If that's the nucleus, remember,
0:16
it's just a tiny, tiny, tiny dot
0:17
if you think about the entire volume of the actual atom.
0:21
And instead of the electron being in orbits around it,
0:24
which would be how a planet orbits the sun.
0:29
Instead of being in orbits around it,
0:31
it's described by orbitals,
0:33
which are these probability density functions.
0:36
So an orbital-- let's say that's the nucleus
0:39
it would describe,
0:42
if you took any point in space around the nucleus,
0:45
the probability of finding the electron.
0:48
So actually, in any volume of space around the nucleus,
0:53
it would tell you the probability
0:54
of finding the electron within that volume.
0:56
And so if you were to just take
0:58
a bunch of snapshots of electrons
1:00
-- let's say in the 1s orbital.
1:03
And that's what the 1s orbital looks like.
1:05
You can barely see it there,
1:08
but it's a sphere around the nucleus,
1:10
and that's the lowest energy state that an electron can be in.
1:14
If you were to just take a number of snapshots of electrons.
1:16
Let's say you were to take a number of snapshots of helium,
1:21
which has two electrons.
1:22
Both of them are in the 1s orbital.
1:25
It would look like this.
1:26
If you took one snapshot, maybe it'll be there,
1:28
the next snapshot, maybe the electron is there.
1:30
Then the electron is there.
1:32
Then the electron is there. Then it's there.
1:34
And if you kept doing the snapshots,
1:35
you would have a bunch of them really close.
1:37
And then it gets a little bit sparser as you get out,
1:40
as you get further and further out away from the electron.
1:44
But as you see, you're much more likely
1:47
to find the electron close to
1:50
the center of the atom than further out.
1:54
Although you might have had an observation with the electron
1:56
sitting all the way out there, or sitting over here.
1:58
So it really could have been anywhere,
1:59
but if you take multiple observations,
2:01
you'll see what that probability function is describing.
2:04
It's saying look, there's a much lower probability of
2:07
finding the electron out in this little cube of volume space
2:11
than it is in this little cube of volume space.
2:14
And when you see these diagrams
2:16
that draw this orbital like this.
2:18
Let's say they draw it like a shell, like a sphere.
2:23
And I'll try to make it look three-dimensional.
2:25
So let's say this is the outside of it,
2:27
and the nucleus is sitting some place on the inside.
2:29
They're just saying -- they just draw a cut-off
2:32
-- where can I find the electron 90% of the time?
2:35
So they're saying, OK, I can find the electron
2:36
90% of the time within this circle,
2:38
if I were to do the cross-section.
2:40
But every now and then the electron
2:42
can show up outside of that, right?
2:44
Because it's all probabilistic.
2:45
So this can still happen.
2:46
You can still find the electron
2:47
if this is the orbital we're talking about out here.
2:51
Right?
2:52
And then we, in the last video, we said,
2:54
OK, the electrons fill up the orbitals
2:57
from lowest energy state to high energy state.
3:05
You could imagine it. If I'm playing Tetris--
3:09
well I don't know if Tetris is the thing--
3:10
but if I'm stacking cubes, I lay out cubes from low energy,
3:14
if this is the floor,
3:15
I put the first cube at the lowest energy state.
3:17
And let's say I could put the second cube
3:21
at a low energy state here.
3:21
But I only have this much space to work with.
3:27
So I have to put the third cube
3:28
at the next highest energy state.
3:30
In this case our energy would
3:32
be described as potential energy, right?
3:34
This is just a classical, Newtonian physics example.
3:36
But that's the same idea with electrons.
3:39
Once I have two electrons in this 1s orbital
3:44
-- so let's say the electron configuration of helium is 1s2
3:49
-- the third electron I can't put there anymore,
3:52
because there's only room for two electrons.
3:54
The way I think about it is these two electrons are now
3:57
going to repel the third one I want to add.
3:59
So then I have to go to the 2s orbital.
4:02
And now if I were to plot the 2s orbital on top of this one,
4:06
it would look something like this,
4:07
where I have a high probability
4:08
of finding the electrons in this shell
4:12
that's essentially around the 1s orbital, right?
4:19
So right now, if maybe I'm dealing with lithium right now.
4:23
So I only have one extra electron.
4:24
So this one extra electron,
4:25
that might be where I observed that extra electron.
4:29
But every now and then it could show up there,
4:31
it could show up there, it could show up there,
4:32
but the high probability is there.
4:34
So when you say where is it going to be 90% of the time?
4:37
It'll be like this shell that's around the center.
4:39
Remember, when it's three-dimensional
4:40
you would kind of cover it up.
4:42
So it would be this shell.
4:42
So that's what they drew here.
4:45
They do the 1s.
4:47
It's just a red shell.
4:49
And then the 2s.
4:50
The second energy shell is just this blue shell over it.
4:53
And you can see it a little bit better in, actually,
4:55
the higher energy orbits, the higher energy shells,
4:57
where the seventh s energy shell is this red area.
5:02
Then you have the blue area, then the red, and the blue.
5:04
And so I think you get the idea
5:05
that each of those are energy shells.
5:07
So you kind of keep overlaying
5:09
the s energy orbitals around each other.
5:11
But you probably see this other stuff here.
5:14
And the general principle, remember,
5:15
is that the electrons fill up the orbital
5:18
from lowest energy orbital to higher energy orbital.
5:21
So the first one that's filled up is the 1s.
5:24
This is the 1.
5:26
This is the s.
5:27
So this is the 1s.
5:28
It can fit two electrons.
5:30
Then the next one that's filled up is 2s.
5:32
It can fill two more electrons.
5:34
And then the next one, and this is where it gets interesting,
5:37
you fill up the 2p orbital.
5:40
2p orbital.
5:42
That's this, right here.
5:44
2p orbitals.
5:46
And notice the p orbitals have something,
5:49
p sub z, p sub x, p sub y.
5:53
What does that mean?
5:55
Well, if you look at the p-orbitals,
5:57
they have these dumbbell shapes.
5:58
They look a little unnatural, but I think in future videos
6:00
we'll show you how they're analogous to standing waves.
6:03
But if you look at these, there's three ways
6:06
that you can configure these dumbbells.
6:08
One in the z direction, up and down.
6:09
One in the x direction, left or right.
6:11
And then one in the y direction,
6:13
this way, forward and backwards, right?
6:16
And so if you were to draw--
6:17
let's say you wanted to draw the p-orbitals.
6:20
So this is what you fill next.
6:22
And actually, you fill one electron here,
6:24
another electron here, then another electron there.
6:26
Then you fill another electron,
6:28
and we'll talk about spin and things like that in the future.
6:30
But, there, there, and there.
6:32
And that's actually called Hund's rule.
6:34
Maybe I'll do a whole video on Hund's rule,
6:36
but that's not relevant to a first-year chemistry lecture.
6:39
But it fills in that order, and once again,
6:42
I want you to have the intuition of what this would look like.
6:46
Look.
6:47
I should put look in quotation marks,
6:50
because it's very abstract.
6:52
But if you wanted to visualize the p orbitals--
6:54
let's say we're looking at
6:56
the electron configuration for, let's say, carbon.
7:01
So the electron configuration for carbon,
7:04
the first two electrons go into, so, 1s1, 1s2.
7:09
So then it fills-- sorry, you can't see everything.
7:13
So it fills the 1s2, so carbon's configuration.
7:20
It fills 1s1 then 1s2.
7:23
And this is just the configuration for helium.
7:26
And then it goes to the second shell,
7:28
which is the second period, right?
7:30
That's why it's called the periodic table.
7:32
We'll talk about periods and groups in the future.
7:34
And then you go here.
7:35
So this is filling the 2s.
7:38
We're in the second period right here.
7:40
That's the second period.
7:41
One, two.
7:43
Have to go off, so you can see everything.
7:45
So it fills these two.
7:47
So 2s2.
7:50
And then it starts filling up the p orbitals.
7:52
So then it starts filling 1p and then 2p.
7:56
And we're still on the second shell, so 2s2, 2p2.
8:01
So the question is what would this look like
8:04
if we just wanted to visualize this orbital
8:07
right here, the p orbitals?
8:08
So we have two electrons.
8:11
So one electron is going to be in a-- Let's say if this is,
8:14
I'll try to draw some axes.
8:16
That's too thin.
8:20
So if I draw a three-dimensional volume kind of axes.
8:28
If I were to make a bunch of observations of, say,
8:30
one of the electrons in the p orbitals,
8:33
let's say in the pz dimension,
8:35
sometimes it might be here, sometimes it might be there,
8:38
sometimes it might be there.
8:39
And then if you keep taking a bunch of observations,
8:46
you're going to have something that looks like this bell shape,
8:51
this barbell shape right there.
8:53
And then for the other electron
8:55
that's maybe in the x direction,
8:58
you make a bunch of observations.
9:00
Let me do it in a different,
9:01
in a noticeably different, color.
9:03
It will look like this.
9:04
You take a bunch of observations, and you say,
9:06
wow, it's a lot more likely to find that
9:09
electron in kind of the dumbell, in that dumbbell shape.
9:12
But you could find it out there.
9:13
You could find it there.
9:14
You could find it there.
9:15
This is just a much higher probability of
9:17
finding it in here than out here.
9:19
And that's the best way I can think of to visualize it.
9:23
Now what we were doing here,
9:25
this is called an electron configuration.
9:27
And the way to do it-- and there's multiple ways that are
9:30
taught in chemistry class, but the way I like to do it
9:33
-- is you take the periodic table and you say, these groups,
9:40
and when I say groups I mean the columns,
9:42
these are going to fill the s subshell or the s orbitals.
9:51
You can just write s up here, just right there.
9:53
These over here are going to fill the p orbitals.
9:59
Actually, let me take helium out of the picture.
10:01
The p orbitals.
10:03
Let me just do that.
10:04
Let me take helium out of the picture.
10:05
These take the p orbitals.
10:07
And actually, for the sake of figuring out these,
10:09
you should take helium and throw it right over there.
10:12
Right?
10:13
The periodic table is just a way
10:14
to organize things so it makes sense,
10:16
but in terms of trying to figure out orbitals,
10:18
you could take helium.
10:19
Let me do that.
10:20
The magic of computers.
10:22
Cut it out, and then let me paste it right over there.
10:27
Right?
10:29
And now you see that helium, you get 1s and then you get 2s,
10:33
so helium's configuration is
10:34
-- Sorry, you get 1s1, then 1s2.
10:38
We're in the first energy shell.
10:40
Right?
10:41
So the configuration of hydrogen is 1s1.
10:50
You only have one electron
10:52
in the s subshell of the first energy shell.
10:58
The configuration of helium is 1s2.
11:02
And then you start filling the second energy shell.
11:06
The configuration of lithium is 1s2.
11:12
That's where the first two electrons go.
11:13
And then the third one goes into 2s1, right?
11:18
And then I think you start to see the pattern.
11:20
And then when you go to nitrogen you say,
11:24
OK, it has three in the p sub-orbital.
11:29
So you can almost start backwards, right?
11:31
So we're in period two, right?
11:36
So this is 2p3.
11:39
Let me write that down.
11:40
So I could write that down first. 2p3.
11:45
So that's where the last three electrons
11:47
go into the p orbital.
11:48
Then it'll have these two that go into the 2s2 orbital.
11:57
And then the first two, or the electrons
12:01
in the lowest energy state, will be 1s2.
12:06
So this is the electron configuration,
12:07
right here, of nitrogen.
12:11
And just to make sure you did your configuration right,
12:15
what you do is you count the number of electrons.
12:17
So 2 plus 2 is 4 plus 3 is 7.
12:20
And we're talking about neutral atoms,
12:22
so the electrons should equal the number of protons.
12:24
The atomic number is the number of protons.
12:27
So we're good.
12:28
Seven protons. So this is, so far,
12:30
when we're dealing just with the s's and the p's,
12:32
this is pretty straightforward.
12:34
And if I wanted to figure out the configuration of silicon,
12:39
right there, what is it?
12:42
Well, we're in the third period.
12:43
One, two, three.
12:46
That's just the third row.
12:47
And this is the p-block right here.
12:50
So this is the second row in the p-block, right?
12:52
One, two, three, four, five, six.
12:54
Right.
12:56
We're in the second row of the p-block,
12:57
so we start off with 3p2.
13:03
And then we have 3s2.
13:08
And then it filled up all of this p-block over here.
13:10
So it's 2p6.
13:14
And then here, 2s2.
13:17
And then, of course, it filled up at the first shell
13:19
before it could fill up these other shells.
13:20
So, 1s2.
13:21
So this is the electron configuration for silicon.
13:26
And we can confirm that we should have 14 electrons.
13:29
2 plus 2 is 4, plus 6 is 10.
13:33
10 plus 2 is 12 plus 2 more is 14.
13:38
So we're good with silicon.
13:40
I think I'm running low on time right now,
13:42
so in the next video we'll start addressing what happens
13:44
when you go to these elements, or the d-block.
13:47
And you can kind of already guess what happens.
13:50
We're going to start filling up these d orbitals here
13:54
that have even more bizarre shapes.
13:56
And the way I think about this, not to waste too much time,
13:59
is that as you go further and further out from the nucleus,
14:03
there's more space in between the lower energy orbitals
14:06
to fill in more of these bizarro-shaped orbitals.
14:10
But these are kind of the balance --
14:12
I will talk about standing waves in the future
14:14
-- but these are kind of a balance between trying to
14:16
get close to the nucleus
14:18
and the proton and those positive charges,
14:20
because the electron charges are attracted to them,
14:22
while at the same time avoiding the other electron charges,
14:25
or at least their mass distribution functions.

Tracy is putting out decorative bowls of potpourri
0:03
in each room of the hotel where she works.
0:05
She wants to fill each bowl with 1/5 of a can of potpourri.
0:11
If Tracy has 4 cans of potpourri, in how many rooms
0:15
can she place a bowl of potpourri?
0:18
So she has 4 cans, and she wants to divide this 4
0:22
cans into groups of 1/5 of a can.
0:25
So if you have 4 of something and you're
0:27
trying to divide it into groups of a certain amount,
0:29
you would divide by that amount per group.
0:32
So you want to divide 4 by 1/5.
0:37
You want to divide 4 cans of potpourri into groups of 1/5.
0:42
So let's visualize this.
0:46
Let me draw one can of potpourri right over here.
0:50
So one can of potpourri can clearly be cut up into 5/5.
0:55
We have it right over here.
0:56
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
1:00
So 1 can of potpourri can fill 5 bowls
1:05
if you put 1/5 in each bowl.
1:07
Now, we have 4 cans.
1:10
So let me paste these.
1:12
So 2, 3, and 4.
1:18
So how many total bowls of potpourri can Tracy fill?
1:23
Well, she's got 4 cans.
1:25
So this is going to be equal to-- let
1:27
me do this is the right color-- this is going
1:29
to be equal to, once again, she has 4 cans.
1:33
And then for each of those cans, she
1:35
can fill 5 bowls of potpourri because each bowl only
1:37
requires a 1/5 of those cans.
1:40
So this is going to be the same thing as 4 times 5.
1:45
Or we can even write this as 4 times 5 over 1.
1:48
5 is the same thing as 5/1, which
1:51
is the same thing as 4 times 5, which,
1:58
of course, is equal to 20.
2:02
She can fill 20 cans-- or I should say, with her 4 cans,
2:06
she can fill 20 bowls of potpourri.
2:10
Now, just as a review here, we've
2:13
already seen that dividing by a number
2:15
is equal to multiplying by its reciprocal.
2:18
And we see that right over here.
2:20
Dividing by 1/5 is the same thing

0:00
Let's do a few more problems that bring together the
0:03
concepts that we learned in the last two videos.
0:05
So let's say we have the inequality 4x plus 3 is less
0:11
than negative 1.
0:12
So let's find all of the x's that satisfy this.
0:16
So the first thing I'd like to do is get rid of this 3.
0:18
So let's subtract 3 from both sides of this equation.
0:23
So the left-hand side is just going to end up being 4x.
0:27
These 3's cancel out.
0:29
That just ends up with a zero.
0:31
No reason to change the inequality just yet.
0:33
We're just adding and subtracting from both sides,
0:35
in this case, subtracting.
0:36
That doesn't change the inequality as long as we're
0:38
subtracting the same value.
0:40
We have negative 1 minus 3.
0:43
That is negative 4.
0:45
Negative 1 minus 3 is negative 4.
0:49
And then we'll want to-- let's see, we can divide both sides
0:53
of this equation by 4.
1:00
Once again, when you multiply or divide both sides of an
1:02
inequality by a positive number, it doesn't change the
1:06
inequality.
1:06
So the left-hand side is just x.
1:09
x is less than negative 4 divided by 4 is negative 1.
1:15
x is less than negative 1.
1:16
Or we could write this in interval notation.
1:19
All of the x's from negative infinity to negative 1, but
1:24
not including negative 1, so we put a
1:25
parenthesis right there.
1:27
Let's do a slightly harder one.
1:31
Let's say we have 5x is greater than 8x plus 27.
1:39
So let's get all our x's on the left-hand side, and the
1:41
best way to do that is subtract 8x from both sides.
1:45
So you subtract 8x from both sides.
1:49
The left-hand side becomes 5x minus 8x.
1:53
That's negative 3x.
1:56
We still have a greater than sign.
1:57
We're just adding or subtracting the same
1:59
quantities on both sides.
2:01
These 8x's cancel out and you're just left with a 27.
2:04
So you have negative 3x is greater than 27.
2:08
Now, to just turn this into an x, we want to divide both
2:11
sides by negative 3.
2:12
But remember, when you multiply or divide both sides
2:16
of an inequality by a negative number, you swap the
2:19
inequality.
2:20
So if we divide both sides of this by negative 3, we have to
2:29
swap this inequality.
2:30
It will go from being a greater than sign
2:33
to a less than sign.
2:36
And just as a bit of a way that I remember greater than
2:39
is that the left-hand side just looks bigger.
2:41
This is greater than.
2:42
If you just imagine this height, that height is greater
2:45
than that height right there, which is just a point.
2:48
I don't know if that confuses you or not.
2:49
This is less than.
2:50
This little point is less than the
2:53
distance of that big opening.
2:55
That's how I remember it.
2:56
But anyway, 3x over negative 3.
3:00
So now that we divided both sides by a negative number, by
3:04
negative 3, we swapped the inequality from greater than
3:07
to less than.
3:08
And the left-hand side, the negative 3's cancel out.
3:11
You get x is less than 27 over negative 3,
3:16
which is negative 9.
3:18
Or in interval notation, it would be everything from
3:21
negative infinity to negative 9, not including negative 9.
3:26
If you wanted to do it as a number line, it
3:29
would look like this.
3:31
This would be negative 9, maybe this would be negative
3:35
8, maybe this would be negative 10.
3:37
You would start at negative 9, not included, because we don't
3:40
have an equal sign here, and you go everything less than
3:44
that, all the way down, as we see, to negative infinity.
3:47
Let's do a nice, hairy problem.
3:52
So let's say we have 8x minus 5 times 4x plus 1 is greater
4:05
than or equal to negative 1 plus 2 times 4x minus 3.
4:12
Now, this might seem very daunting, but if we just
4:14
simplify it step by step, you'll see it's no harder than
4:17
any of the other problems we've tackled.
4:20
So let's just simplify this.
4:21
You get 8x minus-- let's distribute this negative 5.
4:26
So let me say 8x, and then distribute the negative 5.
4:29
Negative 5 times 4x is negative 20x.
4:33
Negative 5-- when I say negative 5, I'm talking about
4:35
this whole thing.
4:36
Negative 5 times 1 is negative 5, and then that's going to be
4:42
greater than or equal to negative 1 plus
4:45
2 times 4x is 8x.
4:48
2 times negative 3 is negative 6.
4:51
And now we can merge these two terms. 8x minus 20x is
4:56
negative 12x minus 5 is greater than or equal to-- we
5:04
can merge these constant terms. Negative 1 minus 6,
5:10
that's negative 7, and then we have this plus 8x left over.
5:16
Now, I like to get all my x terms on the left-hand side,
5:18
so let's subtract 8x from both sides of this equation.
5:30
I'm subtracting 8x.
5:32
This left-hand side, negative 12 minus 8,
5:34
that's negative 20.
5:36
Negative 20x minus 5.
5:41
Once again, no reason to change the
5:42
inequality just yet.
5:44
All we're doing is simplifying the sides, or adding and
5:46
subtracting from them.
5:48
The right-hand side becomes-- this thing cancels out, 8x
5:53
minus 8x, that's 0.
5:54
So you're just left with a negative 7.
5:57
And now I want to get rid of this negative 5.
5:59
So let's add 5 to both sides of this equation.
6:06
The left-hand side, you're just left with a negative 20x.
6:12
These 5's cancel out.
6:14
No reason to change the inequality just yet.
6:17
Negative 7 plus 5, that's negative 2.
6:22
Now, we're at an interesting point.
6:23
We have negative 20x is greater than or equal to
6:26
negative 2.
6:28
If this was an equation, or really any type of an
6:31
inequality, we want to divide both sides by negative 20.
6:33
But we have to remember, when you multiply or divide both
6:36
sides of an inequality by a negative number, you have to
6:39
swap the inequality.
6:40
So let's remember that.
6:42
So if we divide this side by negative 20 and we divide this
6:46
side by negative 20, all I did is took both of these sides
6:50
divided by negative 20, we have to swap the inequality.
6:54
The greater than or equal to has to become a less than or
6:58
equal sign.
6:59
And, of course, these cancel out, and you get x is less
7:03
than or equal to-- the negatives cancel
7:05
out-- 2/20 is 1/10.
7:10
If we were writing it in interval notation, the upper
7:13
bound would be 1/10.
7:15
Notice, we're including it, because we have an equal sign,
7:18
less than or equal, so we're including 1/10, and we're
7:22
going to go all the way down to negative infinity,
7:24
everything less than or equal to 1/10.
7:27
This is just another way of writing that.
7:29
And just for fun, let's draw the number line.
7:33
Let's draw the number line right here.
7:35
This is maybe 0, that is 1.
7:38
1/10 might be over here.
7:42
Everything less than or equal to 1/10.
7:45
So we're going to include the 1/10 and everything less than
7:51
that is included in the solution set.
7:54
And you could try out any value less than 1/10 and
7:56
verify that it will satisfy this inequality.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,xOxvyeSl0uA,

Divide and write the answer as a mixed number.
0:04
And we have 3/5 divided by 1/2.
0:07
Now, whenever you're dividing any fractions, you just have
0:10
to remember that dividing by a fraction is the same thing as
0:14
multiplying by its reciprocal.
0:16
So this thing right here is the same thing as 3/5 times--
0:22
so this is our 3/5 right here, and instead of a division
0:25
sign, you want a multiplication sign, and
0:28
instead of a 1/2, you want to take the reciprocal of 1/2,
0:31
which would be 2/1-- so times 2/1.
0:36
So dividing by 1/2 is the exact same thing as
0:39
multiplying by 2/1.
0:42
And we just do this as a straightforward multiplication
0:45
problem now.
0:46
3 times 2 is 6, so our new numerator is 6.
0:49
5 times 1 is 5.
0:52
So 3/5 divided by 1/2 as an improper fraction is 6/5.
0:57
Now, they want us to write it as at mixed number.
1:01
So we divide the 5 into the 6, figure out how
1:04
many times it goes.
1:05
That'll be the whole number part of the mixed number.
1:07
And then whatever's left over will be the remaining
1:10
numerator over 5.
1:13
So what we'll do is take 5 into 6.
1:18
5 goes into 6 one time.
1:20
1 times 5 is 5.
1:22
Subtract.
1:23
You have a remainder of 1.
1:25
So 6/5 is equal to one whole, or 5/5, and 1/5.
1:38
This 1 comes from whatever is left over.
1:42
And now we're done!
1:43
3/5 divided by 1/2 is 1 and 1/5.
1:46
Now, the one thing that's not obvious is why did this work?
1:49
Why is dividing by 1/2 the same thing as multiplying
1:53
essentially by 2.
1:54
2/1 is the same thing as 2.
1:57
And to do that, I'll do a little side-- fairly simple--
1:59
example, but hopefully, it gets the point across.
2:03
Let me take four objects.
2:05
So we have four objects: one, two, three, four.
2:08
So I have four objects, and if I were to divide into groups
2:13
of two, so I want to divide it into groups of two.
2:17
So that is one group of two and then that is another group
2:21
of two, how many groups do I have?
2:23
Well, 4 divided by 2, I have two groups of two, so that is
2:27
equal to 2.
2:28
Now, what if I took those same four objects:
2:31
one, two, three, four.
2:33
So I'm taking those same four objects.
2:36
Instead of dividing them into groups of two, I want to
2:38
divide them into groups of 1/2, which means each group
2:44
will have half of an object in it.
2:47
So let's say that would be one group right there.
2:49
That is a second group.
2:51
That is a third group.
2:53
I think you see each group has half of a circle in it.
2:56
That is the fourth.
2:58
That's the fifth.
3:00
That's the sixth.
3:01
That's the seventh, and then that's the eighth.
3:03
You have eight groups of 1/2, so this is equal to 8.
3:08
And notice, now each of the objects became two groups.
3:12
So you could say how many groups do you have?
3:14
Well, you have four objects and each of
3:16
them became two groups.
3:21
I'm looking for a different color.
3:22
Each of them became two groups, and so
3:24
you also have eight.
3:26
So dividing by 1/2 is the same thing as multiplying by 2.

0:00
- [Voiceover] Let's say that we have the linear equation,
0:02
y = 1/2x - 3.
0:09
So if we wanted to draw the line that represents
0:13
the set of all points, all the coordinates where the x value
0:16
and the y value satisfy this equation,
0:18
we could start off by just trying to draw,
0:20
by trying to draw a few of those points,
0:23
and then connecting them with a line.
0:26
Let's set up a little table here x, y.
0:30
And we can just try a couple of x values here,
0:32
then figure out what the corresponding y values are.
0:35
I'm going to pick x values where it's going
0:37
to be fairly easy to calculate the y values.
0:39
Let's say when x is equal to zero,
0:41
then you're gonna have 1/2 x 0 - 3,
0:44
well then y is going to be -3.
0:46
When x is, let me try x = 2, because then 1/2 x 2
0:50
is just gonna be 1.
0:52
So when x = 2, you're going to have
0:55
1/2 x 2 = 1, -3 is -2.
1:00
When x is equal to, let's try 4.
1:04
So 1/2 x 4 is 2, and then -3 is -1,
1:12
and we could keep going but actually
1:14
all we need is two points for a line.
1:16
So we're ready to plot this line if we'd like.
1:18
The point 0, -3 is on this line.
1:22
0, -3 and actually let me do this in a slightly darker color
1:25
so that we can see it on this white background.
1:27
0, -3 is on the line, 2, -2 is on the line.
1:32
So 2, -2 and then we have 4, -1.
1:38
So when x is 4, y is -1,
1:42
and I could draw a line that connects all of these
1:47
so it would look something like...
1:49
If I, let's see if I could do this.
1:51
It would look something like,
1:54
it would something like, like that.
1:59
So this right over here, this is literally,
2:01
this is the graph of y = 1/2x - 3.
2:09
Now when we look at a graph like this
2:11
an interesting thing that we might want to ask ourself
2:13
is where does the graph intersect our axes?
2:18
So first we can say, well where does
2:19
in intersect our x-axis?
2:22
When you look at this, it looks like
2:23
it happens at this point right over here.
2:26
This point where a graph intersects an axes
2:30
this is called an intercept.
2:31
This one in particular is called the x-intercept.
2:35
Why is it called the x-intercept?
2:37
Because that's where the graph
2:38
is intersecting the x-axis
2:41
and the x-intercept, it looks like
2:44
this is at the .6, 0.
2:47
Now it's very interesting, the x-intercept
2:49
happens when y = 0.
2:51
Remember, you're on the x-axis when
2:53
you haven't moved up or down from that axis
2:56
which means y = 0.
2:58
So your x-intercept happens at x = 6, y = 0.
3:02
It's this coordinate.
3:04
Now what about the y-intercept?
3:06
Well the y-intercept is this point right over here.
3:08
This is where you intersect or I guess
3:10
you could say intercept the y-axis.
3:13
So this right over here, that over there
3:16
is the y-intercept.
3:19
The y-intercept is at the coordinate
3:21
that has a 0 for the x-coordinate.
3:24
X is 0 here and y is -3.
3:27
X is 0 and y is -3.
3:30
This was actually one of the points,
3:31
or one of the pairs that we first tried out.
3:36
You can validate that 6, 0 satisfies this equation
3:40
right over here.
3:41
If x is 6, 1/2 x 6 is 3, -3 is indeed equal to 0.
3:46
So now that we know what an x-intercept is,
3:49
it's the point where a graph intersects the x-axis
3:52
or intercepts the x-axis and the y-intercept
3:54
is the point where a graph intercepts the y-axis
3:58
or intersects the y-axis.
4:00
Let's try to see if we can find the x and y-intercepts
4:01
for a few other linear equations.
4:05
So let's say that I had the linear equation.
4:09
Let's say that I have 5x + 6y = 30.
4:19
I encourage you to pause this video,
4:21
and figure out what are the x and y-intercepts
4:24
for the graph that represents the solutions,
4:27
all the xy pairs that satisfy this equation.
4:31
Well the easiest thing to do here,
4:33
let's see what the y value is when x = 0
4:38
and what x value is when y = 0.
4:42
When x = 0 this becomes 6y = 30.
4:46
So 6 times what is 30?
4:48
Well y would be equal to 5 here.
4:50
So when x is 0, y is 5.
4:54
What about when y is 0?
4:55
Well when y is 0, that's going to be 0,
4:57
and you have 5x = 30.
4:59
Well then x would be equal to 6.
5:02
Then x would be equal to 6.
5:05
So we could plot those points, 0, 5.
5:08
When x is 0, y is 5.
5:12
When x is 6, y is 0.
5:16
So those are both points on this graph
5:20
and then the actual graph is going to,
5:22
or the actual line that represents the x and y pairs
5:26
that satisfy this equation is going to look like,
5:30
it's going to look like this.
5:32
I'll just try.
5:34
So I can make it go, it's going to look like...
5:38
It's going to go through those two points.
5:41
So it going to...I can make it go the other way too.
5:44
Let me see.
5:45
It's going to go through those two points
5:48
and so it's going to look something like that.
5:51
Now what are its' x and y-intercepts?
5:54
Well, we already kind of figured it out
5:55
but the intercepts themselves,
5:56
these are the points on the graph where
5:58
they intersect the axes.
6:01
So this right over here, this is the y-intercept.
6:03
That point is the y-intercept
6:06
and it happens, it's always going to happen
6:08
when x = 0, and when x = 0 we know that y = 5.
6:13
It's that point, the point 0, 5.
6:15
And what is the y inter...what is the x-intercept?
6:19
The x-intercept is the point, it's actually
6:21
the same x-intercept for this equation right over here.
6:25
It's the point 6, 0. That point right over there.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,LNSB0N6esPU,

In the last video we looked at a function
0:02
and tried to draw its derivative.
0:04
Now in this video, we're going to look at a function
0:06
and try to draw its antiderivative.
0:10
Which sounds like a very fancy word,
0:12
but it's just saying the antiderivative of a function
0:16
is a function whose derivative is that function.
0:19
So for example, if we have f of x,
0:22
and let's say that the antiderivative of f of x
0:33
is capital F of x.
0:35
And this tends to be the notation, when you're
0:37
talking about an antiderivative.
0:39
This just means that the derivative
0:45
of capital F of x, which is equal to, you could say capital
0:49
f prime of x, is equal to f of x.
0:54
So we're going to try to do here is, we have our f of x.
0:57
And we're going to try to think about what's
0:59
a possible function that this could be the derivative of?
1:01
And you're going to study this in much more depth
1:04
when you start looking at integral calculus.
1:06
But there's actually many possible functions
1:09
that this could be the derivative of.
1:11
And our goal in this video is just
1:12
to draw a reasonable possibility.
1:14
So let's think about it a little bit.
1:16
So let's, over here on the top, draw
1:18
y is equal to capital F of x.
1:22
So what we're going to try to draw
1:23
is a function where its derivative
1:26
could look like this.
1:28
So what we're essentially doing is,
1:31
when we go from what we're draw up here to this,
1:33
we're taking the derivative.
1:34
So let's think about what this function could look like.
1:37
So when we look at this derivative,
1:39
it says over this interval over this first interval right
1:42
over here, let me do this in purple,
1:44
it says over this interval from x
1:46
is equal to 0 all the way to whatever value of x,
1:50
this right over here, it says that the slope is
1:53
a constant positive 1.
1:56
So let me draw a line with a slope of a constant positive 1.
2:00
And I could shift that line up and down.
2:02
Once again, there's many possible antiderivatives.
2:05
I will just pick a reasonable one.
2:08
So I could have a line that looks something like this.
2:16
I want to draw a slope of positive 1 as best as I can.
2:21
So let's say it looks something like this.
2:24
And I could make the function defined here or undefined here.
2:27
The derivative is undefined at this point.
2:30
I could make the function defined or undefined
2:32
as I see fit.
2:34
This will probably be a point of discontinuity
2:36
on the original function.
2:37
It doesn't have to be, but I'm just
2:39
trying to draw a possible function.
2:41
So let's actually just say it actually
2:42
is defined at that point right over there.
2:44
But since this is going to be discontinuous,
2:46
the derivative is going to be undefined at that point.
2:49
So that's that first interval.
2:51
Now let's look at the second interval.
2:52
The second interval, from where that first interval ended,
2:55
all the way to right over here.
2:59
The derivative is a constant negative 2.
3:03
So that means over here, I'm going
3:04
to have a line of constant negative slope,
3:08
or constant negative 2 slope.
3:10
So it's going to be twice as steep as this one right
3:13
over here.
3:14
So I actually could just draw it.
3:16
I could make it a continuous function,
3:17
I could just make a negative 2 slope, just like this.
3:21
And it looks like this interval is about half as long
3:23
as this interval.
3:24
So it maybe gets to the exact same point.
3:25
So it could look something-- let me
3:29
draw it a little bit neater-- like this.
3:39
The slope right over here is equal to 1,
3:45
we see that right over there in the derivative.
3:47
And then the slope right over here is equal to negative 2.
3:53
We see that in the derivative.
3:56
Now things get interesting.
3:57
Once again, I could have shifted this blue line up and down.
4:00
I did not have to construct a continuous function like this.
4:02
But I'm doing it just for fun.
4:04
There's many possible antiderivatives
4:06
of this function.
4:08
Now what's going on over the next interval?
4:14
And I'll do it do it in orange.
4:16
The slope starts off at a very high value.
4:20
It starts off at positive 2.
4:22
Then it keeps decreasing, and it gets to 0, right over here.
4:26
The slope gets to 0 right over there.
4:29
And then it starts becoming more and more and more
4:32
and more negative.
4:33
So I'll just try to make this a continuous function, just
4:36
for fun.
4:36
Once again, it does not have to be.
4:38
So over here the slope is very positive.
4:40
It's a positive 2.
4:41
So our slope is going to be like, this is negative 2,
4:44
so it's going to be a positive 2.
4:46
And then it gets more and more and more negative up to this,
4:49
or, it becomes less and less and less positive I should say.
4:52
Even here the slope is positive.
4:54
And it gets to 0 right over there.
4:56
So maybe it gets to 0 maybe right over here.
5:02
And so what we have, we could have some type of a parabola.
5:05
So the downward facing parabola.
5:08
So notice, the slope is a very positive value.
5:11
It's a positive 2 right over here,
5:13
then it becomes less and less and less and less positive,
5:17
all the way to 0 right over there.
5:19
And then the slope starts turning negative.
5:25
And so our function could look something
5:28
like that over the interval.
5:29
Let me draw it a little bit neater.
5:33
This is symmetric.
5:35
How ever positive our slope was here,
5:36
it's equally negative here.
5:38
So our curve should probably be symmetric as well.
5:41
So let me draw it like this over that interval.
5:45
It could look like that.
5:47
And then finally, over this last interval,
5:51
or I guess we could say, it keeps going, our slope is 0.
5:56
And once again I don't have to draw a continuous function.
5:59
But when the slope is 0, that just
6:01
means that I have a line with slope 0.
6:04
I have a horizontal line.
6:05
And I could draw that horizontal line up here, in which case
6:09
I'd have to say its discontinuous.
6:11
Or I could draw that horizontal line right over here,
6:17
and try to make my antiderivative
6:19
a continuous function.
6:20
So once again, I could have shifted any of these segments
6:23
up or down, and gotten the exact same derivative.
6:25
But then I would not have gotten a continuous function
6:28
like this.
6:29
But we have been able to construct
6:31
a possible antiderivative for f of x.
6:34
And just as a reminder, that's just saying this f of x is--
6:37
the antiderivative is a function that f of x
6:41
could be the derivative of.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,61ecnr8m04U,

0:00
The main mast of a fishing boat is supported by a sturdy
0:04
rope that extends from the top of the mast to the deck.
0:07
If the mast is 20 feet tall and the rope attaches to the
0:10
deck 15 feet away from the base of the mast,
0:14
how long is the rope?
0:16
So let's draw ourselves a boat and make sure we understand
0:19
what the deck and the mast and all of that is.
0:22
So let me draw a boat.
0:25
I'll start with yellow.
0:27
So let's say that this is my boat.
0:31
That is the deck of the boat.
0:33
And the boat might look something like this.
0:37
It's a sailing boat.
0:40
This is the water down here.
0:45
And then the mast is the thing that holds up the sail.
0:47
So let me draw ourselves a mast.
0:56
And they say the mast is 20 feet tall.
0:59
So this distance right here is 20 feet.
1:04
That is what is holding up the sail.
1:07
I can draw it as a pole so it's a little bit clearer.
1:10
Even shade it in if we like.
1:12
And then they say a rope attaches to the deck 15 feet
1:16
away from the base of the mast. So this is the base of
1:18
the mast. This is the deck right here.
1:20
The rope attaches 15 feet away from the base of the mast.
1:26
So if this is the base of the mast, we go 15 feet, might be
1:29
about that distance right there.
1:31
Let me mark that.
1:36
And the rope attaches right here.
1:37
From the top of the mast all the way that base.
1:40
So the rope goes like that.
1:44
And then they ask us, how long is the rope?
1:48
So there's a few things you might realize.
1:50
We're dealing with a triangle here.
1:52
And it's not any triangle.
1:53
We're assuming that the mast goes straight up and that the
1:57
deck is straight left and right.
1:59
So this is a right triangle.
2:00
This is a 90 degree angle right here.
2:05
And we know that, if we know two sides of a right triangle,
2:08
we can always figure out the third side of a right triangle
2:11
using the Pythagorean theorem.
2:19
And all that tells us is it the sum of the squares of the
2:24
shorter sides of the triangle are going to be equal to the
2:27
square of the longer side.
2:29
And that longer side is call the hypotenuse.
2:36
And in all cases, the hypotenuse is the side
2:39
opposite the 90 degree angle.
2:40
It is always going to be the longest side
2:42
of our right triangle.
2:44
So we need to figure out the hypotenuse here.
2:46
We know the lengths of the two shorter sides.
2:48
So we can see that if we take 15 squared, that's one of the
2:54
short sides, I'm squaring it.
2:56
And then add that to the square of the other shorter
2:59
side, to 20 feet squared.
3:01
And when I say the shorter side, I mean relative to the
3:03
hypotenuse.
3:04
The hypotenuse will always be the longest side.
3:09
Let's say the hypotenuse is in green just so we get our color
3:12
coding nice.
3:13
That is going to be equal to the rope squared.
3:17
Or the length of the rope.
3:18
Let's call this distance right here r.
3:21
r for rope.
3:28
So 15 squared plus 20 squared is going to
3:30
be equal to r squared.
3:33
And what's 15 squared?
3:34
It's 225.
3:37
20 squared is 400.
3:43
And that's going to be equal to r squared.
3:47
Now 225 plus 400 is 625.
3:52
625 is equal to r squared.
3:55
And then we can take the principal root of both sides
3:57
of this equation.
3:58
Because we're talking about distances, we want the
4:00
positive square root.
4:01
So you take the positive square root, or the principal
4:04
root, of both sides of this equation.
4:07
And you are left with r is equal to the
4:10
square root of 625.
4:11
You can play with it a little bit if you like.
4:13
But if you've ever played with numbers around 25, you'll see
4:17
that this is 25 squared.
4:20
So r is equal to the square root of 625, which is 25.
4:25
So this distance right here, the length of the rope, is
4:28
equal to 25 feet.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,JVrkLIcA2qw,

Let's do some equations that deal with absolute values.
0:03
And just as a bit of a review, when you take the absolute
0:06
value of a number.
0:07
Let's say I take the absolute value of negative 1.
0:10
What you're really doing is you're saying, how far is that
0:13
number from 0?
0:16
And in the case of negative 1, if we draw a number line right
0:20
there-- that's a very badly drawn number line.
0:23
If we draw a number line right there, that's 0.
0:26
You have a negative 1 right there.
0:28
Well, it's 1 away from 0.
0:30
So the absolute value of negative 1 is 1.
0:33
And the absolute value of 1 is also 1 away from 0.
0:38
It's also equal to 1.
0:40
So on some level, absolute value is the distance from 0.
0:43
But another, I guess simpler way to think of it, it always
0:46
results in the positive version of the number.
0:48
The absolute value of negative 7,346 is equal to 7,346.
0:59
So with that in mind, let's try to solve some equations
1:02
with absolute values in them.
1:05
So let's say I have the equation the absolute value of
1:08
x minus 5 is equal to 10.
1:14
And one way you can interpret this, and I want you to think
1:16
about this, this is actually saying that the distance
1:18
between x and 5 is equal to 10.
1:23
So how many numbers that are exactly 10 away from 5?
1:26
And you can already think of the solution to this equation,
1:29
but I'll show you how to solve it systematically.
1:31
Now this is going to be true in two situations.
1:36
Either x minus 5 is equal to positive 10.
1:41
If this evaluates out to positive 10, then when you
1:44
take the absolute value of it, you're going to
1:46
get positive 10.
1:48
Or x minus 5 might evaluate to negative 10.
1:53
If x minus 5 evaluated to negative 10, when you take the
1:56
absolute value of it, you would get 10 again.
1:59
So x minus 5 could also be equal to negative 10.
2:04
Both of these would satisfy this equation.
2:07
Now, to solve this one, add 5 to both
2:10
sides of this equation.
2:11
You get x is equal to 15.
2:14
To solve this one, add 5 to both sides of this equation.
2:17
x is equal to negative 5.
2:20
So our solution, there's two x's that
2:23
satisfy this equation.
2:24
x could be 15.
2:26
15 minus 5 is 10, take the absolute value, you're going
2:29
to get 10, or x could be negative 5.
2:32
Negative 5 minus 5 is negative 10.
2:36
Take the absolute value, you get 10.
2:39
And notice, both of these numbers are exactly 10 away
2:43
from the number 5.
2:45
Let's do another one of these.
2:48
Let's do another one.
2:51
Let's say we have the absolute value of x plus
2:54
2 is equal to 6.
2:58
So what does that tell us?
2:59
That tells us that either x plus 2, that the thing inside
3:03
the absolute value sign, is equal to 6.
3:07
Or the thing inside of the absolute value sign, the x
3:10
plus 2, could also be negative 6.
3:12
If this whole thing evaluated to negative 6, you take the
3:13
absolute value, you'd get 6.
3:16
So, or x plus 2 could equal negative 6.
3:20
And then if you subtract 2 from both sides of this
3:22
equation, you get x could be equal to 4.
3:25
If you subtract 2 from both sides of this equation, you
3:29
get x could be equal to negative 8.
3:33
So these are the two solutions to the equation.
3:37
And just to kind of have it gel in your mind, that
3:39
absolute value, you can kind of view it as a distance, you
3:42
could rewrite this problem as the absolute value of x minus
3:46
negative 2 is equal to 6.
3:50
And so this is asking me, what are the x's that are exactly 6
3:55
away from negative 2?
3:57
Remember, up here we said, what are the x's that are
4:00
exactly 10 away from positive 5?
4:03
Whatever number you're subtracting from positive 5,
4:05
these are both 10 away from positive 5.
4:08
This is asking, what is exactly 6 away
4:11
from negative 2?
4:13
And it's going to be 4, or negative 8.
4:15
You could try those numbers out for yourself.
4:17
Let's do another one of these.
4:20
Let's do another one, and we'll do it in purple.
4:25
Let's say we have the absolute value of 4x-- I'm going to
4:30
change this problem up a little bit.
4:31
4x minus 1.
4:33
The absolute value of 4x minus 1, is equal to-- actually,
4:36
I'll just keep it-- is equal to 19.
4:40
So, just like the last few problems, 4x minus 1 could be
4:43
equal to 19.
4:47
Or 4x minus 1 might evaluate to negative 19.
4:51
Because then when you take the absolute value, you're going
4:53
to get 19 again.
4:54
Or 4x minus 1 could be equal to negative 19.
4:59
Then you just solve these two equations.
5:00
Add 1 to both sides of this equation-- we could do them
5:03
simultaneous, even.
5:03
Add 1 to both sides of this, you get 4x is equal to 20.
5:08
Add 1 to both sides of this equation, you get 4x is equal
5:13
to negative 18.
5:15
Divide both sides of this by 4, you get x is equal to 5.
5:20
Divide both sides of this by 4, you get x is equal to
5:23
negative 18/4, which is equal to negative 9/2.
5:31
So both of these x values satisfy the equation.
5:35
Try it out.
5:36
Negative 9/2 times 4.
5:39
This will become a negative 18.
5:41
Negative 18 minus 1 is negative 19.
5:44
Take the absolute value, you get 19.
5:46
You put a 5 here, 4 times 5 is 20.
5:49
Minus 1 is positive 19.
5:51
So you take the absolute value.
5:53
Once again, you'll get a 19.
5:55
Let's try to graph one of these, just for fun.
5:58
So let's say I have y is equal to the absolute
6:03
value of x plus 3.
6:04
So this is a function, or a graph, with an
6:07
absolute value in it.
6:09
So let's think about two scenarios.
6:11
There's one scenario where the thing inside of the absolute
6:14
value is positive.
6:16
So you have the scenario where x plus 3-- I'll write it over
6:19
here-- x plus 3 is greater than 0.
6:23
And then you have the scenario where x plus 3 is less than 0.
6:29
When x plus 3 is greater than 0, this graph, or this line--
6:35
or I guess we can't call it a line-- this function, is the
6:37
same thing as y is equal to x plus 3.
6:41
If this thing over here is greater than 0, then the
6:44
absolute value sign is irrelevant.
6:46
So then this thing is the same thing as y is
6:48
equal to x plus 3.
6:50
But when is x plus 3 greater than 0?
6:52
Well, if you subtract 3 from both sides, you get x is
6:57
greater than negative 3.
6:59
So when x is greater than negative 3, this graph is
7:03
going to look just like y is equal to x plus 3.
7:08
Now, when x plus 3 is less than 0.
7:11
When the situation where this-- the inside of our
7:14
absolute value sign-- is negative, in that situation
7:18
this equation is going to be y is equal to the
7:22
negative of x plus 3.
7:26
How can I say that?
7:27
Well, look, if this is going to be a negative number, if x
7:30
plus 3 is going to be a negative number-- that's what
7:33
we're assuming here-- if it's going to be a negative number,
7:36
then when you take the absolute value of a negative
7:38
number, you're going to make it positive.
7:40
That's just like multiplying it by negative 1.
7:43
If you know you're taking the absolute value of a negative
7:45
number, it's just like multiplying it by negative 1,
7:48
because you're going to make it positive.
7:51
And this is going to be the situation.
7:53
x plus 3 is less than 0.
7:55
If we subtract 3 from both sides, when x is less than
7:59
negative 3.
8:01
So when x is less than negative 3, the graph will
8:03
look like this.
8:05
When x is greater than negative 3, the graph will
8:08
look like that.
8:09
So let's see what that would make the
8:11
entire graph look like.
8:13
Let me draw my axes.
8:21
That's my x-axis, that's my y-axis.
8:26
So just let me multiply this out, just so we have it in mx
8:29
plus b form.
8:29
So this is equal to negative x minus 3.
8:36
So let's just figure out what this graph would
8:37
look like in general.
8:38
Negative x minus 3.
8:42
The y-intercept is negative 3, so 1, 2, 3.
8:47
And negative x means it slopes downward, has a
8:51
downward slope of 1.
8:52
So it would look like this.
8:56
The x-intercept would be at x is equal to--.
9:02
So if you say y is equal to 0, that would happen when x is
9:07
equal to negative 3.
9:08
So it's going to go through that line,
9:10
that point right there.
9:11
And the graph, if we didn't have this constraint right
9:14
here, would look something like this.
9:19
That's if we didn't constrain it to a certain interval on
9:22
the x-axis.
9:23
Now this graph, what does it look like?
9:27
Let's see.
9:27
It has its y-intercept at positive 3.
9:31
Just like that.
9:33
And where's its x-intecept?
9:35
When y is equal to 0, x is negative 3.
9:37
So it also goes through that point right there, and it has
9:39
a slope of 1.
9:40
So it would look something like this.
9:43
That's what this graph looks like.
9:45
Now, what we figured out is that this absolute value
9:48
function, it looks like this purple graph when x is less
9:52
than negative 3.
9:53
So when x is less than negative 3-- that's x is equal
9:57
to negative 3 right there-- when x is less than negative
9:59
3, it looks like this purple graph.
10:03
Right there.
10:04
So that's when x is less than negative 3.
10:07
But when x is greater than negative 3, it looks like the
10:10
green graph.
10:12
It looks like that.
10:14
So this graph looks like this strange v.
10:17
When x is greater than negative 3, this is positive.
10:21
So we have the graph of-- we have a positive slope.
10:24
But then when x is less than negative 3, we're essentially
10:28
taking the negative of the function, if you want to view
10:30
it that way, and so we have this negative slope.
10:32
So you kind of have this v-shaped function, this
10:35
v-shaped graph, which is indicative of an absolute
10:38
value function.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,u6zDpUL5RkU,

0:00
We're first exposed to the idea of a slope of a line early on
0:05
in our algebra careers, but I figure it never hurts
0:07
to review it a bit.
0:08
So let me draw some axes.
0:10
That is my y-axis.
0:12
Maybe I should call it my f of x-axis.
0:15
y is equal to f of x.
0:17
Let me draw my x-axis, just like that, that is my x-axis.
0:23
And let me draw a line, let me draw a line like this.
0:28
And what we want to do is remind ourselves, how do we
0:31
find the slope of that line?
0:36
And what we do is, we take two points on the line,
0:42
so let's say we take this point, right here.
0:45
Let's say that that is the point x is equal to a.
0:48
And then what would this be?
0:49
This would be the point f of a, where the function is
0:53
going to be some line.
0:54
We could write f of x is going to be equal to mx plus b.
0:59
We don't know what m and b are, but this is all
1:01
a little bit of review.
1:02
So this is a.
1:04
And then the y-value is what happens to the function when
1:06
you evaluated it at a, so that's that point right there.
1:09
And then we could take another point on this line.
1:11
Let's say we take point b, right there.
1:14
And then this coordinate up here is going to be
1:17
the point b, f of b.
1:22
Right?
1:22
Because this is just the point when you evaluate
1:23
the function at b.
1:24
You put b in here, you're going to get that point right there.
1:27
So let me just draw a little line right there.
1:29
So that is f of b, right there.
1:32
Actually, let me make it clear that this coordinate right
1:35
is the point a, f of a.
1:38
So how do we find the slope between these 2 points, or more
1:42
generally, of this entire line?
1:43
Because whole the slope is consistent the
1:46
whole way through it.
1:48
And we know that once we find the slope, that's
1:50
actually going to be the value of this m.
1:51
That's all a review of your algebra, but how do we do it?
1:54
Well, a couple of ways to think about it.
1:56
Slope is equal to rise over run.
2:05
You might have seen that when you first learned algebra.
2:07
Or another way of writing it, it's change in
2:09
y over change in x.
2:13
So let's figure out what the change in why over the change
2:16
in x is for this particular case.
2:18
So the change in y is equal to what?
2:22
Well, let's just take, you can take this guy as being the
2:25
first point, or that guy as being the first point.
2:26
But since this guy has a larger x and a larger y,
2:29
let's start with him.
2:30
The change in y between that guy and that guy is this
2:33
distance, right here.
2:35
So let me draw a little triangle.
2:36
That distance right there is a change in y.
2:39
Or I could just transfer it to the y-axis.
2:42
This is the change in y.
2:44
That is your change in y, that distance.
2:46
So what is that distance?
2:47
It's f of b minus f of a.
2:51
So it equals f of b minus f of a.
2:57
That is your change in y.
3:01
Now what is your change in x The slope is change
3:05
in y over change in x.
3:09
So what our change in x?
3:10
What's this distance?
3:11
Remember, we're taking this to be the first point,
3:13
so we took its y minus the other point's y.
3:16
So to be consistent, we're going to have to take this
3:17
point x minus this point x.
3:20
So this point's x-coordinate is b.
3:23
So it's going to be b minus a.
3:29
And just like that, if you knew the equation of this line, or
3:31
if you had the coordinates of these 2 points, you would just
3:34
plug them in right here and you would get your slope.
3:39
That straightforward.
3:40
And that comes straight out of your Algebra 1 class.
3:43
And let me just, just to make sure it's concrete for you, if
3:46
this was the point 2, 3, and let's say that this, up here,
3:55
was the point 5, 7, then if we wanted to find the slope of
4:00
this line, we would do 7 minus 3, that would be our change in
4:06
y, this would be 7 and this would be 3, and then we
4:10
do that over 5 minus 2.
4:14
Because this would be a 5, and this would be a 2, and so this
4:18
would be your change in x.
4:19
5 minus 2.
4:20
So 7 minus 3 is 4, and 5 minus 2 is 3. so your
4:24
slope would be 4/3.
4:30
Now let's see if we can generalize this.
4:33
And this is what the new concept that we're going
4:35
to be learning as we delve into calculus.
4:38
Let's see if we can generalize this somehow to a curve.
4:41
So let's say I have a curve.
4:44
We have to have a curve before we can generalize
4:46
it to a curve.
4:47
Let me scroll down a little.
4:47
Well, actually, I want to leave this up here, show
4:49
you the similarity.
4:51
Let's say I have, I'll keep it pretty general right now.
4:56
Let's say I have a curve.
4:58
I'll make it a familiar-looking curve.
5:01
Let's say it's the curve y is equal to x squared, which
5:03
looks something like that.
5:06
And I want to find the slope.
5:10
Let's say I want to find the slope at some point.
5:13
And actually, before even talking about it, let's even
5:15
think about what it means to find the slope of a curve.
5:18
Here, the slope was the same the whole time, right?
5:22
But on a curve your slope is changing.
5:24
And just to get an intuition for that means, is, what's
5:27
the slope over here?
5:28
Your slope over here is the slope of the tangent line.
5:31
The line just barely touches it.
5:33
That's the slope over there.
5:34
It's a negative slope.
5:35
Then over here, your slope is still negative, but it's a
5:37
little bit less negative.
5:39
It goes like that.
5:40
I don't know if I did that, drew that.
5:41
Let me do it in a different color.
5:43
Let me do it in purple.
5:45
So over here, your slope is slightly less negative.
5:48
It's a slightly less downward-sloping line.
5:51
And then when you go over here, at the 0 point, right here,
5:56
your slope is pretty much flat, because the horizontal line, y
6:00
equals 0, is tangent to this curve.
6:02
And then as you go to more positive x's, then your
6:05
slope starts increasing.
6:08
I'm trying to draw a tangent line.
6:10
And here it's increasing even more, it's increased even more.
6:14
So your slope is changing the entire time, and this is kind
6:17
of the big change that happens when you go from a
6:19
line to a curve.
6:21
A line, your slope is the same the entire time.
6:24
You could take any two points of a line, take the change in y
6:27
over the change in x, and you get the slope for
6:29
the entire line.
6:30
But as you can see already, it's going to be a little
6:32
bit more nuanced when we do it for a curve.
6:35
Because it depends what point we're talking about.
6:37
We can't just say, what is the slope for this curve?
6:40
The slope is different at every point along the curve.
6:43
It changes.
6:44
If we go up here, it's going to be even steeper.
6:46
It's going to look something like that.
6:50
So let's try a bit of an experiment.
6:54
And I know how this experiment turns out, so it won't
6:57
be too much of a risk.
6:59
Let me draw better than that.
7:02
So that is my y-axis, and that's my x-axis.
7:11
Let's call this, we can call this y, or we can call
7:13
this the f of x axis.
7:15
Either way.
7:16
And let me draw my curve again.
7:20
And I'll just draw it in the positive coordinate, like that.
7:24
That's my curve.
7:26
And what if I want to find the slope right there?
7:33
What can I do?
7:34
Well, based on our definition of a slope, we need 2 points
7:38
to find a slope, right?
7:39
Here, I don't know how to find the slope with 1 point.
7:41
So let's just call this point right here,
7:49
that's going to be x.
7:50
We're going to be general.
7:51
This is going to be our point x.
7:53
But to find our slope, according to our traditional
7:55
algebra 1 definition of a slope, we need 2 points.
7:58
So let's get another point in here.
8:02
Let's just take a slightly larger version of this x.
8:05
So let's say, we want to take, actually, let's do it even
8:10
further out, just because it's going to get messy otherwise.
8:13
So let's say we have this point right here.
8:15
And the difference, it's just h bigger than x.
8:18
Or actually, instead of saying h bigger, let's just, well
8:20
let me just say h bigger.
8:22
So this is x plus h.
8:25
That's what that point is right there.
8:27
So what going to be their corresponding y-coordinates
8:30
on the curve?
8:31
Well, this is the curve of y is equal to f of x.
8:35
So this point right here is going to be f of our
8:39
particular x right here.
8:41
And maybe to show you that I'm taking a particular x, maybe
8:43
I'll do a little 0 here.
8:45
This is x naught, this is x naught plus h.
8:48
This is f of x naught.
8:51
And then what is this going to be up here, this point up
8:56
here, that point up here?
8:59
Its y-coordinate is going to be f of f of this x-coordinate,
9:04
which I shifted over a little bit.
9:05
It's right there. f of this x-coordinate, which is
9:08
f of x naught plus h.
9:10
That's its y-coordinate.
9:12
So what is a slope going to be between these two points that
9:15
are relatively close to each other?
9:17
Remember, this isn't going to be the slope
9:18
just at this point.
9:20
This is the slope of the line between these two points.
9:23
And if I were to actually draw it out, it would actually be a
9:27
secant line between, to the curve.
9:29
So it would intersect the curve twice, once at this point,
9:31
once at this point.
9:32
You can't see it.
9:34
If I blew it up a little bit, it would look
9:35
something like this.
9:41
This is our coordinate x naught f of x naught, and up here
9:47
is our coordinate for this point, which would be, the
9:51
x-coordinate would be x naught plus h, and the y-coordinate
9:56
would be f of x naught plus h.
9:59
Just whatever this function is, we're evaluating it at this
10:02
x-coordinate That's all it is.
10:03
So these are the 2 points.
10:05
So maybe a good start is to just say, hey, what is the
10:07
slope of this secant line?
10:10
And just like we did in the previous example, you find the
10:12
change in y, and you divide that by your change in x.
10:22
Let me draw it here.
10:23
Your change in y would be that right here, change in y, and
10:26
then your change in x would be that right there.
10:29
So what is the slope going to be of the secant line?
10:33
The slope is going to be equal to, let's start with this
10:37
point up here, just because it seems to be larger.
10:39
So we want a change in y. so this value right here, this
10:43
y-value, is f of x naught plus h.
10:46
I just evaluated this guy up here.
10:47
Looks like a fancy term, but all it means is, look.
10:49
The slightly larger x evaluate its y-coordinate.
10:52
Where the curve is at that value of x.
10:57
So that is going to be, so the change in y is going to be
11:00
a f of x naught plus h.
11:03
That's just the y-coordinate up here.
11:05
Minus this y-coordinate over here.
11:08
So minus f of x naught.
11:13
So that equals our change in y.
11:16
And you want to divide that by your change in x.
11:21
So what is this?
11:21
This is the larger x-value.
11:23
We started with this coordinate, so we start
11:25
with its x-coordinate.
11:26
So it's x naught plus h, x naught plus h.
11:30
Minus this x-coordinate.
11:32
Well, we just picked a general number.
11:33
It's x naught.
11:36
So that is over your change in x.
11:39
Just like that.
11:39
So this is the slope of the secant line.
11:41
We still haven't answered what the slope is right at that
11:43
point, but maybe this will help us get there.
11:47
If we simplify this, so let me write it down like this.
11:51
The slope of the secant, let me write that properly.
11:57
The slope of the secant line is equal to the value of the
12:03
function at this point, f of x naught plus h, minus the value
12:08
of the function here, mine f of x naught.
12:12
So that just tells us the change in y.
12:14
It's the exact same definition of slope we've always used.
12:18
Over the change in x.
12:19
And we can simplify this.
12:20
We have x naught plus h minus x naught.
12:23
So x naught minus x naught cancel out, so you
12:26
have that over h.
12:27
So this is equal to our change in y over change in x.
12:32
Fair enough.
12:33
But I started off saying, I want to find the slope of
12:36
the line at that point, at this point, right here.
12:38
This is the zoomed-out version of it.
12:40
So what can I do?
12:42
Well, I defined second point here as just the first
12:45
point plus some h.
12:49
And we have something in our toolkit called a limit.
12:52
This h is just a general number.
12:55
It could be 10, it could be 2, it could be 0.02, it could be 1
12:59
times 10 to the negative 100.
13:01
It could be an arbitrarily small number.
13:03
So what happens, what would happen, at least theoretically,
13:07
if I were take the limit as h approaches 0?
13:09
So, you know, first, maybe h is this fairly large number over
13:13
here, and then if I take h a little bit smaller, then I'd be
13:15
finding the slope of this secant line.
13:17
If I took h to be even a little bit smaller, I'd be finding the
13:20
slope of that secant line.
13:21
If h is a little bit smaller, I'd be finding
13:23
the slope of that line.
13:24
So as h approaches 0, I'll be getting closer and closer to
13:28
finding the slope of the line right at my point in question.
13:34
Obviously, if h is a large number, my secant line is going
13:36
to be way off from the slope at exactly that point right there.
13:41
But if h is 0.0000001, if it's an infinitesimally small
13:45
number, then I'm going to get pretty close.
13:47
So what happens if I take the limit as h
13:51
approaches zero of this?
13:53
So the limit as h approaches 0 of my secant slope.
14:00
Of, let me switch to green.
14:03
f of x naught plus h minus f of x naught, that was my change in
14:08
y, over h, which is my change in x.
14:15
And now just to clarify something, and sometimes you'll
14:17
see it in different calculus books, sometimes instead of an
14:20
h, they'll write a delta x here.
14:22
Where this second point would have been defined as x naught
14:25
plus delta x, and then, this would have simplified to just
14:28
delta x over there, and we'd be taking the limit as
14:30
delta x approaches 0.
14:31
The exact same thing.
14:33
h, delta x, doesn't matter.
14:34
We're taking h as the difference between one x point
14:37
and then the higher x point, and then we're just going to
14:39
take the limit as that approaches zero.
14:40
We could have called that delta x just as easily.
14:44
But I'm going to call this thing, which equals the slope
14:52
of the tangent line, and it does equal the slope of the
14:54
tangent line, I'm going to call this the derivative of f.
14:58
Let me write that down.
15:05
And I'm going to say that this is equal to f prime of x.
15:10
And this is going to be another function.
15:12
Because remember, the slope changes at every x-value.
15:16
No matter what x-value you pick, the slope is
15:18
going to be different.
15:19
Doesn't have to be, but the way I drew this curve,
15:20
it is different.
15:21
It can be different.
15:22
So now, you give me an x-value in here, I'll apply this
15:27
formula over here, and then I can tell you the
15:30
slope at that point.
15:31
And it all seems very confusing and maybe
15:34
abstract at this point.

We're told that Naomi lives at 2nd Avenue and 3rd

Street representing 2, 3 on the graph below.
0:08
Her school is it 4th Avenue and 10th street,
0:12
representing 4, 10 on the graph.
0:15
She walks over to 4th Avenue and up to 10th Street.
0:19
Plot her home and school on the map.
0:21
How many blocks does Naomi walk to school?
0:24
So let's plot her home first, 2nd Avenue and 3rd Street,
0:28
which they are giving us the coordinates 2, 3.
0:31
So the x-axis right over here, this
0:33
is representing the avenues.
0:35
And then the y-axis, or the vertical axis,
0:38
this represents the street.
0:40
So 2, 3.
0:41
So this right over here is 2nd Avenue and 3rd Street.
0:46
So you see here, we went to 2nd Avenue
0:48
and then we went up to 3rd Street.
0:50
This is where she lives at home.
0:51
We could have also said 3rd Street and 2nd Avenue.
0:55
Now her school is a 4th Avenue and 10th street.
0:59
And now we're going to go, so if we start at the origin,
1:01
we go to 4th Avenue and then go up 10 to 10th Street.
1:06
So this is the coordinate 4, 10.
1:09
So this is where our home is.
1:10
This is where a school is.
1:12
They say she walks over to 4th Avenue and up to 10th Street.
1:16
So she walks from 2nd Avenue to 4th Avenue
1:19
and then up to 10th Street.
1:21
How many blocks does Naomi walk to school?
1:24
Well as she walks from 2nd Avenue to 4th Avenue,
1:30
she's going to walk 2 blocks.
1:31
1 block and 2 blocks.
1:33
You shouldn't get confused by they're actually marking off
1:36
with these lines every half a block.
1:38
So that's 1 block to 3rd Avenue, 2 blocks to 4th Avenue.
1:42
So that's 2 blocks so far.
1:44
And then she goes from 3rd Street to 10th Street.
1:46
Well, if you go from 3rd Street to 10th Street,
1:48
that's going to be 7 more blocks.
1:50
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

Voiceover:Most of your mathematical lives
0:02
you've been studying real numbers.
0:04
Real numbers include things like zero, and one,
0:08
and zero point three repeating, and pi, and e,
0:15
and I could keep listing real numbers.
0:17
These are the numbers that you're
0:18
kind of familiar with.
0:20
Then we explored something interesting.
0:22
We explored the notion of what if
0:24
there was a number that if I squared it
0:26
I would get negative one.
0:28
We defined that thing that if we squared it
0:31
we got negative one, we defined that thing as i.
0:35
So we defined a whole new class of numbers
0:37
which you could really view as multiples
0:40
of the imaginary unit.
0:42
So imaginary numbers would be i and negative i,
0:47
and pi times i, and e times i.
0:52
This might raise another interesting question.
0:55
What if I combined imaginary and real numbers?
0:58
What if I had numbers that were essentially
1:00
sums or differences of real or imaginary numbers?
1:02
For example, let's say that I had the number.
1:06
Let's say I call it z,
1:08
and z tends to be the most used variable
1:11
when we're talking about
1:12
what I'm about to talk about, complex numbers.
1:15
Let's say that z is equal to,
1:19
is equal to the real number five plus
1:23
the imaginary number three times i.
1:28
So this thing right over here
1:29
we have a real number plus an imaginary number.
1:31
You might be tempted to add these two things,
1:33
but you can't.
1:34
They won't make any sense.
1:35
These are kind of going in different,
1:37
we'll think about it visually in a second,
1:39
but you can't simplify this anymore.
1:41
You can't add this real number
1:43
to this imaginary number.
1:44
A number like this, let me make it clear,
1:46
that's real and this is imaginary, imaginary.
1:51
A number like this we call a complex number,
1:56
a complex number.
2:00
It has a real part and an imaginary part.
2:02
Sometimes you'll see notation like this,
2:04
or someone will say what's the real part?
2:07
What's the real part of our complex number, z?
2:10
Well, that would be the five right over there.
2:13
Then they might say,
2:14
""Well, what's the imaginary part?
2:16
""What's the imaginary part of our complex number, z?
2:20
And then typically the way that this function
2:23
is defined they really want to know
2:25
what multiple of i is this imaginary part
2:28
right over here.
2:29
In this case it is going to be, it is going to be three.
2:34
We can visualize this.
2:35
We can visualize this in two dimensions.
2:38
Instead of having the traditional
2:39
two-dimensional Cartesian plane
2:42
with real numbers on the horizontal
2:44
and the vertical axis,
2:46
what we do to plot complex numbers
2:48
is we on the vertical axis we plot
2:52
the imaginary part, so that's the imaginary part.
2:56
On the horizontal axis we plot the real part.
2:59
We plot the real part just like that.
3:04
We plot the real part.
3:06
For example, z right over here
3:08
which is five plus three i,
3:09
the real part is five so we would go
3:12
one, two, three, four, five.
3:17
That's five right over there.
3:18
The imaginary part is three.
3:20
One, two, three, and so on the complex plane,
3:25
on the complex plane we would visualize
3:28
that number right over here.
3:31
This right over here is how we
3:33
would visualize z on the complex plane.
3:36
It's five, positive five in the real direction,
3:38
positive three in the imaginary direction.
3:41
We could plot other complex numbers.
3:43
Let's say we have the complex number a
3:46
which is equal to let's say it's negative two
3:50
plus i.
3:51
Where would I plot that?
3:53
Well, the real part is negative two,
3:55
negative two,
3:56
and the imaginary part is going to be
3:59
you could imagine this as plus one i
4:01
so we go one up.
4:02
It's going to be right over there.
4:04
That right over there is our complex number.
4:07
Our complex number a would be at that point
4:10
of the complex,
4:12
complex, let me write that,
4:14
that point of the complex plane.
4:17
Let me just do one more.
4:19
Let's say you had a complex number b
4:22
which is going to be,
4:24
let's say it is, let's say it's four minus three i.
4:29
Where would we plot that?
4:30
Well, one, two, three, four,
4:32
and then let's see minus one, two, three.

Our negative three gets us right over there.

khan_video_Llt-KkHugRQ_103606,How do I convert fractions to decimals?,MCQ,"•
0:00
Welcome to the presentation on ordering numbers.
0:04
Let's get started with some problems that I think, as you
0:06
go through the examples hopefully, you'll understand
0:09
how to do these problems.
0:10
So let's see.
0:11
The first set of numbers that we have to order is 35.7%,
0:23
108.1% 0.5, 13/93, and 1 and 7/68.
0:44
So let's do this problem.
0:46
The important thing to remember whenever you're doing this type
0:48
of ordering of numbers is to realize that these are all just
0:52
different ways to represent-- these are all a percent or a
0:56
decimal or a fraction or a mixed-- are all just different
1:00
ways of representing numbers.
1:02
It's very hard to compare when you just look at it like this,
1:05
so what I like to do is I like to convert them
1:07
all to decimals.
1:08
But there could be someone who likes to convert them all to
1:11
percentages or convert them all to fractions and then compare.
1:14
But I always find decimals to be the easiest way to compare.
1:16
So let's start with this 35.7%.
1:19
Let's turn this into a decimal.
1:21
Well, the easiest thing to remember is if you have a
1:25
percent you just get rid of the percent sign and
1:27
put it over 100.
1:28
So 35.7% is the same thing as 35.7/100.
1:38
Like 5%, that's the same thing as 5/100 or 50% is just
1:43
the same thing as 50/100.
1:45
So 35.7/100, well, that just equals 0.357.
1:53
If this got you a little confused another way to think
1:55
about percentage points is if I write 35.7%, all you have to do
2:01
is get rid of the percent sign and move the decimal to the
2:05
left two spaces and it becomes 0.357.
2:10
Let me give you a couple of more examples down here.
2:11
Let's say I had 5%.
2:16
That is the same thing as 5/100.
2:20
Or if you do the decimal technique, 5%, you could just
2:22
move the decimal and you get rid of the percent.
2:24
And you move the decimal over 1 and 2, and you put a 0 here.
2:28
It's 0.05.
2:30
And that's the same thing as 0.05.
2:33
You also know that 0.05 and 5/100 are the same thing.
2:36
So let's get back to the problem.
2:37
I hope that distraction didn't distract you too much.
2:40
Let me scratch out all this.
2:43
So 35.7% is equal to 0.357.
2:49
Similarly, 108.1%.
2:51
Let's to the technique where we just get rid of the percent and
2:54
move the decimal space over 1, 2 spaces to the left.
2:59
So then that equals 1.081.
3:08
See we already know that this is smaller than this.
3:11
Well the next one is easy, it's already in decimal form.
3:14
0.5 is just going to be equal to 0.5.
3:18
Now 13/93.
3:21
To convert a fraction into a decimal we just take the
3:24
denominator and divide it into the numerator.
3:27
So let's do that.
3:29
93 goes into 13?
3:36
Well, we know it goes into 13 zero times.
3:39
So let's add a decimal point here.
3:43
So how many times does 93 go into 130?
3:47
Well, it goes into it one time.
3:49
1 times 93 is 93.
3:55
Becomes a 10.
3:56
That becomes a 2.
3:58
Then we're going to borrow, so get 37.
4:03
Bring down a 0.
4:06
So 93 goes into 370?
4:10
Let's see.
4:10
4 times 93 would be 372, so it actually goes into
4:14
it only three times.
4:19
3 times 3 is 9.
4:22
3 times 9 is 27.
4:30
So this equals?
4:31
Let's see, this equals-- if we say that this 0 becomes a 10.
4:38
This become a 16.
4:39
This becomes a 2.
4:42
81.
4:45
And then we say, how many times does 93 go into 810?
4:48
It goes roughly 8 times.
4:50
And we could actually keep going, but for the sake of
4:52
comparing these numbers, we've already gotten to a pretty
4:55
good level of accuracy.
4:57
So let's just stop this problem here because the decimal
5:00
numbers could keep going on, but for the sake of comparison
5:02
I think we've already got a good sense of what this
5:04
decimal looks like.
5:05
It's 0.138 and then it'll just keep going.
5:10
So let's write that down.
5:13
And then finally, we have this mixed number here.
5:15
And let me erase some of my work because I don't
5:18
want to confuse you.
5:18
Actually, let me keep it the way it is right now.
5:22
The easiest way to convert a mixed number into a decimal is
5:26
to just say, OK, this is 1 and then some fraction
5:29
that's less than 1.
5:32
Or we could convert it to a fraction, an improper fraction
5:36
like-- oh, actually there are no improper fractions here.
5:38
Actually, let's do it that way.
5:39
Let's convert to an improper fraction and then convert
5:41
that into a decimal.
5:44
Actually, I think I'm going to need more space, so let me
5:46
clean up this a little bit.
5:58
There.
5:58
We have a little more space to work with now.
6:04
So 1 and 7/68.
6:08
So to go from a mixed number to an improper fraction, what you
6:13
do is you take the 68 times 1 and add it to the
6:18
numerator here.
6:19
And why does this make sense?
6:21
Because this is the same thing as 1 plus 7/68.
6:26
1 and 7/68 is the same thing as 1 plus 7/68.
6:29
And that's the same thing as you know from the fractions
6:32
module, as 68/68 plus 7/68.
6:40
And that's the same thing as 68 plus 7-- 75/68.
6:47
So 1 and 7/68 is equal to 75/68.
6:51
And now we convert this to a decimal using the technique
6:54
we did for 13/93.
6:56
So we say-- let me get some space.
6:58
We say 68 goes into 75-- suspicion I'm going
7:05
to run out of space.
7:07
68 goes into 75 one time.
7:09
1 times 68 is 68.
7:13
75 minus 68 is 7.
7:16
Bring down the 0.
7:17
Actually, you don't have to write the decimal there.
7:20
Ignore that decimal.
7:21
68 goes into 70 one time.
7:24
1 times 68 is 68.
7:28
70 minus 68 is 2, bring down another 0.
7:30
68 goes into 20 zero times.
7:33
And the problem's going to keep going on, but I think we've
7:36
already once again, gotten to enough accuracy that
7:38
we can compare.
7:40
So 1 and 7/68 we've now figured out is equal to 1.10-- and if
7:48
we kept dividing we'll keep getting more decimals of
7:51
accuracy, but I think we're now ready to compare.
7:53
So all of these numbers I just rewrote them as decimals.
7:56
So 35.7% is 0.357.
8:00
108.1%-- ignore this for now because we just used
8:05
that to do the work.
8:05
It's 108.1% is equal to 1.081.
8:09
0.5 is 0.5.
8:11
13/93 is 0.138.
8:15
And 1 and 7/68 is 1.10 and it'll keep going on.
8:20
So what's the smallest?
8:23
So the smallest is 0.-- actually, no.
8:26
The smallest is right here.
8:28
So I'm going to rank them from smallest to largest.
8:31
So the smallest is 0.138.
8:36
Then the next largest is going to be 0.357.
8:40
Then the next largest is going to be 0.5.
8:44
Then you're going to have 1.08.
8:47
And then you're going to have 1 and 7/68.
8:54
Well, actually, I'm going to do more examples of this, but for
8:56
this video I think this is the only one I have time for.
8:59
But hopefully this gives you a sense of doing these problems.
9:01
I always find it easier to go into the decimal
9:04
mode to compare.
9:05
And actually, the hints on the module will
9:06
be the same for you.
9:08
But I think you're ready at least now to try the problems.
9:11
If you're not, if you want to see other examples, you might
9:13
just want to either re-watch this video and/or I might
9:16
record some more videos with more examples right now.

0:58
is I'm going to multiply our vector, P
1:01
by a matrix and then the resulting product
1:04
is going to give me another position vector.
1:07

1:09

Let's do that right over here.
1:28
TxP, so first let's just make sure that
1:35

1:38

1:40

1:43
Let's just look at what T and P look like.

That is T and this is P right over here.
1:58
Can we multiply a 2x2 matrix
2:03
times a column vector like this,
2:06
which is essentially 2x1 matrix.
2:09
Well sure, as as we know
2:11
matrix multiplication is only defined,
2:13
or at least conventional matrix multiplication
2:14
is only defined if the first matrix number
2:19
of columns is equal to the number
2:24
of rows in the second matrix, right over here.
2:27
We see there, both of those are 2.
2:29
This is going to result in a 2x1 matrix.
2:34
This is going to result in a 2x1 matrix.

2:43
that this is another column vector.
2:45
This is another position vector.
2:46
You took this vector P,
2:48
multiplied it by this transformation vector
2:50
and we're gonna get another 2x1,
2:52

2:54
which we could plot.
2:55
What's essentially happened is
2:57
this transformation vector has moved,
2:59

3:02
It has given us a new point.
3:04
Let's think about what that is.

It's gonna deal with the second row here
3:37

-1x2 is -2, plus 2x1, which is 2.

-2+2 is just equal to 0.
3:52
Now, we have the position 5, 0,
3:55
which is right over here.
3:57
1,2,3,4,5
4:03
So, we started with this point,
4:05
this position vector, I guess you could say, P
4:08
As transformed it to this other position vector
4:11
and I guess we could call this P prime.
4:16
If you wanted to draw them as vectors,
4:18
this right over, kinda tradition vector form,
4:21
that right over there is P prime
4:24
and this right over here is P.
4:27
This right over here is P.
4:31
This is P actually, let me make sure there's a prime.
4:33
This is P prime
4:34
and the way we got from P to P prime
4:37
is using this transformation matrix.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Kh8HKAxdEyw,

0:00
We have 7,329 minus 6,278.
0:07
So let's go place by place and see if we can subtract.
0:10
6,278 is clearly less than 7,329,
0:15
so we should be able to do this.
0:17
So first, we go to the ones place.
0:18
We're subtracting an 8 from a 9.
0:21
That seems pretty straightforward.
0:22
That's just going to be a 1, a 1 in the ones place.
0:24
It literally just represents 1.
0:26
Then we go to the tens place.
0:28
And we're trying to subtract a 7 from a 2.
0:30
And this is really representing 70.
0:32
And this is really representing 20.
0:34
Well, now we're hitting a bit of a stumbling block.
0:37
So we're going to have to regroup or borrow.
0:39
And to understand what we're doing,
0:41
let's rewrite both of these numbers.
0:44
So 7,329-- 7 we can rewrite as being equal to 7,000.
0:52
Plus 300-- so this 3 in the hundreds place
0:56
is representing 300.
0:58
The 7 in the thousands place is 7,000.
1:00
3 in the hundreds place is 300.
1:03
The 2 in the tens place, that's two 10's, or 20.
1:07
And then the 9 in the ones place is just going to be 9.
1:11
So this is another way of representing 7,329.
1:16
And then down here, we have the 6 in the thousands place.
1:20
Well, that's going to be 6,000.
1:22
And we're subtracting, so minus 6,000.
1:25
And then here, we have a 2 in the hundreds place.
1:28
And once again, we're going to be subtracting all of these.
1:31
So we're going to be subtracting 200.
1:34
And then here in the tens place, we have our 7.
1:38
And we're subtracting it.
1:39
So seven 10's, that's 70.
1:41
And then we are subtracting that 8.
1:46
And what we've already done is said, hey, look.
1:51
Subtracting 8 from 9?
1:54
That's just going to be 1.
1:56
But then we got over here, and we said,
1:58
hey, how are we going to subtract 70 from 20?
2:01
And the key here is to regroup some of the value up here
2:04
and give it to the tens place, so
2:05
that we can subtract 70 from it.
2:08
And the most natural place to go is one place value above.
2:11
So we could take 100 from the 300.
2:18
So then it will become 200.
2:20
We're going to give 100-- we're going to give that 100
2:24
to the tens place.
2:26
So it is going to become 120.
2:31
Notice, 200 plus 120 is 320.
2:35
300 plus 20 is 320.
2:37
We have not changed the value of the number.
2:39
We've just changed what place we're representing it in.
2:42
If we wanted to do it here, we could say--
2:44
and when you think of it this way, this is really regrouping,
2:48
and this is really what's happening.
2:49
But if you want to think of it in a borrowing framework,
2:51
you could say, hey, let's take 1 from the 3.
2:55
Although it's a 300, so you're really taking 100.
2:57
That becomes a 2.
2:59
And you give that 1 to the tens place.
3:01
And so that becomes a 12.
3:05
Now, what was really happening is you took 100.
3:07
You gave it to the 20.
3:08
It became 120.
3:10
But now you can subtract.
3:11
Here, you'd say, well, what's 120 minus 70?
3:14
Well, 120 minus 70 is going to be 50.
3:17
Over here you could say, well, what's 12 minus 7?
3:20
Well, that's 5.
3:22
But it's still representing the same thing.
3:23
12 10's is 120.
3:25
Seven 10's is 70.
3:27
And they give you five 10's, which is the same thing as 50.
3:30
This 5 represents that 50.
3:33
And then we can go to the other places.
3:35
You say 2 minus 2.
3:36
Well, that's zero 100's.
3:37
And then 7,000 minus 6,000 is 1,000.
3:41
And once again, right over here, 200 minus 200 is zero 100's.
3:47
And then 7,000 minus 6,000 is 1,000.
3:52
So this is going to be 1,000 plus 0 plus 50
3:55
plus 1, which is the exact same thing as 1,051.
3:59
The important thing is to visualize--
4:01
you don't have to write this out every time.
4:03
But to make sure you visualize in your head
4:04
that this 3 is representing 300, that this 2 represents 20,
4:08
that when you're taking 100 from the 300,
4:11
then you would represent that as a 2 in the hundreds place.
4:14
And then when you give 100 to the tens place,
4:16
it's essentially that the two 10's will become 12 10's.
4:22
Because you're giving it 10 more 10's.
4:23
You're giving it 100.

0:00
We have the function f of x is equal to x minus
0:03
1 squared minus 2.
0:06
And they've constrained the domain to x being less
0:09
than or equal to 1.
0:10
So we have the left half of a parabola right here.
0:14
They've constrained so that it's not a full U parabola.
0:17
And I'll let you think about why that would make finding
0:20
the inverse difficult.
0:21
But let's try to find the inverse here.
0:23
And a good place to start -- let's just set y
0:25
being equal to f of x.
0:26
You could say y is equal to f of x or we could just
0:29
write that y is equal to x minus 1 squared minus 2.
0:35
We know it's 4.
0:37
x is less than or equal to 1.
0:39
But right now we have y solved for in terms of x.
0:45
Or we've solved for y, to find the inverse we're going to want
0:47
to solve for x in terms of y.
0:51
And we're going to constrain y similarly.
0:54
We could look at the graph and we could say, well, in this
0:56
graph right here, this is defined for y being greater
1:00
than or equal to negative 2.
1:02
So we can maybe put in parentheses y being greater
1:05
than or equal to negative 2.
1:07
Because this is going to be -- right now this is our range.
1:10
But when we swap the x's and y's, this is going
1:12
to be our domain.
1:13
So let's just keep that in parentheses right there.
1:16
So let's solve for x.
1:18
So that's all you have to do, to find the inverse.
1:20
Solve for x and make sure you keep track of the
1:22
domains and the ranges.
1:23
So, let's see.
1:24
We could add 2 to both sides of this equation.
1:26
We get y plus 2 is equal to x minus 1 squared.
1:32
Minus 2, plus 2, so those cancel out.
1:34
And then, I'm just going to switch to the y constraint.
1:37
Because now it's not clear what we're -- whether x is
1:41
the domain or the range.
1:42
But we know by the end of this problem, y is
1:43
going to be the domain.
1:44
So let's just swap this here.
1:46
So, 4 for y is greater than or equal to negative 2.
1:50
And we could also say, in parentheses, x is less than 1.
1:53
This is -- we haven't solved it explicitly for either one, so
1:55
we'll keep both of them around right now.
1:58
Now, to solve for x, you might be tempted to just take the
2:02
square root of both sides here.
2:04
And you wouldn't be completely wrong.
2:05
But we have to be very, very, very careful here.
2:07
And this might not be something that you've ever seen before.
2:11
So this is an interesting point here.
2:13
We want the right side to just be x minus 1.
2:19
That's our goal here, in taking the square root of both sides.
2:21
We want to just have an x minus 1 over there.
2:25
Now, is x minus 1 a positive or a negative number?
2:31
Well, we've constrained our x's to being less than 1.
2:35
So we're dealing only in a situation where x is
2:37
less than or equal to 1.
2:38
So if x is less than or equal to 1, this is negative.
2:44
This is negative.
2:48
So we want to take the negative square root.
2:50
Let me just be very clear here.
2:51
If I take negative 3 -- I take negative 3 and I were to square
2:56
it, that is equal to 9.
2:58
Now, if we take the square root of 9 -- if we take the square
3:02
root -- let's say we take the square root of both
3:04
sides of this equation.
3:05
And our goal is to get back to negative 3.
3:08
If we take the positive square root.
3:11
If we just take the principle root of both sides of that, we
3:16
would get 3 is equal to 3.
3:18
But that's not our goal.
3:19
We want to get back to negative 3.
3:21
So we want to take the negative square root of our square.
3:28
So because this expression is negative and we want to get
3:30
back to this expression, we want to get back to this x
3:33
minus 1, we need to take the negative square root
3:36
of both sides.
3:37
You can always -- every perfect square has a
3:39
positive or a negative root.
3:42
The principle root is a positive root.
3:44
But here we want to take the negative root because this
3:45
expression right here is going to be negative.
3:48
And that's what we want to solve for.
3:50
So let's take the negative root of both sides.
3:53
So you get the negative square root of y plus 2 is equal to
3:58
-- and I'll just write this extra step here, just so you
4:01
realize what we're doing.
4:02
Is equal to the negative square root, the negative square
4:06
root of x minus 1 squared.
4:11
For y is greater than or equal to negative 2.
4:15
And x is less than or equal to 1.
4:17
That's why the whole reason we're going to take the
4:18
negative square there.
4:20
And then this expression right here -- so let me
4:22
just write the left again.
4:24
Negative square root of y plus 2 is equal to the negative
4:29
square root of x minus 1 squared is just going
4:32
to be x minus 1.
4:34
It's just going to be x minus one.
4:36
x minus 1 squared is some positive quantity.
4:39
The negative root is the negative number that you
4:41
have to square to get it.
4:43
To get x minus 1 squared.
4:44
So that just becomes x minus 1.
4:46
Hopefully that doesn't confuse you too much.
4:48
We just want to get rid of this squared sign.
4:50
We want to make sure we get the negative version.
4:52
We don't want the positive version, which would
4:53
have been 1 minus x.
4:54
Don't want to confuse you.
4:56
So here, we now just have to solve for x.
4:58
Add 1.
4:58
And let me write the 4.
5:00
y is greater than or equal to negative 2.
5:04
Add 1 to both sides.
5:06
You get negative square root of y plus 2 plus 1 is equal to x
5:13
for y is greater than or equal to negative 2.
5:17
Or, if we want to rewrite it, we could say that x is equal to
5:21
the negative square root of y plus 2 plus 1 for y is greater
5:28
than or equal to negative 2.
5:29
Or if we want to write it in terms, as an inverse function
5:31
of y, we could say -- so we could say that f inverse of y
5:36
is equal to this, or f inverse of y is equal to the negative
5:42
square root of y plus 2 plus 1, for y is greater than
5:48
or equal to negative 2.
5:49
And now, if we wanted this in terms of x.
5:52
If we just want to rename y as x we just replace
5:55
the y's with x's.
5:56
So we could write f inverse of x -- I'm just
6:02
renaming the y here.
6:03
Is equal to the negative square root of x plus 2 plus 1 for,
6:09
I'm just renaming the y, for x is greater than or
6:12
equal to negative 2.
6:13
And if we were to graph this, let's see.
6:16
If we started at x is equal to negative 2, this is 0.
6:18
So the point negative 2, 1 is going to be on our graph.
6:22
So negative 2, 1 is going to be on our graph.
6:25
Let's see, if we go to negative 1, negative 1 this will
6:30
become a negative 1.
6:31
Negative 1 is 0 on our graph.
6:34
Negative 1, 0 is on our graph.
6:37
And then, let's see.
6:38
If we were to do, if we were to put x is equal to 2 here.
6:42
So x is equal to 2 is 4.
6:46
4 square root, principle root is 2.
6:48
It becomes a negative 2 So it becomes 2, negative 1.
6:52
So that's on our graph right there.
6:54
So the graph is going to look something like
6:55
this, of f inverse.
6:57
It's going to look something like that right there.
7:02
As you can see, it is a reflection of our original
7:05
f of x along the line y is equal to x.
7:08
Along the line y is equal to x.
7:13
Because we've essentially just swapped the x and the y.
7:16
This is about as hard of an inverse problem that
7:18
I expect you to see.
7:19
Especially in a precalculus class because it really is
7:22
tricky to realize that you have to take the negative
7:24
square root here.
7:25
Because the way our domain was constrained, this value right
7:28
here is going to be negative.

0:00
- [Voiceover] You have two fractions, 1/4 and 5/6,
0:04
and you want to rewrite them
0:05
so they have the same denominator
0:07
and have whole number numerators.
0:10
What numbers could you use for the denominator?
0:13
So here's our fractions, 1/4 and 5/6, and we want
0:17
to rewrite these fractions to have new denominators.
0:22
So we currently have a four and a six as our denominator,
0:26
and could we just pick any new thing, like maybe five?
0:28
Could we say, ""Let's change them both to have five
0:30
""as the denominator?""
0:32
The answer is no.
0:33
We have to pick a multiple of four and six, a multiple,
0:37
some number that we can multiply four
0:41
and get this number as an answer.
0:45
So for example, for four, some multiples of four
0:50
would be four times one is four,
0:53
four times two is eight,
0:55
four times three is 12, and so on.
0:58
Those are multiples of four.
1:02
And let's just pause here and look at why we have
1:04
to pick a multiple of four and six,
1:07
why we can't just pick any number
1:09
but we have to pick a multiple of our denominators.
1:14
So the fraction we were just talking about was 1/4.
1:17
We could look at either one, but let's look at 1/4.
1:20
Here we have a picture showing fourths.
1:24
And to show 1/4,
1:26
we shade one of these four equal-size pieces.
1:31
Maybe I wanna change this and I wanna say,
1:33
""I want two, I want two as my numerator.""
1:36
So to have a numerator of two,
1:40
I'm gonna need to split this fourth up here into two pieces.
1:45
Now I have two shaded pieces.
1:47
So can I say this is two, one, two,
1:50
out of one, two, three, four, five pieces?
1:54
It's not 2/5 because these are not equal-size pieces.
1:58
So if I split this fourth right here in half,
2:00
I need to split all of them in half.
2:03
And what I'm doing is doubling
2:06
the amount of pieces.
2:10
So now this is two pieces, this is two, and this is two,
2:14
because we need equal-size pieces.
2:16
So now, this is one, two pieces out of one, two,
2:20
three, four, five, six, seven, eight equal-size pieces.
2:24
So 2/8.
2:27
And you can see, eight is a multiple of four
2:30
because we multiplied by two, and that's what we did.
2:32
We multiplied each of our pieces by two.
2:36
We also multiplied our numerator by two
2:38
because that was also doubled.
2:40
The amount of shaded pieces doubled
2:42
when the entire amount of pieces doubled.
2:45
Now, we don't have to do this just with two.
2:47
We could do any multiple of four.
2:49
For example, we can do one more here.
2:54
If we, again, let's shade 1/4,
2:58
one of the four pieces.
3:01
And maybe this time we wanna split it
3:03
into three equal-size pieces.
3:08
So to have a new numerator of three,
3:10
and these should be equal-sized,
3:13
here's a numerator of three.
3:17
But we can't do our denominator yet
3:20
because we don't have equal-size pieces.
3:23
So to get equal-size pieces we'll need
3:25
to split each of these fourths into three.
3:31
So we are tripling the amount of pieces.
3:36
So now we have three shaded pieces out of a total
3:40
of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
3:43
nine, 10, 11, 12,
3:46
out of 12.
3:48
And I could have figured that out without even counting
3:50
because I knew that we tripled.
3:53
This time we multiplied
3:57
our original denominator times three, we tripled.
4:00
And we also multiplied our numerator times three.
4:05
So these are the multiples, eight, 12, and so on,
4:08
and so those are the denominators we can pick,
4:10
something that we can multiply our denominator by
4:15
so we can multiply the entire amount of pieces.
4:20
And again, so this is super clear, 1/4 and 2/8 and 3/12,
4:24
they all represent the same amount,
4:27
whether we had 1/4, the original, here's 2/8, 3/12,
4:30
they're all equivalent.
4:32
They all represent the same amount.
4:34
They're just different ways of writing the same number.
4:39
Back to our original question,
4:41
what denominators can we use for fourths and for sixths?
4:46
We know we need to use multiples,
4:48
so let's look at the multiples.
4:50
For four, we've already gone through some of these.
4:53
The first multiple of four is four times one,
4:55
which is four.
4:57
Second multiple of four is eight.
4:59
Four times two is eight, so we could split our fourths
5:02
in half and get eighths.
5:04
Or we could say four times three is 12,
5:08
which we showed again where we split our fourths,
5:10
each fourth into three equal pieces.
5:14
Or we could do four times four which is 16.
5:17
Four times five is 20,
5:19
four times six is 24, and so on.
5:24
The reason I'm stopping at 24 is I've looked
5:26
at my answer choices and I can see the largest possible
5:30
answer is 24, so I don't need
5:32
to write any larger multiples.
5:34
There are many, many, many more multiples of four,
5:37
but we don't need to list them all
5:38
'cause the largest number we're gonna have
5:40
to consider is 24.
5:43
Let's do the same for sixths.
5:45
We could leave our sixths alone, six times one,
5:48
and keep six pieces.
5:50
Or we could double our sixths.
5:52
Six times two would be 12,
5:53
if we doubled the pieces we would have 12 pieces.
5:56
We could say six times three, which is 18,
5:59
or six times four, we could divide each
6:01
of our sixths into four pieces,
6:03
and we'd have six times four which is 24 or 24ths.
6:09
And so on, again, I'll stop at 24
6:11
since it's the largest number we need to consider.
6:15
So down to our answer choices,
6:17
what numbers could we use for the denominator?
6:20
Could we use eight?
6:21
Let's look at these lists.
6:23
Eight is a multiple of four, so we could definitely split
6:27
fourths into eighths, but eight is not a multiple of six,
6:31
so we can not split sixths into eighths.
6:35
So...
6:36
Eight will not work as a denominator for both fractions.
6:42
How about 12?
6:44
12 we can see is a multiple of four, and we showed that,
6:47
we drew that already.
6:49
And 12 is a multiple of six,
6:51
we could split our sixths into two equal pieces each
6:53
and we would have 12ths.
6:55
So 12 does work, 12 is a denominator,
6:59
a common denominator for fourths and sixths.
7:03
18, 18 is here on the sixths.
7:06
We could split sixths into 18
7:08
because 18 is a multiple of six,
7:10
but it is not a multiple of four.
7:13
So we can rule out 18, 18 is not a common denominator.
7:17
And 24, you may remember, was the last number
7:21
we wrote on both of them.
7:22
So yes, 24 could be a denominator
7:26
for fourths and sixths.
7:28
So we could use either 12 or 24,
7:31
and there's a lot more numbers we could use too
7:33
as common denominators, but from these choices
7:36
we could use 12 or 24 as a common denominator
7:40
for fourths and sixths.
7:43
And just a note, lots of times people like
7:45
to use the smallest one, the least common denominator,
7:48
which in this case is 12.
7:50
And it makes a lot of sense because it's easier
7:52
to do computation with smaller numbers,
7:54
but you don't absolutely have to use the smallest one.
7:58
You could use 12ths or 24ths or lots of other options.
8:02
But again, 12ths is probably the simplest one
8:05
to work with just 'cause generally it's easier
8:07
to work with smaller numbers.
8:10
But for this question, the common denominators
8:12
we can use from these choices
8:14
for fourths and sixths are 12 and 24.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,T8U7hCmUdpo,

Identify the x and y-intercepts of the line
0:03
y is equal to 3x minus 9.
0:06
Then graph the line.
0:09
So the x-intercept, I'll just abbreviate it
0:11
as x-int, that is where the line intersects the x-axis.
0:15
So where it intersects the x-axis.
0:17
Remember, this horizontal axis is the x-axis.
0:20
So when something intersects the x-axis,
0:22
what do we know about its coordinate?
0:24
Its x-value could be anything, but we know it's y-value is 0.
0:28
If we're intersecting, if we're sitting
0:29
on the x-axis someplace, that means
0:32
that we haven't moved in the y-direction.
0:34
That means that y is 0.
0:36
So this means, literally, that y is 0.
0:39
So we need to find the x-value defined
0:42
by this relationship when y is equal to 0.
0:45
Similarly, when we talk about the y-intercept,
0:47
I'll do it down here-- when we talk
0:49
about the y-intercept, what does that mean?
0:52
Well, y-intercept means-- so this
0:53
is the y-axis right over here running up and down.
0:56
The y-intercept is the point at which
0:58
the line intercepts the y-axis.
1:01
So what's going on?
1:02
If we're at the y-axis, our y-value
1:04
could be anything depending on where we intersect the y-axis.
1:07
But we know that we haven't moved to the right or the left.
1:10
We know that our x-value is 0 at the y-intercept.
1:14
So over here, our x-value is going to be 0.
1:17
And to find the actual point, we just
1:19
have to find the corresponding y-value defined
1:21
by this relationship or this equation.
1:24
So let's do the first one first.
1:25
The x-intercept is when y is equal to 0.
1:28
So we set y is equal to 0, and then we'll solve for x.
1:31
So we get 0 is equal to 3x minus 9.
1:34
We can add 9 to both sides of this equation
1:37
to isolate the x-term.
1:39
So we get 9 is equal to 3x.
1:42
These cancel out.
1:43
We could divide both sides by 3.
1:46
Divide both sides by 3.
1:48
We get 3 is equal to x or x is equal to 3.
1:52
So the point y is equal to 0, x is equal to 3 is on this line.
1:56
And let me put it in order.
1:58
x-coordinate always goes first.
1:59
So it's 3 comma 0.
2:02
So this is the origin.
2:03
1, 2, 3 is right over here.
2:06
That is 3 comma 0.
2:08
This right here is the x-intercept.
2:12
And remember, notice that point lies on the x-axis,
2:15
but the y-value is 0.
2:17
We haven't moved up or down.
2:18
When you think x-intercept, you say, OK,
2:20
that means my y-value is 0.
2:22
So I have to solve for the x-value.
2:24
Now we do the opposite for the y-intercept.
2:26
And the y-intercept, we're sitting on this line,
2:29
x-value must be 0.
2:30
So let's figure out what y is equal to when x is equal to 0.
2:34
So y is equal to-- I want to do it in that pink color.
2:37
y is equal to-- y is equal to 3 times-- x is 0 now.
2:42
3 times 0 minus 9.
2:44
Well, 3 times 0 is just 0.
2:46
So 0 minus 9.
2:47
Well that's, just equal to negative 9.
2:49
So we have the point 0 comma negative 9.
2:52
So when x is 0, we go down 9 for y.
2:57
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
3:04
So right there is the point 0 comma negative 9.
3:08
Notice, it sits on the y-axis.
3:10
That's why it's the y-intercept.
3:12
And the x-value is 0.
3:13
We haven't moved to the left or right.
3:15
All you need is two points for a line,
3:17
so we're now ready to graph.
3:18
We essentially just have to connect the dots.
3:20
So it's going to look something like this.
3:22
It's going to look something-- our line.
3:25
I don't have a good line tool, so I'm

You want to do a straight line.

So it just keeps going on and on and on like that.

It just keeps going.
3:45
And I could keep going all the way in that direction,
3:47
and then-- but then my line doesn't look as straight all
3:50
of a sudden.
3:50
I think you get the general idea.

- [Voiceover] When we observe the physical world
0:12
we find random fluctuations everywhere.
0:21
We can generate truly random numbers
0:24
by measuring random fluctuations, known as noise.
0:28
When we measure this noise, known as sampling,
0:32
we can obtain numbers.
0:34
- [Voiceover] One, two, three, four--
0:36
- [Voiceover] For example, if we measure
0:37
the electric current of TV static over time,
0:40
we will generate a truly random sequence.
0:45
We can visualize this random sequence
0:47
by drawing a path that changes direction
0:50
according to each number, known as a random walk.
0:54
Notice the lack of pattern at all scales.
0:57
At each point in the sequence
0:59
the next move is always unpredictable.
1:03
Random processes are said to be nondeterministic,
1:07
since they are impossible to determine in advance.
1:11
Machines, on the other hand, are deterministic.
1:14
Their operation is predictable and repeatable.
1:18
In 1946, John von Neumann was involved
1:20
in running computations for the military;
1:23
specifically involved in the design of the hydrogen bomb.
1:29
Using a computer called the ENIAC,
1:31
he planned to repeatedly calculate approximations
1:33
of the processes involved in nuclear fission.
1:37
However, this required quick access
1:38
to randomly generated numbers
1:40
that could be repeated, if needed.
1:43
However, the ENIAC had very limited internal memory;
1:46
storing long random sequences was not possible.
1:50
So, Neumann developed an algorithm
1:52
to mechanically simulate the scrambling aspect
1:55
of randomness as follows:
1:58
First, select a truly random number, called the ""seed"".
2:02
This number could come from the measurement of noise,
2:04
or the current time in milliseconds.
2:07
Next, this seed is provided as input
2:09
to a simple calculation.
2:12
Multiply the seed by itself,
2:14
and then output the middle of this result.
2:18
Then you use this output as the next seed,
2:20
and repeat the process as many times as needed.
2:26
This is known as the middle-squares method
2:28
and is just the first in a long line
2:30
of pseudorandom number generators.
2:34
The randomness of the sequence is dependent on
2:36
the randomness of the initial seed only.
2:39
Same seed, same sequence.
2:41
So, what are the differences between
2:43
a randomly generated versus
2:45
pseudorandomly generated sequence?
2:51
Let's represent each sequence as a random walk.
2:58
They seem similar until we speed things up.
3:02
The pseudorandom sequence must eventually repeat.
3:06
This occurs when the algorithm reaches a seed
3:09
it has previously used, and the cycle repeats.
3:13
The length, before a pseudorandom sequence repeats,
3:16
is called ""the period"".
3:19
The period is strictly limited
3:21
by the length of the initial seed.
3:24
For example, if we use a two-digit seed,
3:27
then an algorithm can produce, at most,
3:29
100 numbers, before reusing a seed
3:32
and repeating the cycle.
3:34
A three-digit seed can't expand past 1,000 numbers
3:38
before repeating its cycle,
3:40
and a four-digit seed can't expand
3:43
past 10,000 numbers before repeating.
3:46
Though if we use a seed large enough,
3:49
the sequence can expand
3:50
into trillions and trillions of digits before repeating.
3:57
Though the key difference is important.
3:59
When you generate numbers pseudorandomly,
4:02
there are many sequences which cannot occur.
4:06
For example, if Alice generates a truly random sequence
4:09
of 20 shifts, it's equivalent to a uniform selection
4:14
from the stack of all possible sequences of shifts.
4:17
This stack contains 26 to the power of 20 pages,
4:21
which is astronomical in size.
4:24
If we stood at the bottom and shined a light upwards,
4:27
a person at the top would not see the light
4:30
for around 200,000,000 years.
4:33
Compare this to Alice generating
4:35
a 20 digit pseudorandom sequence,
4:37
using a four-digit random seed.
4:40
Now, this is equivalent to a uniform selection
4:43
from 10,000 possible initial seeds,
4:47
meaning she can only generate
4:49
10,000 different sequences,
4:52
which is a vanishingly small fraction
4:55
of all possible sequences.
4:57
When we move from random to pseudorandom shifts,
5:00
we shrink the key space into
5:03
a much, much smaller seed-space.
5:06
So, for a pseudorandom sequence to be indistinguishable
5:10
from a randomly generated sequence,
5:12
it must be impractical for a computer
5:15
to try all seeds and look for a match.
5:19
This leads to an important distinction
5:21
in computer science, between what is possible,
5:24
versus what is possible in a reasonable amount of time.
5:29
We use the same logic when we buy a bike lock.
5:32
We know that anybody can simply try
5:34
all possible combinations,
5:35
until they find a match and it opens.
5:38
But it would take them days to do so.
5:40
So, for eight hours we assume it's practically safe.
5:46
With pseudorandom generators,
5:48
the security increases as the length of the seed increases.
5:54
If the most powerful computer would take
5:56
hundreds of years to run through all seeds,
5:59
then we safely can assume it's practically secure,
6:04
instead of perfectly secure.
6:07
As computers get faster
6:09
the seed size must increase accordingly.
6:14
Pseudorandomness frees Alice and Bob
6:16
from having to share their
6:18
entire random shift sequence in advance.
6:22
Instead, they share a relatively short random seed,
6:25
and expand it into the same
6:27
random-looking sequence when needed.
6:31
But what happens if they can never meet
6:33
to share this random seed?",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,GtOt7EBNEwQ,

0:00
I've been doing a ton of videos on the mechanics of
0:03
taking the Laplace Transform, but you've been sitting
0:06
through them always wondering, what am I learning this for?
0:09
And now I'll show you, at least in the context of
0:12
differential equations.
0:13
And I've gotten a bunch of letters
0:16
on the Laplace Transform.
0:17
What does it really mean?
0:18
And and all that.
0:19
And those are excellent questions and you should
0:21
strive for that.
0:22
It's hard to really have an intuition of the Laplace
0:25
Transform in the differential equations context, other than
0:28
it being a very useful tool that converts differential or
0:32
integral problems into algebra problems. But I'll give you a
0:36
hint, and if you want a path to learn it in, you should
0:39
learn about Fourier series and Fourier Transforms, which are
0:42
very similar to Laplace Transforms. And that'll
0:44
actually build up the intuition on what the
0:48
frequency domain is all about.
0:50
Well anyway, let's actually use the Laplace Transform to
0:53
solve a differential equation.
0:54
And this is one we've seen before.
0:56
So let me see.
0:59
So let's say the differential equation is y prime prime,
1:03
plus 5, times the first derivative, plus
1:07
6y, is equal to 0.
1:09
And you know how to solve this one, but I just want to show
1:10
you, with a fairly straightforward differential
1:13
equation, that you could solve it with the Laplace Transform.
1:15
And actually, you end up having a
1:17
characteristic equation.
1:19
And the initial conditions are y of 0 is equal to 2, and y
1:27
prime of 0 is equal to 3.
1:32
Now, to use the Laplace Transform here, we essentially
1:36
just take the Laplace Transform of both sides of
1:38
this equation.
1:40
Let me use a more vibrant color.
1:42
So we get the Laplace Transform of y the second
1:47
derivative, plus-- well we could say the Laplace
1:51
Transform of 5 times y prime, but that's the same thing as 5
1:53
times the Laplace Transform-- y prime.
1:59
y prime plus 6 times the Laplace Transform of y.
2:06
And let me ask you a question.
2:06
What's the Laplace Transform of 0?
2:09
Let me do that.
2:11
So the Laplace Transform of 0 would be be the integral from
2:12
0 to infinity, of 0 times e to the minus stdt.
2:19
So this is a 0 in here.
2:20
So this is equal to 0.
2:21
So the Laplace Transform of 0 is 0.
2:23
And that's good, because I didn't have space to do
2:25
another curly L.
2:28
So what are the Laplace Transforms of these things?
2:30
Well this is where we break out one of the useful
2:33
properties that we learned.
2:36
Let me write it over here.
2:37
I think that's going to need as much
2:40
real estate as possible.
2:42
Let me erase this.
2:48
So we learned that the Laplace Transform-- I'll do it here.
2:52
Actually, I'll do it down here.
2:54
The Laplace Transform of f prime, or we could even say y
3:01
prime, is equal to s times the Laplace Transform of
3:08
y, minus y of 0.
3:13
We proved that to you.
3:15
And this is extremely important to know.
3:19
So let's see if we can apply that.
3:20
So the Laplace Transform of y prime prime, if we apply that,
3:23
that's equal to s times the Laplace Transform of-- well if
3:33
we go from y prime to y, you're just taking the
3:35
anti-derivative, so if you're taking the anti-derivative of
3:37
y, of the second derivative, we just end up with the first
3:40
derivative-- minus the first derivative at 0.
3:45
Notice, we're already using our initial conditions.
3:48
I won't substitute it just yet.
3:51
And then we end up with plus 5, times-- I'll write it every
3:56
time-- so plus 5 times the Laplace Transform of y prime,
4:07
plus 6 times the Laplace Transform of y.
4:12
All of that is equal to 0.
4:13
So just to be clear, all I did is I expanded this into this
4:20
using this.
4:22
So how can we rewrite the Laplace Transform of y prime?
4:25
Well, we could use this once again, so let's do that.
4:27
So this over here-- I'll do it in magenta-- this is equal to
4:31
s times what?
4:34
s times the Laplace Transform of y prime.
4:38
Well that's s times the Laplace Transform of y, minus
4:48
y of 0, right?
4:52
I took this part and replaced it with what I have in
4:55
parentheses.
4:56
So minus y prime of 0-- and now I'll switch colors-- plus
5:05
5 times-- once again the Laplace Transform of y prime.
5:09
Well we can use this again.
5:10
So 5 times s times Laplace Transform of y, minus y of 0,
5:24
plus 6 times the Laplace Transform-- oh I ran out of
5:27
space, I'll do it in another line-- plus 6 times the
5:31
Laplace Transform of y.
5:34
All of that is equal to 0.
5:35
I know this looks really confusing but we'll
5:36
simplify right now.
5:37
And we could get rid of this right here, because we've used
5:39
it as much as we need to.
5:42
So now we just simplify.
5:45
And notice, using the Laplace Transform, we didn't have to
5:46
guess at a general solution or anything like that.
5:49
Even when we did a characteristic equation, we
5:50
guessed what the original general solution was.
5:53
Now we're just taking Laplace Transforms, and let's see
5:54
where this gets us.
5:57
And actually I just want to make clear, because I know
5:59
it's very confusing, so I rewrote this part as this.
6:09
And I rewrote this thing as this.
6:14
And everything else is the same.
6:15
But now let's simplify the math.
6:17
So we get s squared, times the Laplace Transform of y-- I'm
6:23
going to write smaller, I've learned my lesson-- minus s
6:28
times y of 0.
6:32
Let's substitute y of 0 here. y of 0 is 2, so s times y of 0
6:35
is 2 times s, so 2s, distribute that s, minus y
6:41
prime of 0.
6:42
Y prime of 0 is 3.
6:44
So minus 3, plus-- so we have 5 times s times the Laplace
6:52
Transform of y, so plus 5s times the Laplace Transform of
6:58
y, minus 5 times y of 0. y of 0 is 2, so minus 10.
7:07
Minus 10, right?
7:08
5 times-- this is 2 right here-- so 5 times 2, plus 6
7:14
times the Laplace Transform of y.
7:18
All of that is equal to 0.
7:22
Now, let's group our Laplace Transform of y terms and our
7:26
constant terms, and we should be hopefully
7:28
getting some place.
7:30
So let's see, my Laplace Transform of y terms, I have
7:33
this one, I have this one, and I have that one.
7:39
So what am I left with?
7:40
Well let me factor out the Laplace Transform of y part.
7:43
So I get the Laplace Transform of y-- and that's good because
7:47
it's a pain to keep writing it over and over-- times s
7:50
squared plus 5s plus 6.
8:02
So those are all my Laplace Transform terms. And then I
8:05
have my constant terms. So let's see, I have 1s, so minus
8:09
2s, minus 3, minus 10, is equal to 0.
8:20
And what can we do here?
8:21
Well, this is interesting, first of all.
8:23
Notice that the coefficients on the Laplace Transform of y
8:28
terms, that those are that characteristic equation that
8:31
we dealt with so much, and that is hopefully, to some
8:33
degree, second nature to you.
8:34
So that's a little bit of a clue, and if you want some
8:38
very tenuous connections, well that makes a lot of sense.
8:40
Because the characteristic equation to get that, we
8:43
substituted e to the rt, and the Laplace Transform involves
8:47
very similar function.
8:48
But anyway, let's go back to the problem.
8:49
So how do we solve this?
8:51
And actually, let me just give you the big picture here,
8:53
because this is a good point.
8:54
What I'm going to do is I'm going to solve this.
8:56
I'm going to say the Laplace Transform of
8:58
y is equal to something.
9:00
And then I'm going to say, boy, what functions the
9:03
Laplace Transform is at something?
9:05
And then I'll have the solution.
9:06
If that confuses you, just wait and hopefully it'll make
9:09
some sense.
9:09
From here until that point it's just some
9:11
fairly hairy algebra.
9:13
So let's scroll down a little bit, just so we have some
9:16
breathing room.
9:17
And so I get the Laplace Transform of y, times s
9:23
squared, plus 5s, plus 6, is equal to-- let's add these
9:29
terms to both sides of this equation-- is equal to 2s plus
9:34
3 plus 10-- oh, that's silly-- plus 13.
9:40
This is minus 13 here.
9:42
A phone call.
9:44
Who's calling?
9:45
I think it's some kind of marketing phone call.
9:48
Anyway, 2s plus 13, and now what can I do?
9:51
Well.
9:51
Let's divide both sides by this s squared plus 5s plus 6.
9:55
So I get the Laplace Transform of y is equal to 2s plus 13,
10:08
over s squared plus 5s plus 6.
10:13
Now we're almost done.
10:15
Everything here is just a little bit of algebra.
10:17
So now we're almost done.
10:19
We haven't solved for y yet, but we know that the Laplace
10:21
Transform of y is equal to this.
10:23
Now, if we just had this in our table of our Laplace
10:27
Transforms, we would immediately know what y was,
10:29
but I don't see something, or I don't remember anything we
10:31
did in our table that looks like this expression of s.
10:35
I'm essentially out of time, so the next video we're going
10:39
to figure out what functions Laplace Transform is this.
10:42
And it actually turns out it's a sum of things we already
10:45
know, and we just have to manipulate this a little bit
10:47
algebraically.

0:01
- [Voiceover] Let's say that this is a red blood cell.
0:04
What makes up the outer layer of this red blood cell?
0:08
Since it's a cell, it has a cell membrane,
0:11
and that's made up of lipids.
0:13
But embedded in those lipids, there's all kinds of proteins
0:16
and molecules, some of which I'm drawing here,
0:20
that have all kinds of different functions.
0:23
There are two of them that are sort of
0:25
more important than the others,
0:26
at least for this topic that we're going to talk about,
0:28
and those are the A molecule and the B molecule.
0:34
I think you'll be pretty happy with those names,
0:36
not too hard to remember.
0:38
I'm actually calling them molecules and not proteins
0:40
because they're actually not proteins.
0:43
They are actually something called glycolipids,
0:47
which I actually didn't realize at first.
0:50
Glycolipids, glyco meaning a sugar group,
0:54
lipid meaning a fat group,
0:55
so it's some kind of mix of a sugar and fat.
0:58
You can look it up if you're interested.
1:04
What's interesting, is that not all people
1:05
have both of these molecules, these glycolipids,
1:09
on their red blood cells.
1:11
Some people do have both, but some have only one.
1:16
For example, some people might have only the A,
1:20
or, as you can imagine, some people would have only the B,
1:23
and some people, can you figure out the last possibility?
1:28
Some people have neither A nor B.
1:31
Of course, all these people have all kinds of other
1:34
proteins and molecules embedded in their red blood cells.
1:41
The reason why we care about this
1:42
and why I'm talking about these As and these Bs,
1:45
is that in medicine, we often
1:47
have to give blood transfusions.
1:50
Let's say you got in a car accident
1:51
and you lost a lot of blood.
1:53
You're rushed to the hospital.
1:54
If you've lost enough blood,
1:56
they'll give you a transfusion of blood.
1:58
Transfusion just means they'll put a needle in your vein
2:00
and pump blood into your veins.
2:03
It turns out that you can't just give any blood to anyone,
2:06
and it has to do with these A and B groups.
2:10
For example, it turns out, and we'll explain this,
2:13
but for example, it turns out that if you
2:16
are the kind of person who has this kind of blood
2:18
that only has As on your blood cells,
2:22
then it turns out that you can't get a blood transfusion
2:24
from someone who has this kind of blood, As and Bs.
2:29
Let's learn why.
2:31
If you remember from the immune system,
2:33
there's something called an antibody.
2:34
We usually draw it in this shape here.
2:37
If you remember from the immune system,
2:39
your body has something called antibodies,
2:43
and it uses these antibodies to fight things
2:45
that it doesn't want in the body.
2:48
For example, if you have a bacterium,
2:50
I'm drawing one here, you'll have an antibody
2:53
that will bind to that bacterium.
2:54
The purpose of that is that now your body knows
2:57
that is should destroy this bacterium.
3:00
This antibody is kind of like a tag
3:02
that marks this guy for destruction.
3:06
But your body is very careful not to make
3:08
antibodies against itself, which is obvious, right?
3:12
If your body made antibodies against itself,
3:14
then it would start to attack itself.
3:17
For that reason, someone who has this kind of blood,
3:20
which means that all of their red blood cells
3:22
have As and Bs on them, that person
3:26
would not want to make antibodies against
3:29
the A and the B molecule, because if they did
3:31
then their body would attack all of their red blood cells.
3:35
These people don't have these antibodies.
3:38
But, let's say if you have this kind of blood,
3:41
then you might not make an antibody against
3:45
the A molecule, but you can make it against
3:48
the B molecule, because the B is not in your body,
3:52
and so there's no risk that your body is going to attack
3:54
itself by making an antibody against the B molecule.
3:59
So these guys don't have the A antibody,
4:02
but they do have the B antibody.
4:04
These guys, on the other hand,
4:06
they can have the A antibody,
4:08
but they don't want the B antibody
4:10
because then they would attack themselves.
4:13
This final guy, can you guess what he has?
4:16
He can actually have both A and B antibodies.
4:20
He actually will have both,
4:22
because that's the way your immune system works.
4:24
It makes antibodies against pretty much anything
4:27
that is not you, that is not yourself.
4:30
A and B molecules are not part of this guy.
4:33
He has none of them, so he'll make antibodies against them.
4:36
Let me ask you, what would happen if this guy,
4:41
someone with just A blood, type A blood,
4:44
got in a car accident and needed a transfusion?
4:47
Let's say they're rushed to the hospital
4:48
and you give them blood from someone with A and B molecules.
4:54
What would happen is that this guy's antibodies
4:56
again B would go and bind to the B molecules
5:01
on the blood that he's just received,
5:03
and then his body would start to destroy
5:05
all of these cells that he just received.
5:08
That's bad because, first of all, it's a waste.
5:11
You gave this guy blood
5:12
and now he's just going to destroy it.
5:13
But second of all, it's going to cause a huge
5:15
amount of inflammation, because this guy's body
5:18
is going to suddenly see all these antigens
5:21
that he thinks are really dangerous,
5:23
and it's going to cause his whole immune system
5:25
to rev up, and that will actually be bad for him.
5:29
Let's go through all the different possible transfusions
5:32
between these different kinds of people.
5:35
Let's go through them methodically by drawing a table.
5:39
On one side of the table we'll have the donors.
5:44
Bear with me as I draw this table out.
5:46
We'll have AB donor, A donor, type B donor,
5:51
and do you know what we call this kind of blood?
5:53
We can't call it type B or type A
5:55
because that's these guys,
5:56
so we actually call this O, type O.
6:00
Then we also have the same guys as possible recipients,
6:05
so we have type AB blood recipient,
6:07
type A blood recipient, type B blood recipient,
6:10
and type O blood recipient.
6:13
Let's make this into a table.
6:19
Here are our donors, blood donors,
6:24
and here are our blood recipients.
6:31
What did we say before?
6:32
We said that someone with type A blood
6:35
cannot receive blood from someone with type AB blood.
6:39
So that means that A recipient with AB donor is no good.
6:45
Well, how about someone with AB blood?
6:48
Can they receive blood from someone with AB blood?
6:51
The answer is yes, because the guy with AB blood
6:54
has no antibodies against A or B,
6:56
so he won't attack the AB blood that is given to him.
7:00
Why don't you pause the video for a moment
7:02
and try to fill in the rest of this table?
7:07
Hopefully you've paused for a second
7:09
and tried to fill in the rest of the table.
7:11
Now we'll fill it in together.
7:13
Someone with AB blood can receive blood from A,
7:17
he can receive blood from B,
7:18
and he can receive blood from O
7:21
because he has no antibodies to either A or B,
7:25
so he won't react to any of these guys.
7:28
Likewise, someone with type A blood can, of course,
7:30
receive from A, B can receive from B,
7:33
O can receive from O,
7:36
but B cannot receive from AB, nor can O.
7:40
Nor can B receive from A, nor can O.
7:44
Nor can O receive from B, nor can A receive from B.
7:49
But O can give to everyone.
7:53
Something interesting you'll notice here is,
7:55
as we just said, O can give to anyone
7:59
because the O blood type has no As or Bs on it,
8:03
so no one's going to react to it.
8:06
For that reason, we call O the universal donor.
8:17
The other interesting thing you'll notice
8:18
is that AB can receive from everyone.
8:23
For that reason, we call him the universal recipient.
8:35
All these things, by the way,
8:37
AB, A, B, O, these are blood types.
8:41
So when someone asks you for your blood type,
8:43
this is what they're referring to.
8:45
This is why it's really important to know your blood type
8:49
if you're ever going to require a blood transfusion.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Nnqp_3HMlDU,
khan_video_lxjmR4pYIVU_171818,What's a fraction with a numerator greater than the denominator called?,MCQ,"•
0:00
We're asked to rewrite the following two
0:02
fractions as fractions with a least common denominator.
0:10
So a least common denominator for two fractions
0:13
is really just going to be the least common multiple of both
0:17
of these denominators over here.
0:19
And the value of doing that is then
0:21
if you can make these a common denominator,
0:24
then you can add the two fractions.
0:26
And we'll see that in other videos.
0:28
But first of all, let's just find the least common multiple.
0:33
Let me write it out because sometimes LCD
0:35
could meet other things.
0:37
So least common denominator of these two things
0:48
is going to be the same thing as the least common multiple
0:51
of the two denominators over here.
0:53
The least common multiple of 8 and 6.
0:57
And a couple of ways to think about least common multiple--
0:59
you literally could just take the multiples of 8 and 6
1:02
and see what they're smallest common multiple is.
1:05
So let's do it that way first.
1:07
So multiples of six are 6, 12, 18, 24 30.
1:13
And I could keep going if we don't find any common multiples
1:17
out of this group here with any of the multiples in eight.
1:20
And the multiples of eight are 8, 16, 24,
1:25
and it looks like we're done.
1:26
And we could keep going obviously-- 32,
1:29
so on and so forth.
1:30
But I found a common multiple and this
1:32
is their smallest common multiple.
1:33
They have other common multiples-- 48 and 72,
1:38
and we could keep adding more and more multiple.
1:40
But this is their smallest common multiple,
1:41
their least common multiple.
1:44
So it is 24.
1:47
Another way that you could have found at least common multiple
1:50
is you could have taken the prime factorization of six
1:52
and you say, hey, that's 2, and 3.
1:55
So the least common multiple has to have at least 1, 2, and 1, 3
2:00
in its prime factorization in order for it
2:02
to be divisible by 6.
2:04
And you could have said, what's the prime factorization of 8?
2:07
It is 2 times 4 and 4 is 2 times 2.
2:11
So in order to be divisible by 8,
2:12
you have to have at least three 2's in the prime factorization.
2:16
So to be divisible by 6, you have to have a 2 times a 3.
2:21
And then to be divisible by 8, you have to have at least three
2:24
2's.
2:25
You have to have two times itself three times
2:27
I should say.
2:28
Well, we have one 2 and let's throw in a couple more.
2:32
So then you have another 2 and then another 2.
2:34
So this part right over here makes it divisible by 8.
2:38
And this part right over here makes it divisible by 6.
2:41
If I take 2 times 2 times 2 times 3, that does give me 24.
2:48
So our least common multiple of 8 and 6,
2:49
which is also the least common denominator of these two
2:52
fractions is going to be 24.
2:54
So what we want to do is rewrite each of these fractions
2:57
with 24 as the denominator.
2:59
So I'll start with 2 over 8.
3:01
And I want to write that as something over 24.
3:08
Well, to get the denominator be 24,
3:11
we have to multiply it by 3.
3:13
8 times 3 is 24.
3:15
And so if we don't want to change
3:16
the value of the fraction, we have
3:17
to multiply the numerator and denominator by the same thing.
3:21
So let's multiply the numerator by 3 as well.
3:24
2 times 3 is 6.
3:26
So 2/8 is the exact same thing as 6/24.
3:29
To see that a little bit clearer,
3:31
you say, look, if I have 2/8, and if I multiply this times 3
3:37
over 3, that gives me 6/24.
3:42
And this are the same fraction because 3 over 3
3:45
is really just 1.
3:47
It's one whole.
3:49
So 2/8 is 6/24 let's do the same thing with 5/6.
3:56
So 5 over 6 is equal to something over 24.
4:03
Let me do that in a different color.
4:05
I'll do it in blue.
4:07
Something over 24.
4:09
To get the denominator from 6 to 24,
4:11
we have to multiply it by 4.
4:14
So if we don't want to change the value of 5/6,
4:16
we have to multiply the numerator and denominator
4:18
by the same thing.
4:19
So let's multiply the numerator times 4.
4:22
5 times 4 is 20.
4:24
5/6 is the same thing as 20/24.
4:26
So we're done.
4:27
We've written 2/8 as 6/24 and we've written 5/6 as 20/24.
4:31
If we wanted to add them now, we could literally just
4:34
add 6/24 to 20/24.

So I have a three-dimensional solid right over here.
0:03
And I want to imagine what type of a shape
0:05
I would get if I were to make a vertical cut.
0:09
And just to refresh ourselves, or give us
0:12
a sense of what a vertical cut is,
0:14
imagine if this was made out of jello or something
0:18
kind of fairly soft.
0:19
But it's still a three-dimensional solid.
0:21
And I were to make a cut-- let's say
0:23
I were to make a cut right over here.
0:25
So let's say I had this big, sharp metal
0:29
thing-- let me draw it like that.
0:31
So you have this big, sharp metal thing.
0:33
Let me draw it a little bit neater.
0:36
So you have this big, sharp metal thing
0:39
that I'm going to cut right over here.
0:42
So this is the thing that I'm going to make the cut.
0:44
And I'm going to go straight down.
0:45
This is a vertical cut that we're talking about.
0:47
So this is the thing that I'm going to cut with.
0:52
Let me make it big enough so that it
0:53
can capture the shape that will result.
0:57
So this thing right over here, it's right in front.
1:00
And I'm going to cut-- I'm going to make it go straight
1:03
down and cut through this jello, or whatever
1:06
you want to call it, this rectangular pyramid of jello.
1:10
And what would be the resulting shape of the intersection
1:13
between the jello and this thing that I'm using to cut it?
1:17
And now I encourage you to pause your video
1:19
and think about what the resulting shape would be.
1:21
And the shape would be in two dimensions.
1:23
Because this purple surface is a two-dimensional--
1:27
you could view it as part of a plane.
1:29
And so where this intersects when you cut down
1:32
this rectangular pyramid is the shape we're looking for.
1:35
So I encourage you to pause the video and think about it
1:38
or try to come up with it on your own.
1:41
So let's think about it.
1:42
And let me draw the rectangular pyramid again.
1:48
So that's the same one.
1:50
And now let me see what it would look like once
1:52
I've done my cut, once I've brought this thing down.
1:58
So then this is where I cut.
2:00
So I cut it right over here.
2:05
And then it'll exit the bottom.
2:07
It'll cut along this side like that,
2:12
cut along that side like that.
2:14
And then it'll exit the bottom right over there.
2:19
And so let me draw my whole thing.
2:23
And so once I slice it down, it will look like this.
2:30
My best shot at drawing it-- it will look like this.
2:37
This is a vertical cut.
2:38
So I've brought this thing down.
2:40
And now the intersection between the thing that I'm cutting with
2:42
and this pyramid is going to be this shape right over here.
2:47
It cut into the top right over there.
2:49
It would get all the way to the bottom right over there.
2:51
And along this side, it would cut right there.
2:54
And along that side, it would cut right over there.
2:56
So what's the resulting shape in two dimensions
2:59
of essentially the intersection between the slicer
3:01
and the jello?
3:03
Well, it would be this thing.
3:05
It would look like a trapezoid.
3:06
Let me do that in a new color.
3:07
I'm overusing that one color.
3:12
It would look like a trapezoid.
3:14
So this would be the resulting shape.

0:14
limit is delta x approaches 0 of f
0:16
of x plus delta x minus f of x, all of that over delta x.
0:21
And it really just comes out of trying
0:23
to find the slope of a tangent line at any given point.
0:26
But we're going to see what the power rule is.
0:28
It simplifies our life.
0:29
We won't have to take these sometimes complicated limits.
0:32
And we're not going to prove it in this video,
0:35
but we'll hopefully get a sense of how to use it.
0:37
And in future videos, we'll get a sense of why it makes sense
0:40
and even prove it.
0:41
So the power rule just tells us that if I have some function,
0:44
f of x, and it's equal to some power of x, so x
0:49
to the n power, where n does not equal 0.
0:55
So n can be anything.
0:57
It can be positive, a negative, it could be-- it
1:00
does not have to be an integer.
1:01
The power rule tells us that the derivative of this, f prime
1:07
of x, is just going to be equal to n,
1:10
so you're literally bringing this out front, n times x,
1:17
and then you just decrement the power, times x
1:20
to the n minus 1 power.
1:23
So let's do a couple of examples just
1:25
to make sure that that actually makes sense.
1:28
So let's ask ourselves, well let's say that f of x
1:32
was equal to x squared.
1:34
Based on the power rule, what is f
1:36
prime of x going to be equal to?
1:40
Well, in this situation, our n is 2.
1:43
So we bring the 2 out front.
1:45
2 times x to the 2 minus 1 power.
1:49
So that's going to be 2 times x to the first power, which
1:52
is just equal to 2x.
1:54
That was pretty straightforward.
1:56
Let's think about the situation where,
1:58
let's say we have g of x is equal to x to the third power.
2:03
What is g prime of x going to be in this scenario?
2:08
Well, n is 3, so we just literally pattern match here.
2:12
This is-- you're probably finding
2:13
this shockingly straightforward.
2:15
So this is going to be 3 times x to the 3 minus 1 power,
2:20
or this is going to be equal to 3x squared.
2:24
And we're done.
2:25
In the next video we'll think about
2:26
whether this actually makes sense.
2:28
Let's do one more example, just to show
2:29
it doesn't have to necessarily apply
2:31
to only these kind of positive integers.
2:34
We could have a scenario where maybe we
2:36
have h of x. h of x is equal to x to the negative 100 power.
2:44
The power rule tells us that h prime of x
2:46
would be equal to what?
2:48
Well n is negative 100, so it's negative 100x
2:52
to the negative 100 minus 1, which
2:54
is equal to negative 100x to the negative 101.
2:59
Let's do one more.
3:00
Let's say we had z of x.
3:03
z of x is equal to x to the 2.571 power.
3:11
And we are concerned with what is z prime of x?
3:16
Well once again, power rule simplifies our life,
3:18
n it's 2.571, so it's going to be
3:21
2.571 times x to the 2.571 minus 1 power.
3:27
So it's going to be equal to-- let
3:29
me make sure I'm not falling off the bottom of the page--
3:32
2.571 times x to the 1.571 power.
3:40
Hopefully, you enjoyed that.
3:41
And in the next few videos, we will not only
3:44
expose you to more properties of derivatives,
3:46
we'll get a sense for why the power rule at least makes
3:48
intuitive sense.
3:49

You have reached the first checkpoint
0:02
in the 'Journey to cryptography'-series.
0:04
And now I want to talk about what's next,
0:07
because I'm working on a new series.
0:09
However, this one won't end here.
0:11
If anything, we are kind of at the beginning still.
0:14
So I'm going to do 3 different checkpoint videos.
0:17
This one is on 'Advanced Lessons'.
0:20
However, I also want to eventually talk about Tests and Challenges,
0:24
and what we can do with more interactive explorations
0:27
and computer science lessons as it applies to cryptography.
0:31
But for now, let's talk about Advanced Lessons.
0:33
When I say 'Advanced', I don't necessarily mean 'harder lessons',
0:37
I mean 'more detailed'.
0:39
Let me give you a conceptual idea
0:41
for what I think this series could be and future series.
0:45
I like to think of each series as the trunk of a tree,
0:48
where I took you from prehistoric times
0:51
to around the 20th century, which is here,
0:53
with a few different threads.
0:55
And these ideas kind of branch apart.
0:59
Once you get to the 20th and 21st centuries,
1:01
they start getting highly specific.
1:04
And way down here on the leaves are current research questions,
1:09
which over here might be
1:11
problems related to prime number distribution
1:13
and over here some very specific work being done
1:18
on randomized algorithms or hash functions,
1:21
and way up here we might have new public key protocols
1:27
- because RSA was just the first -
1:29
or we also have encryption standards such as DES and AES.
1:33
We would have a whole new branch on quantum cryptography.
1:37
So as you can see, there are so many different things
1:40
that branch out of this series
1:41
and I couldn't possibly do justice to them all.
1:44
So I think of this video as living right here.
1:46
At kind of a junction point.
1:49
Now I can branch off with help of the community
1:52
and possibly other video creators
1:54
to fill out this tree gradually over time.
1:58
Specifically with the help of the community.
2:01
I am really excited about the Q&A community
2:04
and the work being done to improve
2:06
how people can help people on Khan Academy.
2:09
So, for example,
2:11
in terms of where one of these branches can go,
2:15
I've noticed clusters of questions
2:17
kind of leading into a common branch.
2:20
For example, under 'the pseudo-random number generator',
2:23
I have two questions here: one by Sonny and one by Drakain.
2:26
Drakain's question is:
2:27
""Why has he suggested that time in milliseconds...
2:31
...is a suitable random seed?...
2:33
This is a huge no-no in security. ...
2:35
The time it is on your machine...
2:38
...is the time it is on my machine,...
2:40
...give or take 100 milliseconds...
2:42
(which can be brute-force attacked)""
2:44
And again, this is a great question too
2:46
because it speaks to the need that
2:48
I didn't present a cryptographically secure pseudo-random generator.
2:53
So the middle square's method is back here
2:56
in early 20th century, but up until today,
2:59
we are not using the middle square's method
3:02
and that's a whole interesting branch.
3:05
It is these sorts of questions which cluster together
3:08
and really drive new content.
3:12
I want to show you a really interesting example
3:14
of how this has happened already.
3:16
This is a question Samuel asked on the 'One time pad'-video
3:20
he said: ""wouldn't a computer be able to test all the possibilities very fast?""
3:24
and Chuck Patrol basically asked the same question.
3:28
I see this happening a lot.
3:30
Similar questions all speak to the need of a new video.
3:33
So I went and created a video on 'perfect secrecy'
3:37
which really nails down
3:39
how you can't beat randomness in the world of encryption.
3:43
Out of this video, Dawn made a really great comment.
3:48
What they did, was basically summarise my video in two sentences.
3:52
So, this is what I want to try to do more of
3:55
in filling out these branches:
3:56
take questions, make new content,
3:58
and have this feed-back loop and see what we can do.
4:03
Now what I would really love,
4:05
is for you to ask questions below this video
4:08
which arise after watching the entire series.
4:12
Not specific details about certain video's,
4:14
- those can go with the videos -
4:16
but new questions, which are opening new can of worms.
4:19
And what I think will be fun to do, is:
4:22
Your question will lead to answers,
4:26
by both me and the rest of the community,
4:30
so we'll have multiple answers.
4:32
And what I can do is take this body of answers,
4:35
and out of this draft up a rough script
4:40
for more advanced videos on specific topics
4:43
that sub-sets of the community care about
4:47
So hopefully, out of the discussion below,
4:49
over time we can grow a bunch of new videos!
4:53
I want to be clear: this is an ongoing process.
4:56
This will not happen tomorrow or next week.
4:59
I hope it can happen months, even years from now.
5:02
We can still be building out new videos after the series
5:05
and these videos can be a collaborative effort
5:08
between myself and the community
5:10
and perhaps other video creators down the road.
5:13
So, let me know what you think below,
5:15
and let's get started!",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,A9Km337z15k,
khan_video_Tm98lnrlbMA_153862,At 1:03 Could we use smiley faces in Algebra to replace x?,Essay,"•
0:00
I'm here with Jesse Ro, whose a math teacher at Summit San Jose
0:03
and a Khan Academy teaching fellow
0:05
and you had some interesting ideas or questions.
0:08
Yeah, one question that students ask a lot when they start Algebra
0:11
is why do we need letters, why can't we just use numbers for everything?
0:16
Why letters? So why do we have all these
0:18
Xs and Ys and Zs and ABCs when we start dealing with Algebra?
0:21
Yeah, exactly.
0:22
That's interesting, well why don't we let people think about that for a second.
0:28
So Sal, how would you answer this question?
0:30
Why do we need letters in Algebra?
0:32
So why letters. So there are a couple of ways I'd think about it.
0:35
One is if you have an unknown.
0:38
So if I were to write X plus three is equal to ten
0:44
the reason why we're doing this is that we don't know what X is
0:46
It's literally an unknown.
0:48
And so we're going to solve for it in some way.
0:50
But it did not have to be the letter X.
0:51
We could have literally written blank plus three is equal to ten.
0:55
Or we could have written Question Mark plus three is equal to ten.
0:59
So it didn't have to be letters, but we needed some type of symbol.
1:03
It literally could've been Smiley Face plus three is equal to ten.
1:07
But until you know it, you need some type of a symbol to represent whatever that number is.
1:12
Now we can go and solve this equation and then know what that symbol represents.
1:15
But if we knew it ahead of time, it wouldn't be an unknown.
1:17
It wouldn't be something that we didn't know.
1:20
So that's one reason why I would use letters
1:23
and where just numbers by itself wouldn't be helpful.
1:26
The other is when you're describing relationships between numbers.
1:28
So I could do something like - I could say - that
1:32
whenever you give me a three, I'm going to give you a four.
1:38
And I could say, if you give me a five, I'm going to give you a six.
1:43
And i could keep going on and on forever.
1:46
If you give me a 7.1, I'm going to give you an 8.1.
1:51
And I could keep listing this on and on forever.
1:54
Maybe you could give me any number, and I could tell you what I'm going to give you.
1:57
But I would obviously run out of space and time if I were to list all of them.
2:00
And we could do that much more elegantly if we used letters to describe the relationship.
2:06
Maybe what you give me we call X, and what I give you we call Y.
2:11
And so I say, look, whatever you give me, I'm going to add one to it.
2:14
And that's what I'm going to give back to you.
2:16
And so now, this very simple equation here
2:20
can describe an infinite number of relationships between X
2:24
or an infinite number of corresponding Ys and Xs.
2:28
So now someone knows whatever X you give me
2:31
you give me three, I add one to it, and I'm going to give you four.
2:34
You give me 7.1, I'm going to add one to it and give you 8.1.
2:38
So there is no more elegant way that you could've done it than by using symbols.
2:41
With that said, I didn't have to use Xs and Ys.
2:43
This is just a convention that kind of comes to use from history.
2:46
I could've defined what you give me as Star
2:49
and what I give you as Smiley Face
2:54
and this also would've been a valid way to express this.
2:57
So the letters are really just symbols. Nothing more.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Tm98lnrlbMA,
khan_video_x5EJG_rAtkY_106093,But if what you were given was the linear graph he shows at the end (with the end points) can it also be worked backwards to derive an absolute value equation?,Essay,"•
0:00
We have the absolute value of 2r minus 3 and 1/4 is less
0:05
than 2 and 1/2, and we want to solve for r.
0:08
So right from the get go we have to deal with this
0:10
absolute value.
0:11
And just as a bit of a review, if I were to say that the
0:14
absolute value of x is less than, well let's just say,
0:18
less than 2 and 1/2, that means that the distance from x
0:21
to 0 is less than 2 and 1/2.
0:24
That means that x would have to be less than 2 and 1/2, and
0:32
x would have to be greater than negative 2 and 1/2.
0:36
And just think about it for a second.
0:38
If I were to draw it on a number line right here, that
0:43
is 0, that is 2 and 1/2, and that is negative 2 and 1/2.
0:50
These two numbers are exactly 2 and 1/2 away from 0, because
0:53
both of their absolute values is 2 and 1/2.
0:56
Now, if we want all of the numbers whose absolute value
0:58
is less than 2 and 1/2, or that are less than 2 and 1/2
1:02
away from 0, it would be all of the numbers in between.
1:08
And that's exactly what these two statements are saying. x
1:11
has to be less than 2 and 1/2, and it has to be greater than
1:15
negative 2 and 1/2.
1:17
If this absolute value were the other way, that the
1:19
absolute value of x has to be greater than 2 and 1/2, then
1:21
it would be the numbers outside of this, and
1:23
it would be an or.
1:24
But we're dealing with the less than situation right
1:26
there, so let's just do what we were able to figure out
1:29
when it was just an x.
1:30
The distance from this thing to 0 has to be less than 2 and
1:36
1/2, so we can write that 2r minus 3 and 1/4 has to be less
1:45
than 2 and 1/2 and 2r minus 3 and 1/4 has to be greater than
1:55
negative 2 and 1/2.
1:58
Same exact reasoning here.
1:59
Let me draw a line so we don't get confused.
2:01
Same exact reasoning here.
2:03
This quantity right here has to be between
2:06
negative 2 and 1/2.
2:08
It has to be greater than negative 2
2:09
and 1/2 right there.
2:12
And it has to be less than 2 and 1/2, so
2:15
that's all I wrote there.
2:16
So let's solve each of these independently.
2:19
Well, this first went over here, you've learned before
2:22
that I don't like improper fractions, and I don't like
2:26
fractions in general.
2:27
So let's make all of these fractions.
2:29
Sorry, I don't like mixed numbers.
2:31
I want them to be improper fractions.
2:32
So let's turn all of these into improper fractions.
2:34
So if I were to rewrite it, we get 2r minus 3 and 1/4 is the
2:38
same thing as 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.
2:42
2r minus 13/4 is less than-- 2 times 2 is 4, plus 1 is five--
2:50
is less than 5/2.
2:51
So that's the first equation.
2:53
And then the second question-- and do the same thing here--
2:56
we have 2r minus 13 over 4 has to be a greater
3:02
than negative 5/2.
3:04
All right, now let's solve each of these independently.
3:08
To get rid of the fractions, the easiest thing to do is to
3:10
multiply both sides of this equation by 4.
3:13
That'll eliminate all of the fractions, so let's do that.
3:15
Let's multiply-- let me scroll to the left a little bit--
3:18
let's multiply both sides of this equation by 4.
3:22
And what do we get?
3:22
4 times 2r is 8r, 4 times negative 13 over 4 is negative
3:28
13, is less than-- and I multiplied by a positive
3:32
number so I didn't have to worry about swapping the
3:34
inequality-- is less than 5/2 times 4 is 10, right?
3:40
You get a 2 and a 1, it's 10.
3:42
So you get 8r minus 13 is less than 10.
3:46
Now we can add 13 to both sides of this equation so that
3:50
we get rid of it on the left-hand side.
3:52
Add 13 to both sides and we get 8r-- these guys cancel
3:56
out-- is less than 23, and then we divide
4:02
both sides by 8.
4:06
And once again, we didn't have to worry about the inequality
4:08
because we're dividing by a positive number.
4:11
And we get r is less than 23 over 8.
4:17
Or, if you want to write that as a mixed number, r is less
4:20
than-- what is that-- 2 and 7/8.
4:26
So that's one condition, but we still have to worry about
4:28
this other condition.
4:29
There was an and right here.
4:30
Let's worry about it.
4:31
So our other condition tells us 2r minus 13 over 4 has to
4:36
be greater than negative 5/2.
4:38
Let's multiply both sides of this equation by 4.
4:41
So 4 times 2r is 8r.
4:44
4 times negative 13 over 4 is negative 13, is greater than
4:49
negative 5/2 times 4 is negative 10.
4:52
Now we add 13 to both sides of this equation.
4:59
The left-hand side-- these guys cancel out, you're just
5:02
left with 8r-- is greater than negative 10 plus 13 is 3.
5:08
Or divide both sides of this by 8, and you're left with r
5:13
has to be greater than 3/8.
5:16
So our two conditions, r has to be less than 2 and 7/8 and
5:20
greater than 3/8.
5:21
Or we can just write it like this: r is greater than 3/8,
5:26
so it's greater than-- maybe I should say 3/8 is less than r,
5:31
which is less than 2 and 7/8.
5:36
So if we were to plot the solution on the number line--
5:39
which I'm about to do, so that's my number line-- this
5:44
is 0 right here, maybe this is 1, 2, and 3.
5:51
We have 2 and 7/8.
5:53
We have to be less than 2 and 7/8.
5:55
Let's say that this is 2 and 7/8 right there.
5:59
And we have to be greater than 3/8.
6:01
Say that is 3/8, so 3/8 will be some place
6:05
right around there.
6:06
And everything in between is a valid solution.
6:12
And we could try it out.
6:13
Let's try out something that, based on what I just drew,
6:15
should be a valid solution.
6:17
1 should be a valid solution.
6:18
Let's try it out here.
6:19
2 times 1 minus 3 and 1/4, what is that?
6:26
That's 2 minus 3 and 1/4.
6:29
And so what is that?
6:30
2 minus 3 and 1/4 is-- well, 3 and 1/4 minus 2 is 1 and 1/4,
6:36
so this will be negative 1 and 1/4.
6:39
But we're taking the absolute value of it, so we take the
6:42
absolute value of it, which is equal to 1 and 1/4, which is
6:46
indeed less than 2 and 1/2.
6:48
Now let's try another number.
6:50
Let's try 0.
6:51
Based on this, 0 should not work.
6:53
So what happens if we put 0 here?
6:55
You get 2 times 0, which is 0, minus 3 and 1/4.
6:58
If you take the absolute value of negative 3 and 1/4, you'll
7:02
get positive 3 and 1/4, which won't work.
7:05
3 and 1/4 is greater than 2 and 1/2, so that's
7:08
true, that works out.
7:09
And same thing for 3.
7:11
2 times 3 is 6, minus 3 and 1/4 is 2 and 3/4.
7:18
Take the absolute value, it's 2 and 3/4, still bigger than 2
7:22
and 1/2, so it won't work.
7:23
So at least the points that we tried out seem to validate
7:26
this solution that we got.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,x5EJG_rAtkY,

0:01
think about what it means to have an opposite of a number.
0:06
Let me draw a number line here.
0:10
Let's draw a number line.
0:12
And let's put some numbers on this number line.
0:15
We can start at zero,
0:17
and if we go to the right we have positive numbers.
0:19
One, two, three, four, five.
0:25
As we go to the left we get more and more negative.
0:28
So negative one, negative two, negative three,
0:33
negative four, and I can keep going on and on and on.
0:37
Let's pick one of these numbers.
0:39
Let's say that we pick the number three.
0:43
What is going to be the opposite of the number three?
0:47
Well the opposite of the number is a number that's
0:50
the same distance from zero but on the other side.
0:55
So three is three to the right of zero.
0:57
One, two, three.
1:00
So its opposite is going to be three to the left of zero.
1:02
One, two, three.
1:05
So the opposite of three is negative three.
1:10
Let me make a little table here.
1:11
If we have the number, the number.
1:15
And then we have its opposite.
1:18
We have its opposite.
1:21
So we just figured out that if you have the number three,
1:25
its opposite is going to be negative three.
1:30
Now what if your number is negative?
1:33
What if your number, let's say the number negative four.
1:37
What's the opposite of that?
1:38
And I encourage you to pause the video
1:40
and try to think about it on your own.
1:42
Well, you say, okay, negative four is right over here.
1:45
That's negative four.
1:46
It is four to the left of zero.
1:48
One, two, three, four to the left of zero.
1:52
So its opposite is going to be four to the right of it.
1:55
So one, two, three, four.
1:59
It's going to be positive.
2:01
It's going to be positive four.
2:03
So you're probably starting to see a pattern here.
2:06
The opposite of a number is going to be
2:10
the opposite sign of that number.
2:13
If you have a positive three here,
2:15
its opposite is going to be negative three.
2:17
If you start with negative four,
2:19
its opposite is going to be positive four.
2:22
One way to think about it, it's going to have the
2:25
same absolute value but have a different sign.
2:29
Or another way to think about it is,
2:30
however if this is three to the right of zero,
2:33
its opposite is going to be three to the left of zero.
2:36
Or if the number is four to the left of zero,
2:38
its opposite is going to be four to the right of zero.
2:42
So we'll do one last one.
2:44
What is the opposite of...
2:48
What's going to be the opposite of one?
2:52
Well one is one to the right of zero,
2:55
so its opposite is going to be one to the left of zero,
2:57
or negative one.
2:59
Or another way to think about it, one is positive
3:01
so its opposite is where you're going to change the sign.
3:04
Instead of being positive it's going to be negative.
3:06
It's going to be negative one.
3:08
Either way that you can think about it.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,2Zk6u7Uk5ow,
khan_video_8QihetGj3pg_47693,How would you name that vector?,Essay,"•
0:00
So I have two 2-dimensional vectors
0:02
right over here, vector a and vector b.
0:05
And what I want to think about is how can we define
0:08
or what would be a reasonable way
0:09
to define the sum of vector a plus vector b?
0:15
Well, one thing that might jump at your mind
0:16
is, look, well, each of these are two dimensional.
0:19
They both have two components.
0:20
Why don't we just add the corresponding components?
0:23
So for the sum, why don't we make the first component
0:27
of the sum just a sum of the first two components
0:30
of these two vectors.
0:31
So why don't we just make it 6 plus negative 4?
0:35
Well, 6 plus negative 4 is equal to 2.
0:38
And why don't we just make the second component
0:41
the sum of the two second components?
0:43
So negative 2 plus 4 is also equal to 2.
0:48
So we start with two 2-dimensional vectors.
0:50
You add them together, you get another two
0:52
2-dimensional vectors.
0:53
If you think about it in terms of real coordinates bases,
0:56
both of these are members of R2--
0:59
I'll write this down here just so we get used to the notation.
1:02
So vector a and vector b are both members of R2,
1:14
which is just another way of saying
1:15
that these are both two tuples.
1:16
They are both two-dimensional vectors right over here.
1:21
Now, this might make sense just looking at how we represented
1:23
it, but how does this actually make
1:25
visual or conceptual sense?
1:27
And to do that, let's actually plot these vectors.
1:29
Let's try to represent these vectors in some way.
1:32
Let's try to visualize them.
1:33
So vector a, we could visualize, this tells us
1:37
how far this vector moves in each
1:39
of these directions-- horizontal direction
1:42
and vertical direction.
1:44
So if we put the, I guess you could
1:45
say the tail of the vector at the origin-- remember,
1:48
we don't have to put the tail at the origin,
1:49
but that might make it a little bit easier for us to draw it.
1:52
We'll go 6 in the horizontal direction.
1:53
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
1:56
And then negative 2 in the vertical.
1:58
So negative 2.
1:59
So vector a could look like this.
2:05
Vector a looks like that.
2:09
And once again, the important thing
2:11
is the magnitude and the direction.
2:12
The magnitude is represented by the length of this vector.
2:15
And the direction is the direction
2:17
that it is pointed in.
2:19
And also just to emphasize, I could have drawn vector a
2:21
like that or I could have put it over here.
2:26
These are all equivalent vectors.
2:30
These are all equal to vector a.
2:32
All I really care about is the magnitude and the direction.
2:37
So with that in mind, let's also draw vector b.
2:40
Vector b in the horizontal direction goes negative 4-- 1,
2:44
2, 3, 4, and in the vertical direction goes 4-- 1, 2, 3, 4.
2:50
So its tail if we start at the origin,
2:52
if its tail is at the origin, its head
2:55
would be at negative 4, 4.
2:59
So let me draw that just like that.
3:03
So that right over here is vector b.
3:07
And once again, vector b we could draw it like that
3:10
or we could draw it-- let me copy and let me paste it--
3:15
so this would also be another way to draw vector b.
3:21
Once again, what I really care about
3:23
is its magnitude and its direction.
3:25
All of these green vectors have the same magnitude.
3:27
They all have the same length and they all
3:29
have the same direction.
3:31
So how does the way that I drew vector a and b
3:33
gel with what its sum is?
3:36
So let me draw its sum like this.
3:38
Let me draw its sum in this blue color.
3:41
So the sum based on this definition we just used,
3:44
the vector addition would be 2, 2.
3:47
So 2, 2.
3:48
So it would look something like this.
3:53
So how does this make sense that the sum,
3:55
that this purple vector plus this green vector
4:00
is somehow going to be equal to this blue vector?
4:02
I encourage you to pause the video
4:03
and think about if that even makes sense.
4:07
Well, one way to think about it is this first purple vector,
4:10
it shifts us this much.
4:12
It takes us from this point to that point.
4:14
And so if we were to add it, let's start at this point
4:16
and put the green vector's tail right there
4:18
and see where it ends up putting us.
4:22
So the green vector, we already have a version.
4:25
So once again, we start the origin.
4:28
Vector a takes us there.
4:30
Now, let's start over there with the green vector
4:32
and see where green vector takes us.
4:34
And this makes sense.
4:35
Vector a plus vector b.
4:38
Put the tail of vector b at the head of vector a.
4:41
So if you were to start at the origin,
4:43
vector a takes you there then if you
4:45
add on what vector b takes you, it takes you right over there.
4:48
So relative to the origin, how much did you--
4:52
I guess you could say-- shift?
4:53
And once again, vectors don't only
4:55
apply to things like displacement.
4:56
It can apply to velocity.
4:57
It can apply to actual acceleration.
4:58
It can apply to a whole series of things,
5:01
but when you visualize it this way,
5:03
you see that it does make complete sense.
5:05
This blue vector, the sum of the two,
5:08
is what results where you start with vector a.
5:11
At that point right over there, vector a takes you there,
5:15
then you take vector b's tail, start over there
5:17
and it takes you to the tip of the sum.
5:21
Now, one question you might be having is well,
5:23
vector a plus vector b is this, but what
5:25
is vector b plus vector a?
5:31
Does this still work?
5:33
Well, based on the definition we had
5:35
where you add the corresponding components,
5:37
you're still going to get the same sum vector.
5:39
So it should come out the same.
5:40
So this will just be negative 4 plus 6 is 2.
5:43
4 plus negative 2 is 2.
5:46
But does that make visual sense?
5:48
So if we start with vector b.
5:49
So let's say you start right over here.
5:51
Vector b takes you right over there.
5:54
And then if you were to go there and you
5:56
were to start with vector a-- so let's do that.
5:59
So actually, let me make this a little bit-- actually, let me
6:02
start with a new vector b.
6:06
So let's say that that's our vector b right over there.
6:11
And then-- actually, let me give this
6:13
a place where I'll have some space to work with.
6:15
So let's say that's my vector b right over there.
6:18
And then let me get a copy of the vector a.
6:22
That's a good one.
6:23
So copy and let me paste it.
6:26
So I could put vector a's tail at the tip of vector b,
6:31
and then it'll take me right over there.
6:35
So if I start right over here, vector b takes me there.
6:42
And now I'm adding to that vector a, which starting here
6:45
will take me there.
6:47
And so from my original starting position, I have gone this far.
6:52
Now, what is this vector?
6:53
Well, this is exactly the vector 2, 2.
6:57
Or another way of thinking about it,
6:58
this vector shifts you 2 in the horizontal direction and 2
7:02
in the vertical direction.
7:04
So either way, you're going to get the same result,
7:06
and that should, hopefully, make visual or conceptual sense
7:09
as well.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,8QihetGj3pg,
khan_video_v8plb6V8BQo_121904,"Isn't the m1 (2,3,4) and m2(3,4,5) two vectors on the plane?",MCQ,"•
0:01
If the distance between the plane Ax-2y+z = d and the plane containing the lines,
0:09
and they give us two lines here in three-dimensions,
0:12
if that distance is square-root of 6, then the absolute value of d is...
0:18
So let's think about it for a little bit. They're talking about the distance between this plane and some
0:25
plane that contains these two line.
0:28
So in order to talk realistically about the distance between the planes, those planes will have to be
0:33
parallel, because if they're not parallel - if they intersect with each other, the distance is clearly
0:37
zero, and they're telling us here that the distance is square-root of 6.
0:41
So we have a situation so that the planes can't intersect they must be parallel.
0:46
So you have this plane up here, you have this plane up here, you could call this the equation here
0:53
is ax - 2y + z = d, and then you're going to have another plane, that's going to be parallel to it,
1:01
maybe it looks something like this. You have the other plane that is parallel, and it's going to contain
1:07
both of these lines. So maybe it has this line - so this line is in green, maybe this line looks something
1:14
like this, it's on that blue plane. And then this line, maybe in magenta, is also going to be on the
1:23
blue plane. So how can we figure out the distances?
1:26
Well a good starting point would be to try to figure out the equation for this blue plane here.
1:33
And since these planes are parallel, this equation should look very much like this orange equation -
1:40
at least on the left-hand-side, it might just have a different d-value, and that's because it has the
1:44
exact same inclination. And then once we figure out the equation for this plane over here, then we could
1:52
actually probably figure out what 'a' is, then we could find some point on the blue plane and then use
1:58
our knowledge of finding the distance points and planes to figure out the actual distance from any point
2:05
to this orange plane.
2:07
So let's figure out the equation of this blue plane first, and a good place to start is just to try to
2:12
figure out two vectors on this blue plane, then we can take the cross-product of those two vectors to
2:19
find out a normal to this blue plane, and then use that information to actually figure out the
2:24
equation for the blue plane.
2:26
So let's figure out some points that sit on the blue plane.
2:31
So on this green line right over here you have, see if I want all of these to be equal to zero, you'd
2:37
have the point x is equal to 1, y is equal to 2, z is equal to 3, so you have the point (1,2,3) - that definitely sits
2:46
on the blue plane. Let's come up with another point. let's see if I want all of these to be equal to
2:52
one, I could make this, if I want this to evaluate to two, I'd have the point three, I would have the point,
2:59
if I want this to evaluate to one, I would want five minus two over three, so 3, 5, and then I would want this
3:07
to be seven. Seven minus three over four is also 1, so that's another point, actually both of these points sit on this
3:16
line right over here. 1,2,3 and then 3,5,7. And then let's do the same thing for this - let's find two
3:24
points on this plane, and actually we just need to find one point on this plane, because if you have
3:29
three points that's enough to figure out two different vectors -vectors that aren't scalar multiples
3:35
of each other, which would be enough to figure out the normal to this plane.
3:39
So let's just figure out one more point over here and one more point would be, if we want all of these
3:44
three to be equal to zero, would be the point (2,3,4).
3:52
Because this would be zero, zero, zero. So that's also sitting the plane and that sits on the magenta
3:57
line right over there.
3:59
So let's use these three points to figure out two vectors on the plane that aren't multiples of each
4:03
other, then we can take their cross-product to actually figure out a normal vector to the blue plane.
4:11
So let's say the first vector, 'a', that sits on this plane, let's say it's the difference in the position
4:16
vectors that specify these two points, and then we know that will be on the plane.
4:21
And so that will be three minus one is 2i plus five minus two is 3j, plus seven minus three is 4k.
4:37
So vector 'a' is actually going to sit on this green line, because both of these points are on this line,
4:44
so it's going to sit on that line. If we put it on the plane or if we were to start it at one of those
4:48
points it will sit on that line.
4:50
And then we can do another vector, and it's essentially going between a point on the green line and a
4:55
point on the purple line, but that's definitely going to be a vector on our blue plane.
4:59
Let's go between these two points - that looks pretty straight-forward, so let's call vector b,
5:07
so let's call vector b, let's call that, let's see, two minus one is 'i', three minus two is 'j', and then four minus three, that's just 1k.
5:21
So this vector here is also sitting on the plane. So if I take the cross-product of 'a' and 'b' I am
5:29
going to get a vector that is perpendicular to the plane, or a normal vector to the plane.
5:34
So let's do that. So let's find what 'a' cross 'b' is. 'a' cross 'b' is equal to - and this is how I
5:43
find it easiest - I just write 'i', 'j', 'k', this is really the definition of the cross product, or
5:49
I guess one of them. And we write our first vector, we have 2, 3, 4, and then we have our second vector,
5:56
which is just 1,1,1, and then this is going to be equal to, first we'll look at the 'i' component, so
6:02
cross that row, that column out.
6:04
three times one minus one times four, so that's just three minus four, so it's negative 'i', and then
6:13
minus, we're going to have the 'j', so let we write up minus here, minus , let me just swap signs, we
6:19
have positive, negative, positive, so 'j' , get rid of that column, that row,
6:23
two times one which is two, minus one times four, so that's minus four, is negative 2,
6:28
so we could have written negative 2 here, but the negatives cancel out, so it becomes plus 2j,
6:33
and finally for the 'k', get rid of that row that column, two times one is two, minus one times three,
6:39
is two minus three, which is negative one, so it's negative k.
6:44
So this right here is a normal vector to the plane.
6:52
So if we want to find the equation for that plane, we've done it multiple times, we'd just have to take
7:00
the dot product of that normal vector and any arbitrary vector on that that specified that we can specify
7:13
with with an arbitrary x y and z, and we've done this multiple times in multiple videos.
7:17
If this is any point, x, y, z, that sits on the plane, then the vector - let me draw the vector, let's
7:29
say we go to this point right over here, so this vector right over here is going to be
7:34
- let me draw it the other way actually, so this vector right over here, let's say we're going between
7:39
this point and x,y,z, this vector right here is going to be x minus three i, plus y minus five j, plus
7:53
z minus 7 k.
7:56
That's what this vector is, it sits on the plane, assuming x,y and z sit on the plane.
8:01
So if we take the dot product of this and the normal vector that has got to be equal to zero,
8:06
because it sits on the plane, and then we'll have our equation.
8:09
So let's take 'n' dot that over there, so n dot x minus three i, plus y minus five j, plus z minus seven k.
8:23
If any of this is confusing to you, I've gone into a little bit more depth in previous videos,
8:28
especially in the linear algebra playlist where I talk about constructing the equation of a plane given
8:32
a point on the plane and a normal vector, and even how you find that normal vector,
8:38
so you might want to watch those if you want some review there.
8:40
But these are going to be equal to zero, so when you take the dot product, n, our normal vector is this,
8:46
so we just take the x term, which is negative one, times this x term right over here,
8:51
so negative one times this is just three minus x, and then plus this y component times this y component,
8:58
so it's two times this, so it's plus two y minus ten, and then finally the z component -
9:05
negative one times this. So this is plus seven minus z is equal to zero, and what do we get?
9:15
So we have our negative x, plus two y, minus z, and then is equal to, let's subtract three from both sides
9:27
So if we take it out there it will be minus three. If we add ten to both sides, so then you have
9:35
a plus ten over here, and then we subtract seven from both sides, this becomes a minus seven
9:43
So then on the right-hand-side, negative three plus ten minus seven, well that's just going to be zero!
9:50
And just like that we have the equation for this blue plane over here - the plane that contains these two lines.
10:04
Now remember what we said at the beginning of the video - these two planes are parallel, so the ratio
10:08
of the coefficients on the 'x' terms, the 'y' term and the 'z' term has got to be the same.
10:14
So this one has a positive 2, that has a negative 2, this is just to simplify it, so it looks very similar
10:20
to each other. Let's multiple this equation right here, both sides, by negative one. And then we're going
10:25
to get x minus two y plus z is equal to zero; so this is a completely valid, another alternate way of
10:34
expressing the same plane. And what like about this about this is that it looks very similar to this -
10:39
at least the ratio of the x, y's and z's, negative two y, negative two y; one z, one z, and remember
10:46
the ratios have to be the same.
10:47
So here we have a one-to-one ratio between the z-coefficient and the z-coefficient, the y-coefficient
10:52
and the y-coefficient, so it's also going to be for the x coefficient.
10:56
So here we know if this is going to be parallel to the blue plane we know that 'a' has got to be equal
11:01
to one.
11:03
So this is x minus two y plus z is equal to d. So now let's figure out the actual distance between these
11:18
two planes. So what we can do is we can take a point on this blue plane - and we have several examples
11:24
of points on the blue plane, and find the distance between that point and this plane over here.
11:30
And actually I just finished doing some videos on how to find the distance between a point and a plane,
11:35
so I'm just going to use that formula (if you want it to be proved go watch that video - it's actually
11:39
pretty interesting proof I think) but the distance between let's say this point, (1,2,3), and this plane
11:47
over here, so this distance right here is going to be in the direction of the normal,
11:52
the distance is going to be, you literally just evaluate this, let me do it this way:
12:08
you literally just put in this point for the x, y and z, and then you subtract the d in the numerator,
12:14
and we saw that as the formula for finding the distance. So it's literally going to be one, one,
12:20
(I'm actually using this point right over here)
12:23
So it's going to be one, one, because we just have one x so it's just going to be one minus two times
12:27
two, one minus four (that's two times two), plus three, minus d, over here the d is just d, so we're
12:39
just going to write minus d, just like that, all of that over what is essentially the magnitude of the
12:46
normal vector, and we saw in several videos that's just the square of the coefficients on each of these
12:50
terms right here, and taking the sum of those, taking the square root,
12:54
so it's going to be equal to: 1 squared, plus negative 2 squared which is four, plus one squared which is one.
13:05
So this is going to simplify to the distance is equal to one minus four plus three is zero.
13:13
So in the numerator we have negative d, all of that over the square root of one plus four plus one,
13:21
so all over the square root of six. So they say the distance
13:30
between this plane and this plane over here is square root of six. So they're saying the distance is
13:36
equal to the square root of six, that's what this information right over here is, maybe I should do that
13:44
in another colour.
13:49
The distance between the two planes is going to be the square root of six, and so then if we solve for d,
13:55
multiple both sides of this equation times the square root of six, you get six is equal to negative d,
14:01
or d is equal to negative six.
14:07
Now, what they care about is the absolute value of d, or the absolute distance, so this would be kinda
14:12
the signed distance - it specifies whether we're above or below the plane.
14:15
Since we're below the plane we got a negative number - I just happened to draw it right, if we above
14:19
the plane we would get a positive number.
14:22
So this distance is negative six, the absolute value of it, the absolute value of d which is the same
14:27
as the absolute value of negative six, is equal to six.
14:31
So take any point on this blue plane and you look for the closest point on the orange plane, and they
14:38
will be exactly six apart. Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,v8plb6V8BQo,

- [Voiceover] So we wanna evaluate the definite integral
0:02
from negative one to negative two
0:06
of 16 minus x to the third over x to the third dx.
0:10
Now at first this might seem daunting,
0:12
I have this rational expression, I have xs in the numerators
0:15
and xs in the denominators, but we just have to remember,
0:18
we just have to do some algebraic manipulation,
0:20
and this is going to seem a lot more attractable.
0:22
This is the same thing as the definite integral
0:24
from negative one to negative two of
0:28
16 over x to the third
0:31
minus x to the third
0:33
over x to the third,
0:35
minus x to the third over x to the third dx.
0:38
And now what is that going to be equal to?
0:41
That is going be equal to the definite integral
0:44
from negative one to negative two of,
0:48
I could write this first term right over here,
0:52
let me do this in a different color.
0:54
I could write, I could write this
0:57
as 16x to the negative three, x to the negative three,
1:02
and this second one,
1:05
we have minus x to the third over x to the third.
1:09
Well x to the third is just over,
1:11
x to the third over x to the third
1:12
is just going to be equal to one.
1:14
So this is going to be minus one dx,
1:19
so dx.
1:21
And so what is this going to be equal to?
1:23
Well, let's take the antiderivative of each of these parts
1:26
and then we're going to have to evaluate them
1:28
at the different bounds.
1:29
So, let's see.
1:31
The antiderivative of 16x to the negative three,
1:34
we're just gonna do the power rule
1:35
for derivatives in reverse.
1:37
You can view this as the power rule of integration
1:39
or the power rule of taking the antiderivative
1:42
where what you do is
1:43
you're gonna increase our exponent by one,
1:46
so you're gonna go from negative three to negative two,
1:49
and then you're gonna divide by that amount,
1:52
by negative two.
1:53
So it's going to be 16 divided by negative two
1:57
times x to the negative two.
1:59
All I did is I increased the exponent
2:01
and I divided by that amount.
2:02
So that's the antiderivative here.
2:04
And 16 divided by negative two,
2:07
that is just negative eight.
2:10
So we have negative eight, x to the negative two.
2:12
And then the antiderivative of negative one,
2:15
well, that's just negative x, negative, negative x,
2:21
negative x.
2:23
And actually you might just know that,
2:25
and then hey, if I take the derivative of negative x
2:27
I get negative one, or if you view this
2:29
as negative x to the zero power, because that's what one is,
2:33
well, it's the same thing.
2:34
You increase the exponent by one
2:37
to get x to the first power.
2:39
And then you divide by one and so,
2:40
I mean, you can view it as that right over there,
2:43
but either way you get to negative or minus x.
2:48
And so now we want to evaluate that.
2:50
We're going to evaluate that at the bounds
2:52
and take the difference.
2:54
So we're going to evaluate that at negative two
2:57
and then subtract from that this evaluated at negative one.
3:01
And let me do those in two different colors
3:03
so we can see what's going on.
3:04
So we're gonna evaluate it at negative two
3:06
and we're gonna evaluate it at negative one.
3:09
So let's first evaluate it at negative two.
3:12
So this is going to be equal to,
3:14
this is going to be equal to,
3:16
when you evaluate it at negative two,
3:18
it's going to be negative eight, negative eight
3:22
times x to the negative two.
3:24
So negative two the the negative two power
3:27
minus negative two.
3:30
And from that we're going to subtract it
3:33
and evaluate it at negative one.
3:35
So, it's going to be negative eight times negative one
3:40
to the negative two power minus negative one.
3:45
All right, so then what is this going to be?
3:47
So, negative two the negative two.
3:50
So negative two to the negative two
3:53
is equal to one over negative two squared,
3:57
which is equal to 1/4.
3:59
So this is equal to positive 1/4,
4:03
but then negative eight times positive 1/4
4:07
is going to be equal to negative two.
4:11
And then we have negative two minus negative two,
4:14
so that's negative two plus two.
4:17
And so everything I've just done in this purplish color
4:20
that is just going to be zero.
4:22
And then if we look at what's going on in the orange,
4:26
when you evaluate it at negative one,
4:28
let's see, negative one to the negative two power,
4:31
well, that's one over negative one squared.
4:33
Well, this all is just going to be one.
4:34
And so we're gonna have negative eight plus one,
4:39
which is equal to negative seven.
4:43
So all of this evaluates to negative seven.
4:46
But remember, we're subtracting negative seven,
4:48
and so this is going to result,
4:50
we deserve a little bit of a drum roll,
4:51
this is going to be equal to positive, positive seven.
4:56
And obviously you don't have to write
4:57
that positive out in front,
4:58
I just wrote that just to emphasize
5:00
that this is going to be a positive seven.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,4WJUEXIksH0,

0:00
In your mathematical careers you might
0:03
encounter people who say it is wrong to say
0:05
that i is equal to the principal square root of negative 1.
0:10
And if you ask them why is this wrong,
0:12
they'll show up with this kind of line of logic
0:15
that actually seems pretty reasonable.
0:17
They will tell you that, OK, well
0:19
let's just start with negative 1.
0:21
We know from definition that negative 1
0:23
is equal to i times i.
0:26
Everything seems pretty straightforward right now.
0:28
And then they'll say, well look, if you
0:30
take this, if you assume this part right here,
0:33
then we can replace each of these i's with the square root
0:36
of negative 1.
0:36
And they'd be right.
0:37
So then this would be the same thing
0:39
as the square root of negative 1 times the square root
0:42
of negative 1.
0:43
And then they would tell you that,
0:45
hey, look just from straight up properties
0:48
of the principal square root function,
0:50
they'll tell you that the square root of a times b
0:53
is the same thing as the principal square root
0:55
of a times the principal square root of b.
0:58
And so if you have the principal square root of a times
1:01
the principal square root of b, that's
1:02
the same thing as the square root of a times b.
1:04
So based on this property of the radical of the principal root,
1:09
they'll say that this over here is
1:11
the same thing as the square root
1:13
of negative 1 times negative 1.
1:20
If I have the principal root of the product of two things,
1:23
that's the same thing as the product
1:24
of each of their principal roots.
1:26
I'm doing this in the other order here.
1:28
Here I have the principal root of the products,
1:30
over here I have this on the right.
1:32
And then from that we all know that negative 1 times
1:35
negative 1 is 1.
1:36
So this should be equal to the principal square root of 1.
1:41
And then the principal square root of 1-- Remember,
1:44
this radical means principal square root,
1:45
positive square root, that is just going to be positive 1.
1:51
And they'll say, this is wrong.
1:52
Clearly, negative 1 and positive 1 are not the same thing.
1:59
And they'll argue therefore, you can't make this substitution
2:02
that we did in this step.
2:04
And what you should then point out
2:06
is that this was not the incorrect step.
2:09
That it is true negative 1 is not equal to 1,
2:11
but the faulty line of reasoning here
2:13
was in using this property when both a and b are negative.
2:21
If both a and b are negative, this will never be true.
2:26
So a and b both cannot be negative.
2:36
In fact normally when this property is given-- sometimes
2:38
it's given a little bit in the footnotes
2:40
or you might not even notice it because it's not relevant
2:42
when you're learning it the first time--
2:43
but they'll usually give a little bit of a constraint
2:45
there.
2:45
They'll usually say for a and b greater than or equal to 0.
2:52
So that's where they list this property.
2:53
This is true for a and b greater than or equal 0.
2:56
And in particular, it's false if both a and b are both,
3:00
if they are both negative.
3:03
Now, I've just spent the last three minutes
3:07
saying that people who tell you that this is wrong are wrong.
3:11
But with that said, I will say that you
3:12
have to be a little bit careful about it.
3:16
When we take traditional principal square roots.
3:19
So when you take the principle square root of 4.
3:22
We know that this is positive 2, that 4 actually
3:24
has two square roots.
3:26
There's negative 2 also is a square root of 4.
3:34
If you have negative 2 times negative 2
3:36
it's also equal to 4.
3:38
This radical symbol here means principal square root.
3:42
Or when we're just dealing with real numbers, non
3:44
imaginary, non complex numbers, you
3:46
could really view it as the positive square root.
3:48
This has two square roots, positive and negative 2.
3:50
If you have this radical symbol right here
3:52
principal square roots, it means the positive square root of 2.
3:57
So when you start thinking about taking
3:59
square roots of negative numbers--
4:01
or even in the future we'll do imaginary numbers
4:03
and complex numbers and all the rest--
4:05
you have to expand the definition
4:07
of what this radical means.
4:08
So when you are taking the square root of really
4:12
of any negative number, you're really
4:16
saying that this is no longer the traditional principal
4:19
square root function.
4:20
You're now talking that this is the principal complex square
4:24
root function, or this is now defined
4:25
for complex inputs or the domain,
4:28
it can also generate imaginary or complex outputs,
4:31
or I guess you could call that the range.
4:34
And if you assume that, then really straight
4:36
from this you get that negative, the square root of negative x
4:42
is going to be equal to i times the square root of x.
4:47
And this is only-- and I'm going to make this clear
4:49
because I just told you that this will be false
4:51
if both a and b are negative.
4:52
So this is only true-- So we could
4:55
apply this when x is greater than or equal to 0.
5:06
So if x is greater than or equal to 0,
5:08
then negative x is clearly a negative number,
5:10
or I guess it could also be 0.
5:12
It's a negative number.
5:13
And then we can apply this right over here.
5:16
If x was less than 0, then we would
5:18
be doing all of this nonsense up here.
5:20
And we start to get nonsensical answers.
5:23
And if you look at it this way and you say hey,
5:25
look, i can be the square root of negative one,
5:27
if it's the principal branch of the complex square root
5:30
function.
5:31
Then you could rewrite this right over here
5:33
as the square root of negative 1 times the square root of x.
5:41
And so really the real fault in this logic when people
5:45
say, hey, negative 1 can't be equal to 1,
5:48
the real fault is using this property
5:52
when both a and b, where both of these are negative numbers.
5:57
That will come up with something that is unambiguously false.
6:00
If you expand your definition of the complex
6:03
or expand your definition of the principal root
6:05
to include negative numbers in the domain
6:09
and to include imaginary numbers, then you can do this.
6:13
You can say the square root of negative x
6:16
is the square root of negative 1 times--
6:19
Or you should say the principal square root of negative x--
6:22
I should be particular my words--
6:23
is the same thing as the principal square root
6:26
of negative 1 times the principal square root of x when
6:30
x is greater than or equal to 0.
6:32
And I don't want to confuse you, if x
6:34
is greater than or equal to 0, this negative x, that
6:39
is clearly a negative, or I guess
6:41
you should say a non positive number.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,rYG1D5lUE4I,

0:00
For those of you who are curious
0:01
and have a little bit of a background in calculus,
0:03
I thought I would do a very optional and
0:05
when I say it's optional, you don't have to
0:07
understand this in order to progress with the
0:09
economics playlist, but a very optional proof
0:12
showing you that in general,
0:14
the slope of the marginal revenue curve for a monopolist is
0:17
twice the slope of the demand curve,
0:20
assuming that the demand curve is a line.
0:21
So if the demand curve looks like that, this is price.
0:25
This is quantity. That is demand right over there.
0:28
I'm going to show that the marginal revenue curve
0:30
has twice the slope. It is twice as steep as this.
0:33
It's really twice the negative slope.
0:36
So let me just write price as a function of quantity.
0:39
We know we get price.
0:41
Since this is a line, we can essentially write it in
0:44
our traditional slope y-intercept form.
0:46
In algebra class, you would write
0:48
if this was y and this was x,
0:49
you would write y = mx+b
0:53
where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.
0:56
I'll do something very similar, but instead of y and x
0:58
we have P and Q.
1:00
So, if P = m x Q where m is the slope
1:05
plus ... plus the P-intercept + b.
1:10
So this right over here is b
1:12
and if you were to ... If you were to take your,
1:15
If you were to take your change in P,
1:18
if you were to take your change in P
1:19
and divide it by your change in Q ... your change in Q,
1:23
you would get m. That is your slope,
1:26
change in P / change in Q.
1:30
Now what is going to be our total revenue?
1:33
And this is kind of ... We're just kind of almost doing
1:35
what we've done in the last few videos,
1:36
but we're doing it in general terms.
1:38
So if this is total revenue,
1:40
total revenue as a function of quantity.
1:43
Well, total revenue is just price x quantity.
1:46
Total revenue is just price x quantity.
1:49
We've already written ... We've already written price as a
1:52
function of quantity right over here, so we could take that
1:55
and substitute it ... and substitute it in right over there.
1:58
So we get total revenue is equal to and I'll write it all in blue.
2:03
We have mQ + b and then we're going to multiply that x Q.
2:09
We're going to multiply that x Q or we get
2:12
total revenue = mQ^2.
2:16
mQ^2 + b x Q
2:20
And this is a parabola and it's actually going to be a
2:23
downward sloping parabola because
2:24
m is going to be negative.
2:26
This is downward sloping.
2:27
m has a negative slope, so m is negative.
2:30
So we know ... We know that M < 0 over here.
2:34
That's one of the assumptions we'll make.
2:35
If m < 0, this is going to be a downward opening parabola.
2:40
Total revenue will look something,
2:41
total revenue will look something like that.
2:45
That is our total revenue.
2:46
Now, the marginal revenue as a function of quantity is
2:50
just the derivative and this is the calculus part.
2:52
It's the slope of the tangent line at any given point
2:54
and that is what the derivative is.
2:57
It's the slope of the tangent line at any point as a function
3:00
as a function of quantity. So you give me a quantity,
3:03
I will tell you what the slope of the tangent line of the
3:06
total revenue function is at that point.
3:09
So we essentially just have to take the derivative of this
3:11
with respect to Q.
3:13
So we get D, TR/DQ.
3:18
So how much does total revenue change with a very, very
3:21
small change in quantity, infinitely small, infinitesimal
3:25
change in quantity and this comes straight out of calculus.
3:29
m is a constant. Q^2, the derivative of Q^2 with respect
3:33
to Q is 2Q. So it's going to be 2Q x the constant.
3:38
So it's going to be 2m ... 2mQ.
3:42
And then b is a constant. We're assuming it's given.
3:46
b is a constant.
3:47
The derivative of bQ with respect to Q is just going to be b.
3:53
It's just going to be b.
3:55
And so right over here, this is our marginal revenue curve.
3:58
or I should say our marginal line.
4:00
It is 2mQ + b.
4:03
So notice, it has the same y-intercept as our demand curve
4:08
so definitely starts right over there,
4:10
but it has twice the slope.
4:12
The slope of our demand curve is m.
4:14
The slope of our marginal revenue curve is 2m, is 2m
4:19
and this is a negative slope, so this will be twice as negative.
4:22
So it will look something like this.
4:24
It will look something like this, just like that.
4:27
So no matter what your demand curve is,
4:29
if you assume it's a line like this,
4:32
the marginal revenue curve will be a line with twice the
4:35
slope and in this case, it's twice the negative slope which
4:38
is kind of ... what's going to be generally true.
4:40
Anyway, if you understood that, great.
4:42
You now feel good that this is always the case for a
4:44
linear demand curve like this.
4:46
If you did not understand it, don't worry.

the center of the old circle.
0:52
Now, the reason why this is interesting,
0:54
we already know that this distance, the distance
0:56
between these two centers, this is equal to a radius.
1:00
We also know-- we have a straight edge-- we also
1:04
know that this distance right over here is equal to a radius.
1:10
It's equal to the radius of our new circle right over here.
1:13
We also know that this distance right over here
1:18
is equal to a radius of our old circle.
1:22
And that they both have the same radius.
1:23
So this is a radius between these two points.
1:26
Between these two points is a radius.
1:28
And then, in between these two points is a radius.
1:30
So now, I have constructed an equilateral triangle.
1:34
And essentially, you have to just do this six times.
1:36
And then I'm going to have a hexagon inscribed
1:38
inside the circle.
1:39
Let me do it again.
1:40
So we'll go from here to here.
1:45
This is a radius of my new circle, which
1:48
is the same as the radius of the old circle.
1:51
And I could go from here to here.
1:55
That's the radius of my old circle.
1:57
So I have another equilateral triangle.
1:58
Radius, radius, radius.
2:00
Another equilateral triangle.
2:02
I've just got to do this, I have to do this four more times.
2:05
So let me go to my original.
2:07
Let's see, let me make sure I can-- well,
2:09
it's actually going to be hard for me to-- let me just
2:11
add another circle here, to do it on the other side.
2:14
So if I put the center of it right-- I
2:19
want to move it a little bit, right over--
2:22
I want to make it the same size.
2:24
So oh, that's close enough.
2:27
And let's see, that looks pretty close.
2:32
That's the same size.
2:34
Now, let me move it over here.
2:35
Now, I want this center to be on the circle, right like that.
2:40
And now, I'm ready to draw some more equilateral triangles.
2:46
And really, I don't have to even draw the inside of it.
2:48
Now, I see my six vertices for my hexagon,
2:51
here, here, here, here, here, here.
2:55
And I think you're satisfied now that you could break this up
2:58
into six equilateral triangles.
3:01
So let's do that.
3:02
So this would be the base of one of those equilateral triangles.
3:06
And actually, let me move these.
3:08
Let me move this one out of the way.
3:10
I can move this one right over here.
3:12
Because I really just care about the hexagon itself.
3:15
And I can move this right over here.
3:17
But we know that these are all the lengths of the radius
3:20
anyway.
3:21
Actually, I'm not even having to change the length there.
3:23
Then, I have to just connect one more right down here.
3:26
So let me add another straight edge, connect those two points.
3:30
And I would have done it.
3:31
I would have constructed my regular hexagon inscribed
3:38
in the circle.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Yu4eqwGFJK8,

0:00
- [Voiceover] I could imagine
0:00
that even the earliest human beings,
0:02
or possibly pre-human beings
0:04
had asked themselves the questions,
0:06
""Why am I here? What is the nature of reality?
0:10
""Why is the universe organized the way that it is?""
0:13
And these questions are what we attempt to answer
0:17
in the field of physics...
0:21
In the field of physics,
0:22
which you could view
0:23
maybe right after mathematics
0:24
as the purest of the sciences.
0:27
So you have math, which is very pure,
0:30
and then on that foundation of math
0:33
you have physics.
0:34
And physics really does try to use that mathematics
0:39
along with some core ideas
0:41
to explain the phenomena,
0:43
all the phenomena,
0:44
of the universe.
0:45
And physicists will the the first to admit
0:47
that they are just beginning to understand
0:49
the nature of reality,
0:51
the nature of everything around us.
0:53
Now a lot of times, we think physics
0:54
is only limited to things like cosmological phenomena
0:59
or getting rockets into space,
1:01
or how waves move or building structures.
1:04
But physics is the foundation for
1:07
all of the other sciences.
1:09
When we think about chemistry,
1:10
when we think about chemistry,
1:12
which is at the end of the day
1:13
interactions between atoms,
1:15
those interactions are really physics-based interactions.
1:18
So chemistry, chemistry is actually laid down
1:22
on a foundation of physics.
1:25
And then even when we think about ourselves,
1:28
our bodies, even our consciousness, our brains,
1:30
it really all boils down to chemistry and physics.
1:35
It boils down to interactions between atoms
1:37
and even mechanical properties of our bodies.
1:40
And so even biology,
1:43
even what we are,
1:45
is built on a foundation of chemistry.
1:49
So this is biology right over here,
1:53
which is built on a foundation of physics,
1:54
which is highly dependent on some of the math
1:57
that you've been learning your whole life
1:59
and that you will continue to learn.
2:00
And that fundamental question that you might have said,
2:03
""Well you know, hey, why am I learning this math?""
2:04
Well one, 'cause the math is beautiful,
2:06
but also you will see that it starts to,
2:08
in almost the most pure way,
2:10
describe the structure of the universe.
2:13
And we're going to see that more and more and more
2:15
as we go into physics.
2:17
All of this complex phenomena
2:19
that you see around us,
2:20
whether we're looking at a galaxy
2:21
or we're looking at ocean waves,
2:22
or we're looking at even biological systems,
2:25
we'll see that a shocking amount of them
2:28
can start to be described using some fairly elegant
2:31
mathematics that we can build on
2:33
and continue to build on.
2:34
Simple or elegant mathematics
2:36
like force is equal to mass times acceleration.
2:40
And we're gonna talk about force and acceleration
2:43
as vector quantities.
2:45
We're gonna think about things like displacement,
2:48
and I'll put it as a vector quantity,
2:50
and we'll soon learn more about vector
2:52
and scalar quantities are.
2:53
Displacement is equal to velocity times time.
2:58
We'll learn things like accelaration
3:00
is equal to change in velocity over change in time.
3:04
What we'll see with even a handful
3:06
of very simple ideas like this.
3:09
We'll go into much more depth in future videos.
3:11
You can explain all sorts of complex phenomena.
3:14
And the one thing that I always loved about physics,
3:16
and I don't think it's always fully appreciated,
3:18
sometimes as you start to learn physics,
3:20
you'll see all these complicated formula,
3:21
all of these kind of complicated problems,
3:24
but it's super valuable to realize
3:27
it's all coming from some of these basic ideas.
3:29
Some of the things that I just mentioned,
3:31
these ideas, we're gonna explore ideas of energy.
3:34
We're going to explore Newton's laws.
3:37
We're going to explain, we're gonna think about
3:39
what are the the different types of forces out there,
3:41
and why they might, why they might actually exist.
3:44
At its essence, it's all about trying to
3:48
explain the complexity of the universe,
3:51
predict what is going to happen
3:52
based on simple ideas.
3:55
And that's what physics is all about.
3:58
Now when we think of physics,
3:59
it's been studied by humanity for a very, very long time.
4:02
In fact, I'm sure we don't know
4:04
who the first physicists were.
4:07
But some of the,
4:08
I guess you could say foundational thinkers
4:11
in physics are these gentlemen that I have here.
4:14
And this is just a...
4:15
You could kind of say
4:16
this is some of the most prominent thinkers in physics,
4:19
but this is by no means a complete list.
4:21
First and foremost, we'd wanna include Isaac Newton.
4:25
Especially when you start to study physics,
4:27
you're starting to understand the world
4:30
as Newton understood it.
4:31
He understood, ""Hey, you know,
4:32
""things don't fall to the ground
4:34
""just 'cause they always fall to,
4:35
""just 'cause that's the way the universe is.
4:37
""That's a force that's acting on it,
4:39
""and maybe that same force that's causing me
4:41
""to be stuck to my chair right now
4:44
""is what keeps Earth orbiting around the Sun
4:46
""or the moon orbiting around the Earth.""
4:50
He developed Law of Gravitation,
4:53
Newton's Laws, and we're going to study that
4:54
as we delve into our basic physics.
4:57
And what we'll see,
4:58
even classical mechanics,
5:00
the physics that Newton established,
5:03
can explain a large range of phenomena
5:05
with amazing precision.
5:07
But as we get into the early 20th century,
5:10
physics starts to get even more wild
5:12
as we start to look at the scales
5:14
of the super small,
5:15
and we have Max Planck giving us quantum mechanics,
5:18
and then we have Albert Einstein
5:20
as we start thinking about super fast speeds,
5:23
the speed of light, and we realize that's an absolute.
5:26
That nothing can travel faster than the speed of light,
5:29
which is this mind-boggling thing
5:31
that we have these notions
5:33
of general and special relativity,
5:35
and we start realizing that the universe
5:37
is in some ways more bizarre, and more mysterious,
5:40
and more fascinating than we ever could have imagined.
5:43
But all of the work, even to understand the modern physics
5:46
of Max Planck and Albert Einstein,
5:49
it's based on a lot of the core ideas
5:52
that were given to us by Isaac Newton,
5:54
even people before Isaac Newton.
5:56
So as you go into your study of physics,
5:58
and I'm kind of a physicist wannabe.
6:01
I wanted to be a physicist.
6:03
I imagined kind of,
6:04
'cause it's all about, we all wonder,
6:06
why are we here?
6:07
What is the nature of reality?
6:09
Why do things happen the way they are?
6:12
And these are the questions that physics
6:14
is attempting to answer.
6:16
And so as you go into your study of physics,
6:19
I wanna leave you with some quotes
6:21
from these three gentlemen.
6:22
So the first two are from Isaac Newton.
6:25
""Truth is ever to be found in simplicity,
6:29
""and not in the multiplicity and the confusion of things.""
6:32
And I really wanted to stress this,
6:34
because a lot of times in your studies,
6:35
you might be finding yourself memorizing formulas
6:37
and vocabulary, but that's,
6:41
if you're doing that, you're just at the very surface.
6:43
But if you really start to think about it,
6:45
really start to think about where these things come from,
6:48
it'll come to simpler and simpler and more intuitive ideas.
6:51
And then, you are getting closer to the truth.
6:54
Now, I love this second quote from Isaac Newton.
6:57
""I do not know what I may appear to...
7:00
""I do not know what I may appear to the world,
7:03
""but to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy
7:07
""playing on the seashore,
7:08
""and diverting myself in now and then
7:11
""finding a smoother pebble
7:12
""or prettier shell than ordinary,
7:14
""whilst the great ocean of truth
7:17
""lay all undiscovered before me.""
7:20
I like to imagine there's so much,
7:22
we, even though we think we know so much,
7:24
that we haven't even learned a small fraction
7:27
of how the universe really is.
7:29
And even a great thinker like Isaac Newton,
7:31
he recognized this.
7:32
He's like, ""Hey, I'm just kind of dabbling
7:34
""into the seashore and picking up a pebble there,
7:36
""but there's this vast ocean
7:37
""that I can't even begin to understand.""
7:39
You can even imagine alien civilizations
7:41
that are thousands of years ahead of us
7:43
technologically or scientifically
7:45
or even millions of years,
7:47
how they might perceive the reality,
7:49
and they might see us as ants
7:50
in that we are just beginning
7:51
to scrape the surface of how the world works.
7:55
This is from Max Planck.
7:56
""When you change the way you look at things,
7:59
""the things you look at change.""
8:01
And I find this to be pretty profound,
8:03
because it is true.
8:04
As you study physics,
8:05
you will start to see, whoa,
8:06
most of what we consider to be reality,
8:08
our current understanding is based
8:09
on these forces, but what are these forces?
8:11
And even these things that we think are solid,
8:14
when we go down to the atomic level,
8:15
we see it's mostly empty space
8:17
and it's really just the interaction of forces
8:18
that make us think that something
8:20
is solid or there or tangible is some way.
8:23
And you realize these very tangible things
8:24
aren't so tangible after all.
8:27
At the end of the day, the whole world
8:28
is just a mental model that we have.
8:31
In some ways,
8:32
it's an illusion
8:34
that our mind creates so that we can operate inside of it.
8:37
But we're just beginning to understand it.
8:40
And last but not least,
8:42
and there's actually a ton of great quotes
8:43
from these folks and others,
8:44
but especially Albert Einstein.
8:46
""The most beautiful experience
8:48
""we can have is the mysterious.
8:50
""It is the fundamental emotion that stands
8:53
""at the cradle of true art and true science.""
8:56
And I really want you to take this to heart
8:58
as you study your physics.
9:00
There will be times where we're going
9:02
to be building our tool kits.
9:03
What's a vector?
9:04
What's a scalar?
9:04
Going into some mathematics,
9:06
proving some formulas.
9:07
Those are the tool kits,
9:09
but then we're gonna try to understand
9:10
fundamental phenomena.
9:12
How does the universe actually work?
9:14
And if when we start to think about these,
9:16
you don't get a few chills on your skin,
9:18
a few goosebumps, and feel that the universe
9:21
is more mysterious than you thought,

0:00
What I want to do in this video is answer an age-old question,
0:04
or at least an interesting question to me.
0:06
And the question is, let's say I have a ledge here--
0:10
I have a ledge or cliff, or maybe
0:12
this is a building of some kind.
0:14
And let's say it has height, h.
0:17
So let's say it has a height of h, right over here.
0:21
And what I'm curious about is if I were to either-- Let's
0:25
say that this is me over here, so this is me.
0:29
If I were to either jump, myself--
0:32
that's not recommended for very large h's.
0:35
Or If I were to throw something, maybe a rock off of this
0:38
ledge, how fast would either myself or that rock
0:42
be going right before it hits the ground?
0:48
And like all of the other videos we're
0:49
doing on projectile motion right now,
0:52
we're going to ignore air resistance.
0:54
And for small h's and for small velocities,
0:57
that's actually reasonable.
0:59
Or if the object is very aerodynamic
1:02
and is kind of dense, then the air resistance
1:04
will matter less.
1:05
If it's me kind of belly flopping from a high altitude,
1:08
then the air resistance will start to matter a lot.
1:10
But for the sake of simplicity, we're going to assume no air.
1:15
Or we're not going to take into effect
1:17
the effects of air resistance.
1:19
Or we could assume that we're doing
1:20
this on an Earth-like planet that has no atmosphere.
1:24
However you want to do it.
1:25
So let's just think about the problem.
1:27
And just so you know, some of you might say,
1:28
that's not realistic.
1:29
But this actually would be realistic for a small h.
1:32
If you were to jump off of the roof of a one-story building,
1:35
air resistance will not be a major component
1:37
in determining your speed if.
1:39
It was to be a much larger building, then all of a sudden
1:41
it matters.
1:42
And I don't recommend you do any of these things.
1:43
Those are all very dangerous things.
1:45
Much better to do it with a rock.
1:46
So that's actually the example we're going to be considering.
1:49
So let's just think about this a little bit.
1:52
We want to figure out-- So at the top,
1:56
right when the thing gets dropped,
1:57
right when the rock gets dropped,
1:59
you have an initial velocity of 0.
2:05
And once again, we're going to use the convention here
2:07
that positive velocity means upwards,
2:11
or a positive vector means up, a negative vector means down.
2:16
So we're going to have an initial velocity over here
2:18
of 0.
2:19
And then at the bottom we're going
2:21
to have some final velocity here that
2:30
is going to be a negative number.
2:33
So it's going to have some negative value over here.
2:36
So this is going to be negative.
2:39
This is going to be a negative number right over there.
2:43
And we know that the acceleration of gravity
2:46
for an object on free fall, an object in free
2:49
fall near the surface of the earth.
2:51
We know it, and we're going to assume that it's constant.
2:54
So our constant acceleration is going
2:56
to be negative 9.8 meters per second squared.
3:01
So what we're going to do is given an h,
3:03
and given that their initial velocity is 0
3:05
and that our acceleration is negative 9.8 meters per
3:07
squared, we want to figure out what our final velocity is
3:11
going to be right before we hit the ground.
3:14
We're going to assume that this h is
3:15
given in meters, right over here.
3:17
And we'll get an answer in meters
3:18
per second for that final velocity.
3:20
So let's see how we can figure it out.
3:22
So we know some basic things.
3:24
And the whole point of these is to really show you
3:26
that you can always derive these more interesting questions
3:29
from very basic things that we know.
3:32
So we know that displacement is equal to average velocity times
3:41
change in time.
3:45
And we know that average velocity--
3:48
if we assume acceleration is constant,
3:50
which we are doing-- average velocity
3:53
is the final velocity plus the initial velocity over 2.
4:01
And then our change in time, the amount of elapsed time
4:06
that goes by-- this is our change in velocity.
4:10
So elapsed time is the same thing.
4:12
I write it over here-- is our change in velocity
4:16
divided by our acceleration.
4:20
And just to make sure you understand this,
4:22
it just comes straight from the idea
4:24
that acceleration-- or let me write it this way--
4:26
that change in velocity is just acceleration times time.
4:32
Or I should say, acceleration times change in time.
4:36
So if you divide both sides of this equation by acceleration,
4:39
you get this right over here.
4:42
So that is what our displacement-- Remember,
4:43
I want an expression for displacement
4:45
in terms of the things we know and the one
4:48
thing that we want to find out.
4:50
Well, for this example right over here,
4:55
we know a couple of things.
4:56
Well actually, let me take it step by step.
4:58
We know that our initial velocity is 0.
5:03
So this first expression for the example we're doing,
5:06
the average velocity is going to be our final velocity divided
5:10
by 2, since our initial velocity is 0.
5:13
Our change in velocity is the same thing
5:19
as final velocity minus initial velocity.
5:25
And once again, we know that the initial velocity is 0 here.
5:28
So our change in velocity is the same thing
5:30
as our final velocity.
5:32
So once again, this will be times.
5:33
Instead of writing change in velocity here,
5:35
we could just write our final velocity
5:37
because we're starting at 0.
5:38
Initial velocity is 0.
5:39
So times our final velocity divided by our acceleration.
5:46
Final velocity is the same thing as change in velocity
5:48
because initial velocity was 0.
5:51
And all of this is going to be our displacement.
5:56
And now it looks like we have everything
5:59
written in things we know.
6:01
So if we multiply both sides of this expression
6:04
or both sides of this equation by 2 times our acceleration
6:11
on that side.
6:12
And we multiply the left-hand side
6:14
by-- I'll do the same colors-- 2 times our acceleration.
6:21
On the left hand side, we get 2 times our acceleration
6:27
times our displacement is going to be equal to,
6:35
on the right hand side, the 2 cancels out with the 2,
6:38
the acceleration cancels out with the acceleration--
6:40
it will be equal to the velocity,
6:42
our final velocity squared.
6:49
Final velocity times final velocity.
6:52
And so we can just solve for final velocity here.
6:56
So we know our acceleration is negative 9.8 meters
7:01
per second squared.
7:02
So let me write this over here.
7:04
So this is negative 9.8.
7:07
So we have 2 times negative 9.8--
7:10
let me just multiply that out.
7:12
So that's negative 19.6 meters per second squared.
7:19
And then what's our displacement going to be?
7:21
What's the displacement over the course
7:23
of dropping this rock off of this ledge or off of this roof?
7:27
So you might be tempted to say that our displacement is h.
7:29
But remember, these are vector quantities,
7:32
so you want to make sure you get the direction right.
7:34
From where the rock started to where it ends, what's it doing?
7:39
It's going to go a distance of h,
7:41
but it's going to go a distance of h downwards.
7:44
And our convention is down is negative.
7:48
So in this example, our displacement
7:52
from when it leaves your hand to when it hits the ground,
7:55
the displacement is going to be equal to negative h.
7:58
It's going to travel a distance of h,
8:00
but it's going to travel that distance downwards.
8:02
And that's why this vector notion is very important here.
8:05
Our convention is very important here.
8:07
So our displacement over here is going to be negative h meters.
8:17
So this is the variable, and this
8:19
is the shorthand for meters.
8:20
So when you multiply these two things out,
8:22
lucky for us these negatives cancel out,
8:24
and you get 19.6h meters squared per second squared is equal
8:37
to our final velocity squared.
8:44
And notice, when you square something
8:45
you lose the sign information.
8:47
If our final velocity was positive, you square it,
8:49
you still get a positive value.
8:50
If it was negative and you square it,
8:52
you still get a positive value.
8:53
But remember, in this example, we're
8:55
going to be moving downward.
8:56
So we want the negative version of this.
8:58
So to really figure out our final velocity,
9:01
we take, essentially, the negative square root
9:03
of both sides of this equation.
9:07
So if we were to take the square root of both sides of this,
9:10
you take the square root of that side,
9:12
you take the square root of that side, you will get--
9:14
and I'll flip them around-- your final velocity, we could say,
9:21
is equal to the square root of 19.6h.
9:25
And you can even take the square root of the meter squared
9:27
per second squared, treat them almost like variables,
9:30
even though they're units.
9:31
And then outside of the radical sign,
9:33
you will get a meters per second.
9:35
And the thing I want to be careful here
9:37
is if we just take the principal root here,
9:39
the principal root here is the positive square root.
9:41
But we know that our velocity is going to be downwards here,
9:44
because that is our convention.
9:45
So we want to make sure we get the negative square root.
9:50
So let's try it out with some numbers.
9:52
We've essentially solved what we set out
9:54
to solve at the beginning of this video,
9:56
how fast would we be falling, as a function of the height.
9:59
Well, let's try it out with something.
10:01
So let's say that the height is-- I don't know,
10:03
let's say the height is 5 meters, which
10:09
would be probably jumping off of a
10:12
or throwing a rock off of a one-story, maybe
10:14
a commercial one-story building.
10:18
That's about 5 meters, would be about 15 feet.
10:20
So yeah, about the roof of a commercial building,
10:23
give or take.
10:24
So let's turn it on.
10:27
And so what do we get?
10:28
If we put 5 meters in here, we get 19.6 times 5 gives us 98.
10:38
So almost 100.
10:41
And then, we want to take the square root of that,
10:43
so it's going to be almost 10.
10:45
So the square root of 98 gives us roughly 9.9.
10:51
And we want the negative square root of that.
10:53
in that situation, when the height is 5 meters-- So
10:56
if you jump off of a one-story commercial building,
10:59
right at the bottom, or if you throw a rock off that, right
11:01
at the bottom, right before it hits the ground,
11:03
it will have a velocity of negative 9.9 meters per second.
11:11
So negative 9.9 meters per second.
11:15
I'll leave it up to you, as an exercise,
11:17
to figure out how fast this is either kilometers
11:20
per hour or miles per hour because it's pretty fast.
11:23
It's not something you's want to do.
11:24
And this is just off of a one-story building.
11:26
But you can usually figure this out.
11:28
You could use this for, really, any height as
11:30
long as we're reasonably close to the surface of the earth
11:33
and you ignore the effects of air resistance.
11:35
At really high heights, especially if the object is not
11:38
that aerodynamic, then air resistance
11:40
will start to matter a lot.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,2ZgBJxT9pbU,

0:00
Like we've done in the last several videos, let's assume
0:03
that we have some set of basis vectors B.
0:07
And let's say our basis is going to be v1 v2
0:11
all the way to vk.
0:14
So this will span a subspace of dimension k.
0:18
And let's assume that each of these guys are members of Rn.
0:22
So v1 v2 all the way to vk.
0:27
They're all members of Rn.
0:30
Now in the last video, we saw that we can define a change of
0:33
basis matrix.
0:35
And it's a fancy word, but all it means is a matrix that has
0:39
these basis vectors as its columns.
0:41
So v1, v2 all the way to vk as its columns.
0:48
So we're going to have k columns and we're going to
0:52
have n rows.
0:53
Because each of these guys are members of Rn, so they're
0:55
going to have n entries.
0:56
So we're going to have n rows.
0:58
So it's going to be an n by k matrix.
1:01
And we saw in the last video that if I have some vector a
1:08
that is a member of Rn-- and assuming that a is in the span
1:14
of B-- I can represent a.
1:16
I could say that a is equal to the change of basis matrix
1:22
times the coordinates of a with respect to our basis.
1:28
This is what we saw in the last video.
1:30
If I have the coordinates of a with respect to B, I can
1:34
multiply it by the change of basis matrix and I'll get my
1:36
vector a in standard coordinates.
1:38
Or if I have my vector a in standard coordinates, then I
1:41
can solve for my vector a in coordinates with respect to B.
1:45
We saw that in the last video.
1:47
Now let's take a special case.
1:50
Let's assume that C is invertible.
2:02
What does that mean?
2:03
Or what does that tell us about C?
2:05
Well if C is invertible, it's two things.
2:07
It means that C is a square matrix or has the same number
2:11
rows and columns.
2:12
And that its rows or columns-- You can pick either of them--
2:15
have to be linearly independent.
2:16
So linearly independent, let's just pick columns.
2:20
Now the second statement is a bit redundant.
2:21
We know that C has linearly independent columns, because
2:24
its columns are bases for a subspace.
2:28
So a basis, by definition, all of the vectors have to be
2:31
linearly independent.
2:32
So we know this is a bit redundant.
2:37
But what's interesting is if we know that C is invertible,
2:39
C has to be square.
2:41
And if all of these vectors are members of Rn, then k has
2:44
to be equal to n.
2:48
So C is square means that k is equal to n or that we have n
2:55
basis vectors.
2:59
Now if that's the case, what is the span of B?
3:03
Think about it.
3:04
We have n linearly independent vectors in Rn.
3:20
So any time you have n linearly independent vectors
3:23
in Rn, those guys are a basis for Rn.
3:27
Because any basis that has n entries-- and they're all
3:30
linearly independent-- is going to be a basis for Rn.
3:35
So then B is a basis for Rn.
3:42
So if we know that C is invertible, we also know that
3:45
you can get to any vector in Rn by some linear combination
3:50
of your basis vectors right there.
3:54
In the last video, we had to make sure that this guy was in
3:59
the span of these vectors.
4:01
But now we don't have to make sure, because if C is
4:03
invertible, then the span of B is going to be equal to Rn.
4:17
Or another way you could say it is if the span of B is
4:19
equal to Rn.
4:21
If we have n vectors here, if k was equal to n, then we know
4:25
that the span of B would be equal to Rn.
4:28
And so we'd have n vectors here, n linearly independent
4:31
columns here, and it would be an n by n matrix with all of
4:34
the columns linearly independent.
4:35
So then C would be invertible.
4:37
So we could write if and only if.
4:39
And we could write it the other way.
4:41
If the span of B is Rn, then C is invertible.
4:53
And that's useful, because if either of these things are
4:56
true, then we can rewrite the same equation.
5:00
So let's say if we know this and we're looking for that, we
5:03
can just multiply C times that.
5:05
Let's say we know this and we're looking for that.
5:07
Before we had to do that augmented matrix and solve for
5:10
it, whatnot.
5:10
But if we know C is invertible, then one, we know
5:15
that any vector here can be represented in
5:19
the span of our basis.
5:20
So any vector here can be represented as linear
5:22
combinations of these guys.
5:23
So you know that any vector can be represented in these
5:27
coordinates or with coordinates with
5:28
respect to our basis.
5:30
We can multiply both sides of this equation times C inverse.
5:34
And what do you get if you multiply?
5:35
So it becomes C inverse C times our coordinates of a
5:40
with respect to B is equal to C inverse times a.
5:45
This is just the identity matrix right there.
5:50
Another way of writing this is that the coordinates of a,
5:54
with respect to our basis B, which spans all of Rn, is
5:59
equal to C inverse times our vector a.
6:04
Let's apply this a little bit.
6:06
Let's apply this.
6:07
Let's use this information, what we've done in this video.
6:11
Let's do some concrete examples.
6:13
So let's say I have some basis.
6:20
Let me define two vectors.
6:21
I'll do it this way.
6:22
So let's say I have v1 is equal to the vector 1, 3.
6:28
And let's say v2 is equal to the vector 2, 1.
6:35
And I have a basis that is equal to the set of v1 and v2.
6:43
Now I'll leave it for you to verify that these guys are
6:45
linearly independent.
6:46
But if I have two linearly independent vectors in R2,
6:49
then B is a basis for R2.
6:59
And if we write the change of basis matrix, if we say C is
7:05
equal to 1, 3, 2, 1, we know that C is invertible.
7:10
And actually to show that C is invertible, we can just
7:12
calculate its inverse.
7:14
So what's the determinant of C?
7:16
The determinant of C is equal to 1 times 1 minus 2 times 3.
7:24
So it's equal minus 5.
7:27
That's the determinant of C.
7:28
And so C inverse-- We figured out a general formula for
7:31
doing this for 2 by 2 matrices-- is equal to 1 over
7:35
the determinant of C, so 1 over minus 5 times-- You
7:42
switch these two guys, so you switch the 1's, and you make
7:45
these two guys negative.
7:47
So minus 2, and then minus 3.
7:50
And the very fact that this guy, the determinant of C, was
7:54
non-zero told us that this was invertible.
7:57
But anyway, this is C inverse.
7:59
So let's say that I have some vector a that
8:04
is a member of R2.
8:09
I'm just going to pick some random numbers.
8:10
Let's say that a is equal to 7, 2.
8:13
And I want to find out what the coordinates of a are with
8:17
respect to my basis B.
8:24
Well we go to this situation.
8:26
We know what a is, so we just multiply a times C inverse to
8:32
get this guy right here, to get the coordinates of a with
8:35
respect to B.
8:37
So let me write that down.
8:38
So what is C?
8:39
So C is that.
8:40
C inverse is that.
8:41
So we could write the coordinates of a with respect
8:46
to B is equal to C inverse times the standard
8:50
coordinates of a.
8:51
Or this is the same thing.
8:53
Let me put the actual numbers here.
8:54
The coordinates of a with respect to B are going to be
8:58
equal to C inverse, which is minus 1/5 times 1 minus 3
9:05
minus 2, 1, times a, times 7, 2.
9:15
And what is this equal to?
9:15
This is equal to minus 1/5.
9:19
And then we're going to get 1 times 7 plus minus 2 times 2.
9:24
So it's minus 4.
9:25
So 7 minus 4 is 3.
9:27
And then we're going to get minus 3 times 7, which is
9:30
minus 21, plus 1 times 2.
9:33
So minus 21 plus 2 is minus is 19.
9:39
So the coordinates of a with respect to the basis B are
9:46
going to be equal to-- Let me just multiply the negative
9:48
1/5-- you get minus 3/5.
9:52
And then you get plus 19/5.
9:55
So 19 over 5.
10:00
Just like that.
10:00
And let's verify that.
10:03
This means that a is equal to minus 3/5 times our first
10:06
basis vector plus 19/5 times our second basis vector.
10:10
Let's verify that that's the case.
10:12
So let's see, minus 3/5 times 1, 3, plus 19/5 times 2, 1.
10:25
Let's see what this is going to be equal to.
10:31
Let me write the two vectors.
10:33
This is minus 3/5 times 3 is minus 9/5.
10:42
And there we're going to add it to this guy.
10:45
So this guy is 2 times 19 is 38/5.
10:51
Right?
10:52
And then 19/5 times 1 is 19/5.
10:56
And then if you add these two vectors
10:58
together, what do we get?
11:00
We get minus 3/5 plus 38/5.
11:04
That's 35/3.
11:06
35/5 is 7, minus 9/5 plus 19/5.
11:13
That's 10/5 or 2.
11:16
And there you have it.
11:17
That was our original a.
11:19
So we see that a can definitely be represented as
11:21
minus 3/5 times our first basis vector plus 19/5 times
11:26
our second basis vector.
11:28
Now that was a case where we had some vector a and we
11:31
wanted to represent it in coordinates with respect to B.
11:34
What if we had the other way?
11:36
What if we said that some vector w's coordinates with
11:43
respect to B are-- I'll do something simple-- are 1, 1.
11:50
Then what is w in standard coordinates?
11:54
Well there we can just multiply.
11:58
Remember w is just equal to the change of basis matrix
12:01
times w's coordinates with respect to the basis B.
12:05
So w is going to be equal to the change of basis matrix,
12:10
which is just 1, 3, 2, 1, times the coordinates of w
12:19
with respect to B times 1, 1.
12:22
Which is equal to 1 times 1 plus 2 times 1 is 3.
12:27
And then 3 times 1 plus 1 plus 1.
12:31
So 3 times 1 is 3, plus 1 is 4.
12:35
So w is just equal to the vector 3, 4.
12:38
So there you see if our change of basis matrix is invertible,
12:41
which is really just another way of saying that are basis
12:44
spans Rn-- in this example it was R2-- then you can easily
12:49
go back and forth between coordinate representations in
12:52
our standard coordinates and coordinate representations
12:59
with respect to our basis.
13:02
Right?
13:02
This is with respect to the basis.
13:03
This is in standard coordinates.
13:08
And you can do that just simply by either using this
13:12
information or just saying, oh, the coordinates with
13:16
respect to the basis equal to C inverse times a, or the
13:18
inverse of our change of basis matrix times a.
13:21
Or saying our coordinates with respect to the standard basis
13:27
is just equal to the change of basis matrix times the
13:30
coordinates with respect to the basis.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,meibWcbGqt4,

0:00
Let's see if we can learn a thing or two
0:01
about significant figures, sometimes
0:06
called significant digits.
0:07
And the idea behind significant figures
0:10
is just to make sure that when you do a big computation
0:13
and you have a bunch of digits there,
0:14
that you're not over-representing
0:16
the amount of precision that you had,
0:17
that the result isn't more precise than the things
0:20
that you actually measured, that you used to get that result.
0:24
Before we go into the depths of it
0:25
and how you use it with computation,
0:27
let's just do a bunch of examples
0:28
of identifying significant figures.
0:30
Then we'll try to come up with some rules of thumb.
0:32
But the general way to think about it is, which digits
0:34
are really giving me information about how precise
0:38
my measurement is?
0:39
So on this first thing right over here,
0:41
the significant figures are this 7, 0, 0.
0:45
So over here, you have three significant figures.
0:51
And it might make you a little uncomfortable that we're not
0:53
including these 0's that are after the decimal point
0:57
and before this 7, that we're not including those.
0:59
Because you're just like, that does help define the number.
1:02
And that is true, but it's not telling us
1:05
how precise our measurement is.
1:06
And to try to understand this a little bit better,
1:08
imagine if this right over here was a measurement
1:11
of kilometers, so if we measured 0.00700 kilometers.
1:19
This would be the exact same thing as 7.00 meters.
1:26
Maybe, in fact, we just used a meter stick.
1:28
And we said it's exactly 7.00 meters.
1:32
So we measured to the nearest centimeter.
1:34
And we just felt like writing it in kilometers.
1:36
These two numbers are the exact same thing.
1:39
They're just different units.
1:40
But I think when you look over here,
1:41
it makes a lot more sense why you only
1:43
have three significant figures.
1:45
These 0's are just shifting it based
1:50
on the units of measurement that you're using.
1:53
But the numbers that are really giving you the precision
1:55
are the 7, the 0, and the 0.
1:58
And the reason why we're counting these trailing 0's is
2:00
that whoever wrote this number didn't have to write them down.
2:03
They wrote them down to explicitly say,
2:05
look, I measured this far.
2:06
If they didn't measure this far, they
2:08
would have just left these 0's off.
2:10
And they would have just told you 7 meters, not 7.00.
2:14
Let's do the next one.
2:15
So based on the same idea, we have the 5 and the 2.
2:18
The non-zero digits are going to be significant figures.
2:21
You don't include this leading 0,
2:23
by the same logic that if this was 0.052 kilometers,
2:28
this would be the same thing as 52 meters, which clearly only
2:33
has two significant figures.
2:37
So you don't want to count leading
2:42
0's before the first non-zero digit, I guess we could say.
2:52
You don't want to include those.
2:54
You just want to include all the non-zero digits and everything
2:57
in between, and trailing 0's if a decimal point is involved.
3:03
I'll make those ideas a little bit more formal.
3:06
So over here, the person did 370.
3:08
And then they wrote the decimal point.
3:10
If they didn't write the decimal point,
3:12
it would be a little unclear on how precise this was.
3:14
But because they wrote the decimal point,
3:16
it means that they measured it exactly to be 370.
3:19
They didn't get 372 and then round down.
3:21
Or they didn't have kind of a roughness only
3:24
to the nearest tens place.
3:25
This decimal tells you that all three of these are significant.
3:29
So this is three significant figures over here.
3:34
Then on this next one, once again, this decimal
3:37
tells us that not only did we get to the nearest one,
3:40
but then we put another trailing 0 here,
3:41
which means we got to the nearest tenth.
3:43
So in this situation, once again,
3:45
we have three significant figures.
3:48
Over here, the 7 is in the hundreds.
3:52
But the measurement went all the way down
3:54
to the thousandths place.
3:55
And even though there are 0's in between,
3:57
those 0's are part of our measurement,
3:59
because they are in between non-zero digits.
4:02
So in this situation, every digit here,
4:06
the way it's written, is a significant digit.
4:08
So you have six significant digits.
4:12
Now, this last one is ambiguous.
4:14
The 37,000-- it's not clear whether you
4:17
measured exactly 37,000.
4:19
Maybe you measured to the nearest one,
4:21
and you got an exact number.
4:22
You got exactly 37,000.
4:25
Or maybe you only measured to the nearest thousand.
4:29
So there's a little bit of ambiguity here.
4:33
If you just see something written exactly like this,
4:36
you would probably say, if you had to guess-- or not guess.
4:39
If there wasn't any more information,
4:41
you would say that there's just two significant figures
4:46
or significant digits.
4:47
For this person to be less ambiguous,
4:49
they would want to put a decimal point right over there.
4:52
And that lets you know that this is actually
4:55
five digits of precision, that we actually
4:57
go to five significant figures.
4:58
So if you don't see that decimal point, I would go with two.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,eCJ76hz7jPM,

0:00
I've got a 2 by 2 matrix here.
0:02
Let's say A is equal to a, b, c, d.
0:07
So I'm going to keep it really general.
0:08
So this is really any 2 by 2 matrix.
0:11
What I want to do is use our technique for finding an
0:15
inverse of this matrix to essentially find a formula for
0:18
the inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix.
0:21
So I want to essentially find a inverse, and I want to do it
0:25
just using a formula that it just applies to this matrix
0:28
right here.
0:28
So how can I do that?
0:30
Well, we know a technique.
0:31
We just create an augmented matrix.
0:33
So let's just create an augmented matrix right here.
0:37
So we have a, b, c, d, and then we augment it with the
0:43
identity in R2, so 1, 0, 0, 1.
0:47
And we know if we perform a series of row operations on
0:50
this augmented matrix to get the left-hand side in reduced
0:53
row echelon form.
0:54
The right-hand side, if the reduced row echelon form here
0:57
gets to the identity, then the right-hand side is going to be
1:00
the inverse.
1:01
So let's do it in this general case, not dealing with
1:04
particular numbers here.
1:06
So the first thing I want to do, or I would like to do, is
1:08
I would like to zero this guy out.
1:11
What we want to do is we want to zero that out, zero that
1:13
out, and then these two terms have to become equal to 1.
1:15
So the best way to zero this out, let's perform a little
1:20
transformation here.
1:22
So if I perform the transformation on the columns,
1:29
C1, so those are the entries of a column-- this would be
1:32
one column right here, that would be another column right
1:35
there, that's the third column,
1:37
that's the fourth column.
1:38
But the transformation I'm going to perform on each of
1:40
these columns, and we know this is equivalent to a row
1:41
operation, is going to be equal to-- since I want to
1:44
zero this one out, I'm going to keep my first row the same,
1:49
so it's going to be C1, and I'm going to replace my second
1:52
row with a times my second row minus c times my first row.
1:59
Now why am I doing that?
2:00
Because a times c minus c times a is going to be 0.
2:04
So this guy's going to be 0.
2:05
That's the row operation I'm going to perform.
2:07
And I'm doing this so we can kind of keep track, account
2:10
for what we're doing because the algebra's going to get
2:12
hairy in a little bit.
2:13
So let me perform this operation.
2:15
So if I perform that operation on our matrix, what do we
2:18
have.
2:19
So our first row's going to be the same.
2:22
Let me start with our second row because that's a little
2:24
bit more complicated.
2:25
So I'm going to replace c with a times c minus c times a.
2:31
That's ac-- so let me put it this way-- so that's going to
2:34
be 0 right there.
2:36
I'm going to replace d with d times a or a times d minus c
2:45
times C1 in this column vector.
2:48
So minus c times b.
2:50
Let me write this as bc.
2:52
And then let me augment it.
2:55
And then this guy's going to be a times 0, because he's C2
2:58
minus c times C1.
3:00
So it's going to be minus c.
3:03
And then finally, this guy right here is going to be a
3:07
times 1-- a times this 1 right here-- minus c times 0.
3:12
So that's just going to be an a.
3:14
And then the first row is pretty straightforward.
3:17
We know that the first row or the first entries in our
3:19
column vectors just stay the same through this
3:21
transformation.
3:23
So it's a, b, 1, 0.
3:27
And just to make sure you're clear what we're doing, when
3:30
you perform this transformation on this column
3:32
vector right here, you got this column
3:35
vector right there.
3:36
When you perform the transformation on this column
3:38
vector right there, you get this column
3:40
vector right there.
3:41
Now I just want to make that clear because I did all of the
3:44
second entries of all of the column vectors at once because
3:48
we all were essentially performing the same row
3:50
operation, so that just helped me simplify at least my
3:52
thinking a little bit.
3:53
Let me stay in this mode.
3:55
So let's continue to get this in reduced row echelon form.
3:58
The next thing we want to do is, let's make another
4:00
transformation, we'll call this T1.
4:02
That was our first transformation.
4:03
Let's do another transformation.
4:05
T2, or another set of row operations.
4:08
So if I start with the column vector C1, C2, what I want to
4:13
do now is I want to keep my second row the same and I want
4:16
to zero out this character right here.
4:19
I want to zero him out.
4:20
I know I'm going to keep my second row the same, so C2 is
4:24
just going to still be C2.
4:27
But in order to zero this out, what I can do is I can replace
4:30
the first row with this scaling factor times the first
4:35
row minus this scaling factor times the second row.
4:38
So it'll be ad minus bc times your first entry in your
4:44
column vector minus b times your second entry.
4:50
And the whole reason why I'm doing that is so that this guy
4:53
zeroes out.
4:55
So if we apply that to this matrix up here-- let's do the
4:59
first row first.
5:01
So this first entry right here is going to be ad minus bc
5:05
times a, because that's C1-- let me write that down.
5:08
So it's ad minus bc times a minus b times C2 minus 0.
5:20
So it's just going to be-- that second term
5:22
just becomes 0.
5:24
Fair enough.
5:25
Now what is this guy going to be?
5:26
He's going to be-- I'll write it out.
5:28
He's going to be ad minus bc times b minus b times your C2
5:40
in this column vector, minus b times ad minus bc.
5:47
And you can see immediately that these two guys are going
5:49
to cancel out and you're going to get a 0 there.
5:52
And then we've got to augment it.
5:54
I want to make sure I don't run out of space, I should've
5:56
started to the left a little bit more.
5:58
So what's this guy going to be?
5:59
Well I'm going to have this guy times ad minus bc-- I'll
6:03
do it in pink-- so you're going to have ad minus bc
6:07
times 1, which is just ad minus bc minus b times C2, so
6:13
minus b times minus c.
6:16
So that's plus bc.
6:20
So 1 times ad minus bc minus b times minus
6:25
c is equal to that.
6:26
And you can immediately see that these two guys will
6:28
cancel out.
6:28
You're just [INAUDIBLE]
6:29
ad.
6:30
And then this guy over here, you're going to have 0 times
6:34
ad minus bc, which is just a 0, minus b times a.
6:39
So you have minus ab-- just squeeze it in there.
6:44
And we know that our second row just stays the same.
6:47
Our second row just stays the same in this transformation.
6:50
So we had a 0 here, we're still going to have a 0.
6:52
We had an ad minus bc.
6:54
We'll still have an ad minus bc.
6:56
We had a minus c.
6:58
Then we had an a.
7:01
Just like that.
7:02
Now let me re-write this matrix just so it gets cleaned
7:05
up a little bit.
7:06
So let me re-write it right here.
7:09
I'll do it in my orange-- well, let me
7:11
do it in this yellow.
7:14
So I have ad minus bc times a.
7:21
And then this term right here just became a 0.
7:24
This term right here is a 0.
7:26
This term right here is an ad minus bc.
7:31
And then our augmented part, this part was just an ad.
7:35
This was a minus ab.
7:38
This is a minus c.
7:40
And then this is an a.
7:43
Now we're almost at reduced row echelon form right here.
7:46
These two things just have to be equal to 1 in order to get
7:49
reduced row echelon form.
7:50
So let's define a transformation that'll make
7:53
both of these equal to 1.
7:54
So if this was T2 let me define my transformation T3.
8:02
You give it a column vector, C1, C2.
8:06
And it's just going to scale each of the column vectors.
8:08
So what I want to do is I want to divide my first entries by
8:13
this scaling factor right here so that this becomes a 1.
8:16
So I'm essentially going to multiply 1 over ad minus bc
8:25
times a, so 1 over ad, bc, a times my first entry in each
8:30
of my column vectors.
8:33
And then my second one I want to divide by this.
8:34
So that this guy becomes a 1.
8:36
So I'm doing two scalar divisions in one
8:39
transformation.
8:40
So this one's going to be 1 over ad minus bc times C2.
8:47
So I'm just scaling everything by these two scaling factors.
8:50
So if you apply this transformation to that right
8:52
there, what do we get?
8:54
We get a matrix.
8:56
And this guy, I'm going to divide him by ad minus bc
9:01
times a, so I'm dividing it by itself, so that
9:04
guy's going to be 1.
9:05
I'm going to divide 0 by this, but 0 divided by
9:08
anything is just 0.
9:12
Then we're in an augmented part.
9:13
ad divided by-- so let me write it like this.
9:17
So ad-- I'm going to divide by this-- so it's going to be ad
9:22
minus bc times a-- you immediately see that the a's
9:26
cancel out.
9:27
This is going to be minus ab divided by ad
9:34
minus bc times a.
9:36
Once again, the a's cancel out.
9:38
And then in my second row are my second entries in my column
9:42
vectors, 0 divided by anything is 0.
9:45
So 0 divided by this thing is going to be 0, assuming we can
9:49
divide by that, and we're going to talk
9:51
about that in a second.
9:53
This guy divided by this guy, we're just dividing by
9:55
himself, so it's going to be equal to 1.
9:58
Now we have minus c divided by this, or ad minus bc.
10:06
And then we have an a.
10:08
a divided by ad, ad minus bc.
10:13
And we're done.
10:14
We put the left-hand side of our augmented matrix into
10:18
reduced row echelon form.
10:20
And now this is going to be our inverse.
10:22
So let me clean it up a little bit.
10:25
So, so far we started off with a matrix-- I'll do it in
10:28
purple-- we started off with a matrix a is
10:31
equal to a, b, c, d.
10:35
And now just using our technique we figured out that
10:38
a inverse is equal to this thing right here.
10:42
And just to simplify-- well let me just write it the way I
10:45
have it there, because I don't want to skip any steps-- this
10:46
is equal to d over ad minus bc.
10:52
Right, this guy and that guy canceled out.
10:55
And then we have a minus b over ad minus bc because that
11:02
guy and that guy canceled out.
11:04
Then you have a minus c over ad minus bc.
11:09
And then finally you have an a over ad minus bc,
11:14
which is our inverse.
11:15
But one thing might just pop out at you immediately is that
11:18
everything in our inverse is being divided by this.
11:21
So maybe an easier way to write our inverse.
11:24
We could also write our inverse like this.
11:26
We could just write it as 1 over ad minus bc times the
11:31
matrix d minus b minus c and a.
11:38
And just like that we have come up with a formula for the
11:42
inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix.
11:44
You give me any real numbers here and I'm going to give you
11:48
its inverse.
11:48
That straightforward.
11:50
Now one thing you might be saying, hey, but not all 2 by
11:53
2 matrices are invertible.
11:55
How can this be the case for all of them.
11:58
And I'll give you a question, when will this thing right
12:00
here not be defined?
12:02
When is this thing not defined?
12:06
Every operation I did, I can do with any real numbers, and
12:09
this applies to any real numbers.
12:10
But when is this thing not defined?
12:16
Well it's not defined when I divide by 0.
12:19
And when would I divide by 0?
12:20
Everything else you can multiply and subtract and add
12:23
a zero to anything, but you just can't divide by 0.
12:26
We've never defined what it means when you divide
12:28
something by 0.
12:30
So it's not defined if ad minus bc is equal to 0.
12:38
So this is an interesting thing.
12:39
I can always find the inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix as long as
12:44
ad minus bc is not equal to 0.
12:48
We came up with all of these fancy things for
12:50
invertability, you've got to put it into reduced row
12:52
echelon form, and before that we talked being
12:54
on 2 and 1 to 1.
12:56
For at least a 2 by 2 matrix we've
12:57
really simplified things.
12:59
As long as ad minus bc does not equal 0, we can use this
13:07
formula and then we know that a-- and it goes both ways-- a
13:11
is invertible.
13:13
And not only is it invertible, but we can just apply this
13:16
formula to it.
13:18
So immediately something interesting might-- you might
13:20
say hey, this is an interesting number.
13:24
We should come up with some name for it.
13:25
And lucky for us, we have come up with a name for it.
13:29
This is called the determinant.
13:33
Let me write it in pink.
13:35
Determinant.
13:39
So the determinant of a, and it's also written like this
13:45
with these little straight lines around a, and you could
13:49
also write it like this, a, b, c, d.
13:54
But most people kind of think this is redundant to have
13:57
brackets and these lines.
13:58
So then they just write it like this, this is equal to
14:01
just, they just write the lines, a, b, c, d.
14:04
I want to make this very clear.
14:05
If you have the brackets you're dealing with a matrix.
14:08
If you have just these straight lines you're talking
14:10
about the determinant of the matrix.
14:12
But this is defined for the 2 by 2 case to be
14:16
equal to ad minus bc.
14:20
This is a definition of the determinant.
14:28
So we can re-write, if we have some matrix here, we have some
14:32
matrix a which is equal to a, b, c, d.
14:37
We can now write its inverse, a inverse is equal to 1 over
14:43
this thing, which we've defined as the determinant of
14:45
a times-- and let's just see a good way of kind
14:54
of memorizing this.
14:55
We're swapping these two guys, right, the a
14:59
and the d get swapped.
15:01
So you get a d and an a.
15:03
And then these two guys stay the same,
15:05
they just become negative.
15:06
So minus b and minus c.
15:09
So that's the general formula for the
15:11
determinant of a 2 by 2 matrix.
15:13
Let's try to do a couple.
15:15
Let's try to find the determinant of the
15:20
matrix 1, 2, 3, 4.
15:26
Easy enough.
15:27
So the determinant of-- let's say this is the matrix B.
15:30
So the determinant of B, or we could write it like that,
15:33
that's equal to the determinant of B.
15:36
That is just equal to-- that's this thing right here-- 1
15:39
times 4 minus 3 times 2, which is equal to 4 minus 6, which
15:49
is equal to minus 2.
15:50
So the determinant is minus 2, so this is invertible.
15:55
Not only is it invertible, but it's very easy to find its
15:57
inverse now.
15:58
We can apply this formula.
16:00
The inverse of B in this case-- let me do it in this
16:04
color-- B inverse is equal to 1 over the determinant, so
16:07
it's 1 over minus 2 times the matrix where we swap-- well,
16:12
this is the determinant of B.
16:14
I want to be careful.
16:15
B is the same thing, but with brackets.
16:18
1, 2, 3, 4.
16:22
So B inverse is going to be 1 over the determinant of B,
16:25
which is equal to minus 2.
16:27
So 1 over minus 2.
16:28
We swap these two guys, so they get a 4 and a 1, and then
16:32
these two guys become negative-- minus 2
16:35
and then minus 3.
16:36
And then if we were to multiply this out it would be
16:39
equal to minus 1/2 times 4 is minus 2.
16:43
Minus 1/2 times minus 2 is 1.
16:46
Minus 1/2 times minus 3 is 3/2, minus 1/2
16:51
times 1 is minus 1/2.
16:53
So that there is the inverse of B.
16:56
Now let's say we have another matrix.
16:57
Let's say we have the matrix C, and C is
17:00
equal to 1, 2, 3, 6.
17:05
What is the determinant of C?
17:09
It is equal to-- we could write this way-- 1, 2, 3, 6.
17:15
And it is equal to 1 times 6 minus 3 times 2, which is
17:21
equal to 6 minus 6, which is equal to 0.
17:25
And there you see it's equal to 0, so you cannot find-- so
17:29
this is not invertible.
17:35
So we can't find its inverse because if we would try to
17:37
apply this formula right here you'd have a 1 over 0.
17:40
But we know this formula just comes out-- that attempt to
17:43
put it into reduced row echelon form, and in that last
17:45
step we just had to essentially divide everything
17:48
by these terms. So these terms would be 0 in this matrix C
17:52
that I just constructed for you.
17:55
And the reason why I knew-- I just pulled this out of my
17:58
brain-- I knew this wasn't going to be invertible because
18:00
I constructed a situation where I have columns that are
18:03
linear combinations of each other.
18:04
I have 1, 3-- you multiply that by 2 you get 2 and 6.
18:08
So I knew that these aren't linearly independent columns.
18:11
So you know that its rank wasn't going to be equal to,
18:14
so I knew it wasn't going to be invertible, but we see that
18:16
here by just computing its determinant.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,eEUK_ThrHuQ,

so it can build the things that the
0:30
company is meant to build.
0:31
And in every example so far-- we have the example where me
0:34
and my buddies, we have just a business
0:37
plan, that's the asset.
0:39
And then we own all the equity.
0:42
We're the board of directors initially.
0:44
So that's all the equity.
0:46
So let's call this the assets right now.
0:50
This is the equity.
0:52
And we could go to a venture capitalist-- it could have
0:53
been an angel investor.
0:54
It could have been-- we talked about Series A,
0:57
Series B, all of that.
0:59
And we could say OK, we need to raise x million dollars.
1:03
What percentage of your company do we have to give
1:06
away for that?
1:07
And it'll say OK, well we'll value what you have right
1:10
now-- I'll do a different number than what I did in the
1:12
past-- we'll value what you have right now as $1 million.
1:16
And so, if you need another $2 million-- so let's say we
1:20
value what you have right now as $1 million.
1:22
Let's say right now you have one million shares.
1:28
So the company's pre-money valuation is $1 million.
1:30
So you are essentially saying that the company right now is
1:34
worth a dollar per share.
1:34
There's $1 million worth of assets, and there's a million
1:37
shares, so a million divided by a million is $1 per share.
1:40
So they're valuing it at $1 per share.
1:44
And essentially they're saying that we're willing to give
1:46
you, or we're willing to buy more shares from you at $1.
1:50
So, if we give you-- let me see, let me do green, I'll do
1:55
a different color, I'll do purple-- we'll give you-- draw
1:59
the box-- we'll give you, I don't know, $2 million.
2:10
And since we're buying it at $1 per share, we get two
2:12
million shares for that.
2:18
And now all of this is the equity.
2:21
This is what the founders had, and this is all the equity.
2:24
And so now the company has what we say was worth a
2:28
million dollars.
2:28
And this is kind of an arbitrary thing, and we'll
2:30
talk more about how you can actually value these
2:32
intangible assets and things.
2:34
But now they had that, and now they have another $2 million.
2:36
So the post-money valuation-- pre-money was $1 million--
2:38
post-money is now $2 million.
2:41
And now, we had one million shares, now we have three
2:43
million shares.
2:44
So essentially, for giving $2 million, these venture
2:48
capitalists, or whoever-- so these shares go to some VC or
2:50
angel investor-- they have now 2/3 of the company.
2:54
They have two out of three million shares, or 66% of the
2:56
company for giving the $2 million.
2:58
So that was kind of a private raise of capital.
3:01
And so you've probably heard the words private company and
3:04
public company.
3:05
A private company is one whose shares are not traded on a
3:08
public exchange.
3:10
So if this company wants to raise money by selling equity,
3:14
the only place it can do it is to venture capitalists or to
3:16
private equity firms. And we'll talk a little bit more
3:18
about kind of the difference.
3:20
A venture capitalist really is a private equity firm because
3:22
it's buying private equity.
3:23
But private equity tends to invest in more established
3:26
business, when people just talk about
3:27
private equity by itself.
3:28
But we'll do several videos on that.
3:31
So this is, essentially, this company is a private company
3:33
raising private equity.
3:35
Now, the example we did in the last video is, let's say this
3:39
company grows to a certain size.
3:40
Let me just do another company so it's clean.
3:43
Let's say I have another company, these are its assets.
3:48
And this is its-- let me draw its current
3:50
equity base right there.
3:55
They should be the same size, but you get the idea-- and
3:58
these assets, it could be it has some cash.
4:02
It has some factories or land.
4:05
It could have a bunch of stuff.
4:06
It could have some technology, or we could have some
4:08
intellectual property.
4:10
Maybe it's a drug company, or maybe it's
4:12
a technology company.
4:12
It has a bunch of patents and stuff.
4:14
And then it has some intangibles-- a brand-- who
4:16
knows what it has.
4:17
These are the assets of the firm.
4:18
This is the equity of the firm.
4:19
So this company right now has no debt.
4:21
And we'll talk about that in a second, what it
4:22
means to have debt.
4:26
And this is its current shareholder base, maybe some
4:28
of these are some VCs who invested in the company when
4:31
it was private.
4:32
Maybe the founder has these shares.
4:34
But this is the equity base right here.
4:36
And let's say this company wants to raise a lot of money,
4:39
and as just kind of a review of the last video, it can do
4:41
an initial public offering.
4:42
So right now it's private.
4:44
All of these shares right now that are owned by the VCs and
4:50
the initial founders of the company, they are not traded
4:53
on a public exchange.
4:54
This VC can't go to the NASDAQ and sell their shares.
4:57
They can't go to the broker and say hey, sell my million
4:59
shares I have in Company X.
5:01
They have to just sit on them.
5:02
Maybe they can find another private equity investor to buy
5:05
their shares, or maybe these founders-- there's no
5:08
liquidity here.
5:09
There's no other person they can sell the shares to.
5:12
And also, if this company wants to raise money right now
5:14
it has to kind of go to a VC and do the whole process where
5:18
you negotiate what this value is-- what the
5:20
pre-money value is.
5:21
And they have to come up with all these legal documents, and
5:24
all of these stipulations around, we'll give you this
5:28
money, but if this happens, then you have to give us this
5:30
interest rate.
5:30
And just all these type of things.
5:33
So, what they might want to say is, we need to
5:35
raise a lot of money.
5:36
All of these guys want a way for them to be able to sell
5:39
their shares easily if they need to.
5:41
And this company says well, we need to raise a ton of money.
5:44
Let's say we want to raise $100 million.
5:46
And that's hard to raise from just any one individual
5:48
investor, even if they are a big institution.
5:51
So they'll do an initial public offering, and that
5:53
really just means and-- the IPO, and this is review of the
5:56
last one-- is that for the first time this company is
5:59
going to register its shares with the SEC, and because it
6:04
does, it's going to list its shares on an exchange.
6:06
It will get a ticker symbol, it will maybe be company--
6:09
this'll be its ticker, T-I-C-K, or in the last video
6:13
could be SOCKS, because it's going to sell socks.
6:16
And then people can trade these shares on that exchange.
6:20
It could be on the NASDAQ or something.
6:22
And I think some of you all have had experience doing that
6:25
where you go on your Charles Schwab account and you say I'm
6:28
going to sell SOCK.
6:29
Well, that company that you're selling, at some point, did an
6:32
initial public offering, and registered with the SEC, and
6:35
got listed on an exchange.
6:37
And the way it really works is, it's fundamentally the
6:40
same as when you raise money from a VC.
6:42
But now, instead of raising money from a VC, all the money
6:48
comes from, essentially, the public.
6:52
It goes through these banks and brokerages, but it's
6:54
coming from a bunch of small-- I'm just
6:57
divvying it up right here.
6:58
It could be coming from millions
7:00
and millions of people.
7:01
But the same process kind of holds.
7:03
In order to see what price these shares are bought at,
7:07
someone has to say well, what is the company worth before it
7:09
gets the money?
7:11
What is the company worth before it gets this money?
7:13
Kind of a pre-money valuation.
7:14
That still has to happen, and that's what the
7:16
investment bank does.
7:17
The investment bank will essentially do a model and
7:19
they'll say oh, this is worth-- the company beforehand
7:22
was worth $50 million.
7:27
They'll kind of go out into the market to say well, our--
7:29
and let's say the company right now has
7:33
five million shares.
7:35
So that this piece right here is five million.
7:38
So if the banks value the company at $50 million, and it
7:41
has five million shares, they'll say OK, right now, the
7:43
pre-money valuation is $10 a share.
7:46
And the bank will go out there.
7:47
It'll kind of gauge interest and say well, does it seem
7:50
like the market's willing to pay $10 a share for a
7:53
company like this?
7:53
Or give this company a $50 million pre-money valuation?
7:59
And if so, they'll move forth with the IPO.
8:02
And, hopefully, the market actually wants to
8:05
not pay $10 per share.
8:06
The market maybe wants to pay $20 a share.
8:08
So all of these guys, let's say they'll pay $10 a share,
8:12
so let's say that they sell 10 million shares at $10 a share.
8:18
So the company is able to raise $100 million.
8:21
10 times $10, $100 million.
8:24
Then they can do big ads and all of that.
8:27
And what the bank hopes is by selling these shares at $10 a
8:31
share-- so let's say this is days, and this is price.
8:38
Let me change colors-- so what the investment bank wants to
8:42
hope is that, on day one, you sell it at $10 a share, and
8:45
then the price moves up.
8:46
That the demand was actually to sell it for much more.
8:48
And there's a bit of a balancing act, because if they
8:50
sell for too little, then the company won't get as much
8:51
money as it deserves.
8:53
But if they sell for too much, then the stock price goes
8:55
down, then you kind of have a stigma
8:57
associated with the IPO.
8:59
But anyway, this begs the question of sure, I understand
9:02
why the company is selling shares.
9:04
It needs money.
9:04
It needs to operate.
9:06
It needs to build factories or put out
9:07
advertising, and all that.
9:08
But why are people buying shares to begin with?
9:10
Why do people buy shares in the stock market?
9:13
And frankly, there's two answers.
9:15
And one is kind of the obvious one, because they think the
9:17
shares will go up.
9:18
But to some degree, that's speculation.
9:21
If I'm buying a share at $10, just because I'm hoping that
9:24
there's some other dude out there who, maybe a few weeks
9:27
later, is going to pay $15, I'm just speculating.
9:30
I'm just saying oh, IPOs go up so let me buy it.
9:31
But, economically, why was this even worth
9:36
$10 to begin with?
9:38
How do we even think about that valuation, at a very even
9:41
high level, why is this even worth $10 a
9:43
share to begin with?
9:44
And the idea is that these assets-- assets are nothing
9:48
but claims on future benefits, right?
9:51
A house is an asset because you get the future benefit of
9:55
getting to live in it, right?
9:56
Or the future benefit of not having to pay rent.
9:59
So, the future benefit of these is, they'll hopefully,
10:02
at some point in the future, generate an income stream.
10:05
And even more, they'll generate cash.
10:07
And at some point in the future, and a lot of companies
10:09
don't do it right now, they'll actually
10:11
dividend out that cash.
10:12
So there's a couple of things that will make this equity
10:17
have kind of an economic-- it'll ground it economically.
10:20
And it could be these assets starting to pump out cash, and
10:23
then each of the shareholders will get a dividend.
10:28
A dividend is just cash that is given to the shareholders.
10:30
So let's say that this is a stock certificate in SOCK.
10:34
So at some point when the assets of this company start
10:38
generating cash, each of the shareholders might be getting
10:40
a dividend.
10:41
Or maybe a large company, at some future date, says wow,
10:45
this is an awesome technology.
10:47
It'll complement what we already have. And maybe
10:49
they'll buy out the company.
10:50
Maybe they'll pay $300 million for this company.
10:55
And then, essentially, they're paying $300 million-- and
10:59
there's, what, fifteen million shares?
11:00
So they're paying $20 a share.
11:02
So those are the economic kind of grounding points that why
11:05
these shares even have a value.
11:07
And I'll go into a lot more detail, I'll do a whole
11:09
playlist on how do you even think about whether this is
11:13
worth $50 million, or is it worth $5 million, or is it
11:16
worth $500 million.
11:17
And it's kind of an art, more than a science, because you're
11:21
going to make tons of assumptions in terms of how
11:23
fast the company grows, what's the risk free rate of return
11:27
that you could get on other assets?
11:29
Essentially, where else you could you put your money?
11:31
When does the company dividend out its-- there's so many
11:34
assumptions, so it's more of an art.
11:35
So it's really kind of you try to get a handle on things.
11:38
But there's no real right answer.
11:40
The real right answer is kind of what someone's willing to
11:42
pay for it.
11:43
But anyway, I'll see you in the next video.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,opEy6iN9kqc,

0:00
You have reached the first checkpoint
0:02
in the 'Journey to cryptography'-series.
0:04
And now I want to talk about what's next,
0:07
because I'm working on a new series.
0:09
However, this one won't end here.
0:11
If anything, we are kind of at the beginning still.
0:14
So I'm going to do 3 different checkpoint videos.
0:17
This one is on 'Advanced Lessons'.
0:20
However, I also want to eventually talk about Tests and Challenges,
0:24
and what we can do with more interactive explorations
0:27
and computer science lessons as it applies to cryptography.
0:31
But for now, let's talk about Advanced Lessons.
0:33
When I say 'Advanced', I don't necessarily mean 'harder lessons',
0:37
I mean 'more detailed'.
0:39
Let me give you a conceptual idea
0:41
for what I think this series could be and future series.
0:45
I like to think of each series as the trunk of a tree,
0:48
where I took you from prehistoric times
0:51
to around the 20th century, which is here,
0:53
with a few different threads.
0:55
And these ideas kind of branch apart.
0:59
Once you get to the 20th and 21st centuries,
1:01
they start getting highly specific.
1:04
And way down here on the leaves are current research questions,
1:09
which over here might be
1:11
problems related to prime number distribution
1:13
and over here some very specific work being done
1:18
on randomized algorithms or hash functions,
1:21
and way up here we might have new public key protocols
1:27
- because RSA was just the first -
1:29
or we also have encryption standards such as DES and AES.
1:33
We would have a whole new branch on quantum cryptography.
1:37
So as you can see, there are so many different things
1:40
that branch out of this series
1:41
and I couldn't possibly do justice to them all.
1:44
So I think of this video as living right here.
1:46
At kind of a junction point.
1:49
Now I can branch off with help of the community
1:52
and possibly other video creators
1:54
to fill out this tree gradually over time.
1:58
Specifically with the help of the community.
2:01
I am really excited about the Q&A community
2:04
and the work being done to improve
2:06
how people can help people on Khan Academy.
2:09
So, for example,
2:11
in terms of where one of these branches can go,
2:15
I've noticed clusters of questions
2:17
kind of leading into a common branch.
2:20
For example, under 'the pseudo-random number generator',
2:23
I have two questions here: one by Sonny and one by Drakain.
2:26
Drakain's question is:
2:27
""Why has he suggested that time in milliseconds...
2:31
...is a suitable random seed?...
2:33
This is a huge no-no in security. ...
2:35
The time it is on your machine...
2:38
...is the time it is on my machine,...
2:40
...give or take 100 milliseconds...
2:42
(which can be brute-force attacked)""
2:44
And again, this is a great question too
2:46
because it speaks to the need that
2:48
I didn't present a cryptographically secure pseudo-random generator.
2:53
So the middle square's method is back here
2:56
in early 20th century, but up until today,
2:59
we are not using the middle square's method
3:02
and that's a whole interesting branch.
3:05
It is these sorts of questions which cluster together
3:08
and really drive new content.
3:12
I want to show you a really interesting example
3:14
of how this has happened already.
3:16
This is a question Samuel asked on the 'One time pad'-video
3:20
he said: ""wouldn't a computer be able to test all the possibilities very fast?""
3:24
and Chuck Patrol basically asked the same question.
3:28
I see this happening a lot.
3:30
Similar questions all speak to the need of a new video.
3:33
So I went and created a video on 'perfect secrecy'
3:37
which really nails down
3:39
how you can't beat randomness in the world of encryption.
3:43
Out of this video, Dawn made a really great comment.
3:48
What they did, was basically summarise my video in two sentences.
3:52
So, this is what I want to try to do more of
3:55
in filling out these branches:
3:56
take questions, make new content,
3:58
and have this feed-back loop and see what we can do.
4:03
Now what I would really love,
4:05
is for you to ask questions below this video
4:08
which arise after watching the entire series.
4:12
Not specific details about certain video's,
4:14
- those can go with the videos -
4:16
but new questions, which are opening new can of worms.
4:19
And what I think will be fun to do, is:
4:22
Your question will lead to answers,
4:26
by both me and the rest of the community,
4:30
so we'll have multiple answers.
4:32
And what I can do is take this body of answers,
4:35
and out of this draft up a rough script
4:40
for more advanced videos on specific topics
4:43
that sub-sets of the community care about
4:47
So hopefully, out of the discussion below,
4:49
over time we can grow a bunch of new videos!
4:53
I want to be clear: this is an ongoing process.
4:56
This will not happen tomorrow or next week.
4:59
I hope it can happen months, even years from now.
5:02
We can still be building out new videos after the series
5:05
and these videos can be a collaborative effort
5:08
between myself and the community
5:10
and perhaps other video creators down the road.
5:13
So, let me know what you think below,
5:15
and let's get started!",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,A9Km337z15k,
khan_video_CYNUwiUzlPk_158332,Are the angles in an equilateral triangle always 60 degrees?,MCQ,"•
0:00
What we've got over here is a triangle where all three sides
0:04
have the same length, or all three sides
0:06
are congruent to each other.
0:08
And a triangle like this we call equilateral.
0:11
This is an equilateral triangle.
0:16
Now what I want to do is prove that if all three sides are
0:20
the same, then we know that all three angles are
0:25
going to have the same measure.
0:28
So let's think how we can do this.
0:29
Well, first of all, we could just
0:31
look at-- we know that AB is equal to AC.
0:34
So let's just pretend that we don't even
0:36
know that this also happens to be equal to BC.
0:39
And we know for isosceles triangles,
0:41
if two legs have the same length,
0:45
then the base angles have the same length.
0:49
So let's write this down.
0:50
We know that angle ABC is going to be congruent to angle ACD.
0:56
So let me write this down.
0:57
We know angle ABC is congruent to angle ACD.
1:07
So maybe this is my statement right over here.
1:12
And then we have reason.
1:16
And the reason here, and I'll write it
1:17
in just kind of shorthand, is that they're base angles of,
1:21
I guess you could say an isosceles.
1:22
Because we know that this side is equal to that side.
1:24
And obviously, this is an equilateral.
1:26
All of the sides are equal.
1:27
But the fact that these two legs are equal so
1:29
that the base angles are equal.
1:30
So we say two legs equal imply base angles are
1:39
going to be equal.
1:40
And that just comes from what we actually did in the last video
1:43
with isosceles triangles.
1:45
But we can also view this triangle the other way.
1:47
We could also say that maybe this angle over here
1:50
is the vertex angle, and maybe these two are the base angles.
1:53
Because then you have a situation
1:55
where this side and this side are congruent to each other.
1:58
And then that angle and that angle
2:00
are going to the base angles.
2:01
So you could say angle CAB is going
2:07
to be congruent to angle ABC, really for the same reason.
2:22
We're now looking at different legs here and different base
2:26
angles.
2:26
This would now be the base in this example.
2:29
You can imagine turning an isosceles triangle on its side.
2:32
But it's the exact same logic.
2:34
So let's just review what I talked about.
2:36
These two sides are equal, which imply
2:37
these two base angles are equal.
2:39
These two sides being equal implied
2:41
these two base angles are equal.
2:44
Well, if ABC is congruent to ACD and is congruent to CAB,
2:48
then all of these angles are congruent to each other.
2:53
So then we get angle ABC is congruent to angle ACB, which
3:02
is congruent to angle CAB.
3:04
And that pretty much gives us all of the angles.
3:07
So if you have an equilateral triangle,
3:09
it's actually an equiangular triangle as well.
3:11
All of the angles are going to be the same.
3:13
And you actually know what that measure is.
3:15
If you have three things that are the same--
3:16
so let's call that x, x, x-- and they add up to 180,
3:20
you get x plus x plus x is equal to 180, or 3x is equal to 180.
3:27
Divide both sides by 3, you get x is equal to 60 degrees.
3:32
So in an equilateral triangle, not only
3:34
are they all the same angles, but they're all
3:37
equal to exactly-- they're all 60 degree angles.
3:44
Now let's think about it the other way around.
3:46
Let's say I have a triangle.
3:48
Let's say we've got ourselves a triangle where
3:50
all of the angles are the same.
3:54
So let's say that's point X, point Y, and point Z.
4:00
And we know that all the angles are the same.
4:02
So we know that this angle is congruent to this angle
4:05
is congruent to that angle.
4:07
So what we showed in the last video on isosceles triangles
4:11
is that if two base angles are the same,
4:13
then the corresponding legs are also going to be the same.
4:17
So we know, for example, that YX is congruent to YZ.
4:28
And we know that because the base angles are congruent.
4:39
Now we also know that YZ-- so I'll rewrite YZ--
4:46
is congruent to XZ, by the same argument.
4:57
But here we're dealing with different base angles.
4:59
So now, once again, you can view this
5:00
as almost an isosceles triangle turned on its side.
5:03
This is the vertex angle right over here.
5:05
These are the two base angles.
5:06
This would be the base now.
5:07
And we know that because these two base angles are congruent.
5:11
So by the same logic.
5:13
Over in this first case, the base angles
5:16
were this angle and that angle.
5:17
In the second case, the base angles
5:19
are that angle and that angle.
5:21
And actually let me write it down.
5:23
The base angles in this first case--
5:25
let me do that same magenta-- are
5:27
angle YXZ is congruent to angle YZX.
5:41
That was in the first case.
5:42
These are the base angles.
5:43
So based on the proof we saw in the last video,
5:46
that implies these sides are congruent.
5:48
Here, we have these two base angles.
5:52
Let me do that in green.
5:53
Angle XYZ is congruent to angle YXZ.
6:05
And so that implies that these two guys right over here
6:08
are congruent.
6:09
Well, there we've proved it.
6:10
We've said that this side YX is congruent to YZ.
6:14
And we've shown that YZ is congruent to XZ.
6:16
So all of the sides are congruent to each other.
6:18
So once again, if you have all the angles equal,
6:20
and they're going to have to be 60 degrees,
6:22
then you know that all of the sides
6:24
are going to be equal as well.
6:26
They're going to be congruent.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,CYNUwiUzlPk,

0:00
In the last video we saw that if we had some line that was
0:03
defined as all of the scalar multiples of sum vector-- I'll
0:09
just write it like this.
0:11
The scalar multiples, obviously,
0:13
are any real number.
0:15
We defined a transformation, and I didn't speak of it much
0:18
in terms of transformations, but it was a transformation.
0:21
We defined a projection onto that line L as a
0:26
transformation.
0:27
In the video, we drew it as transformations within R2, but
0:30
it could be, in general, a transformation from Rn to Rn.
0:36
We defined it as, the projection of x onto L was
0:44
equal to the dot product of x, with this defining vector.
0:49
x dot this defining vector, divided by that defining
0:53
vector dotted with itself.
0:58
All of that times the defining vector of the line.
1:01
This was our definition.
1:03
A couple of things might have popped out at you right when
1:05
we first saw this.
1:07
When you dot a vector with itself, what's that equal to?
1:10
We know that if I take some vector, and I dot it with
1:15
itself, that is equivalent to the length
1:19
of the vector squared.
1:22
We can rewrite this as being equal to x dot v, over the
1:30
length of v squared, all of that times v.
1:34
Wouldn't it be nice if the length of v was 1.
1:38
The length of v was equal to 1.
1:43
If the length of v was 1, or this is another way of saying
1:46
that, v is a unit vector.
1:52
Our formula for our projection would just
1:55
simplify to x dot v.
1:59
All of that times, this will just be some scalar number,
2:02
that times v.
2:05
You say, hey Sal, how do we know if this is a
2:08
unit vector or not.
2:10
What you can realize is that any-- Let me draw it this way.
2:14
When I drew it in the previous video, I just picked
2:18
a line, like that.
2:20
The line can be really defined to this vector v in the line.
2:23
It can be any of the vectors that's contained in the line.
2:26
The vector v could be like that.
2:28
Let's say someone gives you a vector v that
2:30
isn't a unit vector.
2:31
Let's say that the length of v is not equal to 1.
2:36
How can you define a line using sum unit vector.
2:39
You can just normalize v.
2:42
You can define sum unit vector right here.
2:46
You could define sum vector right there.
2:48
Let's call it u, and I'll say it's a unit vector.
2:52
That is equal to 1 over 1 over the length of v times v.
2:59
I showed you this in the unit vector video.
3:01
You can construct a unit vector that goes in the same
3:03
direction as any vector, essentially just by dividing,
3:07
or I guess multiplying, that vector
3:09
times 1 over its length.
3:11
In general, we can always redefine the line.
3:14
All of the possible scalar multiples of v are going to be
3:17
the same thing as all of the scalar multiples of our unit
3:20
vector, u, which is just a scalar multiple of v.
3:24
We can redefine our line.
3:26
If we redefine our line, L, as being equal to all the
3:30
possible scalar multiples of our unit vector, where the
3:35
scalars are any members of the real numbers.
3:39
Our projection definition simplifies a good bit.
3:41
The projection of x onto L becomes x dot our unit vector,
3:51
times the unit vector, times the unit vector itself.
3:57
That case that I did in the previous video, where I had
4:00
those two vectors.
4:02
Where I said the vector v that defined the line, I think it
4:04
was vector 2, 1.
4:08
Our vector x was equal to 2, 3.
4:16
If you want to do this definition, we just have to
4:18
turn this guy into a unit vector first.
4:21
The way you turn him into a unit vector, you figure out
4:25
the magnitude.
4:26
In this case the magnitude of v is equal to what.
4:30
2 squared plus 1 squared is 1.
4:35
You take the square root of that.
4:37
Let me just write.
4:37
It's equal to square root of 2 squared plus 1 squared, which
4:41
is equal to the square root of 5.
4:43
You can define your u-- your unit vector could just be 1
4:47
over this, times that guy.
4:49
1 over the square root of 5 times 2, 1.
4:54
You could multiply it out, or not.
4:55
You could just leave it in this form.
4:57
You can always, for any vector v, you can always find a unit
5:00
vector that goes in the same direction, assuming that we're
5:03
dealing with non-zero vectors.
5:05
You can always reduce anything like this, to some other
5:10
definition, like this.
5:11
Where this is a unit vector version of
5:13
your vector v up there.
5:16
I just said that, look, this is a
5:17
transformation from Rn to Rn.
5:19
The one thing that we're not sure of, is this a linear
5:23
transformation.
5:24
We can always write it like this.
5:26
Let's see if this is always going to be a linear
5:28
transformation.
5:30
There's two conditions for it to be a linear transformation.
5:41
Let's see what happens if I take the projection onto L of
5:47
two vectors.
5:48
Let's say the vector a plus the vector v.
5:52
If I take the sum of their vectors.
5:53
If this is a linear transformation, this should be
5:55
equivalent to taking each of their projections
5:58
individually, and then summing.
5:59
Let's see if this is the case.
6:01
This is equal to, by our definition, we'll use the unit
6:03
vector version, because it's simpler.
6:06
This is equal to a plus b, that's our x, dot u.
6:14
And then, all of that times our unit vector.
6:18
We know that the dot product has a distributive property,
6:20
so that this is equal to a dot u plus b dot u.
6:29
These are unit vectors.
6:31
All of that times the vector u.
6:33
These are just scalar numbers.
6:34
So scalar multiplication has distributive properties.
6:37
This is equal to a dot u, times our vector u.
6:44
Remember, this is just going to be some scalar.
6:46
Plus b dot u times our unit vector u.
6:52
What is this equal to.
6:54
This right here is equal to the projection of a.
6:58
This is equal to the projection of a onto L, by
7:02
definition, right here.
7:03
By this definition.
7:04
If we assume that we're dealing with the unit vector
7:07
definition for the line.
7:09
This is equal to, this whole thing right here, is equal to
7:13
plus the projection onto L of the vector b.
7:18
We see our first condition for this being a linear
7:23
transformation holds.
7:25
A projection of the sum of the vectors is equal to the sum of
7:28
the projections of the vectors.
7:30
Our second condition is that the projection of a scalar
7:33
multiple should be equal to a scalar multiple of the
7:35
projection.
7:36
Let me write that down.
7:39
What is the projection onto L of some scalar multiple of
7:44
some vector a.
7:46
That is equal to ca dot our unit vector u
7:53
times unit vector u.
7:57
This one is a little bit more straightforward.
7:58
This is the scalar multiple.
8:01
We see it in our dot product properties, this is equal to c
8:04
times a dot u, times the vector u.
8:09
This is just equal to c times, this right here, is a
8:12
projection of a onto L.
8:18
We met both of our conditions for linear transformations.
8:21
We know that our projection onto a line L in Rn is a
8:26
linear transformation.
8:27
That tells us that we can represent it as a matrix
8:30
transformation.
8:35
We know that projection of x onto L, we already know this
8:41
definition, it can be rewritten.
8:42
It doesn't hurt to rewrite it.
8:43
As x dot some unit vector that defines our line.
8:48
Let me draw it with a little hat to show that
8:50
it is a unit vector.
8:51
Times the unit vector itself, so that we
8:53
actually get a vector.
8:56
How can I write this as some matrix product.
8:59
Some matrix vector product.
9:01
I want to write it as a product of some
9:02
matrix times x.
9:09
To simplify things, since we're actually dealing with a
9:11
matrix, let's limit ourselves to the case of R2.
9:15
I'm assuming that my projection onto L is going to
9:19
be a mapping from R2 to R2.
9:22
You could do what I'm doing here with
9:23
an arbitrary dimension.
9:25
If we're doing it in R2, then our matrix A, right there, is
9:29
going to be a 2 by 2 matrix.
9:33
We've seen in multiple videos that to figure out the matrix
9:36
A, we just take the identity matrix that has the standard
9:41
basis vectors as columns.
9:43
0, 1.
9:44
Or 1, 0, and then 0, 1.
9:46
And we apply the transformation to each of
9:48
these columns.
9:50
We could say that A is going to be equal to-- its first
9:54
column is going to be equal to the projection onto L of this
9:58
thing right here.
10:00
We'll do it in this orange color, right here.
10:03
What is that going to be.
10:05
That is going to be this dot u.
10:08
Let me write my u.
10:09
My unit vector, let's just assume that u can be rewritten
10:12
as my unit vector is equal to sum u1 and u2.
10:17
Just like that.
10:20
I need to take this dot my unit vector, let
10:23
me write this down.
10:24
Let me write this on the side.
10:25
The first thing I want to do is figure out what the
10:27
projection-- the projection onto L, let me
10:32
write it this way.
10:35
We know the projection is just equal to this dot this times
10:38
that vector.
10:39
Let me write that.
10:41
The vector 1, 0 dot the unit vector u,
10:46
which is just u1, u2.
10:48
We're going to have that times my unit vector.
10:53
I'll write it like this.
10:54
Times the vector u1, u2.
10:58
This is going to be my first column in my
11:00
transformation matrix.
11:02
My second column is going to be the same thing, but I'm not
11:06
ready to take the projection of this guy.
11:07
The definition of our projection is you dot this guy
11:10
with our unit vector.
11:13
So we dot it.
11:14
We're taking the dot product of 0, 1.
11:19
0, 1 dot my unit vector dot u1, u2.
11:26
I'm going to multiply that times my unit
11:28
vector, times u1, u2.
11:31
This seems very complicated, but it should simplify when we
11:34
actually try to work out our transformation matrix.
11:36
Let's do it.
11:38
When I dot these two guys, what do I get.
11:40
Let me write it here.
11:42
My matrix A will become 1 times u1, plus 0 times u2.
11:50
That's just u1.
11:52
This whole thing just simplifies to u1, when I take
11:55
the dot product of these two things.
11:57
Times u1, u2.
12:01
That's going to be my first column.
12:03
My second column, if I dot these two guys, I get 0 times
12:06
u1 plus 1 times u2.
12:08
So I'm going to get u2 times my unit vector, u1, u2.
12:16
If I multiply that out, this will be equal to what.
12:18
I can just write them as columns. u1
12:20
times u1 is u1 squared.
12:24
u1 times u2 is u1, u2.
12:29
u2 times u1 is u2 times u1.
12:34
Then, u2 times u2 is u2 squared.
12:38
You give me any unit vector and I will give you the
12:43
transformation that gives you any projection of some other
12:45
vector onto the line defined by that.
12:48
That was a very long way of saying that.
12:50
Let's go back to what I did before.
12:54
Let's say we want to find any projection onto the line, onto
12:58
the vector, I'll draw it here.
13:00
We'll do the same example that we did in the last video.
13:03
If I have some vector v that looks like that.
13:07
We said the vector v was equal to the vector 2, 1.
13:13
That was my vector v.
13:14
How can we find sum transformation for the
13:16
projection onto the line defined by v?
13:19
Onto this line right here.
13:21
The line defined by v.
13:24
What we can first do is convert v into a unit vector.
13:29
We can convert v into a unit vector that
13:32
goes in the same direction.
13:34
Some unit vector u.
13:36
We did that already up here.
13:38
Where we essentially just divided [? bv ?]
13:40
by it's length.
13:42
Let's take v and divide by it's length.
13:44
The unit vector is this, 1 over the square root of 5
13:46
times our vector v.
13:50
It was 1 over the square root of 5 times our
13:55
vector v, right there.
13:56
You start with a unit vector there.
13:59
You just create this matrix, and then we will have our
14:02
transformation matrix.
14:04
If this is our u, what will our matrix be equal to.
14:07
This is u.
14:09
Then our matrix would be equal to u1 squared.
14:14
What is u1 squared.
14:15
Let me rewrite our u a little bit, not at angles.
14:20
Our vector u, our unit vector that defines this line, is
14:24
equal to the vector 2 over the square root of 5 and 1 over
14:29
the square root of 5.
14:29
I just multiplied out this scalar.
14:32
If we want to construct this matrix, we get A is equal to
14:37
u1 squared.
14:38
What is this squared?
14:39
It becomes 2 squared 4 over the square root of 5 squared,
14:43
which is just 5.
14:44
Equals 4 over 5.
14:48
What is u1 times u2?
14:50
2 times 1 over square root of 5 times square root of 5.
14:52
So, 2/5.
14:55
I just multiplied these two.
14:56
What is u2 times u1.
14:58
Same thing.
14:59
Order doesn't matter when you multiply.
15:01
This will also be 2/5.
15:03
What is u2 squared.
15:04
1 squared over the square root of 5 squared is just 1/5.
15:11
Now we can say-- and that's the neat thing about creating
15:14
these matrices, that the projection-- Let's say we have
15:18
some, let's say this is the origin right here, we have
15:20
some other vector x, right here.
15:22
We can now define our transformation.
15:25
The projection onto L where L is equal to any scalar
15:31
multiple of our unit vector u.
15:34
It's right here.
15:37
Is a member of the reals.
15:39
That is our line L.
15:40
The projection onto L of any vector x is
15:43
equal to this matrix.
15:45
Is equal to the matrix 4, 5, 2/5, 2/5, 1/5 times x.
15:54
Which is a pretty neat result, at least for me.
15:56
We once again reduced everything to just a matrix
15:59
multiplication.
16:00
You take this x and you multiply it by this matrix,
16:03
you're going to get its projection onto
16:05
the L, onto the line.
16:08
If you take this vector, let's say a, and you multiply it
16:13
times this matrix right there, you're going to get its
16:15
projection.
16:16
Its projection onto the line.
16:18
If you could take this vector-- No, it should go
16:21
through the origin.
16:22
I want to draw it in standard position.
16:23
If you take this vector, right there, and multiply it times
16:26
this matrix, you're going to get this vector, right here,
16:30
that is contained in the line.
16:32
When you subtract it from this, it's orthogonal.
16:34
We know the definition.
16:35
It's kind of the shadow of that vector.

0:00
Let's write 113.9% as a decimal.
0:06
So percent, this symbol right over here,
0:09
literally means per hundred.

So this is the same thing as 113.9 per 100,

0:29
And to do that, 113.9 divided by 100.
0:33
If you divide by 10, you move the decimal once to the left.
0:36
If you divide by 100, you're moving the decimal twice
0:39
to the left.
0:39
If we're doing it by 1,000, we would go to the left once more.
0:42
10,000, each time you divide by 10,
0:44
you'd go one step to the left, which hopefully makes sense.
0:47
If we were to multiply by 10, we would be moving the decimal
0:49
over to the right, and there are other videos
0:51
that go into far more depth on the intuition behind that.
0:54
But anyway, we're dividing 113.9 by 100,
0:58
so move the decimal two spaces to the left.
1:00
So the decimal will end up right over here.
1:03
So this will be equal to 1.139.

- [Voiceover] Let's say we have the function f of x
0:02
which is equal to cosine of x to the third power
0:08
which we could also write like this,
0:10
cosine of x to the third power.
0:14
And we are interested in figuring out
0:16
what f prime of x is going to be equal to.
0:21
So we want to figure out f prime of x and as we will see,
0:25
the chain rule is going to be very useful here
0:28
and what I'm going to do is
0:29
I'm going to first just apply the chain rule
0:31
and then maybe dig into it a little bit
0:32
to make sure we draw the connection
0:34
between what we're doing here and then what you might see
0:36
in maybe some of your Calculus textbooks
0:38
that explain the chain rule.
0:39
So if we have a function
0:42
that is defined as essentially a composite function,
0:45
notice this expression right here,
0:47
we are taking something to the third power.
0:50
It isn't just an x that we're taking to the third power.
0:52
We are taking a cosine of x to the third power.
0:55
So we're taking a function, you could view it this way,
0:57
we're taking the function cosine of x
0:59
and then we're inputting it in to another function
1:01
that takes it to the third power.
1:04
So let me put it this way.
1:06
If you viewed,
1:07
if you say, look, we could take an x,
1:10
we put it into one function and that is,
1:14
that first function is cosine of x
1:17
so first, we evaluate the cosine
1:21
and so that's going to produce cosine of x,
1:24
cosine of x,
1:26
and then we're going to input it into a function
1:28
that just takes things to the third power.
1:31
So it just takes things to the third power.
1:34
And so what are you going to end up with?
1:36
Well, you're going to end up with,
1:38
what are you taking to the third power?
1:39
You're taking cosine of x.
1:41
Cosine of x to the third power.
1:44
This is a composite function.
1:47
You could view this,
1:50
you could view this as the function,
1:52
let's call this blue one, the function v
1:55
and let's call this the function u
1:58
and so if we're taking x and into u,
2:01
this is u of x
2:04
and then if we're taking u of x into the input
2:07
or as the input into the function v
2:09
then this output right over here,
2:11
this is going to be v of,
2:15
well, what was inputted?
2:16
V of u of x.
2:18
V of u of x
2:21
or another way of writing it,
2:23
I'm going to write it multiple ways.
2:24
That's the same thing as v of cosine of x.
2:28
V of cosine of x.
2:31
And so v, whatever you input into it,
2:33
it just takes it to the third power.
2:35
If you were to write v of x,
2:36
it would be x to the third power.
2:38
So the chain rule tells us
2:40
or the chain rule is what our brain should say.
2:41
Hey, it becomes applicable
2:44
if we're going to take the derivative of a function
2:46
that can be expressed as a composite function like this.
2:49
So just to be clear, we can write f of x.
2:53
f of x is equal to v of u of x.
2:57
I know I'm essentially saying the same thing
3:00
over and over again
3:01
but I'm saying it in slightly different ways
3:02
because the first time you learn this,
3:03
it can be a little bit hard to grok
3:05
or really deeply understand
3:08
so I'm going to try to write it in different ways.
3:10
And the chain rule tells us
3:12
that if you have a situation like this
3:14
then the derivative, f prime of x,
3:17
and this is something that you will see in your textbooks.
3:20
Well, this is going to be
3:21
the derivative of this whole thing
3:24
with respect to u of x
3:25
so we could write that as v prime of u of x.
3:30
V prime of u of x
3:33
times the derivative of u with respect to x.
3:37
Times u prime of x.
3:40
This right over here,
3:41
this is one expression of the chain rule
3:45
and so how do we evaluate it in this case?
3:48
Well, let me color code it in a similar way.
3:50
So the v function,
3:52
this outer thing that just takes things to the third power,
3:54
I'll put in blue.
3:56
So f prime of x,
3:57
another way of expressing it
3:59
and I'll use it with more of the differential notation,
4:02
you could view this as the derivative of,
4:06
well, I'll write it a couple of different ways.
4:07
You could view it as the derivative of v.
4:11
The derivative of v
4:16
with respect to u.
4:19
I want to get the colors right.
4:20
The derivative of v with respect to u,
4:26
that's what this thing is right over here,
4:28
times the derivative of u
4:32
with respect to x.
4:35
So times the derivative of u with respect to x.
4:39
And just to be clear,
4:40
so you're familiar with the different notations
4:41
you'll see in different textbooks,
4:43
this is this right over here just using different notations
4:47
and this is this right over here.
4:51
So let's actually evaluate these things.
4:53
You're probably tired of just talking in the abstract.
4:56
So this is going to be equal to,
4:59
this is going to be equal to
5:01
and I'm going to write it out again,
5:02
this is the derivative,
5:05
instead of just writing v and u,
5:06
I'm going to write it, let me write this way.
5:08
This is going to be,
5:10
I keep wanting, I'm using the wrong colors.
5:13
This is going to be the derivative of,
5:15
and I'm going to leave some space,
5:17
times the derivative of something else
5:20
with respect to something else
5:22
so we're going to have to first take the derivative of v.
5:23
Well, v is
5:26
cosine of x to the third power.
5:29
Cosine of x.
5:30
We're going to take the derivative of that
5:31
with respect to u which is just cosine of x
5:35
and we're going to multiply that
5:36
times the derivative of u which is cosine of x
5:40
with respect to x.
5:42
With respect to x.
5:44
So this one, we have good,
5:47
we've seen this before.
5:50
We know that the derivative with respect to x
5:53
of cosine of x.
5:56
Cosine.
5:57
We use it in that same color.
5:59
The derivative of cosine of x,
6:02
well, that's equal to negative sine of x.
6:05
So this one right over here, that is negative sine of x.
6:09
You might be more familiar with seeing
6:11
the derivative operated this way
6:13
but in theory, you won't see this as often
6:15
but this helps my brain really grok what we're doing.
6:17
We're taking the derivative of cosine of x
6:19
with respect to x.
6:20
Well, that's going to be negative sine of x.
6:22
Well, what about taking the derivative
6:24
of cosine of x to the third power
6:26
with respect to cosine of x?
6:29
What is this thing over here mean?
6:31
Well, if I were taking the derivative,
6:34
if I was taking the derivative of,
6:37
let me write it this way,
6:38
if I was taking the derivative of x to the third power,
6:43
x to the third power with respect to x,
6:46
if it was like that,
6:48
well, this is just going to be
6:50
and let me put some brackets here
6:51
to make it a little bit clear.
6:52
If I'm taking the derivative of that,
6:55
that is going to be,
6:57
that is going to be,
6:58
we bring the exponent out front.
6:59
That's going to be three,
7:01
three times x.
7:05
Three times x to the second power.
7:08
Three times x to the second power.
7:12
So the general notion here is
7:14
if I'm taking the derivative of something,
7:17
whatever this something happens to be,
7:19
let me do this in a new color.
7:20
I'm doing the derivative of orange circle to the third power
7:24
with respect to orange circle.
7:27
Well, that's just going to be three times orange
7:29
or yellow circle.
7:31
Let me make it an actual orange circle.
7:33
So the derivative of orange circle to the third power
7:36
with respect to orange circle,
7:38
that's going to be three times the orange circle squared.
7:42
So if I'm taking the derivative of cosine of x
7:44
to the third power with respect to cosine of x,
7:47
well, that's just going to be,
7:48
this is just going to be
7:51
three times cosine of x,
7:55
cosine of x to the second power.
7:59
To the second power.
8:02
Notice, one way to think about it.
8:04
I'm taking the derivative of this outside function
8:06
with respect to the inside.
8:07
So I would do the same thing
8:09
as taking the derivative of x to the third power
8:11
but instead of an x, I have a cosine of x
8:13
so instead of it being three x squared,
8:14
it is three cosine of x squared
8:18
and then the chain rule says,
8:19
if we want to get finally get
8:20
the derivative with respect to x,
8:21
we then take the derivative of cosine of x
8:24
with respect to x.
8:25
I know that's a big mouthful but we are at the homestretch.
8:29
We've now figured out the derivative.
8:31
It's going to be this times this.
8:34
So let's see, that's going to be negative three,
8:36
negative three times sine of x
8:40
times cosine squared of x
8:45
and I know that was kind of a long way of saying it.
8:47
I'm trying to explain the chain rule at the same time.
8:50
But once you get the hang of it, you're just going to say,
8:52
alright, well, let me take the derivative of the outside
8:56
of something to the third power with respect to the inside.
8:59
Let me just treat that cosine of x like as if it was an x.
9:02
Well, that's going to be,
9:03
if I do that, that's going to be three cosine squared of x
9:06
so that's that part and that part
9:08
and then let me take the derivative of the inside
9:11
with respect to x.
9:12
Well, that is negative sine of x.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,yAFphxolU5w,
khan_video_erjMiErRgSQ_102310,why we used the pressure on outside of balloon at 1:34.......shouldn't we use the pressure of the gas inside the balloon in the equation?,Essay,"•
0:00
In the last video we hopefully learned the intuition
0:04
behind the ideal gas equation, that pressure times volume is
0:09
equal to the number of molecules we have
0:12
times some constant times the temperature.
0:17
And that's all nice and it hopefully it makes sense to you
0:20
how all of these fit together.
0:21
That pressure should be inverse to volume
0:23
and that's why you're multiplying both sides by each other.
0:27
You could take volume and put it on this side of the equation.
0:29
Or that pressure should be proportional
0:31
to the number of particles and the temperature.
0:33
But now let's apply it and actually do some problems.
0:36
Because just knowing this isn't good enough.
0:39
So let's say that I have a two liter container,
0:47
or let's say a two liter balloon, containing hydrogen gas.
1:03
And that's hydrogen as a diatomic molecule.
1:06
So each molecule has two hydrogens in it.
1:08
And let's say I'm measuring it at 30 degrees Celsius.
1:13
Use different color. 30 degrees Celsius.
1:18
My brain is really malfunctioning.
1:20
30 degrees, not 30 percent, 30 degrees Celsius.
1:27
And let's say that the pressure on the outside of the balloon,
1:33
we've measuredat two atmospheres.
1:39
So my question to you is
1:42
how many moles of hydrogen do we have? How many moles...
1:55
So let's apply our ideal gas equation.
1:59
And since we're dealing with liters and atmospheres,
2:02
we have to make sure we use the right proportionality constant.
2:05
But in general, if we keep pressure.
2:07
So our pressure is given in atmospheres.
2:09
Let me write down all the units, actually.
2:11
So we have 2 atmospheres times our volume is 2 liters,
2:24
is equal to n.
2:26
n is the number of particles we care about,
2:28
and we care about it in moles,
2:30
but let's just write n there for now.
2:31
Is equal to n times R.
2:37
I'll do R in a second times.
2:40
R times T.
2:43
Now you might be atempted to just put 30 degrees in there.
2:46
But in all of these problems--
2:48
in fact in general, whenever you're doing
2:49
any of these gas problems or thermodynamics problems,
2:53
or any time you're doing math with temperature--
2:56
you should always convert into Kelvin.
2:58
And just as a bit of review as to what Kelvin is,
3:01
it's just a different scale.
3:03
So for example, the lowest possible temperature
3:06
that can be achieved in the universe,
3:09
when you think about it in Celsius,
3:11
let me draw a little temperature scale here.
3:13
So if that's the temperature scale.
3:16
I'll draw two, one for Celsius and one for Kelvin.
3:20
So the lowest possible temperature
3:22
that can be achieved in the universe,
3:25
and when we say the lowest possible temperature that means that
3:32
the average kinetic energy of the molecules or the atoms are zero.
3:36
They're just not moving.
3:38
They're just stationary.
3:40
So in Celsius, it's minus 273.15 degrees Celsius.
3:49
So zero might be some place over here.
3:52
Zero, that's where water freezes.
3:55
And then 100 degrees, that's where water boils.
3:59
And you can immediately see, the whole Celsius scale
4:03
was made based on the freezing point
4:05
and the boiling point of water. Now, Kelvin.
4:08
So look at this and you say, if I have something that's 5 degrees
4:13
and I have another thing that's 10 degrees,
4:15
when you look at the Celsius scale, you're like,
4:17
oh, maybe the 10 degree thing it has twice
4:19
as much energy as the 5 degree thing.
4:21
It has twice the temperature.
4:22
But when you look at it from the absolute distance to zero.
4:25
Let me see if I can draw this.
4:30
So the 10 degree is all the way over here
4:33
and the 5 degree is almost as far, that far.
4:36
So the 10 degrees Celsius is only a slight increment
4:39
over 5 degrees Celsius, if you were to divide the two.
4:42
It's not twice as hot.
4:43
And that's why they came up with the Kelvin scale.
4:45
Because in the Kelvin scale, absolute zero is defined as 0.
4:49
Zero Kelvin. So this right here is zero degrees Kelvin.
4:56
And so zero degrees Kelvin is absolute zero.
4:58
So what is zero degrees Celsius?
5:00
And the increments are the same.
5:04
One degree change in Celsius
5:05
is one degree change in Kelvin.
5:07
So at least they keep it, it's just a shift.
5:09
So this is going to be plus 273 degrees Kelvin.
5:14
And then 5 degrees would be plus 278
5:17
10 degrees would be plus 283 Kelvin.
5:21
And then you see that 5 and 10 degrees
5:23
really aren't that different from each other.
5:25
But in general, if you want to convert from Celsius to Kelvin
5:27
you just add 273 degrees.
5:30
So 30 degrees Celsius is what?
5:34
Well, this 5 and 10 I drew too close to 100.
5:36
But let's say it's sitting here.
5:37
It would be 303 degrees Kelvin.
5:42
So this is equal to 303 degrees Kelvin.
5:48
All right, so now for our temperature,
5:51
that's what we were worried about.
5:52
We wanted to put in the temperature there.
5:54
So now we can put in our 303 degrees Kelvin.
5:59
Now we have to figure out what constant to use here.
6:03
And I've written a couple of down here.
6:05
Remember, we're dealing with atmospheres and liters.
6:08
So I wrote down a couple of versions of R right here.
6:13
Let's see we're dealing with atmospheres and liters.
6:16
And in the denominator we're always dealing
6:17
with mole and Kelvin no matter what.
6:19
So those are always going to be there.
6:20
So we should use this proportionality constant.
6:22
R is equal to 0.082 liter atmospheres per mole Kelvin.
6:28
Let me write that down.
6:30
So let me rewrite our whole equation actually.
6:34
So I have 2 atmospheres times 2 liters is equal to n times,
6:41
I have a bad memory, 0.082 liter atmospheres per mole Kelvin,
6:52
times 303 degrees Kelvin.
6:56
So let's see what we can do.
6:59
Let's see if all of the units work out.
7:01
So we can always, when you do dimensional analysis,
7:04
you can treat units like numbers.
7:06
So if you divide both sides of this equation by atmospheres,
7:09
the atmospheres cancel out.
7:11
Divide both sides of this equation by liters,
7:13
liters cancel out.
7:15
You have a Kelvin in the numerator,
7:17
Kelvin in the denominator, that cancels out.
7:19
And so we have 2 times 2 is
7:24
equal to n times 0.082 times 303.
7:34
And then we have just a per mole and a 1 over the mole.
7:39
So to solve for n, or the number of moles, what we do is
7:43
we divide both sides of this equation by all of this stuff.
7:47
So we get 2 times 2 is 4.
7:53
4 divided by 0.082 divided by 303.
8:01
I'm just taking this and putting it on the left-hand side,
8:03
dividing both sides by it.
8:05
And when you divide by a per mole,
8:06
if you put a 1 over a mole here,
8:08
that's the same thing as multiplying by a mole.
8:13
So it's good, the units all worked out.
8:15
We're getting n in terms of moles.
8:17
And so we just have to get the calculator out
8:19
and figure out how many moles we're dealing with.
8:21
So we have 4 divided by 0.082
8:27
divided by 303 is equal to 0.16.
8:33
If we wanted to go more digits, 0.161,
8:35
but we'll just round.
8:36
So this is equal to 0.16 moles of H2.
8:43
I am telling you actually here,
8:46
the exact number of hydrogen molecules.
8:51
But if you wanted a number,
8:54
you'd just multiply this times 6.02 times 10 to the 23
8:58
and then you would have a number in kind of the traditional sense.
9:00
And of course, if you wanted to know
9:02
what is the mass of the hydrogen you have.
9:05
You'd say, OK well one mole of H2 has a mass of what?
9:12
The mass of one hydrogen is one atomic mass unit.
9:18
The mass of two hydrogen when it's in its molecular form,
9:21
is two atomic mass units.
9:23
So a mole of it is going to be 2 grams.
9:26
So in this case, we have 0.16 moles.
9:30
So if we wanted to convert that to grams, this in the case
9:34
of these hydrogen gas molecules would be 0.32 grams.
9:41
And I just multiplied it by 2 because each mole is 2 grams.
9:45
Anyway, I hope you found that
9:46
there's a bunch more of these problems.
9:48
Because I think the math is pretty straightforward here.
9:51
The thing that always makes it daunting, I think,
9:54
is the units and making sure you're using the right units.
9:56
What is they are using meters cubed instead of liters,
9:59
or kilopascals instead of atmospheres.
10:01
So I'll try to do a bunch of examples
10:02

0:00
So I've got a whole pizza here, and let's say
0:02
that I were to cut it into two equal pieces.
0:05
Let me cut it right over here into 2 equal pieces.
0:11
And let's say that I ate one of those 2 equal pieces.
0:14
So let's say I ate all of this right over here.
0:17
What fraction of the pizza have I eaten?
0:20
Well, I took the whole and I divide it
0:23
into two equal pieces, and then I ate one of those pieces.
0:33
So I ate 1/2 of the pizza.
0:37
Now, let's imagine that instead of cutting that pizza into only
0:43
2 equal pieces, let's imagine instead
0:45
that decide to cut it into 4 equal pieces.
0:48
So let's draw that.
0:50
So 4 equal pieces.
0:52
So I could cut once this way and then
0:56
I could cut it once this way.
0:59
And so here I have 4 equal pieces.
1:05
But let's say that I want to eat the same amount of pizza.
1:09
How many of these 4 equal pieces would I have to eat.
1:12
I encourage you to pause the video and think about that.
1:15
Well, I would eat this piece.
1:18
You could imagine me eating this piece and this piece right
1:20
over here.
1:21
I've eaten the same amount of the pizza.
1:25
Each of these pieces you could imagine got cut into 2 pieces
1:28
when I cut the whole pizza this way.
1:31
And so now I have to eat 2 slices of the 4,
1:34
as opposed to 1 slice of the 2.
1:36
So I just ate 2 out of the 4 slices.
1:42
I'm using different numbers here.
1:44
Here I'm using a 1 in the numerator
1:47
and 2 in the denominator.
1:48
Here, I'm using a 2 in the numerator
1:49
and a 4 in the denominator.
1:51
These two fractions represent the same quantity.
1:54
I ate the same amount of pizza.
1:56
If I eat 2/4 of a pizza, if I eat 2 out of 4 equal pieces,
2:00
that's the same fraction of the pizza
2:02
as if I eat 1 out of 2 equal pieces.
2:05
So we would say that these two things
2:07
are equivalent fractions.
2:10
Now let's do another one like this.
2:12
Instead of just dividing it into 4 equal pieces,
2:15
let's divide it into 8 equal pieces.
2:23
So now we could cut once like this.
2:26
So now we have 2 equal pieces.
2:29
Cut once like this.
2:30
Now we have 4 equal pieces.
2:32
And then divide each of those 4 pieces into 2 pieces.
2:35
So I'll cut those in-- So let's see.
2:39
I want to make them equal pieces.
2:40
Those don't look as equal as I would like.
2:43
So that looks more equal, and that looks reasonably equal.
2:51
So now how many equal pieces do I have?
2:53
I have 8 equal pieces.
2:57
But let's say I wanted to eat the same fraction of the pizza.
3:01
So I could eat all of these pieces right over here.
3:04
Well, how many of those 8 equal pieces have I eaten?
3:07
Well, I've eaten 1, 2, 3, 4 of those 8 equal pieces.
3:11
And so once again, this fraction, 4 of 8, or 4/8,
3:15
is equivalent to 2/4, which is equivalent to 1/2.
3:19
And you might see a little bit of a pattern here.
3:21
Going from this scenario to this scenario,
3:26
I got twice as many equal slices.
3:29
Because I had twice as many equal slices,
3:32
I needed to eat two times the number of slices.
3:35
So I multiply the denominator by 2,
3:38
and I multiply the numerator by 2.
3:41
If I multiply the numerator and the denominator
3:43
by the same number, then I'm not changing
3:46
what that fraction represents.
3:48
And you see that over here.
3:50
Going from 4 slices to 8 slices, I cut every slice,
3:54
I turned every slice into 2 more slices,
3:57
so I had twice as many slices.
3:59
And then if I want to eat the same amount,
4:01
I have to eat twice as many pieces.
4:07
So all of these, 1/2, 2/4, four 4/8, and I could keep going.
4:10
I could do 8/16.
4:12
I could do 16/32.

All of these would be equivalent fractions.",Khan Academy Video,Math,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,N1X0vf5PUz4,
khan_video_IelS2vg7JO8_89339,Is V= 4/3pi r3 the equation to always use for finding the volume of a sphere?,Essay,"•
0:00
Find the volume of a sphere with a diameter of 14 centimeters.
0:06
So if I have a sphere-- so this isn't just a circle,
0:09
this is a sphere.
0:10
You could view it as a globe of some kind.
0:12
So I'm going to shade it a little bit so you
0:14
can tell that it's three-dimensional.
0:15
They're giving us the diameter.
0:17
So if we go from one side of the sphere
0:19
straight through the center of it.
0:20
So we're imagining that we can see through the sphere.
0:23
And we go straight through the centimeter,
0:25
that distance right over there is 14 centimeters.
0:28
Now, to find the volume of a sphere-- and we've proved this,
0:32
or you will see a proof for this later when you learn calculus.
0:36
But the formula for the volume of a sphere
0:38
is volume is equal to 4/3 pi r cubed,
0:43
where r is the radius of the sphere.
0:47
So they've given us the diameter.
0:48
And just like for circles, the radius of the sphere
0:54
is half of the diameter.
0:56
So in this example, our radius is going to be 7 centimeters.
1:00
And in fact, the sphere itself is the set
1:02
of all points in three dimensions that is exactly
1:05
the radius away from the center.
1:07
But with that out of the way, let's just
1:09
apply this radius being 7 centimeters to this formula
1:12
right over here.
1:14
So we're going to have a volume is
1:16
equal to 4/3 pi times 7 centimeters to the third power.
1:22
So I'll do that in that pink color.
1:25
So times 7 centimeters to the third power.
1:31
And since it already involves pi,
1:33
and you could approximate pi with 3.14.
1:35
Some people even approximate it with 22/7.
1:39
But we'll actually just get the calculator out
1:41
to get the exact value for this volume.
1:43
So this is going to be-- so my volume is
1:47
going to be 4 divided by 3.
1:51
And then I don't want to just put a pi there,
1:53
because that might interpret it as 4 divided by 3 pi.
1:56
So 4 divided by 3 times pi, times 7 to the third power.
2:07
In order of operations, it'll do the exponent
2:09
before it does the multiplication,
2:10
so this should work out.
2:12
And the units are going to be in centimeters cubed or cubic
2:15
centimeters.
2:17
So we get 1,436.
2:19
They don't tell us what to round it to.
2:21
So I'll just round it to the nearest 10th-- 1,436.8.
2:25
So this is equal to 1,436.8 centimeters cubed.

khan_video_5fkh01mClLU_155930,"So how would you solve an equation such as 5x-2y=10
How do you write it in slope intercept form?",Essay,"•
0:00
In this video I'm going to do a bunch of examples of finding
0:03
the equations of lines in slope-intercept form.
0:07
Just as a bit of a review, that means equations of lines
0:09
in the form of y is equal to mx plus b where m is the slope
0:17
and b is the y-intercept.
0:21
So let's just do a bunch of these problems. So here they
0:24
tell us that a line has a slope of negative 5, so m is
0:28
equal to negative 5.
0:30
And it has a y-intercept of 6.
0:34
So b is equal to 6.
0:36
So this is pretty straightforward.
0:37
The equation of this line is y is equal to
0:41
negative 5x plus 6.
0:47
That wasn't too bad.
0:49
Let's do this next one over here.
0:51
The line has a slope of negative 1 and contains the
0:54
point 4/5 comma 0.
0:57
So they're telling us the slope, slope of negative 1.
1:00
So we know that m is equal to negative 1, but we're not 100%
1:05
sure about where the y-intercept is just yet.
1:09
So we know that this equation is going to be of the form y
1:12
is equal to the slope negative 1x plus b, where b is the
1:19
y-intercept.
1:20
Now, we can use this coordinate information, the
1:23
fact that it contains this point, we can use that
1:25
information to solve for b.
1:28
The fact that the line contains this point means that
1:31
the value x is equal to 4/5, y is equal to 0 must satisfy
1:37
this equation.
1:38
So let's substitute those in. y is equal to 0 when x is
1:43
equal to 4/5.
1:44
So 0 is equal to negative 1 times 4/5 plus b.
1:50
I'll scroll down a little bit.
1:52
So let's see, we get a 0 is equal to negative 4/5 plus b.
1:58
We can add 4/5 to both sides of this equation.
2:02
So we get add a 4/5 there.
2:04
We could add a 4/5 to that side as well.
2:07
The whole reason I did that is so that cancels out with that.
2:10
You get b is equal to 4/5.
2:16
So we now have the equation of the line.
2:19
y is equal to negative 1 times x, which we write as negative
2:23
x, plus b, which is 4/5, just like that.
2:32
Now we have this one.
2:34
The line contains the point 2 comma 6 and 5 comma 0.
2:39
So they haven't given us the slope or the y-intercept
2:42
explicitly.
2:43
But we could figure out both of them from these
2:45
coordinates.
2:45
So the first thing we can do is figure out the slope.
2:48
So we know that the slope m is equal to change in y over
2:53
change in x, which is equal to-- What is the change in y?
2:58
Let's start with this one right here.
2:59
So we do 6 minus 0.
3:04
Let me do it this way.
3:05
So that's a 6-- I want to make it color-coded-- minus 0.
3:10
So 6 minus 0, that's our change in y.
3:14
Our change in x is 2 minus 2 minus 5.
3:24
The reason why I color-coded it is I wanted to show you
3:26
when I used this y term first, I used the 6 up here, that I
3:30
have to use this x term first as well.
3:33
So I wanted to show you, this is the coordinate 2 comma 6.
3:36
This is the coordinate 5 comma 0.
3:38
I couldn't have swapped the 2 and the 5 then.
3:41
Then I would have gotten the negative of the answer.
3:45
But what do we get here?
3:46
This is equal to 6 minus 0 is 6.
3:51
2 minus 5 is negative 3.
3:54
So this becomes negative 6 over 3, which is the same
3:58
thing as negative 2.
4:01
So that's our slope.
4:02
So, so far we know that the line must be, y is equal to
4:06
the slope-- I'll do that in orange-- negative 2 times x
4:12
plus our y-intercept.
4:15
Now we can do exactly what we did in the last problem.
4:17
We can use one of these points to solve for b.
4:20
We can use either one.
4:22
Both of these are on the line, so both of these must satisfy
4:25
this equation.
4:26
I'll use the 5 comma 0 because it's always nice when
4:29
you have a 0 there.
4:31
The math is a little bit easier.
4:32
So let's put the 5 comma 0 there.
4:34
So y is equal to 0 when x is equal to 5.
4:38
So y is equal to 0 when you have negative 2 times 5, when
4:43
x is equal to 5 plus b.
4:47
So you get 0 is equal to -10 plus b.
4:52
If you add 10 to both sides of this equation, let's add 10 to
4:57
both sides, these two cancel out.
5:00
You get b is equal to 10 plus 0 or 10.
5:03
So you get b is equal to 10.
5:06
Now we know the equation for the line.
5:07
The equation is y-- let me do it in a new color-- y is equal
5:14
to negative 2x plus b plus 10.
5:22
We are done.
5:23
Let's do another one of these.
5:28
All right, the line contains the points 3 comma 5 and
5:31
negative 3 comma 0.
5:32
Just like the last problem, we start by figuring out the
5:36
slope, which we will call m.
5:40
It's the same thing as the rise over the run, which is
5:44
the same thing as the change in y over the change in x.
5:48
If you were doing this for your homework, you wouldn't
5:50
have to write all this.
5:50
I just want to make sure that you understand that these are
5:52
all the same things.
5:55
Then what is our change in y over our change in x?
5:58
This is equal to, let's start with the side first. It's just
6:02
to show you I could pick either of these points.
6:03
So let's say it's 0 minus 5 just like that.
6:14
So I'm using this coordinate first. I'm kind of viewing it
6:17
as the endpoint.
6:19
Remember when I first learned this, I would always be
6:22
tempted to do the x in the numerator.
6:24
No, you use the y's in the numerator.
6:25
So that's the second of the coordinates.
6:28
That is going to be over negative 3 minus 3.
6:41
This is the coordinate negative 3, 0.
6:44
This is the coordinate 3, 5.
6:46
We're subtracting that.
6:47
So what are we going to get?
6:49
This is going to be equal to-- I'll do it in a neutral
6:52
color-- this is going to be equal to the numerator is
6:56
negative 5 over negative 3 minus 3 is negative 6.
7:02
So the negatives cancel out.
7:03
You get 5/6.
7:05
So we know that the equation is going to be of the form y
7:08
is equal to 5/6 x plus b.
7:15
Now we can substitute one of these coordinates in for b.
7:18
So let's do.
7:19
I always like to use the one that has the 0 in it.
7:21
So y is a zero when x is negative 3 plus b.
7:33
So all I did is I substituted negative 3 for x, 0 for y.
7:37
I know I can do that because this is on the line.
7:40
This must satisfy the equation of the line.
7:44
Let's solve for b.
7:45
So we get zero is equal to, well if we divide negative 3
7:49
by 3, that becomes a 1.
7:51
If you divide 6 by 3, that becomes a 2.
7:54
So it becomes negative 5/2 plus b.
8:02
We could add 5/2 to both sides of the equation,
8:05
plus 5/2, plus 5/2.
8:08
I like to change my notation just so you get
8:10
familiar with both.
8:12
So the equation becomes 5/2 is equal to-- that's a 0-- is
8:17
equal to b.
8:19
b is 5/2.
8:22
So the equation of our line is y is equal to 5/6 x plus b,
8:31
which we just figured out is 5/2, plus 5/2.
8:37
We are done.
8:38
Let's do another one.
8:41
We have a graph here.
8:43
Let's figure out the equation of this graph.
8:45
This is actually, on some level, a little bit easier.
8:46
What's the slope?
8:47
Slope is change in y over change it x.
8:52
So let's see what happens.
8:53
When we move in x, when our change in x is 1, so that is
8:57
our change in x.
8:58
So change in x is 1.
9:00
I'm just deciding to change my x by 1, increment by 1.
9:04
What is the change in y?
9:05
It looks like y changes exactly by 4.
9:10
It looks like my delta y, my change in y, is equal to 4
9:14
when my delta x is equal to 1.
9:20
So change in y over change in x, change in y is 4 when
9:24
change in x is 1.
9:26
So the slope is equal to 4.
9:30
Now what's its y-intercept?
9:32
Well here we can just look at the graph.
9:33
It looks like it intersects y-axis at y is equal to
9:38
negative 6, or at the point 0, negative 6.
9:41
So we know that b is equal to negative 6.
9:46
So we know the equation of the line.
9:48
The equation of the line is y is equal to the slope times x
9:56
plus the y-intercept.
9:59
I should write that.
10:01
So minus 6, that is plus negative 6 So that is the
10:07
equation of our line.
10:09
Let's do one more of these.
10:12
So they tell us that f of 1.5 is negative 3, f of
10:17
negative 1 is 2.
10:18
What is that?
10:19
Well, all this is just a fancy way of telling you that the
10:23
point when x is 1.5, when you put 1.5 into the function, the
10:30
function evaluates as negative 3.
10:33
So this tells us that the coordinate 1.5, negative 3 is
10:36
on the line.
10:38
Then this tells us that the point when x is negative 1, f
10:41
of x is equal to 2.
10:44
This is just a fancy way of saying that both of these two
10:47
points are on the line, nothing unusual.
10:51
I think the point of this problem is to get you familiar
10:54
with function notation, for you to not get intimidated if
10:56
you see something like this.
10:57
If you evaluate the function at 1.5, you get negative 3.
11:01
So that's the coordinate if you imagine that y is
11:04
equal to f of x.
11:06
So this would be the y-coordinate.
11:06
It would be equal to negative 3 when x is 1.5.
11:09
Anyway, I've said it multiple times.
11:10
Let's figure out the slope of this line.
11:13
The slope which is change in y over change in x is equal to,
11:20
let's start with 2 minus this guy, negative 3-- these are
11:27
the y-values-- over, all of that over, negative
11:32
1 minus this guy.
11:40
Let me write it this way, negative 1 minus
11:43
that guy, minus 1.5.
11:48
I do the colors because I want to show you that the negative
11:50
1 and the 2 are both coming from this, that's why I use
11:54
both of them first. If I used these guys first, I would have
11:57
to use both the x and the y first. If I use the 2 first, I
12:00
have to use the negative 1 first. That's why I'm
12:02
color-coding it.
12:03
So this is going to be equal to 2 minus negative 3.
12:08
That's the same thing as 2 plus 3.
12:10
So that is 5.
12:16
Negative 1 minus 1.5 is negative 2.5.
12:23
5 divided by 2.5 is equal to 2.
12:27
So the slope of this line is negative 2.
12:30
Actually I'll take a little aside to show you it doesn't
12:32
matter what order I do this in.
12:34
If I use this coordinate first, then I have to use that
12:36
coordinate first. Let's do it the other way.
12:38
If I did it as negative 3 minus 2 over 1.5 minus
12:54
negative 1, this should be minus the 2 over 1.5 minus the
12:59
negative 1.
13:03
This should give me the same answer.
13:04
This is equal to what?
13:06
Negative 3 minus 2 is negative 5 over 1.5 minus negative 1.
13:12
That's 1.5 plus 1.
13:14
That's over 2.5.
13:16
So once again, this is equal the negative 2.
13:18
So I just wanted to show you, it doesn't matter which one
13:20
you pick as the starting or the endpoint, as long as
13:23
you're consistent.
13:23
If this is the starting y, this is the starting x.
13:26
If this is the finishing y, this has to be
13:28
the finishing x.
13:29
But anyway, we know that the slope is negative 2.
13:33
So we know the equation is y is equal to negative 2x plus
13:36
some y-intercept.
13:39
Let's use one of these coordinates.
13:40
I'll use this one since it doesn't have a decimal in it.
13:43
So we know that y is equal to 2.
13:47
So y is equal to 2 when x is equal to negative 1.
13:55
Of course you have your plus b.
13:57
So 2 is equal to negative 2 times negative 1 is 2 plus b.
14:02
If you subtract 2 from both sides of this equation, minus
14:06
2, minus 2, you're subtracting it from both sides of this
14:10
equation, you're going to get 0 on the left-hand side is
14:12
equal to b.
14:14
So b is 0.
14:15
So the equation of our line is just y is
14:18
equal to negative 2x.
14:22
Actually if you wanted to write it in function notation,
14:23
it would be that f of x is equal to negative 2x.
14:28
I kind of just assumed that y is equal to f of x.
14:30
But this is really the equation.
14:32
They never mentioned y's here.
14:33
So you could just write f of x is equal to 2x right here.
14:37
Each of these coordinates are the coordinates
14:40
of x and f of x.
14:46
So you could even view the definition of slope as change
14:49
in f of x over change in x.

0:00
What I want to do in this video
0:01
is think about the demand curve
0:02
for two different products.
0:04
So this is some laptop
0:05
that's on the market.
0:06
And this, let's just say,
0:08
is the cheapest car
0:09
that happens to be on the market
0:10
this is actually a picture of a 1985
0:12
assuming this is the cheapest car on the market.
0:15
So let's just think about
0:17
their hypothetical demand curves right now
0:20
So once again, on the vertical axis,
0:23
we're going to put price,
0:24
and on the horizontal axis,
0:25
we put quantity,
0:29
and then over here
0:30
let me do it for the same thing
0:32
So this is price,
0:36
and this right over here is quantity.
0:37
And both of them satisfy the law of demand
0:42
if the price is really high
0:44
the quantity demanded is going to be really low for the laptop
0:48
and so it might be right over there
0:50
and if the price is low
0:51
the quantity demanded is going to increase.
0:53
So, the demand curve might look something like that.
0:57
And it doesn't have to be a curve,
0:59
or doesn't have to be a line,
1:00
it could be a curve or anything like that.
1:02
So that is the current demand for the laptop
1:09
All else equal,
1:10
so we're not talking about shifting any of those other factors
1:13
that we've been talking about in the last few videos.
1:15
Now we can draw a similar demand curve
1:18
for this very cheap automobile.
1:20
If the price is high,
1:22
very few people are going to want to buy it,
1:24
and I'm not going to specify what the price is,
1:26
but this is a general idea
1:27
if the price is higher,
1:28
fewer people are going to want to buy it
1:30
If the price is lower,
1:31
more people are going to want to buy it
1:33
So this demand curve will also have the same shape
1:36
from the top left to the bottom right
1:38
it satisfies the law of demand.
1:40
So once again, that is the current demand.
1:46
Now let's think about
1:47
how the demand for each of these goods might change
1:50
depending on changes in income.
1:54
So we're going to focus on the income factor
1:57
the income effect, for this video
2:00
and see how these 2 products might change.
2:02
So let's just assume that
2:05
income in the general population goes up.
2:10
So for something like a laptop, wow,
2:12
if more people are making more money
2:14
especially in real terms
2:16
they have more money to spend well
2:17
for any given price point,
2:18
at any given price point,
2:20
there's going to be a higher quantity
2:25
that's demanded.
2:26
At any given price point,
2:26
higher quantity demanded.
2:30
And so if income goes up for this laptop,
2:33
the demand will increase.
2:35
And the way we show demand increasing
2:37
is the whole curve shifts to the right
2:39
so this right over here demand increased
2:43
demand went up when income went up.
2:46
And this makes complete sense
2:48
and if income were to go down,
2:49
demand would go down
2:51
because people would have less money
2:52
to buy something like a laptop.
2:54
And this is the case for most goods
2:56
we call things like this,
2:57
when income goes up, demand goes up,
2:59
whole curve shifts to the right
3:01
income goes down, demand goes down,
3:02
whole curve shifts to the left
3:04
We call this a normal good.
3:06
So this right over here is a normal good.
3:11
Now let's think about
3:12
what happens with the cheapest car on the market.
3:16
And let's assume we're in a developed country
3:18
where almost everyone has some form of a car.
3:21
Now, what happens when income goes up?
3:25
So people have more money
3:27
but are they going to spend that money
3:29
buying the cheapest car on the market?
3:31
Well, in most cases, if income goes up generally,
3:35
people say, well I have a little bit more money,
3:36
maybe I'll buy a slightly nicer car.
3:39
So, and maybe in particular
3:40
the people who were going to buy this car
3:42
at any given price point
3:44
So this price point,
3:45
the people who were going to buy the car will say
3:47
Wait! I can now afford a better car!
3:49
Why should I you know,
3:51
this is not safe
3:52
maybe or not as safe as the other cars,
3:53
and I want to impress my friends
3:56
from high school and all that,
3:57
so something very strange might happen for this car,
4:00
the demand for this car.
4:02
It actually will decrease
4:04
so the whole curve could shift to the left.
4:11
So income is a very strange thing for this good
4:14
because income increasing maybe people say,
4:16
hey you know what,
4:17
I could trade out of this good
4:18
I could get a good that
4:19
I'd rather have than just getting more of this thing right over here
4:23
Demand went down.
4:24
And goods like this, we call them inferior goods.
4:30
And the general way to think about
4:32
inferior goods are the goods
4:33
that people will want to not own if they had more money
4:36
they would want to buy, I guess, less inferior goods.
4:39
Or another way to think about it is,
4:41
if income were to go down,
4:45
and more people are budget strapped
4:46
and they can't afford
4:47
the Mercedes-Benz or the BMW
4:49
or even the mid-sized sedan anymore,
4:51
so if income were to go down
4:52
and things were getting tighter,
4:54
more people would want this car
4:56
more people would have to trade down to this
4:57
because they're strapped,
4:59
they're tightening their belts
5:00
and so you'll have this strange situation
5:04
where if income goes down,
5:06
demand would go up for this thing
5:09
So income goes down,
5:12
demand goes up.
5:13
Remember, we're talking about demand,
5:15
we're talking about the entire shifting of the curve.
5:17
At any given price point,
5:18
the quantity demanded will go up.
5:21
Because, this is, or we're assuming,
5:23
is the cheapest car on the market.
5:27
So, and likewise,
5:28
if income were to go down for a normal good,
5:30
it'll do what you'll expect,
5:31
demand would go down.
5:32
So this, an inferior good,
5:33
does the opposite of a normal good
5:35
when we're talking about the income effect,
5:40
the inferior good will do the opposite of a normal good
5:44
and that's because people want to trade out of it
5:46
when their income goes up
5:47
or they don't want to buy it
5:48
or they want to buy something nicer.
5:49
And when their income goes down,
5:50
they'll say
5:51
I have to buy this thing,
5:52
so you know, let me just do it.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,wYuAwm-5-Bk,
khan_video_QA2TBiIsdT0_194720,Isnt the argument in favor of Rent v/s (against) buy little flawed?,Essay,"•
0:00
Welcome back.
0:01
I now want to play a little bit of devil's
0:02
advocate with myself.
0:04
I made this argument where I show that for the exact
0:06
identical house, if these are the numbers -- I mean you'd
0:08
have to work it out based on your market, and what the
0:10
numbers are at the time.
0:11
But if this is the comparable rent for a $1 million house, I
0:14
showed you that for the $1 million house you're burning
0:17
$40,000 a year.
0:19
This is not money that is going to build equity.
0:21
This not money that's going to the principal of your house.
0:23
This is money that just going out of your pocket, you'll
0:25
never see again.
0:26
In a way, and actually not in a way, in reality, you can
0:29
view this $40,000 as rent on the money that you borrowed.
0:33
Interest is nothing but rent.
0:35
So when you have an asset, if the asset is cash, the rent on
0:39
it is interest. If the asset is a house, the rent on it is
0:42
your monthly rent payment.
0:44
So when you think of it this way, when people say home
0:45
ownership, they really aren't homeowners yet.
0:48
You're not a homeowner until you don't have debt.
0:51
You are a money renter.
0:54
So your choice is either to be a money renter here, or to be
0:57
a house renter here.
0:59
And I show that you are burning
1:01
almost double the money.
1:02
But then there's the argument of well, there are advantages,
1:06
still, to buying this house.
1:07
And what are they?
1:09
Well one example is, in this situation, if I did get a
1:12
fixed-rate mortgage -- and we learned, when you look at all
1:14
those adjustable-rate mortgages, we know that a lot
1:16
of people didn't.
1:17
But if I have a fixed-rate mortgage, I know what my
1:19
payment is for the foreseeable future, for the next 30 years.
1:22
While my landlord, in this case, they could
1:26
keep raising my rent.
1:27
So this might look good right now, but what if my landlord
1:33
raised the rent to, I don't know, $3,500 a month.
1:37
Well then, out of your pocket, 0.5 times 12, you'd be
1:44
spending $42,000 a year.
1:46
And then of course you get the interest from the money that
1:49
you put in the bank.
1:50
Plus 10.
1:52
Oh, minus 10 actually, sorry.
1:56
So in that case, if the rent goes up, then out of your
1:58
pocket is $32,000 every year.
2:00
Right?
2:00
Or what if the interest that you get on your cash in the
2:03
bank goes down?
2:03
Then this $10,000 thousand will become lower.
2:05
But as we can see, the rent would have to go up a lot to
2:08
make up for $41,000, to make this a break-even situation.
2:12
Let's figure out how much it would have to go up.
2:14
So in this first scenario, in order for your net outflow to
2:20
be $41,500, assuming you're getting $10,000 from the money
2:25
in the bank, your rent would have to be $51,500.
2:31
Right?
2:31
Because you're getting $10,000 from the bank.
2:35
And so divided by 12, your rent would have to be $4,300
2:45
in this situation to make this a break-even proposition.
2:50
This is another way to view it.
2:51
If I were to buy the house, and if I were to move, how
2:53
much would I have to rent this house out for, in order to not
2:58
be losing money every month?
2:59
Well I would have to rent it out for $4,300 a month, even
3:02
though maybe the market rents are only at $3,000.
3:06
And there is another devil's advocate argument.
3:09
And that's, well, housing -- and this is something that you
3:12
heard a lot about three years ago.
3:14
And a lot of these people aren't talking as much now.
3:16
But they would say, housing has never -- housing has done
3:19
nothing but gone up, and I will build equity just from
3:22
housing appreciation.
3:23
So how much does my house have to appreciate every year?
3:27
Well, to make up this difference-- $41,500 minus
3:36
26-- so to make up that $15,500 difference every year,
3:45
this is $15,500 favorable.
3:47
My house would have to appreciate by a comparable
3:50
amount, right?
3:51
So how much appreciation is that on my house?
3:54
Well that's a $1 million house, right?
3:56
So $15,500 appreciation on a $1 million house.
4:01
I'm doing everything in thousands, so 1,000 thousands
4:03
is a million.
4:04
So that's only 1.5% appreciation.
4:07
So if my house appreciates by 1.5%, that's it-- 1.5%.
4:12
If my house just appreciates by 1.5%, I'm going to make up
4:17
this $15,500.
4:18
And so it is worth it for me.
4:21
It is worth it for me to blow this money by having kind of
4:24
an increased -- by renting the money for more than I would
4:27
have to pay to rent the house.
4:29
And that might sound like a very reasonable proposition,
4:32
that the house will appreciate by 1.5%.
4:34
From 2001 to 2005, 2006, houses were appreciating like
4:39
10%, 15% a year.
4:40
So it seemed -- and a real estate agent would often do
4:44
this very math with you, and say, well, you're definitely
4:46
going to get 1.5%.
4:47
In fact, you're probably going to get 10% appreciation.
4:49
And you're going to make much more than this.
4:50
But think about, in the presentation of the balance
4:53
sheet and leverage, what happens if housing prices go
4:56
down by 1.5%?
4:58
What happens if it's minus 1.5%?
5:01
Well, then you're going to spend this much to rent the
5:04
money, right?
5:06
And you're not going to gain this much.
5:07
You're going to lose this much every year.
5:09
And so the proposition becomes even worse.
5:12
So this is a big deal.
5:13
Now that, I think, on a nationwide basis, a lot of the
5:15
housing indices show that housing prices have gone down,
5:18
I think by 6%.
5:19
That's what the Case-Shiller index says.
5:22
6% is a lot.
5:23
Especially on a $1 million house, that's $60,000 a year
5:26
that's just evaporating.
5:28
That's wealth that someone thought they had, that's just
5:29
disappearing out of their equity.
5:31
So this is rationale of pay more to rent the money for a
5:36
house than to rent the house is justified if
5:40
housing prices go up.
5:41
It becomes 10 times worse when housing prices are flat.
5:44
Or, God forbid, if housing prices actually go down.
5:47
And now we see that housing prices actually go down.
5:50
In the last couple of years especially, in the areas
5:52
where, like the Bay Area, or Florida, or California,
5:55
especially Southern California,
5:56
where this is happening.
5:57
And back even two or three years ago, when people used to
6:00
make this argument.
6:02
People used to make the argument, well you know, my
6:03
house just has to go up 1% or 2% percent, and I'm going to
6:06
make up the difference.
6:07
I'd say well, why is your house going to
6:09
go up 1% or 2% percent?
6:11
I mean, there has to be some reason why next year someone's
6:13
willing to pay 2% more for that house.
6:16
Is it because rents are going up 2% a year, so the income
6:18
stream is going to be 2% higher?
6:20
And actually in the Bay Area, from 2001 to roughly 2003,
6:25
rents were going down.
6:26
And there were actually people moving out.
6:27
All the tech workers were getting laid off.
6:29
You had a lot of programming jobs being outsourced to India
6:32
and wherever else.
6:33
So you had this whole situation where the population
6:35
was actually decreasing.
6:36
Demand for housing was going down.
6:39
But for some reason housing prices were going up.
6:42
So people said well, they've been going up for the last
6:44
five years, so they'll continue.
6:45
And they've never gone down, et cetera, et cetera.
6:46
But it didn't make an economic argument.
6:49
And I'll show in a future video that the only reason why
6:51
housing prices did go up is that it just became easier and
6:55
easier and easier to buy a house.
6:59
The standards that banks used for giving out a loan became
7:02
lower and lower and lower.
7:03
There are actually examples in Southern California, and in
7:07
San Jose and some of the suburbs, where people who had
7:10
incomes of $30,000 or $40,000 a year.
7:12
The bank actually gave them a $1 million loan to buy a $1
7:16
million house, based on stated income.
7:18
There's things called stated income loans, where you just
7:20
tell the bank what you earn.
7:22
You don't have to prove it to them.
7:24
And so every year that went by, it just became easier and
7:26
easier and easier.
7:27
More and more people just thought that housing always
7:29
appreciates.
7:30
So that's why they want to pay more and more to essentially
7:33
rent the money for a house.
7:35
And this became a self-fulfilling prophecy.
7:37
But as we see on the way down, it works
7:39
completely against you.
7:40
So in the situation where we are now, where nationwide
7:43
housing prices are actually declining-- and actually they
7:46
will decline until this rent-versus-buy equation
7:49
starts to make a little bit more sense-- it really hurts
7:54
the home buyer.
7:55
And what's even worse, and this is kind of adding insult
7:58
to injury, is that this guy, if I bought this house, and
8:03
all of a sudden I lose my job, and I can't pay the house
8:06
back, I might lose my entire $250,000 down payment because
8:10
maybe I can't sell the house, or the house
8:11
is selling for less.
8:13
Or maybe I want to move, and there's no one out there who
8:15
can buy a house because the banks all of a sudden got
8:19
smart again, and realized that they should become more
8:20
serious in terms of who they give money to.
8:23
And so I'm stuck holding this house, and my flexibility in
8:26
terms of where I can move is limited.
8:27
Actually a friend of mine was telling me that they've
8:29
actually done studies.
8:30
And there's a correlation between
8:31
unemployment and home ownership.
8:33
Because when you own a home, you have less flexibility in
8:36
looking for a job.
8:37
If I have a house in San Jose but there's a job in LA, I
8:40
might not be able to take that job because I
8:42
can't sell my house.
8:42
Or I might not even want to look for a job in LA.
8:44
While the renter, of course, my lease ends and I leave.
8:49
So this is just a rough sense of the rent versus buy.
8:52
And I know I get very impassioned about this.
8:54
But that's just because I explain this a lot.
8:56
And when I'm at parties and I start talking about the
8:59
calculations, people's eyes glaze over.
9:01
But I made this video now and I'll just tell

I told you in the last video on calendar notation that,
0:03
regardless of whether you're using BC, AD or BCE and CE,
0:08
that there is no year 0, that we had 1 BC.
0:13
And then we had that theoretical birth of Jesus,
0:16
and most historians don't think that he
0:18
was born right exactly on January 1, 1 AD.
0:23
But there's no year 0.
0:24
Right after that, you go from December 31, 1
0:28
BC, to January 1, 1 AD.
0:31
There's no year 0.
0:33
And despite the fact that I emphasized
0:35
that in the last video, I didn't take that into consideration
0:39
when I calculated how many years there
0:41
were between Plato's birth and Columbus discovering
0:46
the new world.
0:47
And the reason why I didn't take that into consideration
0:50
is that the year 1492, whether you
0:52
want to call it AD 1492, Anno Domini 1492.
0:57
Whether you want to call it that,
0:58
or whether you want to call it 1492 in the Common Era.
1:01
It's not 1492 years since the theoretical birth of Jesus,
1:07
which we know is not the actual birth.
1:08
He was probably born before that.
1:11
It is 1,491 years since the birth of Jesus.
1:15
And to think about it this way, let's
1:17
just assume-- I'll keep emphasizing,
1:19
it's a theoretical date that we're talking--
1:21
or the theoretical event, this kind of birth of Jesus
1:24
that our calendars revolve around.
1:27
If we talk about January 1, let's think about it this way.
1:33
So January 1, 1 in the Common Era.
1:42
How long is that since the birth of Jesus?
1:45
It's not one year.
1:46
You wouldn't just look at this and say
1:47
it's been one year, because this is theoretically
1:50
the day that he was born.
1:52
So this is zero years, or almost zero years
1:55
since that theoretical birth of Jesus.
1:57
Another way to think about it is how long after January 1,
2:04
the year 1 before the Common Era--
2:09
and I could've called this AD, and I
2:11
could've called this BC-- what's the time
2:13
difference between these two dates?
2:15
So the way I calculated it before, I said,
2:17
oh, this is one year after that theoretical birth.
2:19
That's wrong.
2:20
This is during that theoretical birth.
2:22
But if I did it the way I did in the last video,
2:24
I would have said, oh, that's one year after,
2:25
one year before.
2:26
You add them together, and you would get two.
2:28
But that's wrong because there is no year 0.
2:31
So January 1, 1 AD, or 1 in the Common Era is right over here.
2:37
And then January 1, 1 BCE, is exactly one year before that.
2:42
So there's only one year, one year difference.
2:45
And the reason why the math is strange
2:47
is because there is no year 0.
2:50
If there was a year 0, then my calculation in the last video
2:53
was correct.
2:54
So really, the way that you would calculate
2:57
the time between Plato's birth at 428 BC and Columbus sailing
3:03
across the Atlantic in 1492, you would say, OK.
3:08
This is 428 years before that theoretical birth of Christ.
3:13
But this isn't 1,492 years after that theoretical birth.
3:18
This is 1492 minus 1.
3:21
So what you would do is you would add these two numbers.
3:23
This is 428 before.
3:25
This is 1,492 minus 1 years after.
3:28
So you would add them and then subtract 1.
3:31
So the correct answer-- so this is the correction part--
3:34
it isn't 1,920 years between Plato's birth and Columbus.
3:40
We want to subtract 1 from that.
3:42
It is 1,920 minus 1 years.
3:45
So that is 1,919 years.
3:49
The same way that the difference between 1 AD and 1 BCE,
3:54
you could almost view it as positive and negative numbers.
3:57
You say, oh, this is positive 1 minus negative 1.
3:59
That would give me two.
4:00
But there is no 0, so you would need to subtract another 1.
4:03
So this is exactly 1 year difference.
4:06
So just want to clarify that.
4:07
That's what that no year 0 does to us.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,N06Jy-gQog8,

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby
Today, we're going to look at the world of Rome
through the eyes of a young girl.
Here she is, drawing a picture of herself
in the atrium of her father's enormous house.
Her name is Domitia,
and she is just 5 years old.
She has an older brother who is fourteen,
Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus,
named after her dad.
Girls don't get these long names that boys have.
What is worse is that Dad insists
on calling all his daughters Domitia.
""Domitia!""
His call to Domitia drawing on the column,
Domitia III.
She has an older sister, Domitia II, who is 7 years old.
And then there's Domitia I, who is ten.
There would have been a Domitia IV,
but mom died trying to give birth to her three years ago.
Confused?
The Romans were too.
They could work out ancestry through the male line
with the nice, tripartite names
such as Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus.
But they got in a real mess
over which Domitia was married to whom
and was either the great aunt
or the great stepmother and so on to whom
when they came to write it down.
Domitia III is not just drawing on the pillar,
she's also watching the action.
You see, it's early,
in the time of day when all her dad's clients and friends
come to see him at home to pay their respects.
Lucius Popidius Secundus, a 17 year old,
he wants to marry Domitia II
within the next five to seven years,
has come as well.
He seems to be wooing not his future wife,
but her dad.
Poor Lucius, he does not know that Domitia's dad
thinks he and his family are wealthy
but still scumbags from the Subura.
Afterall, it is the part of Rome
full of barbers and prostitutes.
Suddenly, all the men are leaving with Dad.
It's the second hour
and time for him to be in court
with a sturdy audience of clients
to applaud his rhetoric
and hiss at his opponent.
The house is now quieter.
The men won't return for seven hours,
not until dinner time.
But what happens in the house for those seven hours?
What do Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia do all day?
Not an easy question!
Everything written down by the Romans
that we have today was written by men.
This makes constructing the lives of women difficult.
However, we can't have a history of just Roman men,
so here it goes.
We can begin in the atrium.
There is a massive loom,
on which Dad's latest wife is working on a new toga.
Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia are tasked
with spinning the wool
that will be used to weave this mighty garment,
30 or more feet long and elliptical in shape.
Romans loved the idea
that their wives work wool.
We know that because it's written
on the gravestones of so many Roman women.
Unlike women in Greece,
Roman women go out the house
and move about the city.
They go to the baths in the morning to avoid the men
or to separate baths that are for women only.
Some do go in for the latest fad of the AD 70s:
nude bathing with men present.
Where they have no place
is where the men are:
in the Forum,
in the Law Court,
or in the Senate House.
Their place in public is in the porticos
with gardens,
with sculpture,
and with pathways for walking in.
When Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia want
to leave the house to go somewhere,
like the Portico of Livia,
they must get ready.
Domitia II and Domitia III are ready,
but Domitia I, who is betrothed to be married
in two years to darling Philatus,
isn't ready.
She's not slow, she just has more to do.
Being betrothed means she wears the insignia of betrothal:
engagement rings
and all the gifts Pilatus has given her -
jewels,
earrings,
necklaces,
and the pendants.
She may even wear her myrtle crown.
All this bling shouts,
""I'm getting married to that 19 year old
who gave me all this stuff I'm wearing!""
While as they wait, Domitia II and Domitia III play with their dolls
that mirror the image of their sister
decked out to be married.
One day, these dolls will be dedicated
to the household gods on the day of their wedding.
Okay, we're ready.
The girls step into litters carried by some burly slaves.
They also have a chaperone with them
and will be meeting an aunt at the Porticus of Livia.
Carried high on the shoulders of these slaves,
the girls look out through the curtains
to see the crowded streets below them.
They traverse the city, pass the Coliseum,
but then turn off to climb up the hill
to the Porticus of Livia.
It was built by Livia, the wife of the first emperor Augustus,
on the site of the house of Vedius Pollio.
He wasn't such a great guy.
He once tried to feed a slave
to the eels in his fish pond
for simply dropping a dish.
Luckily, the emperor was at the dinner
and tamed his temper.
The litters are placed on the ground
and the girls get out
and arm in arm, two by two,
they ascend the steps
into the enclosed garden with many columns.
Domitia III shot off and is drawing on a column.
Domitia II joins her
but seeks to read the graffiti higher up on the column.
She spots a drawing of gladiators
and tries to imagine seeing them fighting,
something she will never be permitted to do,
except from the very rear of the Coliseum.
From there, she will have a good view
of the 50,000 spectators
but will see little by way of blood and gore.
If she really wanted a decent view,
she could become a vestal virgin
and would sit right down the front.
But a career tending the sacred flame of Vesta
is not to everybody's taste.
Domitia I has met another ten year old
also decked out in the insignia of betrothal.
Home time.
When they get there after the eighth hour,
something is up.
A smashed dish lies on the floor.
All the slaves are being gathered together in the atrium
and await the arrival of their master.
Dad is going to go mad.
He will not hit his children,
but like many other Romans,
he believes that slaves have to be punished.
The whip lies ready for his arrival.
No one knows who smashed the dish,
but Dad will call the undertaker
to torture it out of them, if he must.
The doorkeeper opens the front door to the house.
A hush comes over the anxious slaves.
In walks not their master
but, instead, a pregnant teenager.
It is the master's eldest daughter, age 15,
who is already a veteran of marriage and child birth.
Guess what her name is.
There is a five to ten percent chance
she won't survive giving birth to her child,
but, for now, she has come to dinner with her family.
As a teenage mother,
she has proved that she is a successful wife
by bringing children and descendants for her husband,
who will carry on his name in the future.
The family head off to the dining room
and are served dinner.
It would seem Dad has had an invite to dinner elsewhere.
With dinner concluded, the girls crossed the atrium
to bid farewell to their older sister
who is carried home in a litter,
escorted by some of Dad's bodyguards.
Returning to the house,
the girls cross the atrium.
The slaves, young and old,
male and female,
await the return of their owner.
When he returns, he may exact vengeance,
ensuring his power over the slaves
is maintained through violence and terror,
to which any slave could be subjected.
But, for the girls, they head upstairs for the night,
ready for bed.

0:04
BETH HARRIS: We thought we would start
0:05
by looking at what is perhaps the most famous painting
0:10
in the world, and whether we can actually even really still see.
0:13
SAL KHAN: Right.
0:14
Because I have seen this before.
0:16
And I've even visited it at the Louvre--
0:19
I know I'm pronouncing it wrong.
0:21
Yes, you're right.
0:23
This is probably the most famous painting world.
0:25
BETH HARRIS: And I just read that most people spend
0:28
about 15 seconds in the Louvre looking at the painting, which
0:32
is a funny statistic.
0:34
SAL KHAN: Well, it's stressful, because there's
0:35
people behind you.
0:36
And on top of that, it's actually surprisingly small
0:39
when you see it in real life.
0:40
I mean, now that I'm able to take my time,
0:42
and not worry about the tourists behind me,
0:44
and I'm looking at it for real, I'm
0:46
already-- things are jumping out at me that I actually
0:48
had never noticed before.
0:49
BETH HARRIS: Like what?
0:50
SAL KHAN: Well, it looks like the scenery is
0:52
some kind of like Vulcan territory or something.
0:54
[LAUGHING] There's this-- it's like mountainous,
0:57
and well, I guess, there's a little bridge in there.
0:59
There's a road.
1:00
I guess I never paid much attention to that before.
1:03
Yeah, actually, I'd never even noticed
1:04
this chair she was on before either.
1:06
You can see hand resting on it.
1:07
Actually-- and I never noticed that there's
1:09
a ledge, right behind her, where's there jars.
1:13
I could probably keep going.
1:15
BETH HARRIS: I like your analogy to Vulcan territory,
1:17
as a Star Trek fan myself.
1:20
That landscape is otherworldly and very mysterious.
1:23
But it's Interesting, isn't it, how
1:25
the bottom part of the landscape at her neck and below
1:28
looks like an inhabited landscape with a winding road
1:31
and a bridge, but the landscape that's at her neck and head
1:35
is more mysterious and looks very much like another planet?
1:39
SAL KHAN: That's right.
1:40
And actually, when you point that out
1:42
and how that painting is divided based
1:44
on where those landscapes and the ledge divide the painting,
1:47
I don't have my ruler out, but I would
1:48
guess that it's pretty close to the golden mean.
1:51
BETH HARRIS: I think you're probably right.
1:53
Those things that look like jars are actually
1:55
the bottom of columns cut off on either side of the painting.
2:00
SAL KHAN: So Leonardo da Vinci actually painted the columns,
2:03
and it was cropped?
2:04
BETH HARRIS: That's right.
2:05
And so the space that she's in would
2:07
have made a lot more sense as a balcony.
2:09
SAL KHAN: Well, you know, all of this-- actually,
2:11
just take a step back.
2:12
I mean, we started with this presumption that
2:14
it's-- and it's true-- that it's probably the most famous
2:17
painting in the world, but I guess,
2:19
I've never quite gotten why.
2:20
I mean, is this just a case of marketing?
2:22
BETH HARRIS: I think it happened in 1911, when the painting was
2:26
stolen from the Louvre and disappeared
2:28
for a couple of years and became notorious.
2:31
At that point in the 19th century,
2:33
the ""Mona Lisa"" was not the most popular painting at the Louvre.
2:36
Paintings by other artists, like Titian and Raphael,
2:39
were much more popular and even valued more highly
2:42
for insurance purposes.
2:45
So it really probably is only in the 20th century
2:47
that she became as important as she is now.
2:50
SAL KHAN: If you go back 150 years ago,
2:52
""Mona Lisa"" was not something that
2:54
was just ingrained in our culture.
2:55
BETH HARRIS: She was important.
2:57
People were interested in her, and people
2:58
were writing about her and they said some interesting things.
3:01
But she wasn't as famous as she is now.
3:03
And also, don't forget that the technology to reproduce her
3:07
existed only, really, in the 20th century in terms
3:09
of mass color reproductions.
3:11
And so her currency has certainly increased, I think,
3:15
in the last 100 years or so.
3:16
SAL KHAN: I see.
3:17
If you go back 150 years, there was probably
3:19
no such thing as super famous paintings.
3:22
BETH HARRIS: I think that might be true, actually.
3:24
There were paintings that were famous, or important,
3:27
but not celebrities in the way that the ""Mona Lisa"" is.
3:29
SAL KHAN: Right.
3:30
Not something that every person on the street would recognize.
3:31
BETH HARRIS: Yeah.
3:32
And of course, now I think most people
3:33
would say that what's so interesting about her
3:35
is her look and her smile, which have been interpreted
3:39
in many different ways.
3:40
SAL KHAN: Yeah, I know.
3:41
And I know that's kind of, I guess,
3:43
one of the claims to fame of the painting.
3:45
And you see that.
3:46
I mean, people like to look at it-- is she smirking,
3:49
is she happy, is she sad.
3:50
All of these things.
3:51
Is she looking at you.
3:52
All of these things that people try
3:53
to-- but, I guess, trying to look at it without all
3:57
of the social programming that I've had around this painting,
3:59
it strikes me is an interesting painting.
4:02
And it seems very technically well done.
4:04
And there's something very bright,
4:06
and just kind of an aura around her face.
4:09
I don't know if I wasn't programmed to really know
4:11
this painting and if I were to see this in the museum
4:13
amongst many, many others, that I would--
4:15
it really jump out at me.
4:16
BETH HARRIS: Portraits really took off during the Renaissance
4:19
beginning in the 1400s in Italy.
4:22
And Leonardo painted this in Florence.
4:24
And that's because of humanism.
4:26
One way that we define humanism is
4:28
taking an interest in human beings,
4:31
and the things of this world, and human achievement,
4:33
and individuality.
4:35
All of those values becoming more important
4:38
in the 15th century.
4:39
And so we begin to see a lot more portraits.
4:42
Also with the beginnings of a wealthy merchants
4:45
class in Florence in the 15th century,
4:48
people could afford portraits and begin to want them.
4:51
At first, portraits were painted with the figure in profile.
4:54
But later, especially in northern Europe,
4:57
artists like Durer or Memling started
5:00
to put their figures in believable spaces.
5:03
SAL KHAN: Right.
5:04
BETH HARRIS: And so, Leonardo's really
5:05
the first artist in Italy to do those things.
5:08
To make an oil painting, which is a relatively new medium
5:12
in Italy.
5:12
SAL KHAN: What did people use before oil?
5:13
BETH HARRIS: They used fresco and tempera painting.
5:15
Tempera for panel painting.
5:18
So this is oil on wood, whereas before, artists
5:20
would paint tempera on wood.
5:22
Tempera tends to look more flat than oil paint, where
5:26
you can really get a sense of modeling and light and dark.
5:29
So Leonardo's making this three-dimensional figure,
5:32
and he's using another technique called sfumato,
5:35
which means a kind of smokey haziness.
5:38
So he obscures the hard outlines around the forms,
5:42
which tend to flatten them.
5:43
One of the things that's fun to talk about with the Mona Lisa,
5:45
too, is all the things that people
5:47
have said about her over the years.
5:48
You might not be aware of the fact
5:50
that Sigmund Freud actually had a particular interpretation
5:54
of the Mona Lisa.
5:55
SAL KHAN: Yes, I'm sure he did.
5:56
[LAUGHTER]
5:58
I'm somewhat skeptical of him.
6:00
I would like to interpret his interpretations someday.
6:03
But yes.
6:04
BETH HARRIS: Freud said that the ""Mona Lisa's"" smile combined
6:07
the two ways that we tend to look at women in our culture.
6:10
In one way, she's very mothering and nurturing.
6:13
And in the other way, she seems very seductive.
6:15
SAL KHAN: I think that says more about Freud
6:17
than about Leonardo.
6:18
BETH HARRIS: You could be right.
6:19
[LAUGHTER]
6:20
And later artists, another artist that you already know,
6:23
Duchamp--
6:24
SAL KHAN: Duchamp, my favorite.
6:25
BETH HARRIS: Your favorite.
6:26
He took a reproduction of the ""Mona Lisa""
6:29
and drew a mustache on her.
6:30
SAL KHAN: I could imagine him doing that.
6:32
[LAUGHTER]
6:33
BETH HARRIS: I think the moustache is interesting,
6:35
because there is something not entirely feminine about her.
6:37
Something a little bit masculine.
6:39
SAL KHAN: Do you think it's that?
6:40
Or I mean, I guess there is a certain-- I mean,
6:42
it's kind of old now, especially because Duchamp did it,
6:44
I'm guessing, 80, 90 years ago.
6:47
But there is something hilarious about drawing
6:49
a mustache on a feminine form.
6:51
We all remember doing it as school kids-- just
6:53
getting a kick out of it.
6:54
And I could see it's especially funny for this painting.
6:57
BETH HARRIS: Taking something that's so high art
6:59
and making it silly, you know?
7:01
SAL KHAN: Exactly.
7:02
BETH HARRIS: Recently, the Prado in Madrid,
7:05
found what turns out to be, after some scientific testing,
7:09
a copy of the ""Mona Lisa,"" which in and of itself
7:12
is not that unusual, but it turns out
7:14
that their copy was made by another artist sitting
7:19
right next to Leonardo copying what he did stroke for stroke.
7:24
And they can tell this by analyzing the under drawing.
7:27
SAL KHAN: Yeah, she looks much younger.
7:29
BETH HARRIS: She has eyebrows.
7:30
SAL KHAN: Oh, that's right.
7:32
It makes you appreciate it.
7:32
That's where the creepiness comes from, because the ""Mona
7:35
Lisa"" we see looks jaundiced-- it's yellow.
7:37
And so, the painting is a little bit different.
7:39
The face is a little bit different,
7:41
but we can assume that the colors might have not
7:43
been that different.
7:44
BETH HARRIS: Exactly.
7:45
And it's a really interesting thing to think about.
7:47
What she would look like if she was cleaned.
7:49
And if she would still mean what she means to us.
7:53
If she--
7:53
SAL KHAN: Oh, I don't think she would,
7:54
because when I look at this cleaned painting,
7:56
it loses a lot of the mystery.
7:58
BETH HARRIS: Yeah, I agree.
8:00
And you can then understand the Louvre's decision
8:02
not to clean her.
8:03
SAL KHAN: I mean, the cleaned one, she looks better.
8:05
She looks younger.
8:07
She loses a lot of the motherly aspects
8:09
that Freud seems to want to ascribe to her.
8:12
Yeah, because the colors are brighter, they're more vibrant,
8:15
it's not as muted as the one that we've learned to like.
8:18
BETH HARRIS: Yeah.
8:19
Although, her reputation has grown over the years, who's
8:22
to say that we won't care so much about her again.
8:24
SAL KHAN: There might be a post-celebrity world
8:26
at some point.

0:15
getting elected.
0:16
And a lot of folks view that as a bit
0:18
of the final catalyst for the Civil War.
0:21
What's happening?
0:22
And is that accurate?
0:23
- [Voiceover] So, Lincoln is elected
0:25
as a Republican Party president.
0:28
This is the first Republican Party president, ever.
0:31
And the real basis of the Republican Party
0:35
is an anti-slavery platform.
0:37
They really don't want slavery
0:40
to extend into the Western territories
0:43
that have been acquired through the Mexican War.
0:46
So, they have been making both an economic,
0:50
and to some extent, moral argument against slavery.
0:54
So, when Lincoln becomes president,
0:56
the states of the South, particularly the Deep South,
0:59
or this Cotton Belt area, whose entire economic system
1:04
relies on slavery, they think that they are under attack.
1:08
That Lincoln is going to be coming for slavery
1:12
as soon as he gets a chance, as president.
1:14
- [Voiceover] And we're talking about
1:16
these states down here.
1:17
This is Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
1:19
Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida.
1:21
- [Voiceover] Right; so these are the real
1:24
cotton states, where slavery is highly entrenched.
1:29
There, more than 50% of the population
1:32
is enslaved working on cotton plantations.
1:35
And it's making the elite people,
1:37
elite whites in the South, very wealthy.
1:40
Cotton is just the backbone of their economy.
1:44
- [Voiceover] So what do they do?
1:45
Lincoln gets elected.
1:46
This is November of 1860?
1:48
- [Voiceover] That's right.
1:49
- [Voiceover] So what do they do about it?
1:51
They're afraid.
1:52
- [Voiceover] They're afraid that Lincoln
1:53
is going to do something about slavery.
1:56
So, over the course of this winter period,
2:01
this is in a period before we moved
2:05
the inauguration up to January,
2:07
so it used to be that presidents
2:09
would be elected in November
2:11
and not take office until March.
2:13
- [Voiceover] Yeah, we have here,
2:15
this Lincoln gets elected in November,
2:16
but then he doesn't get inaugurated
2:17
until March, over here.
2:18
- [Voiceover] So there's this long,
2:19
lame duck period where everyone
2:21
knows that a new political party
2:23
is going to be in power, a new president
2:25
is in power, but he's not in office yet.
2:28
- [Voiceover] And so you have James Buchanan
2:30
sitting around; he's still the president, but.
2:32
- [Voiceover] But, yeah, his days are numbered,
2:36
and his power is pretty limited.
2:38
So, over the course of what they call this
2:40
Secession Winter, the seven states
2:43
of the Deep South get together
2:46
and they secede from the Union, one after another.
2:50
And this includes South Carolina,
2:52
Mississippi, Florida, Alabama,
2:55
Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas.
2:58
They secede from the Union,
2:59
and they form what they call
3:00
The Confederate States of America,
3:02
which is, basically, almost exactly
3:05
the same as The United States of America.
3:07
Their constitution is based very
3:10
closely on the US Constitution.
3:12
But it guarantees the existence of slavery.
3:16
It explicitly says that slavery
3:17
is allowed and protected forever.
3:20
And they elect Jefferson Davis as their president.
3:24
- [Voiceover] So when they seceded,
3:26
for them it was clearly about slavery.
3:28
- [Voiceover] Right; everything is about slavery.
3:30
They are concerned that Lincoln
3:33
is going to interfere with slavery.
3:35
They are afraid that because slavery
3:37
is being outlawed many other places
3:39
in the world, particularly in the Western Hemisphere,
3:43
that, one way or another, slavery's days are numbered.
3:46
And if they're going to protect their livelihood
3:49
as slave owners and as cotton planters,
3:52
they're going to have to form their own nation
3:54
to make sure that it's protected.
3:56
- [Voiceover] And James Buchanan
3:57
is officially president when all of this has happened.
4:00
You have seven states of the United States,
4:02
I guess they're not so united anymore, leaving.
4:05
Is he just powerless to do anything?
4:07
- [Voiceover] Well, he tries a few things.
4:10
He was a very ineffective president to begin with.
4:14
It's hard to be an effective president
4:16
when Congress is so divided over issues.
4:19
One thing that Congress actually does
4:21
before Lincoln is in office, and before
4:24
these states officially secede,
4:26
is they try what's called the Crittenden Plan,
4:29
proposed by John Crittenden of Kentucky,
4:32
saying we will officially protect
4:35
slavery in the Constitution.
4:37
We will say that you can't outlaw
4:39
slavery in the South, and we'll even
4:42
extend this Missouri Compromise
4:44
line, which was sort of the official line
4:46
between North and South,
4:47
between free states and slave states,
4:50
all the way to the Pacific.
4:51
So, just so you know, Southern states,
4:53
we'll make sure that we won't get rid of slavery.
4:55
- [Voiceover] So this Crittenden Compromise,
4:57
this was kind of a last ditch effort.
4:58
Everyone's started to see the writing on the wall.
5:00
These seven states, especially,
5:01
were very loose-in-the-socket.
5:04
- [Voiceover] And this was a last ditch
5:05
effort to keep them in the Union, perhaps.
5:09
- [Voiceover] Yeah, and I don't want to say
5:10
it's too little too late, but for the South,
5:13
they have seen the writing on the wall.
5:16
They have seen that this is going
5:18
to be their only opportunity to secede.
5:21
- [Voiceover] Lincoln got elected, and his
5:22
whole party is based on being anti-slavery.
5:24
- [Voiceover] Right.
5:25
So, they want to get out while the getting is good.
5:28
So that they can make sure
5:29
that slavery remains in their states.
5:31
- [Voiceover] All right, so during this lame duck period,
5:34
the seven states, these Deep South states, they secede.
5:37
Then Lincoln gets inaugurated.
5:39
He is now president.
5:41
And we're not really in the Civil War yet.
5:43
- [Voiceover] No, in fact, Lincoln's
5:45
inaugural address is very conciliatory.
5:50
We think of Lincoln as being a really great orator.
5:53
And he certainly was, but his first inaugural address,
5:57
if you read it, is very much
6:00
a plea to the South,
6:02
saying hey, really, I'm not planning
6:07
on outlawing slavery.
6:08
So, the anti-slavery platform that Lincoln
6:11
ascribes to is specifically about
6:14
not extending slavery to the West.
6:16
So he's saying I'm not in favor
6:19
of getting rid of slavery where it is,
6:22
so there's no reason for you all to secede.
6:25
Come back, everything will be situation normal.
6:28
- [Voiceover] And they don't.
6:29
- [Voiceover] No, as I said,
6:32
they've already seen
6:35
that this is their opportunity
6:37
to make sure that slavery continues,
6:40
by creating their own nation.
6:43
So, in the South, there are
6:45
a bunch of arsenals
6:48
and forts that belong to the United States;
6:51
and most of these are taken over by the Confederacy
6:56
when it becomes its own nation.
6:58
- [Voiceover] This is a picture of one right here.
6:59
This is Sumter.
7:01
- [Voiceover] Right; so Fort Sumter
7:03
is right in Charleston Harbor.
7:05
And this is a Union fort, or a United States fort,
7:08
that's holding out, basically.
7:10
They're running out of supplies,
7:13
they have tried to have supplies brought
7:15
in to them before, which have been repelled.
7:20
- [Voiceover] They're holding out.
7:21
They're well in Confederate territory,
7:23
but they're still controlled by United States soldiers.
7:28
- [Voiceover] Right; so, they do not
7:31
want to surrender this fort.
7:32
Lincoln lets the Confederates, the Rebels,
7:37
know that he wants to resupply this fort.
7:43
The Confederates instead fire on Fort Sumter.
7:47
They start lobbing artillery at it.
7:50
Over the course of a day, they force
7:55
the Union forces in Fort Sumter to surrender.
7:59
- [Voiceover] I guess this was the real
8:02
matchstick for the war.
8:04
But this wasn't the first tension.
8:05
- [Voiceover] No; obviously this had been
8:07
going on for some time.
8:09
- [Voiceover] Even in Buchanan's
8:11
lame duck period, there's probably a little bit of tension.
8:13
- [Voiceover] Yeah, if you want to be expansive,
8:17
you could say that this tension is almost built into
8:20
the Constitution when they don't--
8:22
- [Voiceover] (laughs) - [Voiceover] (laughs)
8:23
secede.
8:24
- [Voiceover] You got that right.
8:25
But especially, even post-secession
8:26
of these first seven states,
8:28
there are already some tensions,
8:30
especially if they're taking over these forts.
8:32
Former United States soldiers are now
8:34
thinking about cutting off supplies
8:35
to current United States soldiers.
8:39
And then Fort Sumter, it sounds
8:40
like this was definitely the straw
8:42
that breaks the camel's back, so to speak.
8:44
- [Voiceover] Yeah, this is the tinder box.
8:45
And I think it's maybe intended
8:47
to be a tinder box on both sides.
8:49
Because Lincoln wants to be sure
8:51
that if there's going to be a war,
8:53
the North isn't going to fire the first shot.
8:55
They want to make sure
8:56
that this is the South's decision.
8:58
It can be blamed on them if it needs to be.
9:00
- [Voiceover] This is a pattern you see
9:02
throughout history, is that no one at least
9:04
wants to, officially, be the person to fire the first shot.
9:07
They often look for a good reason
9:09
to fire the first shot because
9:10
they want to get into war,
9:11
but everyone wants
9:13
to have the moral high ground.
9:14
- [Voiceover] Right; and in the South,
9:17
they are looking to make sure
9:20
that this is kind of a morale building moment.
9:23
When they fire on Fort Sumter,
9:25
they're firing on a federal fort, right?
9:28
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm.
9:30
- [Voiceover] In any circumstances,
9:31
that's going to bring on war.
9:32
And they're hoping that if they can
9:34
kind of get this fire started,
9:37
then these four other slaveholding
9:39
states, or actually eight other
9:41
slaveholding states, in the South
9:43
are going to join the effort.
9:46
And that's pretty much exactly what happens.
9:48
So, after they fire on Fort Sumter,
9:50
the fort is surrendered to the Confederacy.
9:54
Lincoln says, okay, you want to start a war, we got a war.
9:57
He calls for 75,000 troops,
10:02
volunteers to put down the insurrection.
10:05
He calls them for a 90-day service period,
10:08
which tells you how long
10:10
they thought this was gonna last.
10:11
After Lincoln has asked for this army,
10:15
four more slaveholding states in the South secede.
10:19
And that's Virginia, the most important of these,
10:22
it's gonna be the real battleground of the Civil War.
10:25
- [Voiceover] Today, we'd consider that West Virginia
10:28
and Virginia, but that was Virginia back then.
10:30
- [Voiceover] Right; Virginia, Arkansas,
10:33
Tennessee, and North Carolina
10:35
also join the Confederate States of America.
10:37
And the war is on.

teded_1289,Describe at least four forces the body exerts in the process of riding a normal bicycle.,open-ended,"Hey it's me Destin.
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.
You've heard people say,
""It's just like riding a bike""
meaning it's really easy and you can't forget how to do it, right?
But I did something.
I did something that damaged my mind.
It happened on the streets of Amsterdam
and I got really scared honestly.
I can't ride a bike like you can anymore.
Before I show you the video of what happened
I need to tell you the back story.
Like many six year olds with a MacGyver mullet
I learned how to ride a bike when I was really young.
I had learned a life skill and I was really proud of it.
Everything changed though when my friend Barney called me 25 years later.
Where I work, the welders are geniuses, and they like to play jokes on the engineers.
He had a challenge for me.
He had built a special bicycle and he wanted me to try to ride it.
He had only changed one thing.
When you turn the handlebar to the left, the wheel goes to the right.
When you turn it to the right, the wheel goes to the left.
I thought this would be easy so I hopped on the bike
ready to demonstrate how quickly I could conquer this.
- And here he is ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Destin Sandlin.
First attempt riding the bicycle.
- Yeah, yeah.
I couldn't do it.
You can see that I'm laughing but I'm actually really frustrated.
In this moment I had a really deep revelation.
My thinking was in a rut.
This bike revealed a very deep truth to me.
I had the knowledge of how to operate the bike,
but I did not have the understanding.
Therefore, knowledge is not understanding.
Look I know what you're probably thinking.
Destin's probably just an uncoordinated engineer and can't do it.
But that's not the case at all.
The algorithm that's associated with riding a bike,
in your brain, is just that complicated.
Think about it.
Downwards force on the pedals,
leaning your whole body,
pulling and pushing the handlebars,
gyroscopic procession in the wheels,
every single force is part of this algorithm.
And if you change any one part it affects the entire control system.
I do not make definitive statements that often,
but I'm telling you right now,
you cannot ride this bicycle.
You might think you can, but you can't.
I know this because I'm often asked to speak at universities and conferences
and I take the bike with me.
It's always the same.
People think they're gonna try some trick or they're just gonna power through it.
It doesn't work.
Your brain cannot handle this.
For instance, this guy.
I offered him two hundred dollars just to ride this bike ten feet across the stage.
Everybody thought he could do it.
[crowd exclaims] No no no. You didn't understand.
So.. this way, not that way. [crowd laughs]
Alright so, whenever you're ready.
Remember you have to keep your feet on.. [crowd laughs]
[laughing crowd]
You've gotta start rolling at least. And go.
Keep your feet on the pedal, go.
[laughing crowd]
Just keep your feet on the pedals.
Alright, one more time.
Once you have a rigid way of thinking in your head,
sometimes you cannot change that, even if you want to.
So here's what I did.
It was a personal challenge.
I stayed out here in this driveway
and I practiced about 5 minutes every day.
My neighbors made fun of me.
I had many wrecks.
But after 8 months, this happened.
One day I couldn't ride the bike, and the next day I could.
It was like I could feel some kind of pathway in my brain that was now unlocked.
It was really weird though.
It's like there's this trail in my brain,
but if I wasn't paying close enough attention to it,
my brain would easily lose that neural path and jump back onto the old road it was more familiar with.
Any small distractions at all, like a cellphone ringing in my pocket,
would instantly throw my brain back to the old control algorithm and I would wreck.
But at least I could ride it.
My son is the closest person to me genetically
and he's been riding a normal bike for 3 years,
that's over half his life.
I wanted to know how long it would take him to learn how to ride a backwards bike
so I told him if he learned how to ride a backwards bike
he could go with me to Australia and meet a real astronaut.
Are you gonna give up?
- No.
- Go ahead.
This is how it starts.
Look at this.
This is such a big deal.
Get up, you got it.
Did you see his brain get it?
So he, in.. How many weeks we been doing this? Two weeks?
In two weeks he did something that took me 8 months to do,
which demonstrates that a child has more neural plasticity,
am I even saying that right?
Than an adult.
It's clear from this experiment that children have a much more plastic brain than adults.
That's why the best time to learn a language is when you're a young child.
Alright, today's bike log.
I can ride smooth, I can ride fast.
I'm thinking the experiment is over.
OK now I'm in Amsterdam,
a city that has more bicycles than people.
The question is, can I ride a normal bike now.
I mean I have spent all this time unlearning how to ride a bike,
If I go back and try to ride a normal one will my brain mess up.
So I've tweeted a Smarter Every Day.. meetup, if you will.
And I'm gonna see if somebody brings a bicycle and I'm gonna try to ride a normal bike.
It's backwards, it's backwards.
This was one of the most frustrating moments of my life.
I had ridden a normal bike since I was six,
but in this moment I couldn't do it any more.
I had set out to prove that I could free my brain from a cognitive bias,
but at this point I'm pretty sure that all I've proved is that I can only re-designate that bias.
So what you're not seeing is there's a group of people here,
looking at me.
Looking at the strange American,
that can't ride a bike, cause they think I'm dumb.
But I'm actually two levels deep into this,
because I've learned and un-learned. Alright.
After 20 minutes of making a fool out of myself,
suddenly my brain clicked back into the old algorithm.
I can't explain it, but it happened in a very specific moment.
[laughter]
I've got it, I've got it, I've got it.
I'm back.
Oh it clicked. It clicked.
I've got it, I've got it.
OK there it is.
There was the moment.
OK I can ride a bike.
I tried to explain this to the people around me,
and they just didn't get it.
They thought I was faking the previous 20 minutes
and I couldn't get anybody to believe me.
That looked like I faked it, didn't it.
You think I'm faking. You don't believe me.
- It looked so weird...
- You think I'm lying don't you.
I'm not lying.
I felt like the only person on the planet who had ever un-learned how to ride a bike,
and I couldn't articulate it to anyone
because everybody just knew that you can't forget how to ride a bike.
So I learned 3 things from this experiment.
I learned that welders are often smarter than engineers,
I learned that knowledge does not equal understanding,
and I learned that truth is truth.
No matter what I think about it.
So be very careful how you interpret things
because you're looking at the world with a bias
whether you think you are or not.
I'm Destin,
you're getting Smarter Every Day,
have a good one.
OK if you wanna support Smarter Every Day
you can download a free audio book at audible.com/smarter
I recommend Commander Hadfield's book
which is An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth.
I read it, it was awesome.
If you think about it, I had to learn how to ride a different kind of bicycle
and my son did it as well,
but Commander Hadfield had to learn how to ride a different space ship.
Not only that, but a different type of space station.
He was on Mir and the International Space Station.
Anyway, if you're interested in supporting Smarter Every Day,

I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.
Have a good one.
[crowd cheers]
Everything is wrong... My instinctive reaction is wrong.
(Destin) Why don't you ride it? You just build it?
- I can't ride it, I just build it.

khan_video_VpuN8vCQ--M_9369,How does the law of large numbers relate to a scatter plot with no pattern in the data set?,Essay,"•
0:01
Let's learn a little bit about the law of large numbers, which
0:08
is on many levels, one of the most intuitive laws in
0:11
mathematics and in probability theory.
0:14
But because it's so applicable to so many things, it's often a
0:18
misused law or sometimes, slightly misunderstood.
0:22
So just to be a little bit formal in our mathematics, let
0:26
me just define it for you first and then we'll talk a little
0:28
bit about the intuition.
0:29
So let's say I have a random variable, X.
0:33
And we know its expected value or its population mean.
0:38
The law of large numbers just says that if we take a sample
0:41
of n observations of our random variable, and if we were
0:46
to average all of those observations-- and let me
0:49
define another variable.
0:50
Let's call that x sub n with a line on top of it.
0:54
This is the mean of n observations of our
0:56
random variable.
0:57
So it's literally this is my first observation.
1:00
So you can kind of say I run the experiment once and I get
1:03
this observation and I run it again, I get that observation.
1:07
And I keep running it n times and then I divide by my
1:11
number of observations.
1:12
So this is my sample mean.
1:14
This is the mean of all the observations I've made.
1:17
The law of large numbers just tells us that my sample mean
1:23
will approach my expected value of the random variable.
1:27
Or I could also write it as my sample mean will approach my
1:32
population mean for n approaching infinity.
1:39
And I'll be a little informal with what does approach or
1:43
what does convergence mean?
1:44
But I think you have the general intuitive sense that if
1:46
I take a large enough sample here that I'm going to end up
1:50
getting the expected value of the population as a whole.
1:54
And I think to a lot of us that's kind of intuitive.
1:56
That if I do enough trials that over large samples, the trials
2:01
would kind of give me the numbers that I would expect
2:04
given the expected value and the probability and all that.
2:06
But I think it's often a little bit misunderstood in terms
2:09
of why that happens.
2:10
And before I go into that let me give you
2:13
a particular example.
2:15
The law of large numbers will just tell us that-- let's say I
2:17
have a random variable-- X is equal to the number of heads
2:24
after 100 tosses of a fair coin-- tosses or flips
2:30
of a fair coin.
2:36
First of all, we know what the expected value of
2:37
this random variable is.
2:39
It's the number of tosses, the number of trials times
2:43
the probabilities of success of any trial.
2:46
So that's equal to 50.
2:49
So the law of large numbers just says if I were to take a
2:53
sample or if I were to average the sample of a bunch of these
2:57
trials, so you know, I get-- my first time I run this trial I
3:03
flip 100 coins or have 100 coins in a shoe box and I shake
3:06
the shoe box and I count the number of heads, and I get 55.
3:10
So that Would be X1.
3:11
Then I shake the box again and I get 65.
3:15
Then I shake the box again and I get 45.
3:18
And I do this n times and then I divide it by the number
3:22
of times I did it.
3:24
The law of large numbers just tells us that this the
3:27
average-- the average of all of my observations, is going
3:31
to converge to 50 as n approaches infinity.
3:38
Or for n approaching 50.
3:40
I'm sorry, n approaching infinity.
3:42
And I want to talk a little bit about why this happens
3:45
or intuitively why this is.
3:47
A lot of people kind of feel that oh, this means that if
3:50
after 100 trials that if I'm above the average that somehow
3:54
the laws of probability are going to give me more heads
3:57
or fewer heads to kind of make up the difference.
4:00
That's not quite what's going to happen.
4:01
That's often called the gambler's fallacy.
4:04
Let me differentiate.
4:05
And I'll use this example.
4:06
So let's say-- let me make a graph.
4:08
And I'll switch colors.
4:23
This is n, my x-axis is n.
4:25
This is the number of trials I take.
4:27
And my y-axis, let me make that the sample mean.
4:32
And we know what the expected value is, we know the expected
4:36
value of this random variable is 50.
4:39
Let me draw that here.
4:42
This is 50.
4:47
So just going to the example I did.
4:49
So when n is equal to-- let me just [INAUDIBLE]
4:53
here.
4:54
So my first trial I got 55 and so that was my average.
4:59
I only had one data point.
5:00
Then after two trials, let's see, then I have 65.
5:04
And so my average is going to be 65 plus 55 divided by 2.
5:09
which is 60.
5:10
So then my average went up a little bit.
5:13
Then I had a 45, which will bring my average
5:15
down a little bit.
5:16
I won't plot a 45 here.
5:18
Now I have to average all of these out.
5:19
What's 45 plus 65?
5:22
Let me actually just get the number just
5:23
so you get the point.
5:24
So it's 55 plus 65.
5:28
It's 120 plus 45 is 165.
5:32
Divided by 3.
5:36
3 goes into 165 5-- 5 times 3 is 15.
5:39
It's 53.
5:42
No, no, no.
5:43
55.
5:45
So the average goes down back down to 55.
5:46
And we could keep doing these trials.
5:49
So you might say that the law of large numbers tell this,
5:51
OK, after we've done 3 trials and our average is there.
5:56
So a lot of people think that somehow the gods of probability
6:00
are going to make it more likely that we get fewer
6:02
heads in the future.
6:03
That somehow the next couple of trials are going to have to
6:06
be down here in order to bring our average down.
6:09
And that's not necessarily the case.
6:10
Going forward the probabilities are always the same.
6:13
The probabilities are always 50% that I'm
6:15
going to get heads.
6:16
It's not like if I had a bunch of heads to start off with or
6:19
more than I would have expected to start off with, that all of
6:22
a sudden things would be made up and I would get more tails.
6:25
That would the gambler's fallacy.
6:27
That if you have a long streak of heads or you have a
6:29
disproportionate number of heads, that at some point
6:32
you're going to have-- you have a higher likelihood of having a
6:35
disproportionate number of tails.
6:37
And that's not quite true.
6:38
What the law of large numbers tells us is that it doesn't
6:41
care-- let's say after some finite number of trials your
6:45
average actually-- it's a low probability of this happening,
6:48
but let's say your average is actually up here.
6:50
Is actually at 70.
6:52
You're like, wow, we really diverged a good bit from
6:56
the expected value.
6:57
But what the law of large numbers says, well, I don't
6:58
care how many trials this is.
7:00
We have an infinite number of trials left.
7:03
And the expected value for that infinite number of trials,
7:06
especially in this type of situation is going to be this.
7:11
So when you average a finite number that averages out to
7:15
some high number, and then an infinite number that's going to
7:18
converge to this, you're going to over time, converge back
7:22
to the expected value.
7:24
And that was a very informal way of describing it, but
7:27
that's what the law or large numbers tells you.
7:29
And it's an important thing.
7:30
It's not telling you that if you get a bunch of heads that
7:33
somehow the probability of getting tails is going
7:36
to increase to kind of make up for the heads.
7:38
What it's telling you is, is that no matter what happened
7:41
over a finite number of trials, no matter what the average is
7:44
over a finite number of trials, you have an infinite
7:46
number of trials left.
7:47
And if you do enough of them it's going to converge back
7:51
to your expected value.
7:52
And this is an important thing to think about.
7:54
But this isn't used in practice every day with the lottery and
7:57
with casinos because they know that if you do large enough
8:02
samples-- and we could even calculate-- if you do large
8:04
enough samples, what's the probability that things
8:07
deviate significantly?
8:09
But casinos and the lottery every day operate on this
8:12
principle that if you take enough people-- sure, in the
8:15
short-term or with a few samples, a couple people
8:18
might beat the house.
8:19
But over the long-term the house is always going to win
8:22
because of the parameters of the games that they're
8:24
making you play.
8:25
Anyway, this is an important thing in probability and I
8:28
think it's fairly intuitive.
8:29
Although, sometimes when you see it formally explained like
8:32
this with the random variables and that it's a little
8:34
bit confusing.
8:34
All it's saying is that as you take more and more samples, the
8:39
average of that sample is going to approximate the
8:44
true average.
8:45
Or I should be a little bit more particular.
8:47
The mean of your sample is going to converge to the true
8:51
mean of the population or to the expected value of
8:54
the random variable.
8:56

0:00
- [Voiceover] I think one of the most underrated skills
0:03
for learning history is learning
0:05
how to think like a historian.
0:07
And what do I mean by ""thinking like a historian""?
0:11
Does that mean that you have to go out and buy
0:15
a tweed jacket with some elbow patches
0:17
and maybe grow a long, white beard
0:20
and sit around all day pondering whether the Civil War
0:23
was caused by slavery or states' rights?
0:27
No, but you can try that if you want.
0:30
But I would say thinking like a historian is a little bit
0:33
like being a combination between a storyteller
0:41
and a scientist . . .
0:43
you're gonna see me draw a really, really bad beaker here
0:49
there we go . . .
0:53
some little fumes coming off of that.
0:57
and a lawyer, maybe I'll put a gavel here.
1:08
It's a gavel, not a croquet mallet or a hammer.
1:12
So first let's start with the storytelling aspect.
1:18
I think one of the most important things that we can learn
1:22
from telling this story of history is that
1:24
in a good story nothing just happens.
1:32
Imagine a story where everything just happened.
1:37
The story would be: the wind blows, the earth turns, right?
1:42
No one is making those things happen
1:45
and that's why it's kind of a boring story
1:48
because it doesn't show cause and effect.
1:50
And that cause and effect is really
1:53
the backbone of history, right?
1:57
And you would be surprised how often
1:59
people can fall into the trap of telling history,
2:03
this incredible story about what people have done
2:07
in the past that has led to the society we have today
2:10
as if it were kind of a laundry list of events
2:14
that just followed one after another without
2:16
any possibility of things being different.
2:19
People will say, ""and then World War II happened""
2:21
or ""and then the United States was born,"" right?
2:26
Those statements are in passive voice because they don't
2:29
talk about the people who make these things happen.
2:32
And really, short of a natural disaster,
2:35
pretty much everything happens in history
2:38
because people made it happen.
2:41
So when you think like a historian, you kind of think
2:44
the same way that a novelist might think.
2:46
OK, what is this character's motive?
2:49
What are they going to do to make their wish come true?
2:55
What are the influences that lead
3:00
a person to make certain choices?
3:02
And just like people make choices,
3:05
nations make choices, right?
3:07
World War I didn't just happen
3:10
and just as people make choices,
3:12
actions have consequences.
3:14
You wouldn't write a story where
3:16
a thief stole 100 million dollars
3:18
and the police didn't even try to come after her.
3:21
Neither can you write a story about history without
3:24
talking about the effects that actions have on people.
3:27
So that's the storytelling aspect
3:30
of thinking like a historian.
3:31
Let's talk about the scientific aspect.
3:34
We often think of history as something
3:36
that's pretty much done, right?
3:39
It's a series of events that happened in the past
3:44
and now we just have to memorize what happened
3:47
so we can learn from it and maybe have a good idea
3:50
about what to do in the future.
3:52
But really there is only so much we can actually know
3:56
about what happened in the past.
3:57
And so historians always have to do
4:01
a kind of research to understand what happened
4:06
and get a better idea of what people were feeling.
4:10
So just like scientists have theories,
4:14
when historians think about the past,
4:17
they're really thinking about theories as well.
4:20
They're saying, ""ok, I have a theory about
4:23
""what caused the evolution of jazz in the 1920s.""
4:27
Why did jazz become a major
4:30
popular form of music in the 1920s?
4:33
Well, I'm gonna theorize it was because people
4:36
were reacting to the horror of World War I
4:39
which made so many people interested in kind of,
4:42
staccato notes and discordant sounds.
4:45
Alright, so that's a theory.
4:47
Well, how do you go about proving a theory?
4:49
And the answer is you do research
4:51
and you consult evidence, right?
4:53
And the way that you do that in history
4:56
is usually by doing a lot of reading, right?
4:59
You might say, alright well, let me take
5:02
the letters of some jazz musicians from this time period
5:05
and see what they write about.
5:06
Maybe they write all about how
5:09
they experienced battle in World War I
5:11
and they were trying to reflect that in their music.
5:14
Or maybe they write that World War I
5:16
had nothing to do with their interest in music.
5:19
Actually, they wanted to simulate the sounds of flight
5:24
because they were so interested in
5:26
modern forms of transportation.
5:28
So our understanding of what happened in the past
5:30
is always just a theory.
5:33
I mean we have a pretty good idea
5:36
of what was going on most of the time,
5:39
but new information comes to light all the time, right?
5:42
I mean people are always cleaning out their grandma's attic
5:45
and finding some new documents
5:47
and as the preponderance of the evidence shifts and changes
5:51
so might our understanding of the past.
5:54
The last aspect of thinking like a historian
5:56
I want to talk about is this kind of lawyerly aspect.
6:00
And what I mean by this is that historians
6:04
are always making an argument.
6:14
Just like a lawyer gets up in a court room and says,
6:16
""Here's my idea, now let me support it
6:19
""with the evidence from witnesses, from experts,
6:23
""from objects we might have found at a crime scene.""
6:27
A historian is saying, ""believe my theory.
6:30
""Believe my evidence.""
6:33
And I think the analogy of law is really powerful here
6:36
because you could see the same pieces of evidence
6:39
used to support two different arguments.
6:42
So for example, say there's, maybe . . .
6:46
a sock that was found at the scene of a crime
6:51
right, and here's our sock . . .
6:58
I'm not a beautiful artist.
7:02
But, maybe the prosecution
7:06
tries to argue . . .
7:09
that the accused must have committed
7:12
this crime because the sock is his size.
7:20
Right, the sock shows he did it.
7:22
Whereas the defense
7:27
might say, ""My client never wears socks,
7:30
""he always wears sandals.""
7:32
So it's clear that the sock shows that
7:35
he couldn't possibly have been the one to do this crime.
7:38
So that's how we end up with so many
7:40
different interpretations of the same event.
7:43
The task of the historian is to gather evidence
7:46
and to present an argument that they think will
7:51
best convince the public of their interpretation.
7:55
And so these interpretations do change over time.
7:58
So in later videos we'll get into the nuts and bolts
8:01
of how you tell these stories and make these arguments.
8:04
But for now, I just kind of want you to see
8:07
that thinking like a historian is not
8:09
something that only historians can do.
8:12
It's actually a really useful skill
8:14
for lots of aspects of your life.
8:16
We tell stories, search for evidence, and make arguments
8:20
in our lives all the time about things
8:22
that we interact with every day like our favorite
8:25
bands, our favorite foods, our political views, right?
8:29
We base those on our own experiences,
8:32
consequences in our lives
8:34
and evidence that we see around us.
8:37
And we can do the same thing for the past.
8:39
It's not such a foreign country.
8:41
What we have are the remnants of that past
8:44
and the ability to interpret them.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,vIdMgO-tfyE,

(music) (""In The Sky With Diamonds"" by Scalding Lucy)
0:05
Steven: We're in Washington D.C. on the mall
0:08
at the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial.
0:10
Beth: With is situated right between
0:12
the Washington Monument and the Lincolcn Memorial.
0:16
Maya Lin, the architect of the memorial
0:19
sought about uniting the memorial to the nation's past,
0:23
bringing together the past and the present.
0:25
Steven: It's this very long series of
0:28
slabs of stone, this highly-reflective black granite
0:32
that actually points to both of those monuments.
0:35
Beth: Although the architect didn't like to
0:37
refer to these as walls, in a way they are walls,
0:40
but it's very thin, sunk into the ground
0:43
and inscribed with the names of
0:44
the servicemen who died in the Vietnam War.
0:47
Steven: Now there are more than 58,000 names
0:50
and in fact, more names are being added.
0:52
It is overwhelming in the density of names.
0:56
What happens as you walk down this path,
1:00
you sink into the earth.
1:02
The earth opens up and reveals these names.
1:05
Because the surface of the stone is so reflective,
1:09
it becomes a mirror and really all that
1:11
seems to have substance is
1:14
the rougher surface of the names themselves.
1:17
Beth: Maya Lin's idea was that it was the names
1:20
that were the reality, the substance of the monument
1:24
and that the reflectivity of the granite
1:28
opened up into another world that we could not enter,
1:31
but which was there for us to see.
1:33
Steven: She describes when she first visited the site
1:36
that she wanted to reveal that edge.
1:39
Beth: In fact, she said, ""I had a simple impulse
1:41
to cut into the earth. I imagined taking a knife
1:45
and cutting into the earth, opening it up
1:47
and initial violence and pain that in time would heal.""
1:51
She writes,""That the experience of the monument
1:53
would help people to come to terms
1:55
with the death of their loved ones.""
1:57
Steven: There is a real journey involved here.
1:58
You walk down in, you find the name
2:01
of your loved one embedded within
2:03
the chronological sequence of the death
2:06
of all of these soldiers, and then you walk back out.
2:09
Beth: That's right. In the center,
2:11
the chronology begins and goes down toward the right
2:14
as we're facing the wall and then picks up again
2:16
on the low edge of the left side
2:19
and then towards the center again.
2:21
As we move down the center, the path widens
2:25
and the granite rises more than 10 feet above us.
2:28
Steven: The names become a symbol of
2:30
this person multiplied more than 58,000 times,
2:34
but even though you've got that abstraction,
2:36
you also have this very concrete reality.
2:40
You have this place for family to come,
2:42
to gather, to reflect on that name.
2:44
Beth: Maya Lin talks about the name as
2:47
an abstraction that in fact, means more to
2:51
family and loved ones than a picture.
2:55
The picture represents someone at
2:56
a particular time and a particular place
2:58
as one moment in their lives whereas a name
3:02
might recall everything about that person.
3:04
Steven: There is this powerful accumulation
3:06
of all of the names.
3:08
As you descend, as you walk into the densest middle
3:11
of the monument, it becomes absolutely overwhelming.
3:14
Beth: It's a very different experience than
3:16
most previous war memorials.
3:19
When we think about the history of war memorials,
3:21
we often think about memorials to military heroes like
3:25
the monument to Lord Nelson in Trafalgar Square
3:28
or we might think about the Shaw memorial by
3:31
Augustus Saint-Gaudens in the National Gallery
3:33
where you have a hero leading an
3:36
anonymous army with an allegorical figure
3:39
representing peace and death,
3:41
this combination of allegory and heroism
3:44
that's usually in memorials,
3:46
it's completely absent here.
3:48
Steven: How can one create a meaningful monument
3:51
in the late 20th century?
3:53
What does it mean to strip away all of the
3:55
representational form?
3:56
What does it mean to create something so
3:59
subconsciously abstract and yet also so
4:01
powerful and so meaningful?
4:03
Beth: Evidently the committee that judged this
4:05
decided that this abstraction would be best.
4:08
It's interesting to think about how the committee
4:11
didn't know who was Maya Lin was.
4:13
There were 1,400 entries, completely anonymous.
4:17
Maya Lin at that point, was an undergraduate at Yale,
4:19
she was an architecture student, she's an Asian American.
4:22
It's interesting to think about what
4:24
might have happened had they known
4:26
who this application was from.
4:28
Steven: Once her identity had been revealed,
4:30
there was real backlash and racism.
4:33
There was backlash also about the abstraction.
4:35
Ultimately that was resolved by
4:37
a much more naturalistic sculpture
4:38
adjacent to the main memorial.
4:41
Beth: One that shows soldiers in a
4:43
very naturalistic way, three-dimensionally,
4:46
which is also powerful, but in a way that
4:48
feels much more public and far less intimate.
4:50
Steven: Maya Lin was brilliant in creating
4:53
a public space and yet tremendous intimacy.
4:56
We can feel those names inscribed.
4:58
The active reading is to come close,
5:00
to internalize those names.
5:03
Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial is one of the most
5:06
successful memorials in the nation.
5:08
Beth: And apparently one of the most visited
5:10
monuments in Washington D.C.
5:13
In an article that was published much later,
5:15
writing about her ideas for the monument,
5:17
Maya Lin said, ""It would be an interface between
5:20
our world and the quieter, darker,
5:22
more peaceful world beyond.
5:25
I chose black granite in order to make
5:27
the surface reflective and peaceful.
5:29
I never looked at the memorial as a wall,
5:31
an object, but as an edge to the earth,
5:34
an opened side. The mirrored sect would
5:36
double the size of the park creating two worlds;
5:40
one we are part of and one we cannot enter.""
5:43
Steven: Even that black granite created controversy.
5:45
She also talked about how she couldn't
5:48
expect granite that came from Canada
5:50
or from Sweden, two countries that had
5:52
really good quality black granite because
5:55
there was too much political baggage because
5:58
draft dodgers had gone to both of those countries.
6:00
Beth: One opponent of her design said,
6:03
""One needs no artistic education to see
6:05

6:12
No, I think this is very different than what
6:14
Maya Lin intended for the wall.
6:16
She specifically took an apolitical approach
6:20
and wanted the design to be about those veterans
6:24
who had sacrificed their lives and not about
6:26
the political controversy at all;
6:28
not about whether if the was was
6:29
something shameful or something honorable.
6:32
Steven: The country had not only fought the war,
6:34
but then fought itself over the meaning of the war.
6:37
Maya Lin was very wise in sidestepping that
6:40
and putting to the fore simply the names,
6:45
the numerical power of all those fallen.
6:48
Beth: And she wrote, ""The wall dematerializes

SPEAKER 1: We're in the British Museum,
0:06
and we're looking at one of the most important objects
0:08
in the collection, the Rosetta Stone.
0:10
SPEAKER 2: It's in a glass case, surrounded
0:12
by people who are taking pictures of it.
0:14
SPEAKER 1: People love it.
0:15
SPEAKER 2: They do.
0:16
And there's gifts in the gift shop about it.
0:18
SPEAKER 1: You can get your own little Rosetta Stone.
0:20
SPEAKER 2: Exactly!
0:20
SPEAKER 1: You can get Rosetta Stone posters.
0:22
SPEAKER 2: On a mug.
0:23
SPEAKER 1: I think you can get a doormat Rosetta Stone.
0:25
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.
0:26
SPEAKER 1: But the stone itself is historically
0:28
incredibly important.
0:29
It allowed us for the first time to be able to understand,
0:32
to be able to read, to be able to translate hieroglyphics.
0:36
SPEAKER 2: Hieroglyphics was the written language
0:38
of the ancient Egyptians.
0:40
And until the mid 19th century, we really
0:43
didn't know what it said.
0:45
SPEAKER 1: The language itself is pictorial.
0:46
And actually that led to one of the real confusions,
0:49
because they think that early archaeologists believed
0:52
and linguists believed that the pictures
0:54
they could see-- you can make out
0:55
birds and snakes in various different kinds of forms--
0:58
actually referred in some way to a specific thing in the world.
1:01
SPEAKER 2: Right.
1:01
So if you saw a bird, it somehow referred to a bird.
1:04
SPEAKER 1: And in fact, that's not the case.
1:06
SPEAKER 2: Right.
1:07
SPEAKER 1: This is a far more sophisticated language.
1:09
SPEAKER 2: And the Rosetta Stone was really
1:11
what helped them to understand that Egyptian hieroglyphics are
1:14
not pictorial.
1:15
They're not pictographs.
1:16
They're actually phonetic.
1:18
So all those things that look like pictures actually
1:21
represent sounds.
1:22
And that's how they were able to finally figure
1:24
out and translate ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.
1:27
SPEAKER 1: And the reason we were able to do that
1:29
is because this stone said the same statement three times
1:32
in three different languages.
1:34
So the three languages are ancient Greek,
1:37
which is down at the bottom.
1:38
Now, that was the language of the administration.
1:41
That was the language of government.
1:42
And the reason for that is because Alexander the Great
1:45
had conquered Egypt and had set up this sort of Greek rule
1:49
in this Hellenistic era, and that maintained itself
1:52
in ancient Egypt.
1:53
SPEAKER 2: Let's remember, we're talking about 200 BC here.
1:56
SPEAKER 1: Which is actually getting
1:57
close to the end of the life of hieroglyphics as well.
2:00
It would last for another few hundred years
2:02
before it died out completely.
2:03
So this is really the tail end of this 3,000-year-long
2:07
language.
2:07
SPEAKER 2: So the middle section is
2:09
Demotic, which actually means the language of the people.
2:13
And it was this common language used by the Egyptians.
2:17
SPEAKER 1: And the top, of course, was the sacred writing.
2:20
This was hieroglyphs.
2:21
SPEAKER 2: Right.
2:22
SPEAKER 1: And that was the language
2:23
that we really couldn't read.
2:25
SPEAKER 2: Until we had the Rosetta Stone,
2:27
and we could see within the writings of the Rosetta Stone
2:31
cartouches, which held the names of the rulers.
2:35
Cartouches are a kind of oblong shape
2:37
that contains the name of the ruler.
2:39
SPEAKER 1: In this case, that would be Ptolemy V.
2:42
SPEAKER 2: And by recognizing that ruler's name
2:45
in these three different languages,
2:47
we found a way to begin to unlock hieroglyphics.
2:49
SPEAKER 1: Now, that would take decades.
2:50
It was an incredibly difficult task.
2:52
SPEAKER 2: And we haven't even talked yet
2:54
about how this was found.
2:55
Napoleon has his army in Egypt, and Napoleon's brought with him
2:59
some what I guess what we would call
3:01
sort of archaeologist types.
3:03
And one of those people who accompanied Napoleon
3:07
found or came across the Rosetta Stone.
3:10
SPEAKER 1: It was being used as a part
3:11
of the foundation of a fort, in fact.
3:14
SPEAKER 2: And of course, it would have originally
3:16
been erected in a temple or near an ancient Egyptian temple.
3:18
SPEAKER 1: And I suppose it's important to say that this
3:21
is the bottom portion of a much larger stele, or sort of stone
3:24
tablet, that would have been quite tall.
3:26
SPEAKER 2: So Napoleon took it back--
3:28
SPEAKER 1: Except hold on a second, because we're not
3:29
in the Louvre.
3:30
We're in London in a British Museum.
3:32
So how does that work?
3:33
SPEAKER 2: Well, the British defeated Napoleon
3:36
and brought back the stone.
3:38
And a year or two later, I think 1801 or 1802,
3:41
it was brought to the British Museum,
3:42
and it's been here ever since.
3:43
SPEAKER 1: Well, it's clearly still extremely popular.

0:00
Welcome back.
0:01
We'll now do another tension problem and this one is just a
0:04
slight increment harder than the previous one just because
0:06
we have to take out slightly more sophisticated algebra
0:10
tools than we did in the last one.
0:11
But it's not really any harder.
0:14
But you should actually see this type of problem because
0:15
you'll probably see it on an exam.
0:17
So let's figure out the tension in the wire.
0:19
So first of all, we know that this point
0:22
right here isn't moving.
0:24
So the tension in this little small wire right here is easy.
0:26
It's trivial.
0:28
The force of gravity is pulling down at this point
0:30
with 10 Newtons because you have this weight here.
0:33
And of course, since this point is stationary, the
0:35
tension in this wire has to be 10 Newtons upward.
0:37
That's an easy one.
0:38
So let's just figure out the tension in these two slightly
0:41
more difficult wires to figure out the tensions of.
0:44
So once again, we know that this point right here, this
0:47
point is not accelerating in any direction.
0:49
It's not accelerating in the x direction, nor is it
0:52
accelerating in the vertical direction or the y direction.
0:55
So we know that the net forces in the x direction need to be
0:57
0 on it and we know the net forces in the y
1:00
direction need to be 0.
1:03
So what are the net forces in the x direction?
1:06
Well they're going to be the x components of these two-- of
1:10
the tension vectors of both of these wires.
1:12
I guess let's draw the tension vectors of the two wires.
1:15
So this T1, it's pulling.
1:18
The tension vector pulls in the direction of the wire
1:21
along the same line.
1:23
So let's say that this is the tension vector of T1.
1:26
If that's the tension vector, its x component will be this.
1:30
Let me see how good I can draw this.
1:33
It's intended to be a straight line, but that
1:35
would be its x component.
1:36
And its x component, let's see, this is 30 degrees.
1:42
This is 30 degrees right here.
1:44
And hopefully this is a bit second nature to you.
1:47
If this value up here is T1, what is the
1:49
value of the x component?
1:51
It's T1 cosine of 30 degrees.
1:59
And you could do your SOH-CAH-TOA.
2:01
You know, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.
2:04
So the cosine of 30 degrees is equal to-- This over T1 one is
2:09
equal to the x component over T1.
2:10
And if you multiply both sides by T1, you get this.
2:14
This should be a little bit of second nature right now.
2:15
That the x component is going to be the cosine of the angle
2:20
between the hypotenuse and the x component times the
2:23
hypotenuse.
2:24
And similarly, the x component here-- Let me
2:27
draw this force vector.
2:28
So if this is T2, this would be its x component.
2:38
And very similarly, this is 60 degrees, so this would be T2
2:44
cosine of 60.
2:48
Now what do we know about these two vectors?
2:50
We know that their net force is 0.
2:55
Or that you also know that the magnitude of these two vectors
2:57
should cancel each other out or that they're equal.
2:59
I mean, they're pulling in opposite directions.
3:01
That's pretty obvious.
3:04
And so you know that their magnitudes need to be equal.
3:05
So we know that T1 cosine of 30 is going to equal
3:08
T2 cosine of 60.
3:10
So let's write that down.
3:12
T1 cosine of 30 degrees is equal to T2 cosine of 60.
3:27
And then we could bring the T2 on to this side.
3:29
And actually, let's also-- I'm trying to save as much space
3:31
as possible because I'm guessing this is going to take
3:33
up a lot of room, this problem.
3:35
What's the cosine of 30 degrees?
3:38
If you haven't memorized it already, it's square
3:39
root of 3 over 2.
3:40
So this becomes square root of 3 over 2 times T1.
3:45
That's the cosine of 30 degrees.
3:47
And then I'm going to bring this on to this side.
3:49
So the cosine of 60 is actually 1/2.
3:54
You could use your calculator if you forgot that.
3:56
So this is 1/2 T2.
3:58
Bring it on this side so it becomes minus 1/2.
4:01
I'm skipping more steps than normal just because I don't
4:04
want to waste too much space.
4:07
And this equals 0.
4:08
But if you seen the other videos, hopefully I'm not
4:11
creating too many gaps.
4:12
And this is relatively easy to follow.
4:14
So we have the square root of 3 times T1 minus 1/2 T2 is
4:19
equal to 0.
4:19
So that gives us an equation.
4:21
One equation with two unknowns, so it doesn't help
4:24
us much so far.
4:25
But let's square that away because I have a feeling this
4:29
will be useful.
4:32
Now what's going to be happening on the y components?
4:34
So let's say that this is the y component of T1 and this is
4:39
the y component of T2.
4:42
What do we know?
4:42
What what do we know about the two y components?
4:44
I could've drawn them here too and then just shift them over
4:46
to the left and the right.
4:48
We know that their combined pull upwards, the combined
4:52
pull of the two vertical tension components has to
4:54
offset the force of gravity pulling down because this
4:57
point is stationary.
4:59
So we know these two y components, when you add them
5:02
together, the combined tension in the vertical direction has
5:05
to be 10 Newtons.
5:06
Because it's offsetting this force of gravity.
5:09
So what's this y component?
5:10
Well, this was T1 of cosine of 30.
5:12
This should start to become a little second nature to you
5:15
that this is T1 sine of 30, this y component right here.
5:19
So T1-- Let me write it here.
5:23
T1 sine of 30 degrees plus this vector, which is T2 sine
5:34
of 60 degrees.
5:38
You could review your trigonometry and your
5:39
SOH-CAH-TOA.
5:41
Frankly, I think, just seeing what people get confused on is
5:44
the trigonometry.
5:45
But you can review the trig modules and maybe some of the
5:48
earlier force vector modules that we did.
5:50
And hopefully, these will make sense.
5:52
I'm skipping a few steps.
5:53
And these will equal 10 Newtons.
5:58
And let's rewrite this up here where I substitute the values.
6:02
So what's the sine of 30?
6:03
Actually, let me do it right here.
6:06
What's the sine of 30 degrees?
6:07
The sine of 30 degrees is 1/2 so we get 1/2 T1 plus the sine
6:15
of 60 degrees, which is square root of 3 over 2.
6:17
Square root of 3 over 2 T2 is equal to 10.
6:22
And then I don't like this, all these 2's
6:23
and this 1/2 here.
6:25
So let's multiply this whole equation by 2.
6:27
So 2 times 1/2, that's 1.
6:30
So you get T1 plus the square root of 3 T2 is equal to, 2
6:37
times 10 , is 20.
6:40
Similarly, let's take this equation up here and let's
6:42
multiply this equation by 2 and bring it down here.
6:46
So this is the original one that we got.
6:47
So if we multiply this whole thing by 2-- I'll do it in
6:50
this color so that you know that
6:52
it's a different equation.
6:54
So if you multiply square root of 3 over 2 times 2-- I'm just
6:56
doing this to get rid of the 2's in the denominator.
6:58
So you get square root of 3 T1 minus T2 is equal to 0 because
7:10
0 times 2 is 0.
7:12
And let's see what we could do.
7:13
What if we take this top equation because we want to
7:15
start canceling out some terms. Let's take this top
7:18
equation and let's multiply it by-- oh, I don't know.
7:24
Let's multiply it by the square root of 3.
7:28
So you get the square root of 3 T1.
7:36
I'm taking this top equation multiplied by the
7:37
square root of 3.
7:38
This is just a system of equations
7:39
that I'm solving for.
7:41
And the square root of 3 times this right here.
7:43
Square root of 3 times square root of 3 is 3.
7:46
So plus 3 T2 is equal to 20 square root of 3.
7:54
And now what I want to do is let's-- I know I'm doing a lot
7:59
of equation manipulation here.
8:01
But this is just hopefully, a review of algebra for you.
8:04
Let's subtract this equation from this equation.
8:09
So you can also view it as multiplying it by negative 1
8:11
and then adding the 2.
8:13
So when you subtract this from this, these two terms cancel
8:15
out because they're the same.
8:17
And so then you're left with minus T2 from here.
8:22
Minus this, minus 3 T2 is equal to 0 minus 20 square
8:31
roots of 3.
8:33
And so this becomes minus 4 T2 is equal to minus 20 square
8:40
roots of 3.
8:42
And then, divide both sides by minus 4 and you get T2 is
8:46
equal to 5 square roots of 3 Newtons.
8:52
So that's the tension in this wire.
8:54
And now we can substitute and figure out T1.
8:58
Let's use this formula right here because it
8:59
looks suitably simple.
9:02
So we have the square root of 3 times T1 minus T2.
9:08
Well T2 is 5 square roots of 3.
9:10
5 square roots of 3 is equal to 0.
9:14
So we have the square root of 3 T1 is equal to five square
9:19
roots of 3.
9:21
Divide both sides by square root of 3 and you get the
9:23
tension in the first wire is equal to 5 Newtons.
9:28
So this is pulling with a force or tension of 5 Newtons.
9:31
Or a force.
9:33
And this is pulling-- the second wire --with a tension
9:36
of 5 square roots of 3 Newtons.
9:39
So this wire right here is actually
9:43
doing more of the pulling.
9:45
It's actually more of the force of gravity is ending up
9:48
on this wire.
9:49
That makes sense because it's steeper.
9:51
So since it's steeper, it's contributing
9:54
more to the y component.
9:56
It's good whenever you do these problems to kind of do a
9:58
reality check just to make sure your numbers make sense.
10:01
And if you think about it, their combined tension is
10:05
something more than 10 Newtons.
10:07
And that makes sense because some of the force that they're
10:10
pulling with is wasted against pulling each other in the
10:13
horizontal direction.
10:15
Anyway, I'll see you all in the next video.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,zwDJ1wVr7Is,
khan_video_Frpq_A7Ky_Q_96040,Were there any previous assassination attempts on President Abraham Lincoln?,MCQ,"•
0:00
In the video where I give an overview of American history
0:03
through the Civil War, I commented that it's unfortunate
0:06
that Abraham Lincoln is assassinated shortly
0:08
before the end of the Civil War.
0:11
And although that is technically correct, what I want to do
0:13
is clarify that comment a little bit in this video.
0:16
Because in actuality by the time he was assassinated,
0:20
Lincoln knew that the Union was very, very, very likely
0:24
to win the war, that the major Confederate armies had already
0:29
surrendered to the Union.
0:31
Although it wasn't formally done,
0:32
there was still some fighting going
0:34
on in some parts of the South.
0:36
So if we go back to April 9, 1865
0:40
you have the battle at Appomattox Courthouse,
0:42
and after that battle the Confederate army
0:45
is essentially routed.
0:46
It has to surrender.
0:47
This right here is Robert E. Lee.
0:53
And on April 9, 1865 after that battle,
0:57
he surrenders to Ulysses S. Grant.
1:02
And one point of confusion some people often have, and I
1:05
had this the first time I learned it,
1:07
is that Appomattox Courthouse is the name of the city,
1:10
that the surrender actually did not take place
1:12
in the courthouse in that city.
1:13
And I actually shouldn't even call it a city.
1:15
It's like a little town with a handful of buildings.
1:18
It took place in this gentleman's house,
1:20
Wilmer McLean.
1:22
And I'm showing his image because,
1:24
his set of circumstances or how he is tied to the Civil War,
1:28
is frankly fascinating.
1:30
Because in 1861 the first battle of the Civil War
1:34
occurred on his property in Manassas, Virginia.
1:37
This is in northern Virginia.
1:39
He was sympathetic with the Confederate army.
1:43
He did not like that northern Virginia was
1:45
so close to the North-South border.
1:50
So he picks up his bags and his family,
1:52
and he moves them down to the small town
1:54
of Appomattox Courthouse, which is in central Virginia.
1:58
So the very first major land battle of the Civil War
2:02
literally occurs on this guy's property.
2:05
And the last major or really the major surrender
2:10
of the Civil War occurs inside this guy's house
2:13
after he moves.
2:14
And it's all coincidence.
2:15
He just happens to have the nicest house
2:17
near the battlefield where everyone
2:19
felt that it was appropriate to have this kind of major end
2:22
to a major war.
2:24
But regardless, that happens on April 9, 1865.
2:28
The major Confederate army surrenders to the Union army.
2:33
The reason why this is not the formal end of the Civil War
2:36
is that you still had 175,000 Confederate troops other places
2:41
in the south continuing to fight on.
2:43
You have to remember that we didn't
2:45
have a telephone at this point in time,
2:47
so we didn't have instant communication.
2:49
So these people who were fighting, many of them
2:52
did not even know that the Confederate army had already
2:56
surrendered to the Union.
2:58
But to some degree this major surrender
3:01
is what leads to Lincoln's assassination.
3:04
Because for most people this tells you,
3:08
hey, there's a 99.9% chance that the Union has won.
3:12
It just has to, either these people
3:13
need to find out that their major army has surrendered,
3:16
or the Union has to go and essentially force
3:20
all of the rest of the armies to surrender.
3:22
So you go to April 14, 1865.
3:25
Lincoln already knows that Robert E. Lee's army
3:28
has surrendered.
3:29
He knows that victory is imminent.
3:32
But you have this gentleman right over here, John Wilkes
3:36
Booth, who is sympathetic to the Confederate cause.
3:46
And in his mind all is not lost yet.
3:50
He does see this as a major blow to the Confederate cause,
3:53
and he thinks that they need to do something desperate
3:56
if they want to have any chance of being able to come back,
4:00
being able to maintain their independence from the Union.
4:04
So he coordinates with a couple of his buddies.
4:07
And he says, hey our only chance is
4:09
if we assassinate not only Abraham Lincoln, but also
4:13
Andrew Johnson who's the vice president, and Ulysses S Grant,
4:18
and we assassinate Seward, who was the Secretary of State.
4:22
And the idea there is if you assassinate everyone
4:25
who is in line to become president,
4:27
then it would just throw the entire Union leadership
4:30
in disarray, and maybe it would give these characters over here
4:33
a fighting chance to maintain their independence
4:36
or maybe come back against the Union Army.
4:38
Unfortunately for John Wilkes Booth,
4:40
or I guess well you could take it either way,
4:44
the other three people were not able to fully execute
4:47
on their plan.
4:48
Seward was injured.
4:51
He actually did get stabbed in the face and all that,
4:53
but he was not assassinated.
4:55
And John Wilkes Booth was the only person
4:57
who was able to carry out his assassination.
5:00
So you have on April 14, 1865 shortly after 10:00 PM Abraham
5:05
Lincoln is watching a play at Ford's Theater.
5:08
And his booth, the guy who was supposed to guard the booth,
5:12
was out drinking with his buddies.
5:14
So I guess the Secret Service really, the security
5:18
was not back then what it is now, hopefully what it is now.
5:21
And John Wilkes Booth, who actually
5:24
used to act at this theater, he picked a time in the play
5:27
where everyone would laugh and clap.
5:28
And he said, hey, I'll just shoot right then.
5:30
People will think it's part of the play or something,
5:32
or they wouldn't notice as much, and then
5:34
I'll be able to run out.
5:35
And so he is able to, right in that moment shortly after 10:00
5:39
PM, shoot Abraham Lincoln and assassinate him
5:43
on April 14, 1865.
5:44
But the whole point here is to just understand
5:47
that Lincoln did know that Robert E. Lee's army had
5:53
surrendered at the time of his assassination.
5:56
So he at least was feeling pretty
5:57
good about the course of the war.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Frpq_A7Ky_Q,
khan_video_huOnuYAyv6w_121308,"How did Germany prepare so quickly for war, and why was it so eager for war?",Essay,"•
0:00
In the last video, we left off with the assassination
0:03
of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the heir
0:08
to the Austro-Hungarian empire.
0:11
And so you could imagine, the Austro-Hungarian empire
0:15
did not take that well.
0:16
They already did not enjoy the kingdom of Serbia trying to,
0:21
essentially, provoke this nationalistic movement.
0:24
And they viewed them as this small, little, weak country
0:27
right below them.
0:29
And so they use this to, essentially,
0:31
issue an ultimatum.
0:32
Essentially say, look, immediately
0:34
bring all the people who did this to justice,
0:37
all the people who might have conspired with the Gavrilo
0:40
Princips to allow this assassination
0:43
attempt to occur, and do it or else,
0:46
and accept full responsibility.
0:48
And actually, the kingdom of Serbia
0:51
was in no mood to get into a war with Austria-Hungary,
0:55
and so they tried their best to comply,
0:57
but their best wasn't enough.
0:59
So then July 28, a month later, you
1:03
have the Austrians declaring war on the Serbians.
1:15
Now up until this point, the Austro-Hungarian empire
1:19
is thinking, OK, Serbia is a small, little kingdom here.
1:21
It has some ties and obviously, it's a Slavic nation
1:24
so it has some linguistic ties with the Russian empire.
1:27
The Russian empire also had some political ties to it,
1:29
but Russia is not going to get into a war with us over this.
1:32
We're justified in attacking them.
1:33
They've just killed the heir to our throne.
1:36
So we're going to go in there and Russia is probably not
1:38
interested in actually creating a larger skirmish here.
1:43
That was a severe miscalculation on the part of the Austrians.
1:48
The Russians were not happy about this.
1:50
They felt close ties to the Serbians
1:52
and they felt a need to protect the Serbians,
1:55
or you could argue, that maybe they
1:57
wanted to mobilize just to scare the Austrians.
2:00
Whatever it might be, whether it was Russia
2:02
wanted to get into a war, whether they were really
2:03
looking to protect the Serbians, or whether they were looking
2:06
to mobilize to scare the Austrians from actually
2:09
attacking, the Russians began to mobilize.
2:12
So the Russians began to gather their troops.
2:16
So the Russians mobilize.
2:23
And now, this is where all of the alliances
2:25
start to come into effect.
2:28
If you remember about the alliances
2:30
we talked about several videos ago, if you go to 1879,
2:36
you have the Dual Alliance Treaty
2:38
between Germany and Austria-Hungary
2:40
to protect each other if Russia attacks and actually,
2:42
if Russia attacks or mobilizes.
2:45
So now, Germany is like, hey, maybe I
2:47
am obligated to protect Austria-Hungary from Russia.
2:50
You also have to remember in 1892, the Franco-Russian
2:54
Military Convention.
2:55
Military assistance both ways in the event of attack.
2:59
So Germany is thinking, look, we signed this treaty
3:02
and we, to some degree, are maybe eager for war
3:05
because we've been militarizing so much.
3:08
And I can't just fight Russia.
3:10
I also know that France and Russia
3:11
have this alliance right over here.
3:14
So Germany in quite surprising quickness
3:17
decides to declare war on both.
3:19
So on August 1, Germany declares war on Russia.
3:31
And then on August 3, Germany declares war on France
3:42
because they know or at least they
3:44
feel that they can't declare war on only one of them.
3:46
And they wanted to do it very quickly because they didn't
3:48
want Russia a chance to mobilize too much.
3:51
And the fact that they were able to do this so quickly--
3:53
we're talking three days after Austria declares war on Serbia
3:57
and then another two days declare war
3:59
on France-- kind of shows that Germany was already
4:01
in a war footing.
4:02
It's not a joke to all of a sudden invade
4:04
or declare war on countries.
4:06
So Germany was, essentially, preparing for this.
4:08
And this right over here gave them
4:11
the excuse to, essentially, declare war.
4:15
So they declare war on both of these characters, Germany
4:18
against Russia.
4:19
Germany is declaring war on France.
4:22
Now, the easiest way for them to move into France--
4:25
so they're literally going on the offense
4:27
here-- is for them to go through Belgium.
4:34
But the Germans were aware.
4:36
They're aware that there's this 75-year-old treaty, the Treaty
4:39
of London in 1839, Article 7 said
4:42
that Britain was to protect the neutrality of Belgium.
4:46
And Germany was in no interest to get
4:48
into a war with the British.
4:49
The British had a powerful military,
4:52
especially a very powerful navy.
4:55
The Germans said, hey, let's just
4:56
take on the Russians and the French for now.
4:58
And so they actually reached out to the British
5:00
and said, hey, this little treaty that you got here
5:03
from 1839, this 75-year-old treaty,
5:04
you don't really take this seriously, right?
5:06
I mean if we have to go through Belgium,
5:08
you're not really going to hold true to this treaty?
5:11
And the British said, no, we actually
5:13
take that very seriously.
5:15
Obviously, the British didn't want
5:17
the Germans to be aggressive here.
5:18
The British didn't want the Germans
5:20
to be able to invade France.
5:22
And so on August 4 when Germany, essentially,
5:31
rolls through Belgium, Germany invades
5:33
Belgium to get to France, this gave the legal justification
5:40
for the British to declare war on Germany.
5:52
And so in a matter of only-- I mean not even, we're
5:54
talking a few months here from the assassination of Franz
5:58
Ferdinand of Austria, you essentially
6:01
have all of the major powers of Europe.
6:03

0:00
- [Voiceover] As we exit 1917 and enter into 1918,
0:04
we're getting into the final stages of World War I.
0:08
And let's just give ourselves a little bit of review,
0:10
a little bit of background, a little bit of context.
0:12
The war started off as
0:14
a two-front war for the Central Powers.
0:15
You have the Western Front,
0:17
you have the Western Front right over here,
0:20
and you had the huge,
0:22
you had the huge Eastern Front right over here.
0:26
By 1917, the major conflict on the Eastern Front,
0:29
especially with Russia, which was the major power there,
0:33
had come to an end.
0:34
You had a February Revolution in Russia.
0:36
The czar had to abdicate the throne.
0:39
You had a provisional government.
0:41
Then in November of 1917,
0:43
the Bolsheviks have a coup, they take over.
0:46
They have no interest in prosecuting World War I,
0:48
because they have their own civil war to worry about,
0:51
so they sign an armistice with the Central Powers,
0:55
by the end of 1917.
0:58
And then we get into 1918,
1:00
just let me write all this down,
1:02
so by the time we get into 1918,
1:05
they're ready to sign a treaty in March,
1:08
in March, the Russians sign
1:11
the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk,
1:13
Litovsk,
1:15
which cedes over all of this territory to the Germans
1:18
and takes the Russians out of World War I.
1:21
So I'm not gonna, I've gone into detail in other videos,
1:23
but a huge amount of territory,
1:25
and I'm gonna do it very informally right over here.
1:27
I'll give a rough sense of where that territory was.
1:31
And the treaty itself, its main significance,
1:33
'cause the treaty didn't last,
1:35
as you might already know,
1:36
the Central Powers lost World War I,
1:38
so that treaty was later nullified.
1:41
But the key importance of that treaty,
1:43
is one, it took Russia out of the war,
1:45
it allowed the Central Powers, especially Germany,
1:48
to focus on the Western Front.
1:49
But the other element of it is,
1:51
by giving so much territory to the Germans,
1:53
the Germans couldn't just leave that territory as is.
1:56
If they wanted any claims to it,
1:58
they had to devote some of their troops to occupy,
2:01
or at least attempt to occupy some of it.
2:04
So even though it was a huge opportunity,
2:05
and the Germans were able to, after the treaty,
2:08
or even before the treaty, after the armistice,
2:10
they were able to start bringing many more
2:13
of the Eastern-Front troops over to the Western Front.
2:17
They didn't bring over as many as they could have,
2:19
because they left some to attempt to occupy
2:22
some of the territory that had been gained
2:24
on the Eastern Front.
2:26
But if you view things from a German perspective,
2:29
at this point, March 1918,
2:31
you're gonna be feeling pretty good.
2:33
You are holding your own in a two-front war now,
2:36
and at one point you thought Russia
2:39
was the major threat there.
2:40
That threat is gone, you can now focus on a one-front war,
2:43
maybe you should be able to kind of
2:45
put the decisive blow against the allies now.
2:48
And that is how the Germans felt.
2:51
But they were worried about a couple of things.
2:53
They were worried about the British industrial capacity,
2:57
and the Allied industrial capacity,
2:58
that was stronger than the Central Powers,
3:02
and so the British could produce more tanks
3:05
and more guns and more weapons,
3:06
so it was a race against that,
3:08
and there was also a race against
3:09
significant American entry.
3:11
Remember, April 1917,
3:13
Woodrow Wilson gives a speech to Congress,
3:16
they declare war on the Central Powers,
3:19
and so the Germans wanna get this thing over with
3:22
before the Americans have a chance
3:24
to send in significant number of fresh troops.
3:27
So in March 1918, not only do you have
3:30
the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk,
3:32
you also have the beginning of Germany's attempt
3:35
to deal that decisive blow to the Allies,
3:38
and it's known as the Spring Offensive.
3:41
So you have the Spring, the Spring Offensive.
3:46
And the goal of the Spring Offensive
3:49
was to essentially try to end the war for the Germans.
3:53
And the goal was to separate
3:55
the British from the French forces.
3:57
The British, for the most part, were in control
3:59
of the line right over here, north of the Salm River,
4:02
while the French were in control south of it.
4:05
So the Spring Offensive, especially the first phases
4:07
of the Spring Offensive, in March 1918,
4:09
focused on this area, right over here.
4:13
And at first it was actually very successful.
4:14
They were able to make huge territorial gains,
4:17
drive through the lines,
4:19
drive the Allied Powers back.
4:21
Now, the problem was is that it wasn't
4:23
a real big strategic gain.
4:25
The Germans were just hoping it would be such a demoralizer,
4:28
that it would throw at least,
4:29
maybe the French out of the war,
4:31
and then maybe they could take care of the British
4:32
or whatever else, but that didn't happen,
4:35
and all of a sudden they found themselves
4:36
with these huge territorial gains,
4:38
in very short amount of time,
4:40
they had to supply themselves,
4:42
and they didn't really quite,
4:44
and they had spread their troops thin,
4:46
and so it frankly just let the opportunity arise
4:49
for the Allies, in August,
4:51
to lead a counteroffensive.
4:53
And this counteroffensive by the Allies,
4:56
is referred to as the 100 Days Offensive.
4:58
It began in August, went roughly into November,
5:01
so 100 Days, 100 Days Offensive,
5:06
during which the Allies, between August and November,
5:09
were able to push the Germans, not only back
5:11
beyond what they had captured during the Spring Offensive,
5:14
but all the way well back of the front
5:17
that was kind of the stalemate line
5:19
for most of World War I.
5:21
And it was during this 100 Days Offensive,
5:23
that to most objective observers,
5:25
it was clear that the Allies would win this war.
5:29
And it was clear to several of the Central Powers,
5:31
or those Allied with the Central Powers.
5:33
As we go into September,
5:36
as we go into September of 1918,
5:40
Bulgaria drops itself out of the war,
5:43
just to remind ourselves where, what we're talking about.
5:46
So you have Bulgaria right over here.
5:49
It, Bulgaria, right over here.
5:51
It signs an armistice with the Allies,
5:54
so, let me just, you have armistice,
5:58
I'll use a little peace symbol for armistice,
6:00
that's a, armistice is just the fighting has stopped,
6:02
you still, in theory, could be at a state of war,
6:05
so maybe I shouldn't do the peace symbol,
6:07
I'll just write armistice.
6:09
Armistice, Armistice, with Bulgaria.
6:15
And this is really starting to tighten the noose
6:17
around the remaining Central Powers,
6:19
because this allowed the Allies to gain control
6:23
of Serbia and of Greece,
6:26
which essentially tied, removed the last source of food
6:30
for Austria, Hungary and the German Empire.
6:33
There was already a blockade,
6:35
the kind of the harsh, British blockade
6:37
that we've already talked about, up in the North Sea,
6:39
and so their last source of food was from the south,
6:41
but now with Bulgaria signing an armistice,
6:44
and ceding over territory,
6:46
now the strangle hold was really,
6:49
was really, really coming into effect.
6:52
Now, by October, and remember,
6:53
at this point it was reasonably clear,
6:56
and even by this point, even clear to the German people
6:59
that the war is pretty much done for,
7:01
and they're just waiting for their leaders
7:03
to make it official.
7:06
So several of the leaders of the German Navy
7:09
wanted to do this last-ditch,
7:11
what could easily be considered suicidal,
7:13
offensive against the British Navy,
7:16
and as they're planning it and the sailors catch wind of it,
7:19
they mutiny, they revolt.
7:20
They say hey, look, the war is over.
7:22
We're not gonna die in a futile attempt
7:25
to just kind of, for pride or whatever else,
7:28
and so you have a naval mutiny begins.
7:31
Naval mutiny, and eventually this spreads to the mainland
7:35
and leads to revolts and revolutions,
7:38
so revolution in Germany, in Germany.
7:43
And this culminates in November, in November,
7:47
November 9th, famous date in history,
7:49
November 9th, 1918.
7:51
You essentially, Kaiser Wilhelm II,
7:55
right over here, let me make sure you see his picture,
7:58
this is him right over here, Kaiser Wilhelm II,
8:02
is forced to abdicate, give up his throne.
8:04
He flees to the Netherlands,
8:07
and on November 9th, 1918,
8:09
Germany is declared a republic.
8:11
So Germany no longer has a king or emperor in charge.
8:18
Germany becomes a republic.
8:22
And a little bit before this, November 3rd,
8:24
the writing was already clear to the Austrians,
8:27
in fact, they even, in 1917,
8:29
attempted to make some peace overtures,
8:31
thinking that they were pretty much done for,
8:33
but by November 3rd, 1918,
8:36
the Austrians also signed an armistice,
8:39
armistice, armistice,
8:43
with the Austrians, with the Austrians,
8:47
and with the Kaiser Wilhelm II fleeing to the Netherlands,
8:52
Germany becoming a republic,
8:54
this sets up the armistice, finally, with Germany
8:58
on November 11th,
9:00
and this is one of the most famous dates in history,
9:03
known for a long time in the US as Armistice Day,
9:06
and so it was November 11th, 1918,
9:10
and it was actually 11am, 11am,
9:13
so you might remember the famous,
9:14
the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month,
9:18
war, or World War I, or the fighting in World War I,
9:22
was over with the Allies victorious,
9:25
and the Central Powers losing it,
9:27
and the terms of what would happen for those that lost
9:30
and those that won would be dictated
9:33
by the Treaty of Versailles.
9:34
The Treaty of Versailles in 1919.
9:37
The terms of which were finally finalized
9:39
about six months later.
9:41
So this is June, you have the treaty,
9:44
Treaty of, Treaty of, Treaty of Versailles.
9:50
Which, incidentally, this is like one of those
9:51
little footnotes in history,
9:53
the Americans did not actually ratify it,
9:55
mainly because it had the League of Nations in it,
9:57
which was this project of Woodrow Wilson,
10:00
but the American people and the American Congress
10:03
was not a fan of this whole trans-national government,
10:06
League of Nations thing,
10:07
so the United States did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles
10:10
but in effect, on Armistice Day, November 11th, 11am,
10:14
the war was over, Treaty of Versailles dictated the terms,
10:17
many would argue, overly-harsh terms,
10:20
of the Treaty of Versailles,
10:22
and we're done with World War I.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,xFBK9534NI8,
teded_3192,How is intrapersonal intelligence different than interpersonal intelligence?,open-ended,"Currently I think there are eight intelligences
that I’m very confident about and a few
more that I’ve bene thinking about.
I’ll share that with our audience.
The first two intelligences are the ones which
IQ tests and other kind of standardized tests
valorize and as long as we know there are
only two out of eight it’s perfectly fine
to look at them.
Linguistic intelligence is how well you’re
able to use language.
It’s a kind of skill that poets have, other
kinds of writers, journalists tend to have
linguistic intelligence, orators.
The second intelligence is logical mathematical
intelligence.
As the name implies logicians, mathematicians,
scientists have that kind of intelligence.
They’re able to do mathematical proofs.
They’re able to do scientific reasoning
and experimentation.
And it’s great to have language and logical
intelligence because most tests really focus
on that.
And if you do well in those tests as long
as you stay in school you think you’re smart.
But if you ever walk out into Broadway or
the highway or into the woods or into a farm
you then find out that other intelligences
are at least this important.
So the third intelligence is musical intelligence
and that’s the capacity to appreciate different
kinds of musics, to produce the music by voice
or by an instrument or to conduct music.
And people say well music is a talent.
It’s not an intelligence.
And I say well why if you’re good with words
is that an intelligence but if you’re good
with tones and rhythms and timbres nobody’s
ever given me a good answer which is why it
makes sense to talk about musical intelligence.
And at certain cultures over history musical
intelligence has been very important.
The fourth intelligence is spatial intelligence.
That’s the intelligence which allows us
to handle and work in space that’s close
by.
A chess player would have spatial intelligence.
A surgeon would have spatial intelligence.
But there’s another variety of spatial intelligence
which we use for a much broader navigation.
That’s what an airplane pilot or a sea captain
would have.
How do you find your way around large territory
and large space.
Similarly with the fifth intelligence bodily
kinesthetic intelligence it comes in two flavors.
One flavor is the ability to use your whole
body to solve problems or to make things.
And athletes and dancers would have that kind
of bodily kinesthetic intelligence.
But another variety is being able to use your
hands or other parts of your body to solve
problems or make things.
A craft person would have bodily kinesthetic
intelligence even if they weren’t particularly
a good athlete or dancer.
The sixth intelligence and seventh intelligence
have to do with human beings.
Interpersonal intelligence is how you understand
other people, how you motivate them, how you
lead them, how you work with them, how you
cooperate with them.
Anybody at any workplace with other people
needs interpersonal intelligence.
Leaders hopefully have a lot of interpersonal
intelligence.
But any intelligence can be used in a pernicious
way so the salesman that sells you something
you don’t want for a price you don’t want
to pay, he or she has got interpersonal intelligence.
It’s just not being used in a way that we
might prefer.
The seventh kind of intelligence is difficult
to assess but it’s very important.
It’s intrapersonal intelligence.
It’s the understanding yourself.
If we go back a way in history and prehistory
knowledge of yourself probably wasn’t that
important because people did what their parents
or grandparents did whether they were hunters
or fisherman or craftspeople.
But nowadays especially in developed society
people lead their own lives.
We follow our own careers.
We often switch careers.
We don’t necessarily live at home as we
get older.
And if you don’t have a good understanding
of yourself you are in big trouble.
So that’s intrapersonal intelligence.
The eighth intelligence which I added some
years ago is the naturalist intelligence.
And that’s the capacity to make important
relevant discriminations in the world of nature
between one plant and another, between one
animal and another.
It’s the intelligence of the naturalist,
the intelligence of Charles Darwin.
I missed it the first go around when I wrote
about it but I tried to atone by adding it
to my list.
And by the way you might say well but nature
isn’t so important anymore.
But in fact everything we do in the commercial
world uses our naturalist intelligence.
Why do I buy this jacket rather than another
one?
This sweater rather than another one?
One hair style rather than another?
Those all make just the naturalist intelligence
because the brain is very adaptive.
And when an old use of a brain center no longer
is relevant it gets hijacked for something
new.
So we’re all using our naturalist intelligence
even if we never walk out into the woods or
into the savannah of East Asia.
The two other intelligences which I’m interested
in, one of them is called the teaching or
pedagogical intelligence.
The intelligence which allows us to be able
to teach successfully to other people.
Now you could have two people who have exactly
the same expertise and knowledge in the field
but one is a very good teacher and the other
isn’t.
That probably doesn’t surprise individuals
so much.
But what got me fascinated was as young as
two or three kids already know how to teach.
Now what does that mean?
You show a child how to do something let’s
say a three or four year old and then you
ask the child to explain it to an older person
or to a younger person.
And even the three or four year old will explain
it very differently to a young person, will
go through details, point things and speak
slowly.
And with an older person it would be much
more elliptical and say well you do this and
that and then you can figure it out.
So that shows as young as three let’s say
we already have teaching intelligence.
The other one is one which I think is going
to be difficult to prove to a skeptic but
I call it existential intelligence.
And existential intelligence is the intelligence
of big questions.
Philosophical questions, artistic questions.
What does it mean to love?
Why do we die?
What’s going to be in the future?
My pet bird might have more musical intelligence.
The rats who are scurrying around the floor
might have more spatial intelligence.
But no other animals have existential intelligence.
Part of the human condition is to think about
questions of existence.
And I like to say every five year old has
existential intelligence because five year
old are always asking why this, why that.
But the difference between a five year old
and a philosopher is the five year old doesn’t
pay too much attention to the answer whereas
philosophers and other people who develop
existential intelligence are really very interested
in how we attack questions like that.
So again where there’s eight intelligences
or ten or twelve is less important to me than
having broken the monopoly of a single intelligence
which sort of labels you for all time.
I think if we lived forever we could probably
develop each intelligence to a very high degree.
But life is very short and if you devote too
much attention to one intelligence you’re
not going to have much time to work on other
kinds of intelligences.
And so the big question is should you play
to strength or should you bolster weakness?
And that’s a value judgment.
Scientists cannot give you an answer to that.
If, for example, you want to be a jack of
all trades and be very well rounded then probably
you’re going to want to nurture the intelligences
which aren’t that strong.
If on the other hand you’re dead set on
really coming to the top of some particular
heap then you’re probably going to find
the intelligences that you’re strongest
at and really push those.
And, you know, if a parent came to me and
said well should we supplement or should we
accentuate I would say well tell me what you
would like your child to do.
Or better let the child tell you what he or
she wants to do rather than say well science
says you should do one or the other.
I think it’s a question of values, not of
science.
Some people think there’s such a thing as
humor intelligence.
But, in fact, I don’t.
I think humor intelligence is simply the operation
of a logical intelligence in some realm like
human nature or physical nature or the workplace.
And what happens is in humor there’s a certain
expectation and you flip that expectation
so it’s logic but it’s logic that’s
played out in different kinds of ways.
People had mentioned there’s such a thing
as a cooking intelligence, a humor intelligence
and a sexual intelligence.
And I quipped well that can’t be intelligences
because I don’t have any of them.

khan_video_JNm3M9cqWyc_88001,What is the fundamental difference between the Law of large numbers & the Central limit theorom ?,Essay,"•
0:00
In this video, I want to talk about what is easily
0:03
one of the most fundamental and profound concepts in statistics
0:06
and maybe in all of mathematics.
0:08
And that's the central limit theorem.
0:16
And what it tells us is we can start off
0:18
with any distribution that has a well-defined mean and
0:21
variance-- and if it has a well-defined variance,
0:23
it has a well-defined standard deviation.
0:25
And it could be a continuous distribution or a discrete one.
0:27
I'll draw a discrete one, just because it's easier
0:29
to imagine, at least for the purposes of this video.
0:33
So let's say I have a discrete probability distribution
0:36
function.
0:37
And I want to be very careful not
0:38
to make it look anything close to a normal distribution.
0:41
Because I want to show you the power of the central limit
0:43
theorem.
0:44
So let's say I have a distribution.
0:45
Let's say it could take on values 1 through 6.
0:47
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
0:50
It's some kind of crazy dice.
0:52
It's very likely to get a one.
0:54
Let's say it's impossible-- well,
0:55
let me make that a straight line.
0:56
You have a very high likelihood of getting a 1.
0:58
Let's say it's impossible to get a 2.
1:00
Let's say it's an OK likelihood of getting a 3 or a 4.
1:03
Let's say it's impossible to get a 5.
1:04
And let's say it's very likely to get a 6 like that.
1:07
So that's my probability distribution function.
1:10
If I were to draw a mean-- this the symmetric,
1:12
so maybe the mean would be something like that.
1:14
The mean would be halfway.
1:16
So that would be my mean right there.
1:17
The standard deviation maybe would
1:19
look-- it would be that far and that
1:20
far above and below the mean.
1:22
But that's my discrete probability distribution
1:25
function.
1:26
Now what I'm going to do here, instead of just taking
1:28
samples of this random variable that's
1:30
described by this probability distribution function,
1:33
I'm going to take samples of it.
1:35
But I'm going to average the samples
1:37
and then look at those samples and see
1:39
the frequency of the averages that I get.
1:41
And when I say average, I mean the mean.
1:44
Let me define something.
1:45
Let's say my sample size-- and I could put any number here.
1:48
But let's say first off we try a sample size of n is equal to 4.
1:57
And what that means is I'm going to take four samples from this.
2:00
So let's say the first time I take four samples--
2:03
so my sample sizes is four-- let's say I get a 1.
2:05
Let's say I get another 1.
2:07
And let's say I get a 3.
2:09
And I get a 6.
2:10
So that right there is my first sample of sample size 4.
2:14
I know the terminology can get confusing.
2:16
Because this is the sample that's made up of four samples.
2:19
But then when we talk about the sample mean and the sampling
2:23
distribution of the sample mean, which we're
2:25
going to talk more and more about over the next few videos,
2:27
normally the sample refers to the set of samples
2:32
from your distribution.
2:33
And the sample size tells you how many you actually
2:35
took from your distribution.
2:37
But the terminology can be very confusing,
2:39
because you could easily view one of these as a sample.
2:42
But we're taking four samples from here.
2:44
We have a sample size of four.
2:45
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to average them.
2:48
So let's say the mean-- I want to be very careful when
2:50
I say average.
2:51
The mean of this first sample of size 4 is what?
2:55
1 plus 1 is 2.
2:56
2 plus 3 is 5.
2:58
5 plus 6 is 11.
2:59
11 divided by 4 is 2.75.
3:06
That is my first sample mean for my first sample of size 4.
3:11
Let me do another one.
3:12
My second sample of size 4, let's say that I get a 3, a 4.
3:19
Let's say I get another 3.
3:20
And let's say I get a 1.
3:21
I just didn't happen to get a 6 that time.
3:23
And notice I can't get a 2 or a 5.
3:25
It's impossible for this distribution.
3:27
The chance of getting a 2 or 5 is 0.
3:28
So I can't have any 2s or 5s over here.
3:31
So for the second sample of sample size 4,
3:37
my second sample mean is going to be 3 plus 4 is 7.
3:42
7 plus 3 is 10 plus 1 is 11.
3:46
11 divided by 4, once again, is 2.75.
3:49
Let me do one more, because I really
3:51
want to make it clear what we're doing here.
3:53
So I do one more.
3:53
Actually, we're going to do a gazillion more.
3:55
But let me just do one more in detail.
3:57
So let's say my third sample of sample size 4--
4:01
so I'm going to literally take 4 samples.
4:03
So my sample is made up of 4 samples
4:05
from this original crazy distribution.
4:08
Let's say I get a 1, a 1, and a 6 and a 6.
4:13
And so my third sample mean is going to be 1 plus 1 is 2.
4:18
2 plus 6 is 8.
4:20
8 plus 6 is 14.
4:21
14 divided by 4 is 3 and 1/2.
4:29
And as I find each of these sample
4:32
means-- so for each of my samples of sample size 4,
4:35
I figure out a mean.
4:36
And as I do each of them, I'm going
4:38
to plot it on a frequency distribution.
4:40
And this is all going to amaze you in a few seconds.
4:44
So I plot this all on a frequency distribution.
4:46
So I say, OK, on my first sample,
4:49
my first sample mean was 2.75.
4:52
So I'm plotting the actual frequency of the sample
4:54
means I get for each sample.
4:55
So 2.75, I got it one time.
4:58
So I'll put a little plot there.
4:59
So that's from that one right there.
5:02
And the next time, I also got a 2.75.
5:04
That's a 2.75 there.
5:06
So I got it twice.
5:08
So I'll plot the frequency right there.
5:10
Then I got a 3 and 1/2.
5:11
So all the possible values, I could have a three,
5:13
I could have a 3.25, I could have a 3 and 1/2.
5:16
So then I have the 3 and 1/2, so I'll plot it right there.
5:19
And what I'm going to do is I'm going
5:20
to keep taking these samples.
5:22
Maybe I'll take 10,000 of them.
5:25
So I'm going to keep taking these samples.
5:27
So I go all the way to S 10,000.
5:29
I just do a bunch of these.
5:31
And what it's going to look like over time is each of these--
5:33
I'm going to make it a dot, because I'm
5:35
going to have to zoom out.
5:37
So if I look at it like this, over time-- it still
5:41
has all the values that it might be able to take on,
5:43
2.75 might be here.
5:45
So this first dot is going to be-- this one
5:48
right here is going to be right there.
5:50
And that second one is going to be right there.
5:52
Then that one at 3.5 is going to look right there.
5:56
But I'm going to do it 10,000 times.
5:57
Because I'm going to have 10,000 dots.
5:59
And let's say as I do it, I'm going just keep plotting them.
6:01
I'm just going to keep plotting the frequencies.
6:04
I'm just going to keep plotting them
6:05
over and over and over again.
6:08
And what you're going to see is, as I take
6:09
many, many samples of size 4, I'm
6:12
going to have something that's going
6:14
to start kind of approximating a normal distribution.
6:18
So each of these dots represent an incidence of a sample mean.
6:22
So as I keep adding on this column right here,
6:24
that means I kept getting the sample mean 2.75.
6:27
So over time.
6:28
I'm going to have something that's
6:30
starting to approximate a normal distribution.
6:32
And that is a neat thing about the central limit theorem.
6:39
So an orange, that's the case for n is equal to 4.
6:42
This was a sample size of 4.
6:45
Now, if I did the same thing with a sample size of maybe
6:48
20-- so in this case, instead of just taking 4 samples
6:51
from my original crazy distribution, every sample
6:55
I take 20 instances of my random variable,
6:58
and I average those 20.
7:00
And then I plot the sample mean on here.
7:02
So in that case, I'm going to have
7:04
a distribution that looks like this.
7:06
And we'll discuss this in more videos.
7:08
But it turns out if I were to plot 10,000 of the sample
7:12
means here, I'm going to have something
7:14
that, two things-- it's going to even more closely approximate
7:17
a normal distribution.
7:18
And we're going to see in future videos,
7:20
it's actually going to have a smaller-- well,
7:22
let me be clear.
7:23
It's going to have the same mean.
7:25
So that's the mean.
7:26
This is going to have the same mean.
7:28
So it's going to have a smaller standard deviation.
7:31
Well, I should plot these from the bottom
7:33
because you kind of stack it.
7:34
One you get one, then another instance and another instance.
7:37
But this is going to more and more approach
7:38
a normal distribution.
7:40
So this is what's super cool about the central limit
7:44
theorem.
7:45
As your sample size becomes larger--
7:53
or you could even say as it approaches infinity.
7:55
But you really don't have to get that close
7:56
to infinity to really get close to a normal distribution.
7:58
Even if you have a sample size of 10 or 20,
8:01
you're already getting very close to a normal distribution,
8:04
in fact about as good an approximation
8:06
as we see in our everyday life.
8:07
But what's cool is we can start with some crazy distribution.
8:11
This has nothing to do with a normal distribution.
8:15
This was n equals 4, but if we have a sample size of n
8:17
equals 10 or n equals 100, and we
8:19
were to take 100 of these, instead of four here,
8:22
and average them and then plot that average,
8:24
the frequency of it, then we take 100 again, average them,
8:27
take the mean, plot that again, and if we
8:28
do that a bunch of times, in fact,
8:30
if we were to do that an infinite time,
8:32
we would find that we, especially
8:33
if we had an infinite sample size,
8:35
we would find a perfect normal distribution.
8:37
That's the crazy thing.
8:39
And it doesn't apply just to taking the sample mean.
8:42
Here we took the sample mean every time.
8:44
But you could have also taken the sample sum.
8:46
The central limit theorem would have still applied.
8:48
But that's what's so super useful about it.
8:51
Because in life, there's all sorts of processes out there,
8:54
proteins bumping into each other, people doing
8:57
crazy things, humans interacting in weird ways.
9:00
And you don't know the probability distribution
9:02
functions for any of those things.
9:04
But what the central limit theorem
9:05
tells us is if we add a bunch of those actions
9:08
together, assuming that they all have the same distribution,
9:11
or if we were to take the mean of all of those actions
9:13
together, and if we were to plot the frequency of those means,
9:16
we do get a normal distribution.
9:18
And that's frankly why the normal distribution shows up
9:22
so much in statistics and why, frankly, it's
9:25
a very good approximation for the sum
9:28
or the means of a lot of processes.
9:31
Normal distribution.
9:33
What I'm going to show you in the next video is I'm actually
9:36
going to show you that this is a reality, that as you increase
9:39
your sample size, as you increase your n,
9:41
and as you take a lot of sample means,
9:43
you're going to have a frequency plot that looks very, very
9:45
close to a normal distribution.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,JNm3M9cqWyc,

why do two negative charges not attract each other?",Essay,"•
0:00
- [Instructor] Okay, so we know that electrical charges
0:02
create electric fields in the region around them
0:05
but people get confused by electric field problems
0:07
so you got to get good at at least two things here
0:09
if you wanna proficient at dealing with electrical field.
0:13
You should get good at determining the direction
0:16
of the electric field that's created by a charge.
0:19
If you've got some charge
0:20
and you wanna know which way does that charge
0:22
create an electric field,
0:23
you should get really good at that.
0:25
And if you know the direction of the field,
0:27
you should get good at finding the direction
0:29
of the electric force exerted on a charge.
0:32
If there's some charge floating around
0:34
in an electric field,
0:35
you should be able to say,
0:36
oh, okay, I can determine the electric force.
0:38
Not too bad.
0:39
If you get good at these two things,
0:40
these problems are gonna be way easier
0:42
and the whole process is gonna make a lot more sense.
0:45
Let's figure out how to do this.
0:46
How do you do these things?
0:47
We'll do the first one first.
0:48
Let's try to tackle this one.
0:49
Let's try to figure out how do you determine
0:51
the direction of the electric field
0:52
that's created by a charge.
0:54
Let's say we didn't know, this is what the electric field
0:56
look like around a positive charge.
0:59
I just gave this to you
0:59
but how do we know that this is what the electric field's
1:02
supposed to look like?
1:03
What we can do is this.
1:04
We can say that we know the definition of electric field
1:07
is that it's the amount of electrical force
1:10
exerted per charge.
1:12
In other words, if you took some test charge,
1:14
think of this Q as the test charge
1:16
and we usually just make this a positive test charge
1:19
so this is easier to think about.
1:20
If you took some positive test charge into some region
1:23
let's do that, let's put some positive test charge in here.
1:26
We take this test charge, we move it around.
1:27
All we have to do to figure out
1:29
the direction of the electric field,
1:31
since this Q would be positive,
1:32
we can just figure out what direction
1:34
is the electric force on that positive test charge.
1:37
In other words, the direction of the electric field E
1:40
is gonna be the same direction as the electric force
1:43
on a positive test charge.
1:45
Because if you know about vector equations,
1:47
look at this electric fields vector,
1:49
this electric forces vector.
1:50
This electric field is just gonna adopt
1:52
the same direction as the electric force
1:55
as long as this Q is positive.
1:56
If this Q were negative it would flip the sign
1:59
of this electric force
2:00
and then the E would point the opposite direction.
2:02
But if we keep our test charge positive
2:04
then we know, okay, the electric field's
2:06
just gonna point the same direction
2:08
as the electrical force on that positive test charge.
2:11
Here's what I mean.
2:12
We take our positive test charge.
2:14
We move it around.
2:14
If I wanna know the electric field at this spot right here,
2:17
I just ask myself,
2:19
which way does the electrical force
2:20
point on that test charge?
2:22
The electric force would point to the right
2:24
since it's being repelled
2:26
by this other positive charge over here.
2:28
I know that the electric force points to the right,
2:30
these charges repel each other.
2:32
And since the electric force points to the right,
2:33
that means the electric field in this region
2:35
also points to the right.
2:37
It might not have the same magnitude.
2:39
The electric force might be 20 newtons
2:41
and the electric field might be 10 newtons per coulomb
2:44
but they have the same direction.
2:45
And I can move this charge somewhere else,
2:47
let's say I move it over here.
2:48
Which way would the electric force point?
2:50
Well, these positive charges are still repelling.
2:52
I'd still have an electric force to the right.
2:54
That electric force would be smaller
2:56
but it would still point to the right
2:57
and that means the electric field
2:59
also still points to the right,
3:00
it would be smaller as well
3:02
but it would still point to the right.
3:03
And if we wanna determine the electric field elsewhere,
3:05
we can move our positive test charge,
3:06
I'll move it over to here.
3:08
I'll ask which way is the electric force
3:10
on this positive test charge?
3:11
That would be in this direction
3:13
since these positive charges are repelling each other,
3:16
they're pushing each other away
3:17
so this positive always gets pushed away
3:19
from this other positive charge.
3:21
And so, that also means that the electric field
3:23
is pointing in that direction as well.
3:25
We keep doing this.
3:26
I can move this somewhere else.
3:27
I can move this positive charge down here.
3:29
The charges repel so the electric force
3:30
would point downward.
3:31
And that means the electric field would also point down.
3:34
If you keep doing this,
3:35
if you keep mapping what's the direction
3:37
of the electric force on a positive test charge?
3:39
Eventually, you realize oh, it's always just gonna point
3:42
radially out away from this other positive charge.
3:46
And so we know the electric field
3:47
from a positive charge is just gonna point
3:49
radially outward, that's why we drew it like this.
3:52
Because this positive charge would push
3:54
some positive test charge radially away from it
3:57
since it would be repelling it.
3:59
Positive charges create electric fields
4:01
that point radially away from them.
4:03
Now what if the charge creating the field
4:05
were a negative charge?
4:07
So, let's try to figure that one out,
4:08
let me get rid of this.
4:09
Let's say the charge creating the electric field
4:11
were negative, a big negative charge,
4:13
how do we determine the electric field
4:14
direction around this negative charge?
4:16
We're gonna do the same thing,
4:17
we're gonna take our positive test charge
4:19
and we're gonna keep our test charge positive,
4:21
that way we know that the direction
4:24
of the electric force on this positive test charge
4:27
is gonna be the same direction
4:28
as the electric field in that region.
4:30
In other words, the positivity of this test charge
4:33
will just make it so that the electric field
4:34
and electric force point in the same direction.
4:37
And if we do that, I'll move this around.
4:38
We'll just put it at this point here,
4:39
we'll move this test charge here.
4:41
Which way is the force on that test charge?
4:43
This time it's getting attracted to this negative charge.
4:46
Opposite charges attract
4:47
so the electric force would point this way
4:49
and since it's a positive test charge
4:51
and it preserve the direction in this equation,
4:53
that means the electric field
4:55
also points in that leftward direction.
4:57
And we can keep mapping the field
4:58
we'll move the test charge over to here.
5:00
The electric force this time is gonna point up
5:02
because this positive test charges
5:03
is attracted to this negative charge.
5:05
And if the electric force points up,
5:07
that means the electric field also points up in that region.
5:10
And you'd realize the electric force
5:12
is always gonna pull a positive test charge
5:15
toward this negative creating the field around it.
5:17
And because of that, the electric field
5:19
created by a negative charge points radially inward
5:24
toward that negative charge.
5:25
This is different.
5:26
Positive charge created a field that pointed
5:28
radially away from
5:30
because it always repelled the positive test charge.
5:33
But a negative charge creates an electric field
5:34
that points radially into
5:37
because it's always attracting a positive test charge.
5:40
Basically what I'm saying is
5:41
that if we got rid of all these,
5:42
clean this up,
5:43
the electric field from a positive charge
5:44
points radially outward
5:46
but if it were a negative charge,
5:48
you'd have to erase all these arrowheads
5:49
and put them on the other end.
5:51
Because the electric field from a negative charge
5:53
points radially inward toward that negative charge.
5:56
In other words, the electric field created by
5:59
a negative charge at some point in space around it
6:02
is gonna point toward that negative charge
6:04
creating that electric field.
6:06
And so, that's how you could determine
6:07
the direction of the electric field created by a charge.
6:09
If it's a positive charge you know
6:11
the electric field points radially out from that positive.
6:14
And if it's a negative charge,
6:16
you know the field points radially inward
6:18
toward that negative charge.
6:20
Okay, so that was number one here.
6:21
We found the direction
6:23
of the electric field created by a charge.
6:25
Check, we've done this.
6:26
Now we should get good at finding
6:28
the direction of the electric force
6:29
exerted on a charge in a field.
6:32
What does that mean?
6:33
Let's say you had a region of space
6:34
with electric field pointing to the right.
6:36
What's creating this electric field?
6:38
I don't know.
6:39
It doesn't even really matter.
6:40
This is why the electric field is a cool idea.
6:42
I don't really need to know
6:43
what created this electric field.
6:45
I mean, it could be positive charges over here
6:47
creating fields that point radially away from them.
6:51
But it could also be negative charges over here
6:53
creating fields that point radially toward them
6:56
or both, we don't really know.
6:58
It doesn't really matter.
6:58
As long as I now have an electric field
7:00
that points to the right,
7:01
I can figure out the direction of the electric force
7:03
on a charge in that field.
7:05
Let's put a charge in this field.
7:06
We'll just start with a positive charge.
7:08
We'll put this charge in here.
7:09
Since the electric field is equal to
7:12
the electric force on a charge
7:13
divided by that charge,
7:15
if this is a positive charge
7:17
and this charge we put down here is positive,
7:20
then the electric force points in the same direction
7:22
as the electric field and vice versa.
7:24
The electric field and electric force
7:26
would point the same direction
7:27
if the charge feeling that force is a positive charge.
7:30
This is just a long way of saying
7:32
that the electric force on a positive charge
7:34
is gonna point in the same direction
7:36
as the electric field in that region.
7:39
If there's an electric field that points to the right
7:41
like we have in here
7:42
then the electric force on a positive charge in that region
7:45
is also gonna point to the right.
7:46
And you might be thinking well,
7:47
duh, isn't that kind of obvious?
7:49
Doesn't this equation say
7:50
that the electric force has to be
7:52
the same direction as the electric field.
7:54
Almost, not quite.
7:55
There's one exception.
7:56
If this charge in here were negative,
7:59
if you put a negative charge in here,
8:00
now this force vector gets multiplied by a negative,
8:04
well, divided by a negative but the same thing.
8:06
Dividing by negative ones like multiplying by negative one.
8:09
You would swap the direction of this force vector
8:12
and this electric field would point
8:13
the opposite direction as the force
8:15
on a negative charge in that region,
8:17
and that's confusing.
8:18
In other words, check this out.
8:19
Say we took a negative charge in this region
8:21
and we wanted to know which way
8:22
would the electric force be on this negative charge
8:25
due to this electric field that points to the right.
8:27
Well, if the electric field points to the right
8:29
and this charge is negative,
8:31
then the electric force has to point to the left.
8:33
And the reason is if this force vector is leftward
8:36
and we divide it by a negative sign,
8:38
that's gonna take this force vector
8:40
and turn it from left to right.
8:41
That means the electric field
8:42
would be pointing to the right.
8:44
If the charge experiencing the electric force is negative
8:47
because multiplying a vector by negative one
8:49
changes its direction,
8:51
the electric force and the electric field
8:53
are gonna have opposite directions.
8:54
A negative charge feels a force
8:56
in the opposite direction as the electric field
8:59
but a positive charge feels a force
9:01
in the same direction as the electric field.
9:03
And I'll repeat that because it's important.
9:05
Positive charges experience an electric force
9:08
in the same direction as the electric field.
9:11
And negative charges experience an electric force
9:14
in the opposite direction as the electric field.
9:17
People mess this up all the time.
9:18
This confuses people a lot
9:20
so here's a way that might make it seem a little simpler.
9:23
Notice that neither of these charges
9:24
are creating this electric field
9:26
that's exerting the force on them
9:28
but let's draw some possibilities
9:29
for charges that might be creating this electric field.
9:32
One way to create an electric field to the right
9:34
is by having a bunch of positive charges over here,
9:37
creating electric fields that point radially away from them.
9:41
That would create an electric field to the right.
9:42
And what would be the force on these charges then?
9:45
Well, we know positive charges repel other positive charges
9:48
so the electric forces to the right.
9:50
And positive charges attract negative charges
9:52
so the electric force would point to the left.
9:54
This convention of electric forces pointing
9:56
in the same direction as the electric field
9:59
for a positive charge
10:00
and electric forces pointing in the opposite direction
10:02
of the electric field for a negative charge
10:04
agrees with what we already know
10:05
about opposites attracting and likes repelling.
10:08
It's just that people get confused
10:09
when we don't draw these charges
10:10
that are creating the electric field,
10:12
sometimes people forget how to find
10:14
the direction of the force.
10:15
If you want to, you can always draw them in there.
10:17
The other possibility is that
10:18
to create fields to the right,
10:20
we can put negative charges over here.
10:22
These might be creating that electric field
10:24
because they'd create fields
10:25
that point radially into them
10:27
because that's what negative charges do.
10:29
And which way will the forces be?
10:30
These negatives would be attracting
10:32
this positive to the right just like we said
10:34
in the same direction as the electric field.
10:36
Whether that electric field created by
10:38
positives or negatives, it doesn't matter.
10:40
If the electric field points to the right,
10:42
positive charges feel the force to the right.
10:44
And then a negative charge in this region
10:46
would be repelled by these negatives
10:47
or attracted by these positives
10:49
and it would feel a force to the left.
10:51
It doesn't matter whether it was positives
10:53
or negatives creating the field.
10:55
If the field points right,
10:57
positive charges are gonna feel a force
10:59
in that region to the right.
11:00
Negative charges are gonna feel a force
11:01
in that region to the left.
11:03
Let's do one more for practice.
11:04
Let's say you had this example.
11:06
Let's say you had a negative charge
11:07
and it was experiencing an electric force downward.
11:10
Now we wanna know what direction
11:12
is the electric field in this region?
11:14
Well, if the electric force
11:15
on a negative charge is downward,
11:17
the only way that happens is
11:18
for there to be an electric field
11:20
in this region that points upward.
11:22
Because negative charges are gonna feel
11:23
an electric force in the opposite direction
11:26
as the electric field.
11:27
The direction of the E would be the opposite direction
11:30
as the direction of F
11:31
or it could just ask what charge would cause
11:33
an electric force downward on this negative charge?
11:35
A big positive charge down here would do it.
11:37
Well, positive charges create fields
11:39
that point radially away from them.
11:41
So in this region up here
11:42
it would have to point radially upward
11:44
since that's a away from the positive charge.
11:47
Or you could say something else
11:48
that would cause an electric force
11:49
downward on this negative charge
11:51
would be a big negative charge up here.
11:53
And negative charges always create fields
11:55
that point radially into them.
11:57
What would the field be in this region down here,
11:59
it would still point upward
12:01
because upward would be radially in
12:03
toward the negative charge creating that field.
12:06
Recapping, you can find the direction
12:08
of the electric field created by a charge
12:10
since positive charges create fields
12:12
that point radially away from them.
12:14
And negative charges create fields
12:16
that point radially toward them.
12:18
And you can find the direction of
12:19
the electric force on a charge
12:21
since positive charges are gonna feel an electric force
12:24
in the same direction as the electric field in that region.
12:27
And negative charges are gonna feel an electric force
12:29
in the opposite direction
12:31
to the electric field in that region.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,Z_ddImEdmCQ,

0:00
We now know a little bit about inflation and deflation.
0:03
And now I want to introduce you to hyperinflation.
0:07
And as the word implies, it's inflation gone wild.
0:13
How hyperinflation, or at least the cases
0:15
that we've seen in modern times, how they've happened is you
0:18
have some type of a government just going wild
0:21
with the printing press.
0:22
They're just printing a ton of money.
0:24
So the general cycle is they print money,
0:30
they print like mad, usually because they
0:34
don't have any other way of getting revenue.
0:37
They print like mad.
0:39
That leads to prices going up.
0:44
And then because prices go up, they
0:46
have to print more in order for them
0:48
to be able to get the same goods and services
0:50
or pay the government workers what they wanted
0:52
to pay the government workers, or pay the soldiers what
0:55
they wanted to pay the soldiers.
0:57
This by itself would probably drive the hyperinflation
1:00
in and of itself.
1:02
But on top of this, we're used to thinking high inflation is
1:06
5% or 10%, but you could imagine what
1:09
happens when inflation is 5% or 10% per hour.
1:12
Because then there's no incentive
1:14
to be actually holding currency.
1:16
Every second that you hold currency it
1:18
becomes worth less and less and less.
1:21
And so what happens in a scenario like this is people
1:23
want to hoard hard assets.
1:25
So if the price of bread is going up by the minute
1:28
or by the hour, or the price of shoes
1:30
are going up by the minute or by the hour,
1:33
the increase in prices is going to make people hoard things.
1:40
Hoarding goes through the roof.
1:43
And you can imagine if hoarding goes through the roof,
1:45
if the shoe seller doesn't want to sell his shoes anymore,
1:48
or he wants the hold them a little bit longer,
1:50
then the supply of shoes are going to go down,
1:52
and the prices are going to go up even higher.
1:54
So hoarding leads even to higher prices.
1:58
When people go to the bread market,
1:59
and there's five loaves of bread, they buy all of them.
2:02
And then the next person can't buy any
2:03
because they know that the price of bread
2:04
is going through the roof.
2:06
So it just keeps getting worse and worse.
2:09
And it's all started by the government just
2:11
going nuts with the printing press.
2:14
Now, the three most famous examples
2:17
of this happening-- probably the most famous one
2:19
is what happened in Weimar Germany
2:22
after World War I. They had huge reparations to pay.
2:26
That's what the Weimar government
2:28
would have argued was their main cause.
2:30
But they just printed money like crazy.
2:32
Some people said that they were almost
2:34
trying to destroy the economy so that they wouldn't have
2:36
to pay reparations for what they did in World War I.
2:40
But this just gives you a sense of how crazy it was.
2:43
Here's the end of World War I. And they just
2:46
printed money like mad.
2:50
And isn't the rate of inflation.
2:52
This is how much it was relative to a gold mark.
2:56
So this is one gold mark over here.
2:58
So only after about 2 and a half years it was over tenfold.
3:02
And this is a logarithmic scale.
3:04
Each slash year, this is a factor of 10.
3:07
So after by the end of 1923, you're
3:09
looking at-- This is what?
3:10
Not 100,000, not a million, not a billion.
3:15
This is a trillion.
3:16
It had gone up a trillion fold in the span of one, two, three,
3:20
four, five, six years.
3:23
The other famous examples of this,
3:26
Zimbabwe from 1980 until 2009.
3:29
Once again, printing money like mad.
3:31
And some of their productive capacity went away.
3:34
This right here is a 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollar.
3:39
And this shows you the Zimbabwean dollar
3:43
relative to the US dollar.
3:44
And once again, is a logarithmic scale.
3:46
This is 10 to the 30th power.
3:48
And then the largest or the most extreme hyperinflation
3:52
ever was Hungary after World War II.
3:55
And this right here is a 10 million

teded_2092,Who uses video games?,multiple-choices,"Hi, I'm Medium Invader
from the classic video game Space Invaders,
and I want to tell you a little bit
about where video games came from.
A video game is an electronic game
that has an interface designed for human interaction
on a video device.
Simple.
Video games are used by scientists,
the military,
and people like you,
and their evolution has spread across arcades,
consoles,
computers,
smart phones,
and all kinds of other electronics.
These days video games are everywhere,
but they were actually made in science labs.
In fact, the earliest U.S. video game patent on record
was in 1948,
and at the time it was referred to
as a cathode-ray tube amusement device.
That's a mouthful!
Some of the earliest video games include
the Nimrod computer,
OXO,
Tennis for Two,
and my personal favorite, Spacewar!
But none of these early video games
were ever sold to the public
because they were either too huge
or too expensive
to get out of the lab.
This all changed when a man named Ralph Baer
looked at his television screen and wondered
how else it might be used.
In 1972, Baer's idea to get video games
out of the science lab and into the living room
led to the release of a game console
called Odyssey.
Odyssey allowed you to play a game on your TV.
At about the same time,
two other people, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney,
were working on something similar
in a little company called Atari.
You might have heard of it,
and even if you haven't,
I'm sure that your Dad has.
Atari's first major game release was in 1972,
an arcade game called Pong.
It was an immediate hit,
and it's credited
as the first commercially successful video game.
Atari then released a home version of Pong in 1974.
By 1978, competition between Atari
and another game company called Midway
was heating up.
Midway had licensed an arcade game
for the Japanese company, Taito,
that put them on the map.
The game:
Space Invaders.
It featured iconic actors, like me,
and it went on to become
the second highest selling arcade game of all time.
Space Invaders also helped kick off
what is known as the Golden Age of Arcade Games.
In response, Atari followed
with the release of the arcade game Asteroids,
which ranked sixth on the list
of highest selling arcade games.
It was a good game,
but it's no Space Invaders.
By 1980, color came to arcade games,
and this was also the year
that another video gaming milestone was born.
Pac-Man, created by the Japanese company Namco,
was brought to the U.S. by Midway.
Important to the spread
of video games into popular culture,
Pac-Man was a character that could be licensed.
It wasn't long before it had a song on the charts,
a Saturday morning television show,
and all sorts of other products.
In just a year, Pac-Man arcade games
made over one billion dollars in quarters.
Then, in 1981, a company called Nintendo
started making waves in the U.S. video game market
with their release of Donkey Kong.
It was the earliest video game
to have a story line.
The story went a bit like this:
Donkey Kong is the pet
of a carpenter named Jumpman.
Jumpman mistreats his pet ape,
so the ape steals his girlfriend,
leaving the game player to assume the role
of Jumpman and rescue the girl.
Jumpman was eventually renamed to Mario.
Other iconic arcade games from the early 80s include
Frogger,
Dragon's Lair,
and Mario Brothers.
Perhaps the last iconic game considered
to be part of the Golden Age of Arcade Games
is Double Dragon.
It was the first really successful example
of the beat-them-up genre.
It was released in 1987,
and, like Donkey Kong,
it featured a damsel in distress storyline,
a storyline common in many video games.
By the mid-90s, the Golden Age of Arcade Games
was coming to an end,
and the home game console
was gaining in popularity.
While arcade games continued
to decline in sales over the years,
the popularity of video games was merely beginning,
and we'll talk about that
and a lot more
in part two of a brief history of video games.

0:00
Entering into World War I, the British
0:02
had the world's dominant navy.
0:04
And they use it immediately to their advantage.
0:06
You might remember from previous videos,
0:09
Britain declared war on Germany because of their invasion
0:12
into Belgium in early August of 1914.
0:15
And it was in November of 1914 that the British declared
0:23
the entire North Sea area a war zone.
0:31
Which essentially is telling any ship, come here
0:34
at your own risk.
0:34
You might be destroyed, and especially you're
0:36
not allowed to carry any contraband.
0:38
But they included food as a contraband.
0:41
So this essentially began the blockade
0:43
of Germany and Austria-Hungary.
0:45
So this is the blockade of the Central Powers.
0:53
And this had major implications for the war.
0:56
It continued throughout the entire war.
0:59
It essentially caused the Germans, or the Central Powers,
1:01
especially the Germans and the Austrians
1:04
to have to ration food.
1:05
We're talking about 1,000 calories a day.
1:08
You could look at the number of calories in your average Big
1:11
Mac and think about how little food that was.
1:13
And there's many estimates of what that caused.
1:15
That obviously made it hard for the Central Powers
1:18
to get war munitions and things like that.
1:20
But it also made it very difficult for them to get food.
1:22
And there are estimates that this rationing, this inability
1:26
to get food, lead to malnutrition, even led
1:29
to starvation.
1:30
And there's estimates that this might
1:32
have led to in excess of 400,000 civilian deaths
1:39
either directly or indirectly due to malnutrition
1:41
or starvation amongst the Central Powers.
1:48
So this was a pretty serious tactic that was undertaken.
1:52
Now, the Germans did not have as dominant of a Navy.
1:56
Most of their Navy was actually focused right off
1:58
of the coast of Germany, right around there, in the North Sea.
2:02
But they also wanted to disrupt trade with the British.
2:05
They recognized the British Isles, they're islands.
2:08
They're dependent on trade for food and for supplies.
2:12
So in 1915 in February, the Germans declared the seas
2:19
around the British Isles, they declared this whole area,
2:22
a war zone.
2:32
Similarly, they declared that a war zone as well.
2:38
And because their surface fleet was concentrated
2:40
right over here, the way that they
2:41
would enforce that, they would essentially
2:43
try to keep people from trading with the British Isles
2:48
is through submarine warfare.
2:50
And World War I is the first time
2:52
that submarine warfare becomes a significant factor.
2:54
We're talking about very primitive submarines.
2:56
But we are talking about these vessels that
2:58
could go underwater and essentially
3:00
send torpedoes into boats.
3:02
Now, thinking about that as a backdrop,
3:06
we now forward to May of 1915.
3:09
So let's go to May of 1915.
3:14
You have the passenger liner, the RMS Lusitania.
3:18
And RMS literally stands for Royal Mail Ship
3:20
because it carried some mail.
3:22
It's a big ship.
3:23
If you've ever seen the movie Titanic,
3:24
think of a ship like that.
3:26
And it was setting sail from New York to Liverpool, England.
3:32
And it was apparently a passenger ship,
3:35
but it was also carrying cargo.
3:37
But the Germans, they said, look,
3:39
this could be fair game for us, especially if it's
3:41
carrying munitions, especially if it's a British ship.
3:44
And in the advertisement that was
3:46
in New York for the Lusitania that
3:48
was going to leave on May 1, 1915,
3:58
the German embassy actually placed an advertisement.
4:01
And this is worth reading.
4:03
They wrote, ""Notice, travelers intending
4:06
to embark on the Atlantic voyage are
4:08
reminded that a state of war exists
4:10
between Germany and her allies and Great
4:14
Britain and her allies.
4:15
That the zone of war includes the water
4:18
adjacent to the British Isles.
4:20
That in accordance with formal notice given
4:23
by the Imperial German government, vessels flying
4:26
the flag of Great Britain, or any of her allies,
4:30
are liable to destruction in those waters.
4:34
And that travelers sailing in the war zone
4:36
on ships of Great Britain or her allies do so at their own risk.
4:41
From the Imperial German embassy.""
4:43
And this is dated April 1915.
4:47
So that's the backdrop.
4:49
The Lusitania sets sail May 1, 1915.
4:56
On May 7, 1915-- the number 15 keeps
4:59
jumping into my brain-- on May 7, 1915,
5:06
it's almost reached its destination of Liverpool.
5:09
That's Liverpool right over here.
5:13
It's around 10 or 15 miles off the coast of Ireland.
5:17
And right there it encounters a German U boat.
5:21
So this right over here is a German U boat.
5:24
And that German U boat sends a torpedo into the Lusitania.
5:29
Now the torpedo, as you could imagine, rams into the ship.
5:32
And then shortly after the torpedo hits,
5:34
you have this huge explosion.
5:35
And the huge explosion is actually
5:37
one of those question marks of history.
5:40
Now, the ship goes down, taking down with it
5:43
most of its passengers.
5:45
So there were 1,959 total passengers and crew.
5:55
And 1,195 of them actually died.
5:59
Now there were other ships that went down due to German U
6:03
boats, but what was famous about this one,
6:06
at least from an American history point of view,
6:08
is that there were 128 Americans who also died on board.
6:15
And so you could imagine, this led to a lot of people
6:20
were concerned on the American side.
6:22
Why did this happen?
6:23
These were American civilians.
6:25
And it essentially led to a harsh reprimand
6:28
from Woodrow Wilson.
6:30
And just as a little bit of context, once war broke out--
6:33
and war had broken not even a year
6:35
before the sinking of the Lusitania--
6:37
the Americans' position was to be neutral.
6:40
It did not want to enter into this European conflict.
6:43
With that said, the Americans were disproportionately
6:47
trading with the Allies not the Central Power.
6:50
They were providing supplies, at a minimum, at a trading level.
6:56
And they were providing monetary support.
6:58
They were providing loans to the Allies disproportional
7:02
to the Central Powers.
7:03
So even though there was this formal neutrality,
7:09
there was more implicit connection to the Allies.
7:13
So Woodrow Wilson, he still wants to keep America out
7:16
of the war at this point.
7:18
So we're talking about May 1915.
7:20
And so he essentially just sends a stern warning
7:23
to the German empire.
7:25
Says, you must apologize.
7:27
You must take action to prevent this type of thing
7:30
happening in the future.
7:32
And the German empire actually complies.
7:34
On September 9-- let me write this on the timeline.
7:40
So right over here.
7:41
So in May, you have the Lusitania sunk.
7:48
And then in September, the Germans
7:54
agree to not attack passenger ships.
8:08
And so even though the sinking of the Lusitania,
8:11
especially in a lot of American history classes,
8:13
is often given as a trigger for America entrance into war,
8:17
this whole thing happened and America stayed neutral
8:20
throughout this entire period.
8:21
And America wouldn't actually enter the war until April 1917.
8:26
So the Lusitania was just one of many things
8:28
that happened in the years running up to the war.
8:31
And if we fast forward a little bit,
8:32
in 1916 the next presidential election where Wilson
8:36
won re-election, he ran on a platform of,
8:39
he kept us out of war.
8:48
So the sinking of the Lusitania was a significant event.
8:51
One could argue because the Germans did not
8:54
want the US to enter on the side of the Allies,
8:57
it was why the Germans agreed to loosen up,
8:59
at least for a couple of years, on their U boat campaigns.
9:03
As we'll see, once we get into 1917, the Germans,
9:06
out of desperation, start to become
9:07
more aggressive on their U boat attacks
9:09
again, which is one of the catalysts
9:11
that the US claims drove them into World War I.
9:18
But with that said, just as a little bit
9:20
of context-- and oftentimes when we look back at history,
9:23
it seems very cut and dry.
9:25
It seems obvious.
9:25
Oh yes, we had to go to war, et cetera, et cetera.
9:29
I have a few quotes here from William Jennings Bryan,
9:34
who was Woodrow Wilson's secretary of state.
9:36
And a few of these are pretty telling.
9:40
So this first one is September 1914.
9:42
This was before any of the stuff happened with Lusitania,
9:44
but war had broken out in Europe.
9:47
And he had this message that he wrote
9:49
to Woodrow Wilson to essentially advocate
9:51
why we should stay out of the war
9:53
and why there should be some type of mediation
9:55
to try to get the war to end as opposed
9:57
to just letting it run its course.
9:58
And he wrote to Wilson, ""it is not likely
10:01
that either side will win so complete a victory as
10:04
to be able to dictate terms.
10:06
And if either""-- and this is interesting and strangely
10:11
foreshadowing-- ""and if either side does win such a victory,
10:16
it'll probably mean preparation for another war.
10:19
It would seem better to look for a more rational basis
10:24
for peace.""
10:25
Now, the other quotes here-- and this is the question mark
10:29
around that second explosion-- William Jennings Bryan wrote,
10:34
""ships carrying contraband should be prohibited
10:36
from carrying passengers.
10:37
It would be like putting women and children
10:39
in front of an army.""
10:41
And so this is one of those big questions of history.
10:43
It was known that the Lusitania was carrying light ammunition.
10:49
So it was carrying a light munitions.
10:54
Now, the Germans claimed that it was actually
10:56
carrying heavy munitions.
10:57
And to some degree, that second explosion
10:59
tends to back that up.
11:00
And there was all sorts of shady things about a lot of the cargo
11:03
that the Lusitania was carrying, even though they claimed
11:06
that it was these perishable goods.
11:07
It wasn't being stored in a refrigerated part of the ship.
11:11
And so there was reason to believe
11:13
that it was carrying actually heavy munitions.
11:16
And that second explosion seems to point in that direction
11:21
as well.
11:21
And then even after World War I, the British Navy actually
11:25
spent multiple times trying to destroy
11:27
the wreck of the Lusitania.
11:29
And some people say in order to maybe get rid of some evidence
11:33
that it was actually carrying far more munitions
11:35
and maybe was, from the Germans' point of view,
11:38
a fairer target than was actually made out.
11:43
So regardless, it's a very interesting incident,
11:45
not necessarily directly tied to America's entrance
11:50
into World War I. But it is one of many events.
11:53
And this whole idea of blockades and German U boats
11:56
against civilians, this was something
11:58
that was a cause of repeated concern for the Americans.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,B_P48TakY3Y,

0:00
The word inequality, by its very nature,
0:02
at least sounds, sounds a little bit unfair.
0:06
Obviously, everyone's not getting the same thing.
0:09
They're not getting the same income,
0:10
or they don't have the same wealth,
0:12
but a question needs to be asked is,
0:14
is this necessarily a bad thing,
0:17
and even if it is a bad thing,
0:19
are the ways of fixing it or trying to address it,
0:23
could they make matters worse in some way,
0:25
especially for the people that you're trying to help?
0:28
And, once again, my goal here is to not tell you
0:30
one way or the other, but to at least give you
0:32
frameworks for thinking about this.
0:34
So, let's just think about a world where we have
0:38
kind of a fixed-pie economy, and there,
0:40
increasing inequality is clearly not doing good
0:43
for the people who have less resources.
0:48
So, let's imagine a fixed-pie economy.
0:50
So, let's say this rectangle right over here
0:55
represents the total national income in a given period.
1:01
So, year one, this is the total national income,
1:05
total national income, and let's say that in year one
1:12
the top 10 percent of earners, the top 10 percent
1:17
of earners, make a third of the national income,
1:21
so, they make a third of the national income.
1:24
This is the top 10 percent.
1:26
Now, let me be very clear.
1:27
This area right over here is not 10 % of the whole rectangle.
1:31
This is 35 percent, or actually this is a third,
1:36
so, this is going to be 33.
1:38
This is one-third of the entire rectangle,
1:41
but it's the income from the top 10 percent.
1:45
Income from the top 10 percent.
1:49
Now, that would mean that the other 90 percent,
1:52
other 90 percent, is essentially splitting the remaining
1:58
two-thirds of national income between them.
2:01
So, if you take this reality, and if the total pie,
2:05
so, let's do a static pie right over here,
2:09
so pie stays the same, so pie, and when I say pie,
2:14
I'm talking about this square thing here.
2:15
I guess it doesn't look too much like a pie,
2:17
so maybe I don't call it a pie.
2:19
So, national income static.
2:22
So, it's not changing right over here.
2:24
So, then you have, let me try to draw
2:26
a rectangle of the same size, of the same size,
2:32
and if you have increasing inequality in this situation,
2:37
then you might have the top 10 percent of earners by,
2:39
let's just say this is year 10, year 10 right over here,
2:45
maybe instead of having one-third of the national income,
2:47
maybe they have 50 percent of the national income,
2:50
and I'm just picking round numbers for simplicity.
2:53
So, this right over here is one-half of
2:55
national income now from the top 10 percent.
2:58
From the top 10 percent.
3:03
So, clearly, if this happens, the other 90 percent
3:06
are now splitting only one-half of the national income.
3:10
So, this is the other 90 percent right over here.
3:15
So, here it's essentially a zero-sum game.
3:17
If you had a static economy, if it was not growing at all,
3:21
then, of course, rising inequality would mean
3:24
that these people, right over, the other 90 percent,
3:27
are going to have lower per capita,
3:30
I guess you could say income, lower per capita GDP.
3:34
They're going to have a lower standard of living.
3:36
So, they're not doing good in this situation.
3:39
But, let's think of the other way,
3:40
of where you do have economic growth,
3:42
and economic growth that's enough so even if you have
3:46
some inequality, the growth more than offsets that,
3:51
so that these, the other 90 percent, is still better off.
3:55
So, let's see if we can visualize that.
3:56
So, economic growth, economic growth,
4:06
and let's say your pie has grown dramatically
4:09
over 10 years, and I'm just, maybe I'm exaggerating
4:12
a little bit for the sake of discussion.
4:15
So, let me draw it like this.
4:17
So, I'll try to do about the same height,
4:19
but now, our whole economy, let's say our whole economy
4:24
has doubled, our whole economy has doubled here,
4:30
and now in this situation, let's say you still have
4:33
this wealth inequality growing.
4:35
So, the top 10 percent in year one
4:37
having one-third of national income.
4:39
Let's say that it still goes to one-half of national income
4:42
in year 10, so one-half of national income.
4:47
So, I can draw that a little bit neater.
4:49
So, half of national income right over there,
4:54
half of national income, so one-half of national income.
4:58
So, this is still a situation where you've had
5:00
inequality increase, but the half of national income
5:06
that's going to have to be split between the other
5:09
90 percent has still grown fairly dramatically,
5:14
if we assume that I've drawn it
5:15
pretty close to proportional.
5:18
So, let me just copy and paste this.
5:19
So, copy and paste.
5:23
So, this is how much was being split
5:25
amongst the other 90 percent in year one,
5:28
and notice, it's much smaller than how much
5:31
is being split by the other 90 percent,
5:33
and actually, let me put it right over here,
5:35
than the other 90 percent in year 10,
5:38
and if we assume that the population
5:40
hasn't grown by this amount, it's grown by
5:42
something smaller than this, or maybe the population
5:44
has been relatively stable, then your per capita,
5:47
your per capita GDP, your per capita income
5:50
is actually going to improve.
5:52
So, this is a situation here where even though inequality
5:56
has increased, because the pie has gotten bigger,
6:00
these people are better off.
6:02
These people are better off, and so, that leads to
6:07
really one of the fundamental questions,
6:10
especially when you're thinking about economic systems,
6:12
is that you have this market system,
6:15
this capitalist system, this market economy,
6:21
a market economy, and at least in the recent history,
6:25
it's shown us that, hey, this leads to growth,
6:28
wealth creation, so pie, so economic growth,
6:32
economic growth, but it also leads to inequality.
6:39
It also leads to Inequality.
6:42
Inequality is an inevitable by-product.
6:45
Inequality.
6:47
Now, the question you might have to ask is,
6:49
well, look, is this necessarily bad?
6:51
If this economic growth is enough, everyone is better off.
6:55
It doesn't matter if some people are even more better off
6:57
than other people, but everyone is better off,
6:59
and it's important to think about if you try to
7:03
just focus on inequality, just focus on inequality,
7:07
are you also going to stop this from happening?
7:09
Another way of thinking about it, if you're one of
7:11
the people in this situation right over here,
7:15
you're the other 90 percent, would you rather
7:17
stay in this world, where you're in a static pie
7:20
and inequality is not increasing,
7:22
or would you rather go to this world right over here?
7:26
Now, once again, the point of my video isn't to say
7:29
that this world is necessarily going to happen.
7:31
There could be a world where your
7:33
total economic growth was less than this,
7:35
and the pie got bigger, and these people are not
7:37
as well off, but the whole point of this is just to highlight
7:41
that inequality is not necessarily always going to lead
7:44
to the people, I guess who are getting less of the pie,
7:49
being worse off, if the pie grows fast enough,
7:52
and the other thing to realize is, well,
7:55
sometimes, in an attempt to lessen inequality,
7:59
you might also stifle economic growth,
8:02
and that might keep everyone from being better off
8:05
in this scenario right over here.
8:06
So, once again, it really depends on the context,
8:09
it really depends on the situation and the variables
8:11
and the numbers you're looking at,
8:13
but I just really want to emphasize that
8:15
there's no such thing as, hey, if there's rising inequality
8:17
it's going to hurt always the other 90 percent.
8:20
It'll definitely benefit the people who are maybe
8:23
in the top 10 percent, but it also,
8:25
because that's a by-product of economic growth,
8:27
it might make these people better off as well.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,r5L-riaIJjI,

is low the demand for square footage is higher.
0:35
But what I really want to focus on in this video,
0:37
is viewing the demand curve as the
0:39
marginal benefit curve.
0:41
Marginal benefit curve.
0:43
When that first incremental square foot
0:47
that is added to the market,
0:49
that has a huge marginal benefit
0:51
where people are desperate to get an apartment.
0:54
To get someplace where they could rent and they could live.
0:57
So it has a huge marginal benefit.
1:00
Then the marginal benefit for every
1:01
incremental square foot starts to go down.
1:06
Likewise, we can look at the supply curve.
1:08
We're going to look at this as the
1:09
marginal cost curve.
1:11
The marginal cost curve.
1:13
The marginal cost of that very first
1:16
incremental square foot for the suppliers
1:19
for the landlords in the city is $1
1:21
per square foot.
1:22
One way to think about it,
1:24
that very first square foot,
1:25
we don't know what its price would have been,
1:27
but let's say its price was at $3 if it was.
1:31
I'm just making that up.
1:33
In that reality,
1:34
if that very first square foot's price was at $3,
1:36
there is definitely an incentive for someone
1:39
to make that first square foot
1:42
because their marginal cost is only
1:43
a dollar and they could rent it out at $3 per month.
1:47
There is definitely an incentive for someone to rent it.
1:51
The marginal benefit is $4 and they just have
1:54
to pay $3 for it.
1:56
It could be rented out for anywhere
1:58
or it would exist,
1:59
or this kind of transaction would happen
2:01
as long as its price was between $1 and $4.
2:06
You could imagine, based on how this is drawn,
2:08
where the actual equilibrium price is.
2:10
The suppliers will keep adding more and more
2:14
square foot as long as they can actually rent it out,
2:17
all the way until the point that the marginal
2:20
benefit is equal to the marginal cost.
2:23
Right over here marginal benefit is equal
2:25
to marginal cost.
2:27
It wouldn't make sense for suppliers
2:29
to produce an incremental square foot right over here.
2:32
If they produce an incremental square foot,
2:33
their marginal cost has gone beyond $3,
2:37
while the marginal benefit is below $3,
2:39
no one is going to rent that thing out.
2:42
We reach an equilibrium point at 2 million
2:49
square feet per month on the market.
2:51
Let me make that line a little bit straighter.
2:53
2 million square foot per month on the market
2:55
and at a price of $3 per square foot per month.
3:03
You can look at the total surplus here.
3:05
In this equilibrium scenario,
3:07
we can calculate the consumer surplus.
3:10
So all of these folks,
3:12
for this first incremental foot,
3:15
someone was willing to pay $4 per square foot.
3:17
They only have to pay $3.
3:18
The next one a little less than $4.
3:20
Benefit they only have to pay $3.
3:21
All the way to this point right over here.
3:23
So the area of this triangle right over here,
3:27
this right over here is the consumer surplus.
3:30
So that right over here is consumer surplus.
3:33
Consumer surplus.
3:37
We can calculate it.
3:38
This is a triangle.
3:40
I'm assuming actually both the supply and demand curves are lines.
3:42
So let's see this has a height of 1
3:44
and it has a base of 2 so its area is going to be
3:48
1 times 2 times one-half.
3:51
That is going to be equal to 1 million dollars.
3:58
We are multiplying $1 times 2 million
4:02
times one-half.
4:04
That's going to be 1 million dollars
4:07
of consumer surplus per month.
4:09
Let's think about the producer surplus.
4:11
The producer surplus is going to be this area.
4:14
It's going to be this area right over here.
4:17
That first incremental foot it only cost
4:19
those producers $1 but they are able
4:21
to rent it out for $3.
4:25
Then they will keep producing,
4:27
keep producing all the way until they
4:28
do 2 million square foot.
4:30
For all of their square feet,
4:32
they are able to rent it out for more
4:34
than it was their cost to produce it.
4:35
So the area of this triangle is the producer surplus.
4:40
This is the producer surplus.
4:44
Producer surplus.
4:49
We can calculate that as well.
4:51
The height right over here is $2.
4:54
$2 times this width is 2 million square feet per month.
4:59
2 times 2 times one-half is 2.
5:02
This is equal to 2 million dollars.
5:06
If we were to talk about what the total surplus is,
5:08
it is 3 million dollars.
5:14
Now, this equilibrium rent,
5:16
$3 per square foot per month is actually quite a lot
5:18
for 1,000 square foot apartment.
5:21
My last apartment was a two bedroom,
5:23
two bath apartment.
5:24
It was about 1,000 square foot.
5:26
So that means you're going to be paying $3,000
5:27
per month for that.
5:29
That's pretty high rent.
5:30
That's the type of rent you might pay
5:31
in a city like San Francisco.
5:34
Let's say people start complaining about it.
5:36
So the government says, ""Okay that rent is not fair.
5:38
""It's too high.
5:39
""We want to introduce some type of price control.
5:43
""We want to introduce rent control.""
5:47
I'm oversimplifying how this works,
5:50
but just so that we can deal with this model right over here,
5:53
Let's say that the city just sets a ceiling
5:56
on the price per square foot per month.
6:00
Let's just say they set a price ceiling,
6:02
a price ceiling of $2 per square foot per month.
6:09
$2 per square foot.
6:12
Let me write it this way.
6:14
$2 per square foot per month.
6:21
So they set a price ceiling right over here.
6:26
Given that, what is going to happen?
6:29
What is going to happen?
6:32
What I really want to think about is what
6:33
is going to be the new consumer surplus
6:35
or the new producer surplus?
6:37
I encourage you to pause the video
6:38
and try to think about that on your own.
6:40
Well let's think about what's going to happen.
6:42
From the producers point of view,
6:44
it doesn't make sense for them to produce
6:46
more than 1 million units.
6:48
1 million square feet per month.
6:51
I have to rent out more than a million
6:53
square feet per month
6:54
because that extra square foot above that,
6:57
its marginal cost is going to be more than
6:58
what they're going to get.
7:00
The producers are just going to stop there.
7:01
The producer surplus is going to be the area
7:05
of this triangle right over here.
7:10
Let's see, this is $1 times 1 million
7:13
times one-half.
7:16
This is now a producer surplus.
7:17
Producer surplus.
7:21
A new producer surplus under the rent control
7:22
of $500,000, half a million, of $500,000.
7:30
So we see that the rent control
7:31
immediately hit the producers pretty hard.
7:34
The producer surplus has gone down dramatically.
7:36
Now what about the consumer surplus?
7:38
We're talking about a million units,
7:40
or a million square foot per month I should say.
7:43
So now the new consumer surplus is the area,
7:48
is this entire area.
7:52
So you see that at least for this first
7:55
incremental million square feet,
7:57
the consumers have started to win out a little bit.
8:00
To figure this out, what the total area is,
8:03
we just need to figure out what we could break
8:04
this up into two sections.
8:06
We could break this up into two sections.
8:09
This is the point,
8:10
1 million square feet at $3.50 dollars per square foot per month.
8:14
This is right over here, the point, the 3.5.
8:16
We could use that to figure out this new area.
8:19
Actually let me do it in a different color,
8:21
in this green area right over here.
8:25
What is it going to be?
8:26
Well the area of this thing right over here
8:30
is one-half high.
8:33
One-half times 1 times one-half.
8:38
This right over here is 250K.
8:41
We add that to this area right over here,
8:45
which is one and a half times 1.
8:51
$1.5 dollars per square foot per month
8:54
times 1 million.
8:55
Did I do that right? Yep.
8:57
So that's going to be plus ... plus this,
9:00
which is 1.5 million.
9:03
You add these two together.
9:05
The total consumer surplus ...
9:07
So the total consumer surplus is now 1.75 million.
9:18
So the consumer surplus definitely
9:20
did go up in total because it gained
9:23
all of this from the producer,
9:26
but let's think about what has now
9:28
happened in our society or in our city.
9:30
The producers definitely don't want to put out
9:33
as many square foot per rent anymore.
9:35
It does look like we have lost some
9:37
total surplus for our little city here.
9:40
We have lost out on this entire area.
9:44
We can calculate it by looking at what
9:46
the total surplus was before the rent control
9:49
and what the total surplus was after the rent control.
9:52
The total surplus before,
9:54
so before the total surplus was the 2 million
9:59
producer surplus plus the 1 million consumer surplus,
10:02
so it was 3 million.
10:05
After, it is the 1.75 million consumer surplus
10:12
plus the $500,000 producer surplus,
10:14
which is 2.25 million.
10:19
What we've lost is the difference here,
10:23
which is $750,000.
10:28
So this area right over here.
10:30
This is per month.
10:31
This right over here represents the lost total surplus.
10:35
This lost total surplus of $750,000 per month
10:40
is referred to as the dead weight loss.
10:46
You can debate about rent control.
10:49
Is it good? Is it bad?
10:50
Is it good for this kind of dynamic?
10:52
Who gets what share of the surplus?
10:55
This of course is an oversimplification
10:57
of a market and even the way rent
10:59
control would be instituted.
11:00
This is a model for beginning to think
11:02
about what happens to the total surplus
11:05

0:00
Everything we've talked about so far with this startup
0:04
company selling socks and all of that, has been raising
0:06
money from an equity.
0:07
We raised private money-- when the company was private it
0:10
went to VCs and it went to angel investors, and maybe you
0:15
could go to your friends and family to raise money.
0:17
And then the company could go public and raise money from
0:20
the public markets.
0:21
But there's actually two ways that a
0:23
company can raise capital.
0:26
So this is why this playlist is called capital markets, or
0:29
it's part of it, the name of raise capital.
0:32
Capital is just essentially-- I mean the easy way to think
0:34
about it is you're raising cash that you want to invest
0:38
in some way to grow your business or to sustain your
0:40
business or start your business.
0:41
So everything we talked about so far was equity, and that's
0:47
essentially selling shares in your company to raise money.
0:51
And so that's all of those VC examples.
0:54
The equity investor-- so when you sell equity, you're
0:56
essentially selling-- you're kind of making that person
0:59
who's buying the stock-- you know, an equity is the same
1:01
thing as stock-- you're making the person who's buying a
1:04
stock kind of a partner in the company.
1:06
So if the company-- let's say there's two situations-- if
1:09
the company goes bankrupt-- and I'll talk a lot more about
1:12
what bankruptcy even means-- but if the company goes
1:16
bankrupt, all the shareholders end up with nothing.
1:18
They end up with nil.
1:20
But if the company has a lot of upside, the stock gets a
1:25
lot of upside.
1:27
Because they're partners in it.
1:28
If this was a company, that start-up that we talked about,
1:31
if it turns into Amazon.com and becomes a billion-dollar
1:34
company, everyone is going to do really well.
1:35
Everyone's going to share in that upside.
1:38
But there's another way to raise money, and actually this
1:40
is probably something that's more familiar at
1:43
the household level.
1:44
I mean at the household level you never raise equity.
1:46
You never say, you know what-- well you can, but you're not
1:49
going to say hey, I need to buy a house, why don't I go to
1:52
my rich friend and offer to sell 10% of the stake in my
1:55
house to him and he'll be kind of a partner in my house.
1:59
That could happen but for the most part it doesn't.
2:01
Usually when you do something on a personal level you raise
2:04
money through debt.
2:09
And that's interesting.
2:10
So what's good about debt is it's-- so let's think about it
2:15
from the point of view of the person who's lending
2:18
the money to you.
2:20
Debt is just borrowing money.
2:26
I think all of us know what borrowing money is.
2:29
I go to my rich friend and I say hey, could I borrow $1 and
2:32
I'll give you $1.25 in a year?
2:34
And he says, OK, you're good for it.
2:36
But I'm essentially promising I'm going to give the money
2:38
back at some future date.
2:39
If I sell equity, I'm not promising anything.
2:42
I'm like hey, I got a great business, why don't you give
2:45
$1 and then you get a 20% cut of my business.
2:47
If my business does awesome, you get 20% of all of the
2:50
profits of my business.
2:51
If my business does horrible, well you took a risk, you get
2:54
nothing and I get nothing.
2:55
Debt says regardless of how my business does, if it does
2:59
awesome all you're going to get is the interest.
3:05
That's kind of the upside.
3:05
So the upside's limited, right?
3:07
If I borrow money at 9% interest, all that person's
3:11
going to get is 9%.
3:12
Even if my company becomes the next Google or Microsoft or
3:17
whatever else, that person's just going to
3:18
get 9% on their money.
3:20
While this person might have gotten a hundred times their
3:23
money because they made a bet.
3:24
On the other hand, this downside is much lower.
3:28
So limited downside.
3:30
Because they're going to get their money back at a
3:32
certain-- you know, there's a certain payment schedule.
3:35
And they're going to get their money back before the
3:38
stockholders-- so let's say in a situation where the
3:40
company's going into difficulty-- and we'll do a
3:43
whole playlist on bankruptcy-- the people who lend money to
3:47
the company will see their money before the stockholders
3:50
see anything.
3:51
So how does all of this come out from the balance sheet?
3:53
So let's say we have a public company.
3:57
If you wonder what a CFO at a company does, this is really
4:00
the main decision that they're always making.
4:02
Do we raise money-- well, how do we raise money if we need
4:05
it, and do we raise money from the equity markets or from the
4:07
debt markets?
4:08
So let's come up with a company again.
4:12
Let's say that that's its current assets.
4:14
Not current-- I don't want to say current assets, it's the
4:18
assets that it currently has.
4:19
Current assets means something different, and we'll talk
4:21
about that in the future.
4:23
But let's say, so that's its assets.
4:29
You know it might have some cash here.
4:33
We'll go into more detail.
4:34
We'll actually look at real company balance sheets and
4:37
decipher what all of the terms on the balance sheet mean.
4:40
But that's its assets for now.
4:41
And let's say right now all of its money it's raised so far
4:44
has been equity.
4:46
And let's say it's a publicly listed company.
4:48
It doesn't have to be.
4:50
Let's say that's all of its equity, and let's say it has,
4:59
I don't know, 10 million shares.
5:04
And the other interesting thing about when a company's
5:06
public-- remember, every time when a company was private and
5:08
it took an investor, when it took equity investors, they
5:11
had to sit and have a negotiation saying what is
5:13
this worth?
5:14
What are these assets worth?
5:16
But what's cool is, is when you have a publicly traded
5:18
company, these shares are traded on an exchange, right?
5:21
These shares are on, let's say it's on the
5:24
New York Stock Exchange.
5:27
So every day you could go to Yahoo!
5:29
Finance or wherever and you can look at a chart.
5:33
Let me draw a chart.
5:35
You can draw a chart.
5:41
And we've all seen stock charts, I think.
5:44
So let's say that this is this could have been its IPO date
5:46
or it could just be the start that we're looking at, and
5:48
let's say the stock IPO went up, and then the whole market
5:51
went down a little bit.
5:52
But the stock-- maybe it's there, right?
5:54
But on any given, really almost any given second,
5:57
there's a price that somebody traded that stock at and it
6:00
might not be the best price, but it is a price.
6:03
And we'll talk about why that happens, because you might
6:05
have 10 million shares, and if only, I don't know, 100 shares
6:09
get traded at any second, or let's say only 100 shares get
6:12
traded in the day, is that an indicative price?
6:13
Because that's not a huge percentage
6:15
of all of the shares.
6:16
But anyway, we'll talk more about what volume means
6:20
relative to the total float and all of that.
6:23
But let's say at this split second the company shares
6:26
traded at $15 a share.
6:29
This is $15, right, at this second in time.
6:32
This is like right now.
6:33
Traded at $15 a share, and you could look it up on your
6:36
Bloomberg terminal or whatever else.
6:38
So essentially the market is providing us a
6:41
value for this company.
6:43
The market is saying wow, the market is willing to trade the
6:46
share at $15.
6:47
There was a willing buyer and a willing seller at exactly
6:49
$15 a share.
6:51
So that means that the market at that moment is valuing this
6:54
company at $15 per share times 10 million shares.
6:57
So $15 per share times 10 million shares-- not
7:05
necessarily a dollar sign.
7:08
So the market is assigning a, 15 times 10 is 100.
7:13
$150 million market cap.
7:17
Market capitalization for the company.
7:22
And you could look on the kind of, I think it's the key
7:25
statistics tab on Yahoo!
7:26
Finance, and you'll see market capitalization for a company.
7:29
And it's just the number of shares times the
7:33
price of the shares.
7:34
This is essentially what the market's value
7:37
of the equity is.
7:38
The market is saying that this piece right here
7:40
is worth $150 million.
7:43
And since this piece is the same size as the assets, we
7:47
have nothing else on the right-hand side, the market's
7:49
essentially saying that the assets right now are worth
7:52
$150 million.
7:53
And these aren't always going to be equal.
7:55
We'll see probably in a few videos when you start raising
7:57
debt you have to do an extra calculation to figure out what
8:01
the asset value or-- and I'll throw out a new term here, the
8:03
enterprise value of the firm is.
8:06
The enterprise value's essentially the asset value
8:09
minus excess cash.
8:12
The cash the company really doesn't need to operate.
8:14
And we'll go into more detail of that.
8:16
But we'll just view it as the assets for now.
8:18
So if I'm the CFO of this company, and let's say we need
8:21
to raise another, I don't know, $15 million.
8:25
I have two options.
8:27
I could say OK, the company is trading at $15 per share, I
8:32
need to raise $15 million, so I could issue
8:36
another million shares.
8:38
It wouldn't be the initial public offering because I'm
8:40
already public.
8:41
It would be a follow-on offering, or sometimes it's
8:43
called a secondary offering.
8:44
Although the word secondary has kind of two connotations.
8:47
But it would be a follow-on offering where I would issue,
8:50
I'd go to the board, we would essentially create another
8:53
million shares, and then sell them into the market, and
8:56
hopefully people will buy it at $15 a share or probably a
8:59
little bit less because we're kind of flooding the market
9:01
with a ton of shares.
9:02
Maybe they buy it at $14 per share, and we
9:04
would raise $14 million.
9:08
And that would be a follow-on offering.
9:10
So we can always use the public markets as a way to
9:12
raise more money.
9:13
We didn't have to go to all this-- I mean, for the most
9:15
part we didn't have to do this huge valuation exercise and
9:17
negotiations and do all of this, hire banks and all that.
9:22
Although the banks will still collect fees.
9:24
We actually would have to hire banks to do this.
9:26
So that's one option.
9:27
Or the other option is we're an established company, we're
9:30
generating cash, we could make interest
9:32
payments if we want to.
9:33
We could go to a bank.
9:34
And actually there's a lot of different ways to do this.
9:36
But we could essentially borrow money.
9:38
And let's just say we do that.
9:39
Instead of doing this-- let's say we do both.
9:41
So let's say we did a $1 million follow-on offering,
9:43
that gave us $14 million.
9:47
And let's say we want another $2 million, but this time
9:50
instead of selling shares-- so right now how many
9:52
shares do we have?
9:52
We sold 1 million, we had 10 million, we
9:53
have 11 million shares.
9:57
Let's say, you know what, let's say as a CFO I feel like
10:00
our shares are going to move up a lot more.
10:02
So we don't like selling them at this low price.
10:05
And let's say interest rates are really low.
10:08
Instead we're going to borrow money.
10:10
That's essentially raising debt.
10:12
So let's say we borrow another $3 million because we need it.
10:18
So actually this would be debt, $3 million of debt, and
10:23
we would get $3 million of cash.
10:32
So now our assets are all of this stuff on
10:37
the left-hand side.
10:40
And what are our liabilities now?
10:41
Now, we didn't have liabilities before because
10:43
everything we had were equities.
10:44
But now we do.
10:45
Now we owe somebody $3 million right here.
10:49
And I'll talk more about all the different ways to kind of
10:51
borrow money.
10:52
But it's essentially, it could just literally be a bank loan.
10:55
They might have just gone to Bank of America and said hey,
10:57
we're a big company and we're good for the money, why don't
11:00
you lend us $3 million.
11:02
And maybe it would be $3 million at a low interest
11:06
rate, at maybe 6% per year.
11:08
And Bank of America feels good because you have a high--
11:11
we'll talk more about credit ratings and all of that-- but
11:14
they say oh, you have essentially a good company
11:16
credit score.
11:18
So we'll give it to you at a low interest rate.
11:19
So what happens in the future is, these assets are going to
11:22
generate, hopefully, some cash.
11:24
And before these guys see it-- let me do to it in the--
11:28
before these equity holders-- this is the equity holders
11:31
right now-- before the equity holders see anything, these
11:33
guys have to get paid their interest. And I'll show you
11:36
all of that on a line-by-line basis in an income statement.
11:39
Everything we've done so far has been a balance sheet.
11:42
But something interesting is happening now.
11:44
Now all of a sudden your assets, which is that side-- I
11:47
know I just keep writing over the same drawing-- your assets
11:50
are now larger than your equity.
11:53
I think now, and this is just kind of a review of the
11:55
balance sheet video, you see that the assets are equal to
12:02
your equity, which is this right here, your equity plus
12:09
your liabilities.
12:10
Your liabilities now are $3 million.
12:13
Plus liabilities.
12:14
So if you wanted to know what your assets are worth, because
12:17
your assets are equal to your equity.
12:21
So what's your market value of your equity?
12:25
Well, we figured that out already.
12:26
We have 11 million shares now.
12:28
And let's say the stock plummets to $10 a share for
12:32
some strange reason or for a not-strange reason.
12:35
So what's the market cap? $10 a share, 11 million shares, we
12:39
have a $110 million market cap.
12:41
We're doing a market value.
12:43
And we'll talk more about the difference between market and
12:44
book value.
12:45
But this is the market value of your equity.
12:47
And then what is your liabilities?
12:49
Well we owe $3 million, so plus 3 million.
12:55
So we could say that for the most part the market value of
12:58
our assets, the market thinks that this entire left-hand
13:01
side is going to be worth the value of our equity, the
13:07
market cap of the company, plus the amount of debt, which
13:10
is equal to $113 million.
13:14
So the value of these assets are $113 million, and that for
13:18
the most part is the enterprise
13:20
value of the company.
13:21
What is the company's assets worth?
13:24
And we'll talk-- there's a little bit of a tweak we'll do
13:26
in the future on enterprise value.
13:28
But that's essentially how you kind of can value what the
13:31
company's worth.
13:32
A lot of people when they do a market capitalization
13:35
calculation they say oh, that's what
13:36
the company's worth.
13:37
Well no, that's what the equity is worth.
13:39
Market cap is what the equity's worth.
13:41
If you want to know what the company's worth, you have to
13:43
take the market cap and then add the debt.
13:48
Another way-- well, I won't get too complicated because I
13:51
just realized I've run out of time again.
13:52
See you in the next video.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,yQtUyBrRBx4,
khan_video_pKvo0XWZtjo_4998,"If solid things are supposedly colder, why do I feel warmer when I'm lying down on the floor rather than in a pool?",Essay,"•
0:00
I think we're all reasonably familiar with the three states
0:03
of matter in our everyday world.
0:05
At very high temperatures you get a fourth.
0:07
But the three ones that we normally deal with are, things
0:10
could be a solid, a liquid, or it could be a gas.
0:22
And we have this general notion, and I think water is
0:25
the example that always comes to at least my mind.
0:29
Is that solid happens when things are
0:30
colder, relatively colder.
0:33
And then as you warm up, you go into a liquid state.
0:37
And as your warm up even more you go into a gaseous state.
0:40
So you go from colder to hotter.
0:44
And in the case of water, when you're a solid, you're ice.
0:51
When you're a liquid, some people would call ice water,
0:55
but let's call it liquid water.
0:58
I think we know what that is.
1:01
And then when it's in the gas state, you're essentially
1:04
vapor or steam.
1:12
So let's think a little bit about what, at least in the
1:14
case of water, and the analogy will extend to
1:17
other types of molecules.
1:19
But what is it about water that makes it solid, and when
1:22
it's colder, what allows it to be liquid.
1:24
And I'll be frank, liquids are kind of fascinating because
1:28
you can never nail them down, I guess is the
1:31
best way to view them.
1:32
Or a gas.
1:34
So let's just draw a water molecule.
1:39
So you have oxygen there.
1:42
You have some bonds to hydrogen.
1:47
And then you have two extra pairs of valence electrons in
1:50
the oxygen.
1:51
And a couple of videos ago, we said oxygen is a lot more
1:55
electronegative than the hydrogen.
1:58
It likes to hog the electrons.
2:00
So even though this shows that they're sharing
2:04
electrons here and here.
2:06
At both sides of those lines, you can kind of view that
2:08
hydrogen is contributing an electron and oxygen is
2:10
contributing an electron on both sides of that line.
2:13
But we know because of the electronegativity, or the
2:15
relative electronegativity of oxygen, that it's hogging
2:18
these electrons.
2:19
And so the electrons spend a lot more time around the
2:22
oxygen than they do around the hydrogen.
2:24
And what that results is that on the oxygen side of the
2:27
molecule, you end up with a partial negative charge.
2:32
And we talked about that a little bit.
2:33
And on the hydrogen side of the molecules, you end up with
2:35
a slightly positive charge.
2:44
Now, if these molecules have very little kinetic energy,
2:51
they're not moving around a whole lot, then the positive
2:56
sides of the hydrogens are very attracted to the negative
2:59
sides of oxygen in other molecules.
3:03
Let me draw some more molecules.
3:04
When we talk about the whole state of the whole matter, we
3:06
actually think about how the molecules are interacting with
3:10
each other.
3:10
Not just how the atoms are interacting with each other
3:13
within a molecule.
3:16
I just drew one oxygen, let me copy and paste that.
3:20
But I could do multiple oxygens.
3:22
And let's say that that hydrogen is going to want to
3:26
be near this oxygen.
3:28
Because this has partial negative charge, this has a
3:30
partial positive charge.
3:32
And then I could do another one right there.
3:37
And then maybe we'll have, and just to make the point clear,
3:40
you have two hydrogens here, maybe an oxygen
3:43
wants to hang out there.
3:45
So maybe you have an oxygen that wants to be here because
3:49
it's got its partial negative here.
3:52
And it's connected to two hydrogens right there that
3:55
have their partial positives.
3:57
But you can kind of see a lattice structure.
4:00
Let me draw these bonds, these polar bonds that start forming
4:05
between the particles.
4:08
These bonds, they're called polar bonds because the
4:10
molecules themselves are polar.
4:14
And you can see it forms this lattice structure.
4:16
And if each of these molecules don't have a
4:19
lot of kinetic energy.
4:21
Or we could say the average kinetic energy of this matter
4:26
is fairly low.
4:27
And what do we know is average kinetic energy?
4:29
Well, that's temperature.
4:30
Then this lattice structure will be solid.
4:33
These molecules will not move relative to each other.
4:37
I could draw a gazillion more, but I think you get the point
4:40
that we're forming this kind of fixed structure.
4:44
And while we're in the solid state, as we add kinetic
4:48
energy, as we add heat, what it does to molecules is, it
4:52
just makes them vibrate around a little bit.
4:57
If I was a cartoonist, they way you'd draw a vibration is
4:59
to put quotation marks there.
5:01
That's not very scientific.
5:03
But they would vibrate around, they would buzz around a
5:05
little bit.
5:06
I'm drawing arrows to show that they are vibrating.
5:08
It doesn't have to be just
5:09
left-right it could be up-down.
5:10
But as you add more and more heat in a solid, these
5:14
molecules are going to keep their structure.
5:16
So they're not going to move around relative to each other.
5:19
But they will convert that heat, and heat is just a form
5:23
of energy, into kinetic energy which is expressed as the
5:27
vibration of these molecules.
5:29
Now, if you make these molecules start to vibrate
5:33
enough, and if you put enough kinetic energy into these
5:35
molecules, what do you think is going to happen?
5:37
Well this guy is vibrating pretty hard, and he's
5:39
vibrating harder and harder as you add more and more heat.
5:42
This guy is doing the same thing.
5:43
At some point, these polar bonds that they have to each
5:46
other are going to start not being strong enough to contain
5:50
the vibrations.
5:52
And once that happens, the molecules-- let me draw a
5:57
couple more.
5:58
Once that happens, the molecules are going to start
6:01
moving past each other.
6:07
So now all of a sudden, the molecule will start shifting.
6:13
But they're still attracted.
6:14
Maybe this side is moving here, that's moving there.
6:17
You have other molecules moving around that way.
6:19
But they're still attracted to each other.
6:22
Even though we've gotten the kinetic energy to the point
6:25
that the vibrations can kind of break the bonds between the
6:31
polar sides of the molecules.
6:34
Our vibration, or our kinetic energy for each molecule,
6:38
still isn't strong enough to completely separate them.
6:40
They're starting to slide past each other.
6:43
And this is essentially what happens when you're in a
6:44
liquid state.
6:46
You have a lot of atoms that want be touching each other
6:49
but they're sliding.
6:50
They have enough kinetic energy to slide past each
6:53
other and break that solid lattice structure here.
6:57
And then if you add even more kinetic energy, even more
7:00
heat, at this point it's a solution now.
7:05
They're not even going to be able to stay together.
7:07
They're not going to be able to stay near each other.
7:08
If you add enough kinetic energy they're going to start
7:11
looking like this.
7:12
They're going to completely separate and then kind of
7:15
bounce around independently.
7:17
Especially independently if they're an ideal gas.
7:19
But in general, in gases, they're no longer touching
7:22
each other.
7:22
They might bump into each other.
7:25
But they have so much kinetic energy on their own that
7:28
they're all doing their own thing
7:29
and they're not touching.
7:31
I think that makes intuitive sense if you just think about
7:33
what a gas is.
7:36
For example, it's hard to see a gas.
7:37
Why is it hard to see a gas?
7:39
Because the molecules are much further apart.
7:41
So they're not acting on the light in the way that a liquid
7:46
or a solid would.
7:47
And if we keep making that extended further, a solid--
7:50
well, I probably shouldn't use the example with ice.
7:53
Because ice or water is one of the few situations where the
7:56
solid is less dense than the liquid.
7:58
That's why ice floats.
8:00
And that's why icebergs don't just all fall to the
8:02
bottom of the ocean.
8:03
And ponds don't completely freeze solid.
8:07
But you can imagine that, because a liquid is in most
8:11
cases other than water, less dense.
8:13
That's another reason why you can see through it a little
8:15
bit better.
8:15
Or it's not diffracting-- well I won't go into that too much,
8:18
than maybe even a solid.
8:20
But the gas is the most obvious.
8:21
And it is true with water.
8:23
The liquid form is definitely more dense than the gas form.
8:27
In the gas form, the molecules are going to jump around, not
8:31
touch each other.
8:32
And because of that, more light can
8:35
get through the substance.
8:37
Now the question is, how do we measure the amount of heat
8:40
that it takes to do this to water?
8:44
And to explain that, I'll actually draw a
8:47
phase change diagram.
8:49
Which is a fancy way of describing something fairly
8:53
straightforward.
8:54
Let me say that this is the amount of heat I'm adding.
8:57
And this is the temperature.
8:59
We'll talk about the states of matter in a second.
9:02
So heat is often denoted by q.
9:06
Sometimes people will talk about change in heat.
9:09
They'll use H, lowercase and uppercase H.
9:11
They'll put a delta in front of the H.
9:13
Delta just means change in.
9:15
And sometimes you'll hear the word enthalpy.
9:17
Let me write that.
9:18
Because I used to say what is enthalpy?
9:26
It sounds like empathy, but it's
9:29
quite a different concept.
9:30
At least, as far as my neural connections could make it.
9:33
But enthalpy is closely related to heat.
9:36
It's heat content.
9:45
For our purposes, when you hear someone say change in
9:49
enthalpy, you should really just be thinking
9:51
of change in heat.
9:52
I think this word was really just introduced to confuse
9:56
chemistry students and introduce a non-intuitive word
10:00
into their vocabulary.
10:02
The best way to think about it is heat content.
10:04
Change in enthalpy is really just change in heat.
10:07
And just remember, all of these things, whether we're
10:09
talking about heat, kinetic energy,
10:13
potential energy, enthalpy.
10:16
You'll hear them in different contexts, and you're like, I
10:18
thought I should be using heat and they're
10:19
talking about enthalpy.
10:21
These are all forms of energy.
10:23
And these are all measured in joules.
10:26
And they might be measured in other ways, but the
10:28
traditional way is in joules.
10:29
And energy is the ability to do work.
10:31
And what's the unit for work?
10:33
Well, it's joules.
10:34
Force times distance.
10:35
But anyway, that's a side-note.
10:37
But it's good to know this word enthalpy.
10:38
Especially in a chemistry context, because it's used all
10:40
the time and it can be very confusing and non-intuitive.
10:43
Because you're like, I don't know what enthalpy is in my
10:46
everyday life.
10:47
Just think of it as heat contact, because that's really
10:50
what it is.
10:50
But anyway, on this axis, I have heat.
10:55
So this is when I have very little heat and I'm
10:57
increasing my heat.
10:58
And this is temperature.
11:05
Now let's say at low temperatures I'm here and as I
11:09
add heat my temperature will go up.
11:12
Temperature is average kinetic energy.
11:14
Let's say I'm in the solid state here.
11:16
And I'll do the solid state in purple.
11:21
No I already was using purple.
11:23
I'll use magenta.
11:26
So as I add heat, my temperature will go up.
11:29
Heat is a form of energy.
11:31
And when I add it to these molecules, as I did in this
11:36
example, what did it do?
11:37
It made them vibrate more.
11:38
Or it made them have higher kinetic energy, or higher
11:41
average kinetic engery, and that's what temperature is a
11:43
measure of; average kinetic energy.
11:46
So as I add heat in the solid phase, my average kinetic
11:50
energy will go up.
11:51
And let me write this down.
11:52
This is in the solid phase, or the solid state of matter.
11:58
Now something very interesting happens.
12:01
Let's say this is water.
12:03
So what happens at zero degrees?
12:09
Which is also 273.15 Kelvin.
12:14
Let's say that's that line.
12:15
What happens to a solid?
12:18
Well, it turns into a liquid.
12:19
Ice melts.
12:20
Not all solids, we're talking in particular about
12:22
water, about H2O.
12:25
So this is ice in our example.
12:27
All solids aren't ice.
12:29
Although, you could think of a rock as solid magma.
12:33
Because that's what it is.
12:38
I could take that analogy a bunch of different ways.
12:41
But the interesting thing that happens at zero degrees.
12:49
Depending on what direction you're going, either the
12:51
freezing point of water or the melting point of ice,
12:53
something interesting happens.
12:55
As I add more heat, the temperature does not to go up.
13:00
As I add more heat, the temperature does not go up for
13:03
a little period.
13:05
Let me draw that.
13:07
For a little period, the temperature stays constant.
13:10
And then while the temperature is constant, it stays a solid.
13:14
We're still a solid.
13:16
And then, we finally turn into a liquid.
13:22
Let's say right there.
13:23
So we added a certain amount of heat and it
13:25
just stayed a solid.
13:26
But it got us to the point that the ice
13:28
turned into a liquid.
13:29
It was kind of melting the entire time.
13:31
That's the best way to think about it.
13:32
And then, once we keep adding more and more heat, then the
13:36
liquid warms up too.
13:42
Now, we get to, what temperature becomes
13:45
interesting again for water?
13:46
Well, obviously 100 degrees Celsius or 373 degrees Kelvin.
13:56
I'll do it in Celsius because that's what
13:57
we're familiar with.
13:59
What happens?
13:59
That's the temperature at which water will vaporize or
14:03
which water will boil.
14:05
But something happens.
14:07
And they're really getting kinetically active.
14:13
But just like when you went from solid to liquid, there's
14:16
a certain amount of energy that you have to contribute to
14:19
the system.
14:20
And actually, it's a good amount at this point.
14:23
Where the water is turning into vapor, but it's not
14:26
getting any hotter.
14:31
So we have to keep adding heat, but notice that the
14:34
temperature didn't go up.
14:35
We'll talk about it in a second what
14:37
was happening then.
14:38
And then finally, after that point, we're completely
14:43
vaporized, or we're completely steam.
14:46
Then we can start getting hot, the steam can then get hotter
14:48
as we add more and more heat to the system.
14:53
So the interesting question, I think it's intuitive, that as
14:55
you add heat here, our temperature is going to go up.
15:01
But the interesting thing is, what was going on here?
15:03
We were adding heat.
15:04
So over here we were turning our heat into kinetic energy.
15:07
Temperature is average kinetic energy.
15:10
But over here, what was our heat doing?
15:12
Well, our heat was was not adding kinetic
15:15
energy to the system.
15:16
The temperature was not increasing.
15:17
But the ice was going from ice to water.
15:20
So what was happening at that state, is that the kinetic
15:24
energy, the heat, was being used to essentially break
15:29
these bonds.
15:32
And essentially bring the molecules into a
15:34
higher energy state.
15:35
So you're saying, Sal, what does that mean,
15:37
higher energy state?
15:38
Well, if there wasn't all of this heat and all this kinetic
15:42
energy, these molecules want to be very
15:44
close to each other.
15:46
For example, I want to be close to the
15:49
surface of the earth.
15:50
When you put me in a plane you have put me in a
15:52
higher energy state.
15:53
I have a lot more potential energy.
15:56
I have the potential to fall towards the earth.
15:58
Likewise, when you move these molecules apart, and you go
16:02
from a solid to a liquid, they want to fall
16:05
towards each other.
16:06
But because they have so much kinetic energy, they never
16:08
quite are able to do it.
16:10
But their energy goes up.
16:12
Their potential energy is higher because they want to
16:14
fall towards each other.
16:15
By falling towards each other, in theory, they
16:18
could do some work.
16:21
So what's happening here is, when we're contributing heat--
16:26
and this amount of heat we're contributing, it's called the
16:32
heat of fusion.
16:36
Because it's the same amount of heat regardless how much
16:39
direction we go in.
16:40
When we go from solid to liquid, you view it as the
16:43
heat of melting.
16:45
It's the head that you need to put in to melt
16:48
the ice into liquid.
16:49
When you're going in this direction, it's the heat you
16:51
have to take out of the zero degree water to
16:55
turn it into ice.
16:58
So you're taking that potential energy and you're
17:01
bringing the molecules closer and closer to each other.
17:05
So the way to think about it is, right here this heat is
17:08
being converted to kinetic energy.
17:10
Then, when we're at this phase change from solid to liquid,
17:15
that heat is being used to add potential
17:16
energy into the system.
17:18
To pull the molecules apart, to give them
17:21
more potential energy.
17:22
If you pull me apart from the earth, you're giving me
17:25
potential energy.
17:26
Because gravity wants to pull me back to the earth.
17:29
And I could do work when I'm falling back to the earth.
17:32
A waterfall does work.
17:33
It can move a turbine.
17:35
You could have a bunch of falling Sals move
17:37
a turbine as well.
17:39
And then, once you are fully a liquid, then you just become a
17:42
warmer and warmer liquid.
17:43
Now the heat is, once again, being used for kinetic energy.
17:48
You're making the water molecules move past each other
17:51
faster, and faster, and faster.
17:53
To some point where they want to completely disassociate
17:57
from each other.
17:58
They want to not even slide past each other, just
18:00
completely jump away from each other.
18:03
And that's right here.
18:04
This is the heat of vaporization.
18:13
And the same idea is happening.
18:15
Before we were sliding next to each other, now we're pulling
18:17
apart altogether.
18:19
So they could definitely fall closer together.
18:22
And then once we've added this much heat, now we're just
18:27
heating up the steam.
18:28
We're just heating up the gaseous water.
18:30
And it's just getting hotter and hotter and hotter.
18:33
But the interesting thing there, and I mean at least the
18:35
interesting thing to me when I first learned this, whenever I
18:41
think of zero degrees water I'll say, oh it must be ice.
18:43
But that's not necessarily the case.
18:45
If you start with water and you make it colder and colder
18:48
and colder to zero degrees, you're essentially taking heat
18:52
out of the water.
18:53
You can have zero degree water and it hasn't
18:57
turned into ice yet.
18:58
And likewise, you could have 100 degree water that hasn't
19:01
turned into steam yeat.
19:03
You have to add more energy.
19:04
You can also have 100 degree steam.
19:05
You can also have zero degree water.
19:08
Anyway, hopefully that gives you a little bit of intuition
19:10
of what the different states of matter are.
19:12
And in the next problem, we'll talk about how much heat
19:15
exactly it does take to move along this line.
19:18
And maybe we can solve some problems on how much ice we
19:21
might need to make our drink cool.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,pKvo0XWZtjo,

Voiceover:Which of the following
0:01
can represent a vector?
0:03
A vector is something that
0:05
has both a magnitude and a direction.
0:09
Let's see which one of these could represent something
0:10
that has a magnitude and a direction.
0:12
The first choice right over here is the number 5.
0:16
5 could represent a magnitude,
0:19
you could say, essentially, how large something is.
0:21
That's all the information has.
0:23
It doesn't say 5 in a certain direction.
0:25
This one by itself would not be a
0:28
or it couldn't represent a vector.
0:30
You need to specify a direction as well.
0:32
The angle measure 5 degrees.
0:36
Well the angle measure 5 degrees
0:37
could represent a direction.
0:39
If you say it's 5 degrees.
0:40
Let's say that's the positive X axis
0:43
that's the positive Y axis.
0:45
If you said it's 5 degrees relative
0:47
to the positive X axis.
0:49
If you said something like this,
0:52
so if you had 5 degrees over there,
0:54
that would be specifying a direction,
0:56
but it's not giving us a magnitude.
0:58
It's not saying how far in that direction
1:00
or how large in that direction.
1:02
An angle measure of 5 degrees,
1:04
you're giving us a direction,
1:06
but no magnitude.
1:07
Let's just cross these out.
1:09
The point (5,5). Now this is interesting.
1:13
If we say that the point is the end point of a vector
1:17
that starts at the origin,
1:20
so lets draw that out.
1:22
That's the positive X axis, positive Y axis.
1:25
This is 1,2,3,4,5 in the horizontal direction.
1:31
1,2,3,4,5 in the positive vertical direction.
1:35
The .5,5 is going to be right over there.
1:40
If you said that this represents the head of a vector
1:46
who's tail is at the origin.
1:50
The vector would look something like this.
1:53
Now, you're giving both a magnitude and a direction.
1:56
What's the magnitude?
1:58
What's the distance between the origin
1:59
and this point, right over here.
2:01
You could solve using the Pythagorean theorem

This could specify a magnitude and a direction.
2:16
This could represent a vector.
2:19
The outcome of 5+5, obviously that's just 10.
2:23
That's just a number.
2:24
For the same reason, this first choice,
2:26
if I just have a number,
2:27
that could be a magnitude,
2:28
but we don't have a direction as well.

0:00
In the last video, we figured out what is the present value
0:04
of these three different payment timing choices.
0:08
If we had a 5% risk-free rate, and if these payments were
0:12
risk-free, instead of coming from -- you can almost view
0:15
them as some type of government program, where
0:17
they're asking you to choose which of these three payment
0:20
streams from the government do you want?
0:22
And so we'll use the same rate that the government would pay
0:25
you, if you lent them money.
0:28
And that's given by the treasury rate.
0:30
And in the first case we assumed a 5% treasury rate.
0:34
And if you watched the first present value video, I think
0:37
you understand why compounding going forward is the same
0:41
thing as discounting that rate by going backwards.
0:45
If you want to know how much $100 is a year from now, you
0:47
multiply that times one plus the interest rate, right?
0:54
So if it's 5%, you multiply that times 1.05.
0:57
If you're taking $110 and going a year back,
0:59
you divide by 1.05.
1:01
So it's just the same operation.
1:02
You're just going forward or back.
1:03
Forward is multiplication, backwards is division.
1:07
But anyway, the result that we got in the last video is that
1:11
the present value -- let me do this in a different color.
1:13
And I'll introduce my notation.
1:16
The present value, if we assume a 5% rate, no matter
1:22
how long-- how far away the money is given to you.
1:26
And you'll see what I mean because I'll change that
1:28
assumption in a second.
1:29
But if we assume that the risk-free rate is 5%, then the
1:34
present value of $100 today, well that was just $100.
1:39
$110 in two years, we got that by doing 110 divided by 1.05
1:48
squared, right?
1:49
You divide by 1.05 there, and then you divide by 1.05 again.
1:53
And then you get $99.77.
2:01
I don't want to run out of too much space.
2:02
I could have probably done this whole thing
2:03
a little bit bigger.
2:05
And then choice number three.
2:08
How did we get that?
2:08
Well, we said -- let me do that in a different color.
2:11
That was the present value of the $20 today, plus $50 in one
2:17
year, divided by that, discounted to the present day.
2:22
So divided by 1.05 plus $35 divided by 1.05 squared.
2:31
And we had gotten $99.36.
2:35
And that's what that should be worth to you today, if you
2:39
assume that these payments are risk-free, and you use a 5%
2:42
discount rate.
2:44
Fair enough.
2:45
And based on these calculations, choice number
2:48
one was the best, choice number two was second best,
2:50
choice number three was third best. Fair enough.
2:53
Now what happens -- after I pose the question, you might
2:57
want to think about it before I show you the answer -- what
2:59
happens if I don't assume a 5% discount rate?
3:02
What happens if I assume a 2% discount rate?
3:08
This is just my notation.
3:09
What is the present value of these if I assume a 2%
3:13
risk-free rate, or a 2% discount rate?
3:17
Well $100, I'm getting that today, so
3:19
that's still worth $100.
3:20
You could even do that as -- let me do that in a more
3:23
vibrant color -- as 100 divided by 1.02 to the 0
3:27
power, because we're getting it today.
3:29
But that's just 1.02 divided by 1, which is just $100.
3:33
$100 today.
3:33
What's the present value?
3:34
It's $100.
3:36
Now what's the $110 two years out going to be worth?
3:41
So this is interesting.
3:42
When the interest rate goes down, from 5% to 2%, I'm going
3:47
to be dividing by a smaller number.
3:49
1.02 squared is a smaller number than 1.05 squared.
3:54
So the present value of this payment should go up.
3:59
Interesting.
3:59
This is something to keep in mind for later, when we start
4:01
thinking about bonds.
4:03
When you lower the interest rate, the present value of
4:05
this future payment goes up.
4:07
And it just falls out of the math.
4:08
You're discounting by a smaller number.
4:11
Let's figure out what that is.
4:12
So if I take $110 and I divide it by 1.02 squared, right?
4:20
Discounted twice.
4:22
I get $105.72.
4:32
Oh, and how did I get that?
4:33
That was equal to -- I'm doing it in reverse here -- that was
4:35
equal to 110 divided by 1.02 squared.
4:41
And our intuition was correct.
4:43
Just by the interest rate going from 5% to 2%, the
4:47
present value of this payment two years out -- it's in year
4:51
three, but it's two years out.
4:53
Actually I should re-label this.
4:54
I should call this now, the present.
4:58
I should call this year one.
5:00
I was calling this year two, one year out.
5:03
But I think that makes it confusing.
5:04
I called this year two, so this is now.
5:06
So you could call this year zero.
5:09
This is year one.
5:10
And this is year two.
5:12
Anyway.
5:13
The present value of this is -- it increased by $6 just by
5:18
the discount rate going down by 3%.
5:22
Fascinating.
5:23
Now let's see what happens to choice number three.
5:25
Choice number three, the $20 today, the $20 now, well
5:28
that's just worth $20.
5:29
Its present value is 20 plus 50 divided by 1.02, plus the
5:38
35 divided by 1.02 squared.
5:43
Let's see what this adds up.
5:47
20 plus 50 divided by 1.02 plus 35
5:58
divided by 1.02 squared.
6:02
$102.66.
6:11
Now there's a couple of really interesting things.
6:13
And this is a really good time to kind of let it all sink in.
6:16
All of a sudden we lowered the interest rate.
6:18
And now choice number two is the best, followed by choice
6:22
number three, followed by choice number one.
6:25
So it almost -- choice number one was the best when we had a
6:28
5% discount rate.
6:29
Now at a 2% discount rate, choice number two is all of a
6:32
sudden the best.
6:33
And there's something else interesting here.
6:35
Choice number two improved by a lot more when we lowered the
6:38
interest rate, than choice number three did.
6:41
Its present value went from $99.77 to $105.70,
6:46
so it's almost $6.
6:47
While here it only improved by less than $3, right?
6:51
So why is that?
6:53
Well, when you lower the interest rate, the terms that
6:56
are using that discount rate the most, benefit the most. So
7:00
all of this payment was two years out, right?
7:03
So it benefited the most by decreasing the discount rate,
7:08
the 1.02 squared.
7:10
It changed this value the most.
7:12
These payments are spread out.
7:13
Only some of its payment is two years out.
7:15
Then some of its payment is one year out, and that's going
7:18
to benefit less.
7:19
And then some of its payment is today.
7:21
So it will benefit, because you are discounting some of
7:24
the cash payments.
7:25
But it's going to benefit by less.
7:28
Anyway, I'll leave you there in this video.
7:30
And in the next video, we're going to see what happens when
7:33
we have different discount rates for
7:36
different amounts of time.

0:00
In this video, I want to talk a little bit
0:02
about Newton's First Law of Motion.
0:06
And this is a translation from Newton's Principia from Latin
0:09
into English.
0:10
So the First Law, ""Every body persists
0:13
in a state of being at rest, or moving uniformly
0:20
straightforward, except insofar as it is compelled
0:24
to change its state by force impressed.""
0:27
So another way to rephrase what they're saying
0:30
is, that if there's something-- every body persists--
0:33
so everything will stay at rest, or
0:35
moving with a constant velocity, unless it
0:39
is compelled to change its state by force.
0:42
Unless it's acted on by a force, especially an unbalanced force.
0:45
and I'll explain that in a second.
0:47
So if I have something that's at rest, so completely at rest.
0:50
So I have-- and this is something
0:53
that we've seen before.
0:56
Let's say that I have a rock.
0:59
Let's say that I have a rock someplace
1:03
and it's laying on a field of grass,
1:08
I can keep observing that rock.
1:10
And it is unlikely to move, assuming
1:11
that nothing happens to it.
1:13
If there's no force applied to that rock,
1:15
that rock will just stay there.
1:17
So the first part is pretty obvious.
1:20
So, ""Every body persists in a state of being at rest""--
1:23
I'm not going to do the second part--
1:25
""except insofar as there's some force being applied to it.""
1:28
So clearly a rock will be at rest,
1:30
unless there's some force applied to it, unless someone
1:33
here tries to push it or roll it or do something to it.
1:37
What's less intuitive about the first law is the second part.
1:41
""Every body persists in,"" either, ""being in a state
1:44
of rest or moving uniformly straight forward,
1:48
except insofar as it is compelled
1:50
to change its state by force impressed.""
1:52
So this Newton's first law-- and I
1:55
think I should do a little aside here,
1:56
because, this right here is Newton.
2:00
And if this is Newton's first law,
2:01
why do I have this huge picture of this guy over here?
2:04
Well, the reason is is because Newton's first law is really
2:07
just a restatement of this guy's law of inertia.
2:10
And this guy, another titan of civilization
2:14
really, this is Galileo Galilei.
2:19
And he is the first person to formulate the law of inertia.
2:22
And Newton just rephrased it a little bit and packaged it
2:25
with his other laws.
2:26
But he did many, many, many other things.
2:28
So you really have to give Galileo
2:30
credit for Newton's first law.
2:32
So that's why I made him bigger than here.
2:34
But I was in the midst of a thought.
2:36
So we understand if something is at rest,
2:38
it's going to stay at rest, unless there's
2:39
some force that acts on it.
2:41
And in some definitions, you'll see
2:42
unless there's some unbalanced force.
2:44
And the reason why they say unbalanced
2:46
is, because you could have two forces that act on something
2:49
and they might balance out.
2:50
For example, I could push on this side of the rock
2:53
with a certain amount of force.
2:55
And if you push on this side of the rock
2:56
with the exact same amount of force, the rock won't move.
3:00
And the only way that it would move if there's a lot more
3:03
force on one side than on the other side,
3:05
so if you have an unbalanced force.
3:07
So if you have a ton of-- and maybe the rock
3:09
is a bad analogy.
3:10
Let's take ice, because ice is easier to move, or ice on ice.
3:14
So there's ice right here.
3:16
And then, I have another block of ice
3:17
sitting on top of that ice.
3:19
So once again, we're familiar with the idea,
3:21
if there's no force acting on it that ice won't move.
3:25
But what happens if I'm pushing on the ice
3:29
with a certain amount of force on that side,
3:31
and you're pushing on the ice on that side
3:32
with the same amount of force?
3:34
The ice will still not move.
3:36
So this right here, this would be a balanced force.
3:41
So the only way for the ice to change its condition, to change
3:47
its restful condition is if the force is unbalanced.
3:50
So if we add a little bit of force on this side,
3:53
so it more than compensates the force pushing it this way,
3:57
then you're going to see the ice block start to move,
4:00
start to really accelerate in that direction.
4:04
But I think this part is obvious.
4:05
This, you know, something that's at rest
4:07
will stay at rest, unless it's being acted on
4:09
by an unbalanced force.
4:11
What's less obvious is the idea that something
4:14
moving uniformly straightforward, which
4:16
is another way of saying something
4:18
having a constant velocity.
4:22
What he's saying is, is that something
4:24
that has a constant velocity will continue
4:26
to have that constant velocity indefinitely,
4:29
unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force.
4:33
And that's less intuitive.
4:34
Because everything in our human experience--
4:37
even if I were to push this block of ice,
4:41
eventually it'll stop.
4:42
It won't just keep going forever, even
4:44
assuming that this ice field is infinitely long, that ice
4:47
will eventually stop.
4:48
Or if I throw a tennis ball.
4:54
That tennis ball will eventually stop.
4:59
It'll eventually grind to a halt.
5:01
Or if I roll a bowling ball, or if I, anything.
5:04
We've never seen, at least in our human experience,
5:06
it looks like everything will eventually stop.
5:09
So this is a very unintuitive thing to say,
5:11
that something in motion will just
5:12
keep going in motion indefinitely.
5:14
Everything in human intuition says if you want something
5:17
to keep going in motion, you have to keep
5:19
putting more force, keep putting more energy into it
5:22
for it to keep going.
5:23
Your car won't go forever, unless you keep,
5:25
unless the engine keeps burning fuel to drive and consuming
5:29
energy.
5:30
So what are they talking about?
5:31
Well, in all of these examples-- and I
5:33
think this is actually a pretty brilliant insight from all
5:36
of these fellows is that-- all of these things
5:39
would have gone on forever.
5:41
The ball would keep going forever.
5:42
This ice block would be going on forever,
5:44
except for the fact that there are unbalanced
5:47
forces acting on them to stop them.
5:50
So in the case of ice, even though ice on ice
5:52
doesn't have a lot of friction, there
5:54
is some friction between these two.
5:56
And so you have, in this situation,
5:58
the force of friction is going to be
6:00
acting against the direction of the movement of the ice.
6:03
And friction really comes from, at an atomic level--
6:06
so if you have the actual water molecules in a lattice
6:10
structure in the ice cube, and then here are
6:12
the water molecules in a lattice structure on the ice,
6:17
on the actual kind of sea of ice that it's traveling on--
6:20
they do kind of bump and grind into each other.
6:22
Although they're both smooth, there are imperfections here.
6:25
They bump and grind.
6:26
They generate a little bit of heat.
6:28
And they'll, essentially, be working against the movement.
6:32
So there's a force of friction that's being applied to here.
6:34
And that's why it's stopping.
6:35
Not only a force of friction, you also
6:37
have some air resistance.
6:38
The ice block is going to be bumping
6:40
into all sorts of air particles.
6:42
It might not be noticeable at first,
6:44
but it's definitely going to keep it from going on forever.
6:47
Same thing with the ball being tossed to the air.
6:49
Obviously, at some point, it hits
6:51
the ground because of gravity.
6:52
So that's one force acting on it.
6:54
But even once it hits the ground,
6:55
it doesn't keep rolling forever, once again,
6:57
because of the friction, especially if there's grass
7:01
here.
7:02
The grass is going to stop it from going.
7:04
And even while it's in the air, it's going to slow down.
7:06
It's not going to have a constant velocity.
7:08
Because you have all of these air particles
7:10
that are going to bump into it and exert
7:15
force to slow it down.
7:17
So what was really brilliant about these guys
7:19
is that they could imagine a reality where
7:22
you didn't have gravity, where you did not
7:24
have air slowing things down.
7:27
And they could imagine that in that reality,
7:30
something would just keep persisting in its motion.
7:33
And the reason why Galileo, frankly, was probably good
7:36
at thinking about that is that he
7:37
studied the orbits of planets.
7:41
And he could, or at least he's probably
7:43
theorized that, hey, maybe there's no air out there.
7:45
And that maybe that's why these planets can just
7:47
keep going round and round in orbit.
7:49
And I should say their speed, because their direction is
7:54
changing, but their speed never slows down,
7:56
because there's nothing in the space
7:58
to actually slow down those planets.
8:01
So anyway, hopefully you found that as fascinating as I do.
8:04
Because on some level, it's super-duper obvious.
8:06
But on a whole other level, it's completely not obvious,
8:08
especially this moving uniformly straightforward.
8:10
And just to make the point clear,
8:12
if gravity disappeared, and you had no air,
8:16
and you threw a ball, that ball literally
8:18
would keep going in that direction
8:20
forever, unless some other unbalanced force acted
8:24
to stop it.
8:26
And another way to think about it-- and this
8:28
is an example that you might see in everyday life-- is,
8:32
if I'm in an airplane that's going at a completely
8:38
constant velocity and there's absolutely
8:40
no turbulence in the airplane.
8:42
So if I'm sitting in the airplane right over here.
8:45
And it's going at a constant velocity, completely smooth,
8:51
no turbulence.
8:52
There's really no way for me to tell whether that airplane is
8:55
moving without looking out the window.
8:57
Let's assume that there's no windows in that airplane.
8:59
It's going at a constant velocity.
9:01
And there's no turbulence.
9:02
And let's say, I can't hear anything.
9:06
So I can't even hear the engines.
9:07
There's no way for me to sense that the plane is moving.
9:10
Because from my frame of reference,
9:12
it looks completely identical to if I
9:15
was in that same plane that was resting on the ground.
9:18
And that's another way to think about it.
9:20
That it's actually very intuitive
9:22
that they're similar states, moving at a constant velocity
9:25
or being at rest.
9:27
And you really can't tell whether you
9:29
are one or the other.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,CQYELiTtUs8,
khan_video_i-NNWI8Ccas_47345,Why will the Hydrogen atoms be attracted towards the center of mass if they are being attracted by each other's gravitational pull?,Essay,"•
0:00
Let's imagine we have a huge cloud
0:02
of hydrogen atoms floating in space.
0:05
Huge, and when I say huge cloud, huge both in distance
0:08
and in mass.
0:09
If you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,
0:11
it would just be this really, really massive thing.
0:15
So you have this huge cloud.
0:16
Well, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually
0:20
attracted to each other.
0:21
It's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.
0:25
But it would slowly affect these atoms.
0:27
And they would slowly draw close to each other.
0:30
It would slowly condense.
0:31
They'd slowly move towards the center
0:34
of mass of all of the atoms.
0:37
They'd slowly move in.
0:39
So if we fast forward, this cloud's
0:42
going to get denser and denser.
0:46
And the hydrogen atoms are going to start
0:48
bumping into each other and rubbing up against each other
0:51
and interacting with each other.
0:53
And so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.
0:56
Now remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.
0:58
So the temperature is going up.
1:03
And it'll-- they'll keep condensing.
1:05
They'll just keep condensing and condensing
1:07
until something really interesting happens.
1:09
So let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here
1:12
in the center.
1:16
And there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.
1:19
It's really dense.
1:20
I could never draw the actual number of atoms here.
1:22
This is really to give you an idea.
1:24
There's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,
1:28
from everything that wants to get
1:29
to that center of mass of our entire cloud.
1:32
The temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.
1:38
And at that point, something neat happens.
1:40
And to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,
1:43
let's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.
1:46
A hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just
1:48
going to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.
1:49
So the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.
1:50
If you want to think about a hydrogen atom,
1:52
it also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.
1:57
And let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.
1:59
And obviously this distance isn't to scale.
2:02
This distance is also not to scale.
2:04
Atoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms
2:05
are actually much, much, much, much smaller
2:07
than the actual radius of an atom.
2:10
And so is the electron.
2:11
But anyway, this just gives you an idea.
2:13
So we know from the Coulomb forces,
2:14
from electromagnetic forces, that these two positively
2:17
charged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere
2:20
near each other.
2:22
But we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four
2:25
forces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,
2:28
that if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures
2:31
and huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close
2:35
enough to each other, then all of a sudden,
2:37
the strong force will overtake.
2:39
It's much stronger than the Coulomb force.
2:41
And then these two hydrogens will actually--
2:43
these nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?
2:48
Well, anyway, they would actually fuse together.
2:50
And so that is what actually happens
2:53
once this gets hot and dense enough.
2:57
You now have enough pressure and enough temperature
2:59
to overcome the Coulomb force and bring
3:02
these protons close enough to each other for fusion
3:05
to occur, for fusion ignition.
3:12
And the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.
3:14
It's not ignition.
3:15
It's not combustion in the traditional sense.
3:16
It's not like you're burning a carbon molecule
3:20
in the presence of oxygen.
3:22
It's not combustion.
3:23
It's ignition.
3:24
And the reason why it's called ignition
3:25
is because when two of these protons,
3:27
or two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus
3:32
has a slightly smaller mass.
3:35
And so in the first stage of this,
3:36
you actually have two protons under enough pressure--
3:42
obviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--
3:44
with enough pressure they get close enough.
3:46
And then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.
3:51
One of these guys degrades into a neutron.
3:56
And the resulting mass of the combined protons
3:59
is lower than the mass of each of the original.
4:01
By a little bit, but that little bit of mass
4:04
results in a lot of energy-- plus energy.
4:11
And this energy is why we call it ignition.
4:13
And so what this energy does is it provides
4:16
a little bit of outward pressure,
4:17
so that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.
4:21
So once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.
4:24
And then that energy provides outward pressure
4:26
to balance what is now a star.
4:30
So now we are at where we actually
4:32
have the ignition at the center.
4:35
We have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying
4:39
to get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.
4:43
Now, what is the hydrogen being fused into?
4:46
Well, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just
4:50
kind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens
4:54
in stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.
5:00
I have trouble spelling.
5:01
Which is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.
5:03
This is still hydrogen because it
5:04
has one proton and one neutron now.
5:07
It is not helium yet.
5:08
This does not have two-- it does not have two protons.
5:12
But then the deuterium keeps fusing.
5:14
And then we eventually end up with helium.
5:19
And we can even see that on the periodic table.
5:21
Oh, I lost my periodic table.
5:22
Well, I'll show you the next video.
5:23
But we know hydrogen in its atomic state
5:30
has an atomic number of 1.
5:32
And it also has a mass of 1.
5:34
It only has one nucleon in its nucleus.
5:38
But it's being fused.
5:39
It goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,
5:42
which is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.
5:46
And then that eventually gets fused--
5:48
and I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--
5:50
into helium.
5:51
And by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.
5:56
So it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,
5:58
in particular, that isotope of helium--
6:00
it has an atomic mass of 4.
6:03
And this process releases a ton of energy.
6:06
Because the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced
6:09
is slightly lower than four times the atomic mass
6:15
of each of the constituent hydrogens.
6:17
So all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it
6:21
needs super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--
6:24
keeps the star from collapsing.
6:28
And once a star is in this stage,
6:31
once it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen
6:35
in its core, where the pressure and the temperature
6:37
is the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.
6:41
This is now a main sequence star.
6:48
And that's actually where the sun is right now.
6:50
Now there's questions of, well, what if there just
6:53
wasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?
6:56
And there actually are things that
6:57
never get to quite that threshold
6:59
to fuse all the way into helium.
7:00
There are a few things that don't quite
7:02
make the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.
7:05
So they are generating some of their heat.
7:06
Or there are even smaller objects
7:08
that just get to the point there's
7:10
a huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually
7:13
occurring inside of the core.
7:15
And something like Jupiter would be an example.
7:17
And you could go several masses above Jupiter
7:20
where you get something like that.
7:21
So you have to reach a certain threshold
7:23
where the mass, where the pressure and the temperature
7:25
due to the heavy mass, get so large that you
7:27
start this fusion.
7:28
And-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,
7:31
the slower the fusion will occur.
7:33
But if you're super massive, the fusion
7:35
will occur really, really fast.
7:37
So that's the general idea of just how stars get formed
7:40
and why they don't collapse on themselves
7:43
and why they are these kind of balls
7:45
of fusion reactions existing in the universe.

0:00
At the beginning of the week, Stewart's checking account
0:03
had a balance of negative $15.08.
0:07
On Monday morning, he deposited a check for $426.90.
0:12
On Tuesday morning, he deposited another check for $100.
0:17
How much was in Stewart's checking account
0:19
after the second deposit, so after both of these deposits
0:23
right over here.
0:25
So he starts off with a negative balance.
0:27
So a negative balance means that he's
0:28
overdrawn his checking account.
0:30
He actually owes the bank money now.
0:32
Luckily, he's now going to put some money in his bank account.
0:35
So he'll actually have a positive balance
0:37
in his checking account.
0:38
So he's starts off with the negative $15.08.
0:43
And then to that, he adds $426.90.
0:50
And then he adds another $100.
0:55
So he started off with negative $15.08.
0:59
And then to that, he adds $426.90 and $100.
1:04
So that's $526.90.
1:09
And so how much is going to have in his bank account?
1:11
He started owing $15.08, and then he's going to add $526.90.
1:18
So one way to visualize it is, if you think
1:21
about it on a number line, if this is 0 right over here,
1:27
he's going to start off at negative $15.08.
1:30
But then he's going to add $526.
1:35
So this right over here, this is $15.08 to the left.
1:40
That's how much he owes.
1:42
And to that, he's going to add $526.
1:45
So I'm not drawing this to scale.
1:47
But to that, he is going to add $526.90.
1:53
So the amount that he's going to be in the positive is going
1:56
to be $526.90 minus the $15.08.
2:01
It's essentially going to be this length right over here.
2:07
That's how much he's going to be in the positive.
2:09
And that's going to be $526.90 minus $15.08.
2:16
So that's going to be, and we can even just rewrite this
2:20
so it actually looks exactly like that.
2:22
That's exactly the same thing as $526.90 minus--
2:29
adding a negative is the same thing as subtracting
2:31
a positive-- minus $15.08.
2:34
And this is-- I will do this in another color--
2:37
$526.90 minus $15.08.
2:44
Let's see, 0 is less than 8.
2:46
Let's make that a 10 and borrow from this 9.
2:49
So that becomes an 8, or I guess you could say we're regrouping.
2:51
Now, everything up here is larger than everything there.
2:54
So 10 minus 8 is 2.
2:56
8 minus 0 is 8.
2:58
We have our decimal.
2:59
6 minus 5 is 1.
3:01
2 minus 1 is 1.

0:00
What I want to do is give you a broad overview of all of the
0:02
wars that France was in at this time.
0:05
And then talk about in a little bit more detail exactly
0:08
what Napoleon was up to.
0:09
And his role in either beginning or ending many of
0:13
these wars.
0:14
So you might remember from 1792 to 1797, you had your war
0:22
of the First Coalition.
0:27
And the players there were Prussia,
0:33
Austria, and Great Britain.
0:37
I'll just write Britain for short.
0:41
And this was essentially started by the French.
0:43
You might remember, King Louis XVI was alive then.
0:46
He supported the war, because he thought that they would
0:49
lose and maybe reinstate him.
0:51
Or that it would make him popular.
0:53
The revolutionaries liked the war because they wanted to
0:55
spread the Revolution.
0:57
And you might remember it ended at the Treaty of Campo
1:00
Formio in 1797, due mainly to Napoleon's victories in Italy.
1:14
At that time, he was in charge of the Italian campaign.
1:17
And the government of France at that
1:20
time was the Directory.
1:22
In power to a large degree because of Napoleon's ability
1:26
to defend them.
1:27
Then from 1798-- let me do this in a different color--
1:33
from 1798 to 1802, you have the Second Coalition.
1:42
Now you might immediately see, Napoleon took power
1:44
at the end of 1799.
1:46
So this war spanned some of the Directory being in control
1:50
and some of Napoleon as First Consul being in control.
1:55
And here the players-- once again you have Austria and
2:01
Great Britain-- they tend to be always at war with France
2:05
at this period, especially Great Britain.
2:07
And instead of Prussia, you have Russia.
2:10
And actually, just to help you visualize what the Austrian
2:14
Empire looked like at this time-- and the Prussian
2:15
Empire, this map doesn't do it justice.
2:18
Let me go down to this map.
2:21
That's in 1810.
2:22
Let me go a little bit earlier here.
2:25
This is in 1805.
2:27
And I'll draw the boundaries a little bit
2:28
bolder than they did.
2:30
So this is France.
2:32
These are the boundaries of France.
2:35
Actually, it was able to take some territory
2:39
in what is now Italy.
2:44
I could do the whole boundary if you like, but I think you
2:47
get the idea.
2:48
But the one empire that existed then that doesn't
2:51
exist in its current form, was Prussia.
2:53
Doesn't even exist at all.
2:54
There is no Prussian Empire, or Prussian nation, or the
2:57
country of Prussia anymore.
3:00
You can see there it had some overlap with Germany, some
3:03
overlap with Poland, some other countries, won't go into
3:06
detail there.
3:06
Then you have the Austrian Empire.
3:12
Austrian Empire is right over there.
3:16
As you can see, it encompasses much more than just the modern
3:22
nation or country of Austria.
3:24
Then you have the Russian Empire, which, give or take,
3:27
looks not too different than Russia today.
3:30
But the big difference between the world-- there's many
3:33
differences-- between the world now and the world then
3:36
was that there was no nation of Germany.
3:39
You had a bunch of people speaking German, but they were
3:42
divided into a bunch of small little states.
3:44
This map doesn't show it.
3:45
Some of them were under Austrian control, some of them
3:47
were under Prussian control.
3:49
And this loose confederation of German kingdoms and states,
3:54
this was called the Holy Roman Empire.
3:57
Let me write that down.
4:04
And as Voltaire famously said, they were neither holy, nor
4:08
Roman-- they didn't speak Latin, they weren't Italian,
4:10
they were German.
4:11
It wasn't holy, this wasn't controlled
4:14
by a religious figure.
4:16
And it wasn't an empire, it wasn't a tightly-controlled
4:19
state that was kind of expanding its boundaries.
4:21
It was just a loose confederation of kingdoms.
4:23
So that gives you a visualization of what the
4:25
world looked like right then.
4:28
So with that in mind, let me go back to my overview.
4:35
Right there.
4:36
And then the Second Coalition, in 1801 you had
4:45
the Treaty of Luneville.
4:48
Once again, this was a defeat of the Austrians, mainly due
4:55
to the military capabilities.
4:56
Napoleon was now in charge of France.
4:59
But he led once again, an Italian
5:01
campaign against the Austrians.
5:06
This is his victory in Marengo right there.
5:09
I'll go into a little more detail on that.
5:10
And that essentially declared victory on Austria, allowed
5:13
Napoleon to take more territory
5:18
along the Italian peninsula.
5:20
You can see it right there.
5:24
And then later he had the Treaty of Amiens with the
5:29
British in 1802.
5:31
And that really ended the coalition.
5:33
I guess you could say the coalition ended in 1801,
5:35
because Austria was out of it.
5:36
Russia was kind of just passively observing.
5:38
They participated.
5:39
But they didn't really give or take or lose anything.
5:42
And then I could say at this point the United Kingdom,
5:47
essentially I guess the best explanation of why that it was
5:50
war fatigue.
5:51
But we'll see that they weren't tired for long.
5:53
Because then in May of 1803, you have the beginning of your
5:59
Third Coalition .
6:00
And then I'll go to a little bit more detail about this.
6:03
The Third Coalition, Britain declares war on what we could
6:07
call the French Empire.
6:09
And this isn't going to end until 1805.
6:12
So you can see, Great Britain is essentially at war almost
6:17
continuously.
6:19
There's a few gaps give or take.
6:20
But there's always this tension.
6:22
This is the Third Coalition.
6:27
And once again, I could write the United Kingdom if you
6:31
like, because they actually now are the United Kingdom of
6:34
Great Britain and Ireland.
6:37
You have the United Kingdom in there, we
6:38
have Russia in there.
6:42
And once again, we have Austria.
6:43
And there were other players.
6:45
There was Portugal.
6:45
But these were the prime players.
6:48
And we'll see in this video that this, the war of the
6:52
Third Coalition, really ended with Napoleon being the
6:56
dominant power in Europe.
6:58
And ended with him essentially thinking that he is
7:01
unstoppable.
7:02
So I'll do a little bit more detail on that.
7:04
This resulted in 1805, with the then Emperor Napoleon.
7:09
And we'll talk about how he became emperor.
7:11
But in 1805, Napoleon-- maybe I should say 1806, because
7:16
this ended at the end of 1805-- Napoleon views himself
7:21
as unstoppable, as invincible.
7:27
He got some good victories that fed his
7:30
already large ego.
7:32
So with this as an overview, let's review a little bit of
7:36
the life of Napoleon and the roles that he directly played
7:39
in pretty much all of these conflicts.
7:43
So the first time we heard about Napoleon was in 1793.
7:47
And I'll just draw it right here.
7:48
You're might remember, there were all of these Royalist
7:51
insurrections going on against the revolutionary government.
7:54
And they had this bright artillery captain in Toulon
7:58
who put down an uprising there in 1793.
8:01
He got some, I guess you could say, France-wide, or
8:06
nationwide fame from doing that.
8:09
Then in 1795, you might remember, the Directory was
8:14
trying to get formed in Paris.
8:16
So this is 1793.
8:19
Then in 1795-- let me do a better color than that.
8:24
That's hard to read.
8:26
In 1795, he defended the Tuileries by essentially
8:31
sending out that grapeshot and mowing down people to keep the
8:36
Royalists from taking out the revolutionary government.
8:39
So once again, hugely, hugely popular.
8:44
So all of that was occurring during the war
8:46
of the First Coalition.
8:48
And then Napoleon was made the general in charge of the
8:53
Italian campaign.
8:54
And in 1797, he was essentially able to end the
9:00
war of the First Coalition in a victorious way for France by
9:04
defeating Austria and Italy.
9:05
And that ended the First Coalition
9:07
with the Campo Formio.
9:08
This was Napoleon.
9:15
Then, you might remember, OK, he's this hugely popular guy.
9:19
He actually started publishing some newspapers.
9:22
And he actually sent some military generals to put down
9:25
further counter revolutions on the part of the Royalists.
9:29
So he became even more and more popular.
9:32
And the Directory was a little bit afraid
9:34
of him at this point.
9:35
So they said, hey why don't you go do whatever you want.
9:37
And that's when Napoleon left from Toulon
9:40
and he went to Egypt.
9:43
He went to Egypt with his visions of grandeur, where he
9:47
did all of the damage down there.
9:49
And killed and won multiple wars against the Ottomans in
9:55
both Egypt and Syria.
9:56
But unfortunately for him, his good friend Horatio Nelson
10:01
destroyed his whole fleet in the Battle of the Nile.
10:04
Horatio-- let me draw that in a darker color.
10:08
So that is Horatio Nelson destroyed his
10:13
entire fleet there.
10:14
So they were stranded.
10:15
In 1799, Napoleon was essentially able to abandon
10:21
all of his troops and then come back to
10:23
France on his own.
10:25
So this is in 1799, Napoleon makes his way back to France.
10:34
And then we saw in the last video, he takes power with two
10:37
of the directors as the three consuls of France.
10:41
But in short order, he is able to declare himself as First
10:45
Consul in 1799.
10:48
This is hard to read.
11:00
And is essentially the dictator, or the authoritarian
11:05
ruler, of France.
11:07
But all of while this was happening, remember, this was
11:09
all during this war of the Second Coalition.
11:12
In 1798, he wasn't much help in that war, he was out in
11:16
Egypt doing all of these silly things.
11:18
They were at war with Britain, that's why Horatio Nelson went
11:21
and destroyed his fleet.
11:24
But even after he takes power at the end of 1799 or early
11:28
1800, they're still at war.
11:31
So Napoleon, he decides to take charge.
11:34
So he leads the troops across the Alps into Italy.
11:40
And once again, this pattern is emerging.
11:44
And this one actually wasn't very clear in the beginning
11:46
that it was going to go his way.
11:47
The Italian campaign, it started very badly.
11:50
But eventually, he was able to win against, once again, the
11:53
Austrians at the Battle of Marengo and Hohenlinden.
11:57
I know I'm probably not saying all of these well.
12:00
But once again, through Napoleon directly leading the
12:04
troops, he was able to end the war of the Second Coalition.
12:08
And then the United Kingdom, or Great Britain, however you
12:11
want to call it-- many times when people use the word Great
12:17
Britain it's referring to the entire United Kingdom of Great
12:21
Britain and Ireland.
12:22
If you wanted to be formal, Great Britain refers just to
12:24
the island of Great Britain that has England and Scotland
12:27
and Wales on it, while this is Ireland.
12:30
But I don't feel like keep repeatedly saying United
12:33
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which was now united
12:37
in the early 1800s.
12:38
I'll just keep saying Great Britain.
12:41
But there was just fatigue.
12:42
So the war essentially ended with Great Britain as well.
12:46
This is, as we said before, this was the Treaty of Amiens.
12:51
But very, very, very, short-lived peace.
12:55
Because in 1803, with Napoleon still in power, the Third
13:02
Coalition formed.
13:03
And in the next video, we're going to see exactly how
13:06
Napoleon was able to once again be victorious over these
13:11
powers to become essentially, in his mind, invincible.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,OzyH-1p9nAg,

0:04
When Leonardo is emerging on his own
0:06
as a artist in Florence in the late 1470's, Florence,
0:10
at that time, was full of very important, successful artists.
0:14
Not only is their Verrocchio, but you also people
0:17
like Botticelli, Filipino Lippi and the Pollaiuolo brothers.
0:21
And so Leonardo decides to try his luck elsewhere,
0:24
outside of Florence.
0:25
And he writes a letter to the Duke of Milan.
0:28
And in the job letter, Leonardo states all of the skills
0:32
that he has.
0:32
He's trying to get hired.
0:33
And he's essentially trying to sell himself
0:35
to the Duke of Milan.
0:36
And what's very interesting about this letter, which
0:38
actually survives, most of the letter
0:41
is a list of Leonardo's skills that have absolutely nothing
0:43
to do with painting or sculpture.
0:46
The things that Leonardo says he can do
0:48
include building forts, inventing new weapons
0:51
and so on.
0:52
And then at the very end of the letter
0:53
he says, also ""I can execute sculpture
0:56
in marble, bronze, or clay, and also painting.""
0:59
We can think of Leonardo as a great painter,
1:01
and, indeed, that's what he was.
1:02
But when we read this letter from Leonardo,
1:04
he does not prioritize painting.
1:06
And if anything, it comes last in the long list of things
1:09
that he can do.
1:10
For instance, he could invent new weapons systems.
1:13
And so here's a crossbow machine where
1:15
you see men climbing on the wheel and the crossbow
1:18
would be shooting arrows out.
1:20
He's interested in saying he can design weapons of war,
1:22
because that's what he thinks the Duke of Milan
1:24
is going to want.
1:25
When an artist would be a court artist,
1:26
when they will be working for something like a duke,
1:28
they were responsible for many, many things.
1:30
It was not just making paintings and sculptures.
1:32
They had to design weapons.
1:33
And here's another one.
1:35
It's almost like a tank that slices people in half.
1:37
He tells other things that he can
1:39
do for the duke, including irrigation things.
1:41
This is a machine that is designed
1:43
to make water go uphill.
1:45
He also says he can draw maps for military purposes,
1:49
but also for agricultural purposes.
1:50
And this one is from a little bit later.
1:52
But it shows the same basic idea.
1:54
This is of a valley in Tuscany.
1:56
This is the way that an artist needed to sell himself
1:59
when he is looking for a job in late 15th century Italy.
2:02
Now one other thing that Leonardo talks about
2:04
in his letter was the idea of making an equestrian monument
2:07
for the duke's illustrious father, Francesco Sforza.
2:11
This was a project that had actually been, at first, given
2:14
to one of the Pollaiuolo brothers.
2:17
And here we see the Pollaiuolo design
2:19
for the Sforza Equestrian Monument.
2:22
And this was to be, probably, made
2:24
out of bronze, although it's not entirely certain.
2:26
And this project was never completed by the Pollaiuolo.
2:29
And so when Leonardo was writing his letter
2:31
he says specifically, I can carry out
2:33
this project, because he knows that this
2:35
is a priority of the duke.
2:36
And what it illustrates is that a work of art
2:39
wasn't necessarily linked exclusively
2:41
to the artist who thought it up.
2:42
But that it existed as an idea, as a project for a patron.
2:47
And that various, different artists
2:49
could claim to execute the project,
2:51
or say that they wanted to finish it.
2:53
And so here we see Pollaiuolo's drawing.
2:55
And then Leonardo's early drawing for the same project,
2:57
is this.
2:58
And you can see that, basically, it
2:59
is the same design that Pollaiuolo
3:02
had, but in a slightly more Leonardo,
3:05
more energetic kind of style.

So not only can a magnetic field exert some force on a
0:06
moving charge, we're now going to learn that a moving charge
0:09
or a current can actually create a magnetic field.
0:12
So there is some type of symmetry here.
0:15
And as we'll learn later when we learn our calculus and we
0:18
do this in a slightly more rigorous way, we'll see that
0:25
magnetic fields and electric fields are actually two sides
0:29
of the same coin, of electromagnetic fields.
0:32
But anyway, we won't worry about that now.
0:33
And I think it's enough to ponder right now that a
0:36
current can actually induce a magnetic field.
0:39
And actually, just a moving electron
0:40
creates a magnetic field.
0:42
And it does it in a surface of a sphere-- I won't go into all
0:45
that right now.
0:45
Because the math gets a little bit fancy there.
0:47
But what you might encounter in your standard high school
0:50
physics class-- that's not getting deeply into vector
0:52
calculus-- is that if you just have a wire--
0:57
let me draw a wire.
0:58
That's my wire.
1:00
And it's carrying some current I, it turns out that this wire
1:10
will generate a magnetic field.
1:12
And the shape of that magnetic field is going to be
1:14
co-centric circles around this wire.
1:19
Let me see if I can draw that.
1:22
So here I'll draw it just like how I do when I try to do
1:25
rotations of solids in the calculus video.
1:29
So the magnetic field would go behind and in front and it
1:34
goes like that.
1:37
Or another way you can think about it is if-- let's go down
1:40
here-- is on the left side of this wire.
1:42
If you say that the wire's in the plane of this video, the
1:45
magnetic field is popping out of your screen.
1:52
And on this side, on the right side, the magnetic field is
1:55
popping into the screen.
1:57
It's going into the screen.
2:00
And you could imagine that, right?
2:01
You could imagine if, on this drawing up here, you could say
2:04
this is where it intersects the screen.
2:06
All of this is kind of behind the screen.
2:09
And all of this is in front of the screen.
2:11
And this is where it's popping out.
2:13
And this is where it's popping into the screen.
2:15
Hopefully that makes a little bit of sense.
2:16
And how did I know that it's rotating this way?
2:20
Well, it actually does come out of the cross product when
2:22
you do it with a regular charge and all of that.
2:24
But we're not going to go into that right now.
2:26
And so there's a different right hand rule
2:28
that you can use.
2:29
And it's literally you hold this wire, or you imagine
2:34
holding this wire, with your right hand with your thumb
2:37
going in the direction of the current.
2:39
And if you hold this wire with your thumb going in the
2:42
direction of the current, your fingers are going to go in the
2:44
direction of the magnetic field.
2:47
So let me see if I can draw that.
2:51
I will draw it in blue.
2:52
So if this is my thumb, my thumb is going along the top
2:58
of the wire.
3:00
And then my hand is curling around the wire.
3:06
Those are my knuckles.
3:06
Those are the veins on my hand.
3:09
This is my nail.
3:12
So as you can see, if I was holding that same wire-- let
3:16
me draw the wire.
3:17
So if I was holding that same wire, we see that my thumb is
3:21
going in the direction of the current.
3:22
So this is a slightly new thing to memorize.
3:25
And what is the magnetic field doing?
3:27
Well, it's going in the direction of my fingers.
3:30
My fingers are popping out on this side of the wire.
3:33
They're coming out on this side of the wire.
3:35
And they're going in, or at least my hand is
3:37
going in, on that side.
3:39
It's going into the screen.
3:42
Hopefully that makes sense.
3:44
Now, how can we quantify?
3:46
Well, before we quantify, let's get a little bit more of
3:48
the intuition of what's happening.
3:49
It turns out that the closer you get to the wire, the
3:52
stronger the magnetic field, and the further you get out,
3:56
the weaker the magnetic field.
3:57
And that kind of makes sense if you imagine the magnetic
4:00
field spreading out.
4:04
I don't want to go into too sophisticated analogies.
4:06
But if you imagine the magnetic field spreading out,
4:08
and as it goes further and further out it kind of gets
4:10
distributed over a wider and wider circumference.
4:12
And actually the formula I'm going to give you kind of has
4:15
a taste for that.
4:16
So the formula for the magnetic field-- and it really
4:20
is defined with a cross product and things like that,
4:23
but for our purposes we won't worry about that.
4:25
You'll just have to know that this is the shape if the
4:29
current is going in that direction.
4:30
And, of course, if the current was going downwards then the
4:33
magnetic field would just reverse directions.
4:35
But it would still be in co-centric
4:36
circles around the wire.
4:38
But anyway, what is the magnitude of that field?
4:42
The magnitude of that magnetic field is equal to mu-- which
4:49
is a Greek letter, which I will explain in a second--
4:52
times the current divided by 2 pi r.
4:58
So this has a little bit of a feel for what
5:00
I was saying before.
5:01
That the further you go out-- where r is how far you are
5:04
from the wire-- the further you go out, if r gets bigger,
5:09
the magnitude of the magnetic field is going to get weaker.
5:12
And this 2 pi r, that looks a lot like the
5:14
circumference of a circle.
5:16
So that gives you a taste for it.
5:17
I know I haven't proved anything rigorously.
5:20
But it at least gives you a sense of, look there's a
5:22
little formula for
5:23
circumference of a circle here.
5:24
And that kind of makes sense, right?
5:25
Because the magnetic field at that point
5:27
is kind of a circle.
5:29
The magnitude is equal at an equal radius around that wire.
5:33
Now what is this mu, this thing that looks like a u?
5:36
Well, that's the permeability of the material
5:39
that the wire's in.
5:40
So the magnetic field is actually going to have a
5:41
different strength depending on whether this wire is going
5:44
through rubber, whether it's going through a vacuum, or
5:48
air, or metal, or water.
5:50
And for the purposes of your high school physics class, we
5:54
assume that it's going through air normally.
5:56
And the value for air is pretty close to
6:01
the value for a vacuum.
6:03
And it's called the permeability of a vacuum.
6:05
And I forget what that value is.
6:07
I could look it up.
6:08
But it actually turns out that your
6:09
calculator has that value.
6:11
So let's do a problem, just to put some
6:12
numbers to the formula.
6:14
So let's say I had this current and it is-- I don't
6:19
know, the current is equal to-- I'm going
6:22
to make up a number.
6:22
2 amperes.
6:25
And let's say that I just pick a point right here that is--
6:33
let's say that that's 3 meters away
6:36
from the wire in question.
6:37
So my question to you is what is the magnitude in the
6:39
direction of the magnetic field right there?
6:43
Well, the magnitude is easy.
6:45
We just substitute in this equation.
6:46
So the magnitude of the magnetic field at this point
6:50
is equal to-- and we assume that the wire's going through
6:53
air or a vacuum-- the permeability of free space--
6:57
that's just a constant, though it looks fancy-- times the
6:59
current times 2 amperes divided by 2 pi r.
7:04
What's r?
7:05
It's 3 meters.
7:07
So 2 pi times 3.
7:09
So it equals the permeability of free space.
7:13
So let's see.
7:13
The 2 and the 2 cancel out over 3 pi.
7:16
So how do we calculate that?
7:18
Well, we get out our trusty TI-85 calculator.
7:24
And I think you'll be maybe pleasantly surprised or
7:28
shocked to realize that-- I deleted everything just so you
7:31
can see how I get there-- that it actually has the
7:34
permeability of free space stored in it.
7:36
So what you do is you go to second and you press constant,
7:39
which is the 4 button.
7:41
It's in the built-in constants.
7:43
Let's see, it's not one of those.
7:44
You press more.
7:46
It's not one of those, press more.
7:48
Oh look at that.
7:49
Mu not.
7:50
The permeability of free space.
7:52
That's what I need.
7:54
And I have to divide it by 3 pi.
7:57
Divide it by 3-- and then where is pi?
8:00
There it is.
8:01
It's over the power sign.
8:03
Divided by 3 pi.
8:05
It equals 1.3 times 10 to the negative seventh.
8:10
It's going to be teslas.
8:11
The magnetic field is going to be equal to 1.3 times 10 to
8:17
the minus seventh teslas.
8:20
So it's a fairly weak magnetic field.
8:23
And that's why you don't have metal objects being thrown
8:27
around by the wires behind your television set.
8:31
But anyway, hopefully that gives you a little bit-- and
8:33
just so you know how it all fits together.
8:36
We're saying that these moving charges, not only can they be
8:40
affected by a magnetic field, not only can a current be
8:42
affected by a magnetic field or just a moving charge, it
8:45
actually creates them.
8:47
And that kind of creates a little bit of symmetry in your
8:49
head, hopefully.
8:50
Because that was also true of electric field.
8:52
A charge, a stationary charge, is obviously pulled or pushed
8:57
by a static electric field.
8:58
And it also creates its own static electric field.
9:01
So it's always in the back of your mind.
9:03
Because if you keep studying physics, you're going to
9:05
actually prove to yourself that electric and magnetic
9:09
fields are two sides of the same coin.
9:11
And it just looks like a magnetic field when you're in
9:14
a different frame of reference, When something is
9:15
whizzing past you.
9:17
While if you were whizzing along with it, then that thing
9:19
would look static.
9:20
And then it might look a little bit more like an
9:21
electric field.
9:22
But anyway, I'll leave you there now.
9:25
And in the next video I will show you what happens when we
9:29
have two wires carrying current
9:33
parallel to each other.
9:34
And you might guess that they might actually attract or
9:37
repel each other.
9:38

Lets learn a little bit about how just a plain vanilla bank works.
0:05
So lets say that I'm an entrepreneur and I see a problem out there in the world
0:09
you have all of these hard working people
0:11
whatever they do: doctors, lawyers, engineers, construction workers
0:15
whatever they might do
0:18
They work they provide services to each other and they have savings
0:22
so right now they're burying it in their backyard
0:27
savings
0:32
and they're just collecting there that ""money"" is doing nothing
0:36
they've provided some goods and services to someone else
0:40
those people gave them something
0:43
whether it's gold or a green piece of paper
0:47
that essentially says this gold or this piece of green paper
0:50
entitles you to some future goods and services
0:53
and those people said ""oh that's a useful thing that I have, let me just put it into my matress""
0:59
or whatever.
1:00
In the world there's this pool of savings
1:01
and lets say there's this other pool of entrepreneurs
1:06
and they have a bunch of really good ideas for projects
1:10
they're like ""y'know what, if I could just get...""
1:13
let me just put this here
1:15
projects or investments
1:25
so lets say y'know lets say that there's some other entrepreneur
1:28
and he says ""boy y'know what I have no claims on any goods and resources
1:32
but I have and idea, I have an idea that if I could get a bunch of people
1:37
to dig canals to the crops that we'll be able to grow more crops
1:41
and grow throughout the year and we'll all be richer because we'll all
1:45
have more food and that's a true good and service in its best sense.
1:50
But how am I going to get these people to build this ditch for me
1:55
I mean I can maybe promise them that in the future that once
1:58
all of this is done I can do something or give them more food,
2:01
but that's not the way it works, no one's willing to work for me
2:04
unless they can feel very secure that they are going to get
2:07
something in return""
2:08
So we have an interesting problem here
2:10
You have a bunch of people who have already provided goods and services
2:14
to the world, and the world has given them trinkets
2:17
whether it's gold coins or paper money
2:19
lets just say it's gold
2:20
and I want to make this point because everyone always talks about gold
2:25
as if it's something special, as if it really represents wealth
2:30
while paper money really does not represent wealth
2:32
and that's just not true
2:33
there's nothing about gold
2:35
gold is not useful, other than the fact that it's pretty
2:38
that's the only thing that makes gold useful
2:40
actually it's pretty and it's hard to counterfeit
2:42
Paper money, not so pretty, but it has other advantages
2:45
it's lighter, and at least the paper money we use now, is not so easy to counterfeit
2:51
People always somehow feel that gold is somehow better than paper money
2:59
and we'll talk in the future about inflation and deflation
3:01
and the fact that there is a constraint on how much gold can be produced
3:05
but you can print money
3:07
but we'll talk about that in a little bit.
3:09
So in our modern world, savings are these green pieces of paper
3:13
but lets say we're talking about some primitive culture
3:15
and they're using gold
3:17
so a bunch of people perform a bunch of goods and services
3:21
and they get these little coins
3:22
and these coins are essentially this society's way of agreeing
3:26
if you have one of these coins
3:27
in the future, if you give this coin to someone else
3:30
they'll do something for you
3:32
and how much of that coin you have to give
3:34
for them to do this is based on supply and demand and price.
3:39
These projects, I say ""Well if I only had some way
3:43
of convincing someone to dig a canal
3:46
it would be hugely beneficial
3:47
and it will create wealth
3:49
or dig irrigation ditches
3:51
but how will I do that?
3:52
Well if I had gold, or if I had these little coins
3:55
I could give these coins to these people
3:58
they would dig the irrigation ditch
4:01
and then I could charge people access to water
4:08
and then I could essentially generate a return
4:11
but how do I do that?""

(piano playing)
0:04
Steven: We're looking at one of the single canvases from a series of canvases
0:08
of the Campbell Soup Cans by Andy Warhol from 1962
0:12
at the Museum of Modern Art.
0:13
And one of the really important questions that comes up about,
0:16
especially modern art, is well, why is this art?
0:21
Sal: When you ask me that a bunch of things kind of surface in my brain.
0:24
It does evoke something in me so I'm inclined to say yes,
0:28
but then there's a bunch of other things that say well,
0:30
if I didn't see this in a museum and if I just saw this
0:32
in the marketing department of Campbell's Soup,
0:35
would you be viewing it differently?
0:37
Steven: Because it's advertising then. Sal: Yes.
0:38
Steven: But in the context of the museum or in the context
0:41
of Andy Warhol's studio, it's not quite advertising, right?
0:44
Sal: Even if it's the exact same thing. Steven: Yeah.
0:47
Sal: And the idea here is by putting it in the museum
0:50
it's saying look at this in a different way.
0:52
Steven: Well that's right, it really does relocate it,
0:54
it does change the meaning, it does transform it,
0:57
and that's really one of the central ideas of modern art
1:00
is that you can take something that's not necessarily based
1:03
in technical skill, because I don't think you would say
1:05
that this is beautifully rendered. Sal: Right.
1:08
Steven: But it relocates it and makes us think about it in a different way.
1:11
Sal: And so, I guess he would get credit for taking something
1:14
that was very, almost mundane, something you see in everyone's cupboard,
1:19
and making it a focal point like you should pay attention to this thing.
1:23
Steven: I think that's exactly right and I think that he's doing it
1:26
about a subject that was about as low a subject as one could go.
1:31
I mean cheap advertising art was something that was so far away
1:34
from fine art from the great masters and then to focus on something
1:38
as lowly as a can of soup, and cream of chicken no less, right? (laughs)
1:44
Sal: A lot of it is, if he did it 50 years earlier,
1:47
people would have thought this guy's a quack
1:49
and if he did it now they'd think he was just derivative and...
1:52
It was really just that time where people happened to think this was art.
1:57
Steven: I think that that's right.
1:59
In 1962, what Warhol is doing is he's saying
2:02
what is it about our culture that is really authentic and important?
2:06
And it was about mass production, it was about factories.
2:09
He in a sense said let's not be looking at nature
2:13
as if we were still an agrarian culture, we're now an industrial culture.
2:16
What is the stuff of our visual world now?
2:19
Sal: I think I'm 80 percent there.
2:21
I remember in college there was a student run art exhibit
2:24
and as a prank a student actually put a little podium there
2:28
and put his lunch tray.
2:30
He put a little placard next to it, you know, lunch tray on Saturday
2:33
or something is what he called it.
2:34
So he did it as a prank and everyone thought it was really funny
2:37
but to some degree it's kind of a sign that maybe what he did was art.
2:40
Steven: Well I think that's why it was funny
2:42
because it was so close, right?
2:43
Sal: And to some degree when someone took a lunch tray
2:45
and gave it the proper lighting and gave it a podium to look at it
2:49
and wrote a whole description about it, I did view the lunch tray
2:51
in a different way.
2:52
That's kind of the same idea, that something
2:54
that's such a mundane thing but you use it everyday.
2:56
I mean, what would you say to that?
2:58
Was that a prank or was that art?
3:00
Steven: I think it is a prank but it's also very close
3:02
to some important art that had been made earlier in the century.
3:04
He had license to do that because of somebody named Marcel Duchamp.
3:08
In fact, Warhol had in a sense the same kind of license
3:11
to not focus on the making of something, not focus on the brushwork,
3:15
not focus on the composition, not focus on the color,
3:18
but focus on the refocusing of ideas.
3:21
Sal: And the reason why we talk about Warhol or Duchamp
3:25
or any of these people is that, as you said,
3:27
it's not that they did something technically profound.
3:29
Obviously Campbell Soup's marketing department had already done
3:32
something as equally as profound, it's more that they were the people
3:37
who looked at the world in a slightly different way and highlighted that.
3:41
Steven: Well I think that that's right.
3:42
Warhol is also very consciously working towards
3:46
asking the same questions that the prankster at your school was asking.
3:49
He's saying can this be art?
3:52
And in fact he's really pushing it.
3:54
Look at the painting closely for a moment.
3:55
This is one of the last paintings that he's actually painted.
3:58
He's really defined the calligraphy of this Campbell's,
4:01
he's really sort of rendered the reflection of the tin at the top.
4:05
But then he stopped and he said, I don't want to paint the fleur de lis.
4:08
You see those little fleur de lis down at the bottom.
4:11
I don't want to paint those.
4:12
So he actually had a little rubber stamp made of them
4:14
and actually sort of placed them down mechanically.
4:17
What does that mean for an artist then,
4:19
to say I don't even want to bother to paint these?
4:21
I'm just going to find a mechanical process to make this easier.
4:24
Warhol is doing something I think which is important
4:26
which is reflecting the way that we manufacture,
4:29
the way that we construct our world.
4:31
Think about the things that we surround ourselves with,
4:35
almost everything was made in a factory.
4:37
Almost nothing is singular in the world anymore.
4:40
It's not a world that we would normally find beautiful.
4:43
Sal: I don't know, sometimes I feel and correct me if I'm wrong,
4:45
that a decision was made that Warhol was interesting or great
4:49
and then people will interpret his stuff to justify his greatness.
4:53
That oh look, he used a printer instead of drawing it
4:58
which shows that he was reflecting the industrial or whatever,
5:01
but if he had done it the other way, if he had hand drawn it
5:04
or hand drawn it with his elbow you know, or finger painted it or something
5:08
people would say oh isn't this tremendous because we normally
5:10
would see this thing printed by a machine and now he did it with his hands.
5:13
How much do you think that is the case or am I just being cynical?
5:16
Steven: Well no, I think that there's value in a certain degree of cynicism
5:20
and I think that in some ways what we're really talking about here
5:24
is what does it mean to be an avant-garde artist?
5:26
What does it mean to sort of change the language of art
5:29
and to try to find ways that art relates to our historical moment
5:33
in some really direct and authentic way?
5:36
Sal: And maybe it's easy for me to say this because
5:38
I remember looking at this when I took 5th grade art class,
5:43
Andy Warhol and all of that, so now it seems almost not that unique
5:47
but in '62 what I'm hearing is that Warhol was really noteworthy
5:51
because he really did push people's thinking.
5:53
Steven: I think that Warhol was looking for, in 1962, a kind of subject matter
5:58
that was completely outside of the scope of that we could consider fine art.
6:02
One of his contemporaries, Roy Lichtenstein,
6:04
was asked what pop art was and he said,
6:06
""Well we were looking for subject matter that was so despicable,
6:10
""that was so low, that nobody could possibly believe that it was really art.""
6:14
And I think you're right, I think now we look at it
6:16
and it's so much a part of our visual culture that we immediately accept it.
6:20
But I think that it's really interesting to retrieve
6:22
just how shocking and radical that was.
6:25
Sal: This is fascinating.
6:26
It seems like there's a lot of potential there,
6:29
that stuff that's pseudo-art made for other purposes,
6:32
for commercial purposes but if you kind of shine a light on it,
6:35
in the way that a light has been shone on this, that it does...
6:39
In your mind would that cross the barrier into being art?
6:43
Steven: Well I think that, you mentioned before,
6:45
that if somebody was doing this now it would feel really derivative.
6:48
And I think that that's right.
6:49
I think it underscores just how hard it is to find in our culture now,
6:54
ways of making us see the world in new ways.
6:57
Sal: Fascinating.

0:00
Where we left off in the last video,
0:02
I think we were getting a reasonably good appreciation
0:04
for how huge the sun is, especially
0:07
relative to the Earth, and how far the Earth is away
0:12
from the sun.
0:12
That most of these diagrams that we see in science textbooks--
0:16
they don't give justice.
0:17
In fact, when I showed this sun over here
0:20
that was about five or six inches across,
0:22
I said Earth would be just this little speck, about 40 feet.
0:27
It wouldn't be this distance.
0:28
It would be about 40 feet to the left or the right.
0:30
Or its orbit would have a radius of about 40 feet.
0:35
You wouldn't even notice it if you
0:36
were looking at this thing over here.
0:38
It would be this little speck orbiting
0:39
at this huge, huge distance.
0:42
If you look at this sun over here,
0:44
if I were to draw the whole sun, it
0:46
looks like it would have a diameter of about 20 inches.
0:49
So in this situation, this Earth right here-- and this
0:53
is drawn to scale-- this Earth would not
0:55
be anywhere near this close.
0:56
It would be about 200 feet that way, or about 60
1:02
or 70 meters, 60 meters.
1:06
So you can imagine if the sun was this size, sitting
1:08
on something like a football field,
1:10
this little speck of an Earth, this little thing right here,
1:13
would be sitting on the other 40-yard line, 60 meters away.
1:19
So you wouldn't even notice it.
1:21
You might notice this from a distance,
1:23
but you wouldn't even see this thing over here.
1:25
And the other planets are even further.
1:26
Well, not all of the other planets.
1:27
Obviously, you have Mercury.
1:31
I think most of us are familiar with these.
1:33
But I'll just list them here, just in case.
1:35
That's Mercury.
1:37
This is Venus.
1:38
Mercury is the smallest of the planets where it's not
1:40
debated whether it's a planet.
1:41
Pluto is the smallest, but some people
1:44
debate whether it's really a planet or just
1:46
a large solar body or a dwarf planet
1:48
or any of those type of things.
1:50
But then you have Venus, probably the closest in size
1:53
to the Earth.
1:54
Or it is the closest in size to the Earth.
1:56
And then you have Mars.
1:59
And then you have Jupiter.
2:00
And just to give a sense of, once again,
2:02
how far these things are, if I were to go back
2:05
to the analogy of this being the size of the sun,
2:08
then Jupiter is five times further than Earth.
2:11
So this would be-- If I were to actually do the scale distance,
2:15
this would be 300 meters away.
2:19
So if I had a nice, big, maybe medicine-balled-size sun
2:23
right over here, maybe basketball-sized.
2:25
A little bit bigger than a basketball,
2:27
this looks on my screen-- then this little thing
2:31
that's smaller than a ping pong ball,
2:33
I would put this three football fields away.
2:36
That's how far Jupiter is.
2:38
And then Saturn's about twice as far as that.
2:40
Saturn is about nine times the distance.
2:42
So let me make it clear.
2:45
The Earth is one astronomical unit away from the sun,
2:48
roughly.
2:48
Its distance changes.
2:49
It's not a perfectly circular orbit.
2:53
Jupiter is approximately a little bit--
2:55
5 plus astronomical units-- a little bit
2:58
more than five times the distance
3:00
of the sun to the Earth.
3:02
And Saturn is approximately nine astronomical units,
3:07
or nine times the distance from the sun to the Earth.
3:11
So once again, this would be nine football fields away.
3:13
Or another way to think about it would be, essentially,
3:16
a kilometer away.
3:16
If we had kind of a medicine-ball-size sun,
3:20
this little smaller than a ping pong
3:22
balled Saturn would be a kilometer away.
3:26
And I just want to really reiterate
3:27
that because you never visualize it that way.
3:30
Because just for the sake of being
3:31
able to draw it on a page, you see
3:32
diagrams that look like this.
3:35
And they really don't give you a sense of how small
3:38
these planets are relative to the sun,
3:40
and especially relative to their distance from the sun.
3:45
And then after Saturn, you have Uranus and then Neptune.
3:58
And obviously, these guys are even further.
3:59
And just to give you a sense, it's
4:01
very easy to start talking about galaxies and universes and all
4:05
of the-- or the universe.
4:07
But I really just want to get-- already,
4:09
what we've talked about, we're talking about huge distances,
4:12
huge scale.
4:14
We already talked about that it would take a jet plane 17 years
4:17
to travel from the Earth to the sun.
4:19
Multiply that by five, about 100 years
4:22
to go from Jupiter to the sun, 200 years
4:24
to go from Saturn to the sun.
4:27
So you could have had Abraham Lincoln get into a jet plane,
4:31
and if he left from Saturn, he still
4:34
would not have gotten to the sun.
4:36
So these are huge, huge distances.
4:37
But we're not done with the solar system, there.
4:39
Just to give a sense of scale-- so this right here,
4:44
that's the sun.
4:45
And each of these planets are actually
4:47
narrower than these orbits.
4:48
So they just draw these orbits here,
4:50
but you wouldn't actually even see the actual planets
4:52
here at this type of a scale.
4:54
But this is one astronomical unit right over here,
4:56
the distance from the sun to the Earth.
4:59
Then you have Mars.
5:00
Then you have the asteroid belt.
5:02
There you have the asteroid belt,
5:06
which also has some pretty big things in it, itself.
5:08
And it has these things that are kind of considered almost
5:11
dwarf planets, things like Ceres.
5:13
You could look those type things up.
5:14
And then you have Jupiter out here.
5:16
And once again, we said it would take 100 years, or roughly
5:19
100 years, for a jet plane to get from Jupiter to the sun.
5:23
But even if you take this whole box
5:25
here-- which is a huge amount of distance, of roughly about
5:28
five astronomical units-- it would take about 40 minutes
5:33
for light to get from the sun to Jupiter.
5:37
So this is a huge, huge distance.
5:40
But even this huge distance-- we can put it
5:42
into this little box right over here.
5:46
So this whole box right over there can be fit into this box.
5:55
And you need to do that in order to appreciate
5:57
the orbits of the outer planets.
5:59
And so on this scale, Earth and Venus and Mercury and Mars,
6:03
their orbits look pretty much-- you can't even
6:05
differentiate them from the sun.
6:07
They look so close.
6:08
They almost look like they're part
6:09
of the sun when you look at it on this scale.
6:11
And then you have you have the outer planets--
6:13
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
6:15
And they we have a Kuiper belt.
6:17
And this is more asteroids, but these are kind of more frozen.
6:21
And when we think of ice, you always think of water ice.
6:24
But out here, it's so cold.
6:25
And it's relatively getting dark, now,
6:27
because we're pretty far from the sun
6:29
that things that we normally associate as gases are going
6:31
to be in their solid form out here.
6:33
So this isn't just rocky elements.
6:36
This will also be things that we normally associate as gases,
6:39
like methane, frozen methane.
6:41
But even here, we're not done.
6:42
We're not even out of the solar system yet.
6:46
And actually, just to give you a sense of the scale we're
6:49
operating right here, I have this chart right here
6:52
from the Voyager mission.
6:53
So the Voyager missions-- Voyager 1 and 2-- actually,
6:55
Voyager 2 left a little bit earlier, a month earlier.
6:58
Voyager 1 is just traveling faster.
7:00
They left about a year after I was born
7:04
And their current velocity, just to give you
7:06
a sense of how fast-- Voyager 1 right here is right
7:12
now traveling at 61,000 kilometers per hour.
7:19
That's about 17 kilometers per second.
7:23
The size of a city every second-- it's going that fast.
7:25
That's, at least in my mind, an unfathomably fast velocity.
7:31
This thing has been traveling roughly that fast.
7:33
It's been going around planets and gaining acceleration
7:36
as it went around orbits.
7:37
But for most of the time, it's been
7:38
going at a pretty fast speed.
7:39
And just to translate it to people
7:42
who don't relate to kilometers, that's
7:43
about 38,000 miles per hour, so this huge, huge unfathomably
7:50
fast speed.
7:51
And it's been doing it since 1977.
7:55
I was learning to walk.
7:57
And when I was learning to walk, it
7:58
was traveling at this super fast speed.
8:00
And then when I was learning to talk-- our whole lives,
8:04
when we're sleeping, everything, we're eating,
8:06
I'm in elementary school-- it's still rocketing out
8:09
of the solar system at roughly this speed.
8:11
Its velocity has changed, but especially,
8:13
once it got outside of the planets,
8:15
it's been roughly at this velocity.
8:17
So it's just been rocketing out.
8:19
And I don't want to say only, but it's gotten this far.
8:24
If we look at it on this scale, it's
8:25
gotten about that far right there.
8:28
It's about 115, 116 astronomical units.
8:32
And to give a sense-- so there's two ways to think about it.
8:34
One says, like, wow, that's really far.
8:36
Because we know that even on this scale,
8:39
you can't even see Earth's orbit.
8:40
So this looks like it's a pretty, pretty far distance.
8:43
And just to give you a sense of how far 116 astronomical units
8:47
are, if 2,000 years ago, Jesus got on a plane--
8:52
I actually cut and pasted a copy of Jesus,
8:54
just for visualization purposes--
8:56
but if he'd got on a jet liner at 1,000 kilometers per hour
8:59
and went straight in that direction,
9:01
in the direction that Voyager, Voyager would only just now be
9:05
catching up to Jesus.
9:06
So this is a huge, huge, huge, huge distance.
9:09
But at the same time, even though it's
9:11
a huge distance, especially relative to everything
9:13
else we've talked about, relative to just even
9:15
the outer reaches of the solar system,
9:18
we're still talking in terms of a small scale.
9:21
So that's how far Voyager is.
9:24
And just to give a sense, on this scale-- so this whole box
9:27
over here can be contained in this box.
9:32
And when you look at this box, Voyager's
9:34
only gotten about that far after traveling
9:39
at this unbelievable velocity for over 30 years,
9:44
for about 33 years.
9:45
And just to give you an idea of these other things, Sedna,
9:47
right here, is a reasonably large-sized outer solar system
9:53
object.
9:54
It's one of the furthest objects that we
9:56
know of in the solar system.
9:58
And it has this very eccentric orbit.
10:00
So it gets-- I don't want to say relatively close, but not
10:02
unreasonably far away.
10:05
And then it gets really far away from the sun.
10:09
But even Sedna's orbit-- so if I were to look at this,
10:11
so this whole box over here can be contained right over here.
10:17
So in this diagram right here, you
10:19
wouldn't even be able to see.
10:20
It would be like a speck how far Voyager
10:22
has traveled in 33 years at 38,000 miles per hour.
10:27
You would not even be able to notice.
10:30
You wouldn't even notice that distance.
10:33
And even though you can't even notice that distance,
10:35
we still have the sun's influence.
10:39
The gravitational pull is still attracting things to it.
10:42
And this right here, we speculate
10:45
that there is the Oort cloud.
10:46
And this is where the comets originate from.
10:48
And this is just a bunch of frozen gases
10:51
and ice particles and things like that.
10:54
But we're starting to get to the outer reaches
10:57
of the solar system.
10:58
And this distance right here is about 50,000 astronomical
11:04
units.
11:07
And just to give a scale-- because you
11:09
hear a lot about light years and all of that-- light years
11:11
are about 63,000 astronomical units.
11:14
So if you go a light year out from the sun,
11:19
you'll end up in the Oort cloud, the hypothesized Oort cloud.
11:24
And just to give a sense, another scale,
11:26
the Oort cloud is actually-- most of the planets' orbits
11:30
are roughly in the same plane.
11:32
But this right here is the orbit of the planets.
11:34
And once again, these lines are drawn too thick.
11:36
They're just drawn the thinnest possible so
11:38
that you can see them, but they're still drawn too thick.
11:40
And this gets us all the way to the Kuiper belt.
11:42
But all of this over here, so all the way
11:45
out to the Kuiper belt, all the way out
11:46
to all of the major planets-- this
11:48
is Pluto's orbit right over here.
11:52
This whole diagram is only sitting in right over there.
11:56
You can barely see it.
11:57
This whole diagram is just that dot in this.
12:00
And then you can see the Oort cloud all around it.
12:02
And it's more of a spherical cloud.
12:04
And we think it exists.
12:05
Obviously, it's hard to observe things at that distance.
12:08
So hopefully, that gives you a beginning sense
12:11
of the scale of the solar system.
12:12
And what's really going to blow your mind-- if this hasn't
12:14
blown your mind already-- is that this whole thing's
12:17
going to start looking like a speck.
12:19
When you even just look at the local area around our galaxy,
12:21
much less the galaxy, much less the universe as a whole.
12:25

we're at the National Museum for African art and we're looking at a mask made by
0:09
the Chokwe people in the democratic Republic of Congo and this mask would
0:13
have been dance by a male dancer
0:16
even though we're looking at a mask that represents an ideal woman the masker
0:20
who's a man and the carver who's a man would have made this to honor women
0:26
particularly women who were young and fertile and had successfully given birth
0:30
because there was an honor in Chokwe society given to those women and this is
0:35
also a culture that is matrilineal that is the family line is passed down
0:39
through the mother and one of the reasons to dances mask was not only to
0:43
honor women who were at this stage in life but also to recognize the founding
0:48
female ancestor of the Chokwe lineage it's made of wood that's very thin and
0:53
difficult to carve receive fiber and this elaborate hairstyle we have to
0:59
imagine the rest of the costume that would have been here when the mask was
1:03
dance and this would have been a tight-fitted bodystocking covered in
1:08
raffia cloth the dancers groin area would be covered in a loincloth and he'd
1:12
be wearing wooden breasts and we're using the word dance but from the descriptions
1:19
the dancer walked in a very graceful and stately way and Chokwe women actually
1:24
do dance like that that's very graceful and fluid and slow and respectful and
1:30
when we say he's wearing a woman's face and he's wearing women's breasts he's
1:34
not impersonating a woman he's really not to honor women who have courageously
1:40
gone through childbirth and retain this inner wisdom and beauty so beautifully
1:45
articulated in the facial features and we see that sense of calm in the face
1:49
and the fact that her eyes are closed her mouth is closed suggest is turning
1:55
inward she's not talking
1:57
she doesn't need to talk at this point in life she deserves respect and she
2:01
doesn't have to open her eyes wide she's already knowing the mask itself is a
2:06
deep dark red which is probably created through a mixture of
2:10
red earth and oil but there's white kalyan or white powder around her eyes
2:16
and this whiteness is connected to the spiritual realm in fact her eyes are the
2:21
most important part of the face their abstractly big and it draws attention to
2:26
the fact that she has the spiritual ability almost of second sight that her
2:30
power comes from being able to give birth

the face is very symmetrical the kin comes to have narrower . the broadest

part of the faces by the eyes and ears this wide forehead that is accentuated

the trackway people were little known until the earlier part of the 20th

- [Voiceover] We're now entering into 1944
0:03
where the Americans and the Allies are able to go
0:06
even more on the offensive versus the Japanese
0:10
and get closer and closer to Japan,
0:12
get in bombing range of Japan
0:14
and deprive the Japanese of,
0:17
I guess you could say, their forward bases.
0:19
And so right as we enter into 1944,
0:21
and once again I'm giving you an overview
0:23
I'm not giving every single battle that occurs,
0:25
the Unites States is able to take Kwajalein.
0:28
Which, once again, the strategic value of a lot of these,
0:32
these islands are tiny
0:33
they're barely large enough to have primitive bases
0:38
plus, kind of an air field,
0:39
but they're incredibly valuable because
0:41
the bombers can land, refuel, get resupplied
0:45
and then take off from there
0:47
and then be on the offensive even further in.
0:51
I guess you could say in Japanese territory.
0:53
And with the taking on Kwajalein,
0:54
just as a bit of a reminder,
0:56
the Americans, amongst other things,
0:58
now had control of the Soloman Islands.
1:03
They now have control of the Marshall and Gilbert Islands.
1:06
They now have control of the Marshall and Gilbert Islands.
1:10
And as we'll see, the real theme of 1944
1:13
as we get into the middle of and the end of the year
1:15
is to get as close as possible to the Japanese mainland.
1:19
Because the Americans now had a B-29,
1:23
or they had the B-29 bomber that had a 1500 mile radius.
1:28
1500 mile, I guess I could say 1500 mile range.
1:32
Which means if they're able to get points of
1:36
where their bombers could land and take off,
1:38
and once again these bombsers are way too large and heavy
1:41
to land on a carrier,
1:42
but if they can find islands where they can do that from
1:44
within a 1500 mile range of Japan
1:47
then the United States could have bombing attacks
1:49
directly on Japan and hopefully get closer to
1:53
an end to the war.
1:55
So that was really the theme,
1:56
get as close as possible to Japan
1:58
and then there was a secondary theme
2:00
of take back The Philippines.
2:01
One, it was a matter of pride, it was a former US possession
2:04
ever since the Spanish-American War.
2:08
But then on top of that,
2:09
The Philippines are incredibly strategic for shipping lanes
2:12
from Indonesia, remember those raw materials,
2:14
those resources, that oil that Japan wanted
2:17
from Indonesia.
2:19
If you control The Philippines
2:21
you're gonna control the shipping lanes between
2:23
Indonesia and Japan.
2:26
So you could deprive Japan of those natural resources.
2:28
So The United States' kind of
2:30
main focal areas in 1944,
2:33
get as close as possible to Japan, get within bombing range,
2:36
and take The Philippines.
2:38
And this is exactly what they did.
2:41
As we go into the summer of 1944,
2:45
and one, there were some, as early as the summer of 1944,
2:48
some bombing raids that took off in China to Japan
2:53
with the new B-29s.
2:56
So you do have some of these that happened as early,
2:59
some of these bombing raids happened as early
3:02
as summer of 1944.
3:05
But in terms of actual islands, or territory
3:09
The United States takes or takes back
3:11
in the summer, in June of 1944,
3:14
you have The Battle of the Philippine Sea.
3:17
So Battle of Philippine Sea occurs right around,
3:21
right around here.
3:23
It's a victory for The US. It's a victory for The US.
3:27
And it ends up really, really
3:31
hurting Japanese ability
3:35
to field carriers,
3:36
have air warfare from carriers
3:40
because so much of their
3:42
carrier capability
3:44
was damaged in The Battle of Philippine Sea.
3:47
So, The Battle of
3:52
Philippine
3:59
Battle of the Philippine Sea
4:00
this occurs in June
4:04
1944.
4:05
And along with that, in the summer,
4:08
the Allies are able to take several islands
4:12
in The Mariana Islands.
4:14
Once again, this is gonna be super important
4:16
because from The Marianas, they're able to launch
4:18
B-29 bombing attacks on the mainland in Japan.
4:22
And so over that summer the Allies,
4:24
the Americans in particular, are able to take Saipan,
4:28
they are able to take Guam,
4:33
they are able to take Tinian,
4:35
which is this little island right over here.
4:37
Some of these islands are quite hard to find.
4:39
They're super small, in fact,
4:40
even these little dots exaggerate their size,
4:43
if you were to actually go onto Google Maps or Google Earth
4:45
you'll see how small these are.
4:46
And I encourage you to look at them
4:47
it's really fascinating to see how small
4:49
some of these islands are.
4:50
They're really atolls, a lot of these are
4:52
more atolls then islands.
4:53
Not all of them are atolls.
4:55
But you see, they barely have enough space
4:57
for a landing strip for planes, especially the B-29s.
5:02
And then as we go further into the summer
5:04
and we start entering kind of later in the year,
5:08
the Americans are able to take,
5:10
at the time what was called Peleliu, now it's Palu.
5:14
So Peleliu, they're able to take Morotai,
5:20
and then perhaps most importantly in 1944,
5:23
this might be the biggest deal out of all of these
5:27
pacific battles that occur and all of these
5:28
naval battles that occur,
5:30
is The Battle of Leyte an The Battle of Leyte Gulf.
5:35
Because The Battle of Leyte was important
5:37
because in the process of taking Leyte
5:41
The United States essentially is able to knock out
5:44
the Japanese's ability to further defend,
5:48
I mean they will continue,
5:49
but realistically defend the rest of The Philippines.
5:52
So once Leyte is taken by the Allies
5:57
the odds of the Japanese being able to hold
6:00
the rest of The Philippines becomes very low.
6:03
And maybe even more important,
6:04
The Battle of Leyte Gulf, which occurs right around there,
6:08
it's an incredibly decisive battle for the American Navy.
6:12
The Japanese go all in, and that bet is not a good one.
6:16
The Japanese Navy is pretty much destroyed
6:19
in The Battle of Leyte Gulf.
6:22
And so 1944, once again,
6:25
very good year for the Allies.
6:27
Very bad year for the Japanese.
6:30
Now the Allies are in control of
6:34
they're in control of air strips,
6:36
from which they can take B-29 raids
6:39
to the mainland of Japan.
6:42
So air strips,
6:43
they can now, they're now within range
6:45
to do bombing attacks on the mainland of Japan,
6:48
and they now are very likely to control The Philippines
6:53
and control the shipping lanes from Indonesia to Japan
6:57
and they've all but destroyed the Japanese Navy.
7:01
So, once again, things are not looking very good for Japan.
7:05
And as we go into 1945, we'll see the Allies
7:09
get closer and closer and get more intense
7:13
bombing raids on Japan.
7:15
And every time they get closer,
7:16
the battles to take these islands,
7:18
Iwo Jima, Okinawa,
7:20
incredibly incredibly bloody
7:22
and The United States says,
7:24

0:00
Welcome back.
0:01
So I was trying to rush and finish a problem in the last
0:05
two minutes of the video, and I realize that's just bad
0:08
teaching, because I end up rushing.
0:09
So this is the problem we were going to work on, and you'll
0:11
see a lot of these.
0:12
They just want you to become familiar with the variables in
0:17
Newton's law of gravitation.
0:19
So I said that there's two planets, one is Earth.
0:23
Now I have time to draw things, so that's Earth.
0:27
And then there's Small Earth.
0:28
And Small Earth-- well, maybe I'll just call it the small
0:32
planet, so we don't get confused.
0:34
It's green, showing that there's probably
0:37
life on that planet.
0:40
Let's say it has 1/2 the radius, and 1/2 the mass.
0:45
So if you think about it, it's probably a
0:46
lot denser than Earth.
0:48
That's a good problem to think about.
0:49
How much denser is it, right?
0:51
Because if you have 1/2 the radius, your volume is much
0:55
less than 1/2.
0:56
I don't want to go into that now, but that's something for
0:58
you to think about.
0:58
But my question is what fraction, if I'm standing on
1:01
the surface of this-- so the same person, so Sal, if I'm on
1:06
Earth, what fraction is the pull when I'm on this small
1:13
green planet?
1:15
So what is the pull on me on Earth?
1:18
Well, it's just going to be-- my weight on Earth, the force
1:23
on Earth, is going to be equal to the gravitational constant
1:28
times my mass, mass of me.
1:35
So m sub m times the mass of Earth divided by what?
1:41
We learned in the last video, divided by the distance
1:44
between me and the center of the mass of Earth.
1:45
Really, my center of mass and the center of mass of Earth.
1:49
But this is between the surface of the Earth, and I'd
1:52
like to think that I'm not short, but it's negligible
1:56
between my center of mass and the surface, so we'll just
1:58
consider the radius of the Earth.
2:00
So we divide it by the radius of the Earth squared.
2:08
Using these same variables, what's going to be the force
2:11
on this other planet?
2:13
So the force on the other planet, this green planet--
2:16
I'll do it in green-- and we're calling it the small
2:20
planet, it equals what?
2:23
It equals the gravitational constant again.
2:26
And my mass doesn't change when I go from one planet to
2:29
another, right?
2:31
Its mass now is what?
2:33
We would write it m sub s here, right?
2:37
This is the small planet.
2:39
And we wrote right here that it's 1/2 the mass of Earth, so
2:41
I'll just write that.
2:42
So it's 1/2 the mass of Earth.
2:48
And what's its radius?
2:49
What's the radius now?
2:51
I could just write the radius of the small planet squared,
2:54
but I'll say, well, we know.
2:54
It's 1/2 the radius of Earth, so let's put that in there.
2:57
So 1/2 radius of Earth.
3:00
We have to square it.
3:02
Let's see what this simplifies to.
3:04
This equals-- so we can take this 1/2 here-- 1/2G mass of
3:12
me times mass of Earth over-- what's 1/2 squared?
3:18
It's 1/4.
3:19
Over 1/4 radius of Earth squared.
3:26
And what's 1/2 divided by 1/4?
3:30
1/4 goes into 1/2 two times, right?
3:32
Or another way you can think about it is if you have a
3:33
fraction in the denominator, when you put it in the
3:35
numerator, you flip it and it becomes 4.
3:38
So 4 times 1/2 is 2.
3:39
Either way, it's just math.
3:41
So the force on the small planet is going to be equal to
3:45
1/2 divided by 1/4 is 2 times G, mass of me, times mass of
3:53
Earth, divided by the radius of Earth squared.
3:56
And if we look up here, this is the same
4:01
thing as this, right?
4:05
It's identical.
4:07
So we know that the force that applied to me when I'm on the
4:10
surface of the small planet is actually two times the force
4:15
applied on Earth, when I go to Earth.
4:19
And that's something interesting to think about,
4:20
because you might have said initially, wow, you know, the
4:24
mass of the object matters a lot in gravity.
4:27
The more massive the object, the more it's
4:29
going to pull on me.
4:31
But what we see here is that actually, no.
4:33
When I'm on the surface of this smaller planet, it's
4:36
pulling even harder on me.
4:37
And why is that?
4:38
Well, because I'm actually closer to its center of mass.
4:41
And as we talked about earlier in this video, this object is
4:45
probably a lot denser.
4:46
You could say it's only 1/2 the mass, but it's much less
4:50
than 1/2 of the volume, right?
4:51
Because the volume is the cube of the radius and all of that.
4:55
I don't want to confuse you, but this is just something to
4:56
think about.
4:57
So not only does the mass matter, but the
4:59
radius matters a lot.
5:01
And the radius is actually the square, so it actually
5:03
matters even more.
5:06
So that's something that's pretty
5:09
interesting to think about.
5:10
And these are actually very common problems when they just
5:14
want to tell you, oh, you go to a planet that is two times
5:16
the mass of another planet, et cetera, et cetera, what is the
5:21
difference in force between the two?
5:23
And one thing I want you to realize, actually, before I
5:25
finish this video since I do have some extra time, when we
5:29
think about gravity, especially with planets and
5:30
all of that, you always feel like, oh, it's
5:33
Earth pulling on me.
5:36
Let's say that this is the Earth, and the Earth is huge,
5:41
and this is a tiny spaceship right here.
5:45
It's traveling.
5:48
You always think that Earth is pulling on
5:50
the spaceship, right?
5:51
The gravitational force of Earth.
5:53
But it actually turns out, when we looked at the formula,
5:57
the formula is symmetric.
5:57
It's not really saying one is pulling on the other.
5:59
They're actually saying this is the force
6:01
between the two objects.
6:03
They're attracted to each other.
6:04
So if the Earth is pulling on me with the force of 500
6:13
Newtons, it actually turns out that I am pulling on the Earth
6:16
with an equal and opposite force of 5 Newtons.
6:18
We're pulling towards each other.
6:20
It just feels like the Earth is, at least from my point of
6:23
view, that the Earth is pulling to me.
6:25
And we're actually both being pulled towards the combined
6:29
center of mass.
6:30
So in this situation, let's say the Earth is pulling on
6:33
the spaceship with the force of-- I don't know.
6:37
I'm making up numbers now, but let's say
6:40
it's 1 million Newtons.
6:43
It actually turns out that the spaceship will be pulling on
6:46
the Earth with the same force of 1 million Newtons.
6:51
And they're both going to be moved to the combined system's
6:55
center of mass.
6:56
And the combined system's center of mass since the Earth
7:00
is so much more massive is going to be very close to
7:02
Earth's center of mass.
7:03
It's probably going to be very close to
7:05
Earth's center of mass.
7:06
It's going to be like right there, right?
7:07
So in this situation, Earth won't be doing a lot of
7:12
moving, but it will be pulled in the direction of the
7:15
spaceship, and the spaceship will try to go to Earth's
7:18
center of mass, but at some point, probably the
7:20
atmosphere, or the rock that it runs into, it won't be able
7:24
to go much further and it might crash
7:27
right around there.
7:28
Anyway, I wanted just to give you the sense that it's not
7:31
necessarily one object just pulling on the other.
7:33
They're pulling towards each other to their
7:35
combined center of masses.
7:36
It would make a lot more sense if they had just two people
7:40
floating in space, they actually would have some
7:42
gravity towards each other.
7:43
It's almost a little romantic.
7:47
They would float to each other.
7:48
And actually, you could figure it out.
7:52
I don't have the time to do it, but you could use this
7:55
formula and use the constant, and you could figure out,
7:58
well, what is the gravitational attraction
8:00
between two people?
8:01
And what you'll see is that between two people floating in
8:04
space, there are other forms of attraction that are
8:06
probably stronger than their
8:09
gravitational attraction, anyway.
8:11
I'll let you ponder that and I will see
8:13
you in the next video.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,8i0j3j16yFk,

0:00
Understanding the ethnic and religious commonalities
0:03
and differences in the state or the region that
0:06
used to be Yugoslavia can be quite confusing.
0:08
What I want to do in this video is try to give a primer on it.
0:10
It's really key to understanding some of the triggers of World
0:14
War I. And to, obviously, understand the breakup
0:16
of Yugoslavia which was quite ugly during the fall
0:21
of Communism in the late '80s and early '90s.
0:24
So first of all, it's a good idea
0:25
to just understand where the word Yugoslavia comes from.
0:30
It's literally referring to the southern Slavic states.
0:34
So Yugo- is referring to southern.
0:36
And -slavia, we're talking about the Slavic states.
0:38
And when people talk about Slavic languages,
0:40
they're talking about the languages that
0:42
are spoken in this region, but also much of Eastern Europe,
0:45
and in what is now Russia.
0:49
Now, what we have here in blue is,
0:52
we have shaded in where Serbo-Croatian
0:56
is spoken, which is the dominant Slavic language in this region.
1:05
And there are multiple dialects.
1:07
Some people will say, oh, it's Croatian or Montenegrin
1:10
or Serbian or whatever it might be.
1:12
But mostly, linguists say, well, they're
1:13
pretty close to each other.
1:15
And you can categorize them as one language as Serbo-Croatian.
1:20
And you see that it's now spoken in modern day Croatia, Bosnia
1:24
and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro.
1:28
And that is the commonality here,
1:31
the thing that ties together this region.
1:33
Now on top of that, the Slovenian language
1:36
is also Slavic language that is closely related
1:39
to Serbo-Croatian.
1:40
In Macedonia, they also speak a Slavic language.
1:43
It's closer to Bulgarian.
1:44
But it has some close ties.
1:46
It's not completely different than Serbo-Croatian.
1:48
So you have this linguistic connection
1:51
throughout this area.
1:53
Now, what divides this area is really religion and history.
1:57
So this area, if you look, go back hundreds of years,
2:01
it was under the control of various empires,
2:03
the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire.
2:06
Different-- the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
2:08
you're dealing with the Roman Catholic Empire.
2:10
When you're talking about the Ottomans,
2:11
you're dealing with the Muslim Empire.
2:13
And they held in different parts of this territory
2:16
for hundreds of years.
2:18
And so what you end up, is really a mix of religions.
2:22
And that often gets tied to people's-- what they perceive
2:26
as also their ethnicities.
2:28
And so what I have here is a break down,
2:31
the religious breakdown of the state,
2:34
the former state of Yugoslavia.
2:36
So in this pinkish color right over here,
2:38
I have the areas that are predominately Roman Catholic.
2:41
And I say, predominantly, because it really is all mixed
2:44
together.
2:44
So Slovenia, Croatia, primarily Roman Catholic.
2:48
If you look at Serbia and Montenegro,
2:51
primarily Eastern Orthodox.
2:54
Kosovo, you have a strong Muslim majority right over there.
3:00
And it really gets-- and Kosovo, before its break up,
3:04
was kind of part of Serbia and Montenegro.
3:07
Despite it having this very different religious makeup.
3:10
And then, Bosnia and Herzegovina is
3:12
where things get really, really mixed up.
3:14
Roughly half of the population, and it's
3:16
been moving over the centuries.
3:19
But the dominant religion there is Islam.
3:23
And in general, and this is where it can be confusing,
3:25
when people talk about a Bosniak,
3:28
when they're talking about a Bosniak,
3:30
they're talking about a Bosnian Muslim.
3:36
But Bosnia and Herzegovina also has significant fractions
3:40
of Serbs who are Eastern Orthodox.
3:44
So that's why I put the brown here as well.
3:45
It's about a third of the population.
3:47
And it also has a pretty sizable Roman Catholic population.
3:50
Or we could say Bosnian Croats.
3:53
So just to be clear here, it can be very confusing.
3:55
Even when you when you hear history of it
3:56
or when you've heard it on the news.
3:58
I remember the '90s hearing this on the news
4:00
and getting very confused.
4:02
If someone's referring to a Bosnian Muslim or Bosniak,
4:04
that's a Muslim living in Bosnia.
4:06
That's they tend to be referring to.
4:09
If they say a Bosnian Croats, this
4:16
would be an ethnically Croat who is living in Bosnia.
4:20
And they are-- it would tend to be Roman Catholic.
4:24
And then if you have a Bosnian Serb,
4:29
this is someone who ethnically identifies themselves
4:32
as a Serbian or as a Serb who lives
4:35
in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
4:38
But is probably going to be Eastern Orthodox.
4:42
So you can imagine, you have the strong linguistic and even
4:46
ethnic ties.
4:48
But at some point, because of the religion and dialect
4:52
changes, there's also significant amount
4:54
of differences here.
4:55
Especially when things got ugly, as you
4:57
have the fall of Communism.
4:58
So hopefully, this lays the groundwork
5:00
of the commonalities and the differences here.
5:03
And it'll help us understand what got us into World War I,
5:06
or at least what triggered World War I. And also some
5:08
of the ugliness that was seen in the early '90s.
5:12
And just to finish up with a little bit of context,
5:15
this was not a unified state until-- World War
5:19
I, to some degree, was precipitated by a desire
5:21
to make this a unified state.
5:24
This ethnic grouping, this linguistic grouping
5:28
tended to be broken up with the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
5:31
the Ottoman Empire.
5:32
Entering into a World War I, you started
5:34
to have the decline of the Ottoman Empire
5:35
which started to allow these people to start
5:39
to have more energy behind their desire to form a unified state.
5:43
World War I was essentially the catalyst
5:45
that allowed the state of Yugoslavia to unify.
5:49
And in different forms, it stayed
5:51
unified until the fall of Communism.
5:54
And even though it was a socialist state,
5:56
a communist state during the Cold War,
5:59
it actually always had a strange and distant relationship
6:03
with the Soviet Union.
6:04
But after the fall of Communism, that
6:06
was kind of holding it together, these, especially
6:09
these religious differences, frankly,
6:11
and these ethnic and religious differences broke it apart.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,6RKMRBxDm20,

0:00
- [Voiceover] Hey Kim.
0:01
- [Kim] Hey, Becca.
0:02
So, we've been talking about Uncle Tom's Cabin,
0:05
published in 1852 by Harriet Beecher Stowe,
0:08
and said to have been one of the main causes
0:10
of the American Civil War.
0:13
So, remind me again of what Uncle Tom's Cabin
0:15
was actually about.
0:16
- [Becca] So Uncle Tom's Cabin was about
0:18
the horrors of slavery in the deep south
0:21
and also appealed to a lot of American's Christian values
0:25
and tried to point out these fundamental contradictions
0:28
between Christian faith and slavery.
0:31
- [Kim] So, it was published in 1852.
0:33
How did people receive this book?
0:34
- [Becca] So there was a lot of mixed reactions.
0:36
But, it was the most read book of the 19th century,
0:40
so there were a lot of reactions.
0:42
(laughing)
0:43
In the north, mostly, people were reading this all the time,
0:47
no matter if you were an intellectual
0:50
or just kind of a 17 year old picking up a book off a shelf,
0:54
you were going to read Uncle Tom's Cabin.
0:55
And a lot of the people that actually read the book
0:57
were young men that would later fight in the Civil War.
1:01
- [Kim] How interesting.
1:02
Okay, so, like this would be our book club book of the month
1:05
except everybody was,
1:06
this was like the Oprah's book club choice of 1852.
1:11
- [Becca] Exactly. - [Kim] Everybody was
1:12
reading it.
1:13
- [Becca] Yeah, there's really almost nothing like it.
1:15
Not even Harry Potter.
1:17
But it did have the same international scope
1:19
that Harry Potter does today.
1:20
- [Kim] So, it was popular in the northern United States,
1:23
and elsewhere in the world.
1:25
So, where else was it popular?
1:26
- [Becca] Mostly in Europe.
1:28
But it was translated into over 60 languages.
1:31
- [Kim] Wow.
1:32
- [Becca] And, this also kind of put the spotlight
1:34
on American slavery.
1:36
So, there was all this international attention.
1:39
What is going on in America,
1:41
and what's going to happen?
1:42
- [Kim] That's so interesting.
1:43
It reminds me of The King and I.
1:45
If you've seen that she, the woman goes to Siam,
1:49
and shows people
1:52
the book Uncle Tom's Cabin
1:54
and they put on a version of a play
1:56
based on Uncle Tom's Cabin
1:58
in what would be Thailand.
2:00
- [Becca] So yeah, so this makes it this kind of
2:02
international spectacle.
2:04
The fate of slavery had to be somehow figured out,
2:07
and everyone was watching.
2:09
- [Kim] That's so interesting.
2:10
So, I'm imagining that white southerners
2:12
were not big fans of this book.
2:14
- [Becca] So, white southerners were definitely
2:15
not a fan of Uncle Tom's Cabin.
2:18
And in response, there was this movement of these things
2:21
called anti-Tom novels.
2:23
Here's an anti-Tom novel right next to us,
2:25
right over here,
2:26
Aunt Phillis's Cabin.
2:28
(Kim laughing)
2:28
- [Kim] Creative name. - [Becca] Aunt Phillis' Cabin,
2:30
yes (laughing), very creative name.
2:32
These anti-Tom novels aimed to point out that
2:35
maybe Harriet Beecher Stowe didn't know
2:36
what she was actually talking about.
2:38
They also accused Harriet Beecher Stowe
2:40
of not actually even living in the deep south,
2:42
so she didn't even know what slavery was like.
2:44
They wanted to paint southern slave society
2:47
in this really positive light.
2:49
They wanted to show all the ways that it actually
2:51
maintains social order,
2:53
and promoted economic welfare,
2:55
so this was kind of this response from the south,
2:58
also in novel form.
2:59
- [Kim] So, it's this big kind of cultural battle
3:01
over the interpretation of slavery.
3:04
You have people on one hand saying
3:05
slavery is destructive to families,
3:08
slavery is incompatible with Christianity.
3:11
And then, responses from the white south,
3:14
saying, oh no, actually slavery is great,
3:16
it helps everybody.
3:18
- [Becca] Right, so there was this kind of battle
3:20
within the literary community
3:22
about the peculiar institution of slavery.
3:24
Which one was it?
3:25
- [Kim] So what if, I'm illiterate, right.
3:28
I mean, not everybody in 19th century America
3:31
was a New England intellectual
3:33
who was reading Christian novels.
3:37
How would I have heard about Uncle Tom's Cabin?
3:39
- [Becca] That's a really good point, Kim.
3:40
So, Tom Shows were depictions of Uncle Tom's Cabin
3:44
in theaters around the world.
3:46
And so, they were often times put on by abolitionist people
3:49
trying to point out the issues with slavery today
3:53
and end slavery immediately.
3:56
- [Kim] So, this is before there's copyright law, right,
3:58
so you can just put on a show of anybody's novel
4:01
if you feel like it.
4:02
- [Becca] Exactly, but often times,
4:03
they really misconstrued the novel.
4:06
And actually, now are remembered as contributing
4:09
to the problem of racism in America.
4:12
- [Kim] Racial stereotypes, too, I would imagine,
4:14
because we still have this phrase Uncle Tom
4:17
kind of to mean
4:18
an African-American who is a martyr to the status quo
4:23
as opposed to someone who might fight against racism.
4:26
It seems like they might have borrowed
4:28
a lot of these stereotypes from minstrel shows
4:30
which were also very popular in this time period.
4:33
- [Becca] And some of the characters
4:34
within these minstrel shows
4:35
turned into the character that was remembered as Jim Crow,
4:39
which became the dominating racial order
4:41
after the Civil War.
4:43
So, in the Civil Rights era in the mid-1950's,
4:47
lots of activists actually wanted to completely reject
4:49
the progress that Uncle Tom's Cabin and these Tom Shows
4:52
had made because they actually reduced African Americans
4:55
to this terrible stereotype.
4:58
And so, later on, this kind of idea that
5:01
someone was an Uncle Tom became a racial slur, really,
5:04
and they then rejected Uncle Tom's Cabin
5:07
as being a tool towards racial equality
5:11
and more saw it as a part of the problem.
5:14
- [Kim] So, I think, the most important thing
5:16
about Uncle Tom's Cabin is that it's this catalyst
5:19
of really intense emotions about slavery
5:24
which in the 1850's will lead eventually to the Civil War.
5:28
And, following the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin,
5:31
you'll see more and more violence
5:33
on both sides of this issue.
5:35
For example, John Brown, this famous abolitionist
5:38
actually goes out to Kansas and murders people.
5:41
- [Becca] And I think that Lincoln was very astute
5:44
in pointing out that Uncle Tom's Cabin
5:46
really catalyzed a lot of this violence.
5:49
And he even met with Harriet Beecher Stowe,
5:51
so she earned herself a little meeting with
5:54
Abraham Lincoln.
5:55
(Kim laughing)
5:56
- [Kim] And he said,
5:57
""So you're the little lady that started this great war.""
6:03
I'm trying to think of another book that has started a war.
6:07
- [Becca] I think we would probably remember that.
6:10
But I do think Lincoln was really astute in pointing out
6:13
just how impactful this cultural phenomenon,
6:16
this Tom-mania was on the question of slavery
6:19
and on the fate of the American people.
6:22
And really, it just begged the question in a new way,
6:25
in this kind of public setting.
6:28
I mean, I just think that the book itself,
6:30
the way that the book could just travel
6:32
all around the United States
6:33
and so many different kinds of people
6:35
were able to read it and get their hands on it.
6:37
This really was just this movement of people
6:40
just thinking a lot about slavery,
6:42
reading a lot about slavery.
6:43
- [Kim] Yeah, well, I think after Uncle Tom's Cabin,
6:47
I don't think there was a way to not have an opinion
6:49
on the slavery issue.
6:51
Either you were for it,
6:53
or you were against it.
6:54
And that divisiveness would lead to the Civil War.
6:57
- [Becca] And again, there's this international focus.
6:59
There's a deeper, sectional divide
7:01
between the north and the south,
7:03
and there was this kind of sorting over the slavery question

0:00
- [Voiceover] Hello Grammarians. Hello Paige.
0:02
- [Paige] Hi, David.
0:03
- [Dave] So we have three different sentence
0:05
varieties that we're going to talk about today.
0:07
- [Paige] Okay.
0:08
- [Dave] Here are their three flavors.
0:10
Flavor number one, declarative sentences.
0:16
Flavor number two, interrogative sentences.
0:24
And flavor number three, imperative sentences.
0:29
Those are all pretty long and wibbly words.
0:32
- [Paige] Seriously.
0:32
- [Dave] But we will address each one of them in turn.
0:36
Paige, if you please, what is a declarative sentence?
0:40
- [Paige] A declarative sentence is a type
0:42
of sentence that just states a fact or an opinion,
0:47
I suppose, but it just makes a statement.
0:52
So that would be something like
0:53
it is a beautiful day.
0:57
- [Dave] It is a beautiful day, Paige.
0:59
We can also use declarative sentences
1:01
to get across any kind of information.
1:05
This is what we call exposition in writing.
1:07
- [Paige] Righ. Yeah.
1:08
- [Dave] So we can say Lavender hated baseball.
1:12
You know, you could start a short story with that.
1:14
- [Paige] Right, that's- - [Dave] I challenge you to.
1:16
- [Paige] Just a fact about Lavender.
1:18
- [Dave] That's a fact about Lavender.
1:19
So a declarative sentence is a statement.
1:22
Just straight up.
1:23
- [Paige] Yep.
1:24
- [Dave] An interrogative sentence is a question.
1:28
So it asks a question.
1:30
- [Paige] It's just a fancy word for a question.
1:32
- [Dave] Right. - [Paige] Okay.
1:33
- [Dave] So an example of an interrogative sentence
1:36
would be where did you go last night?
1:38
- [Paige] Right.
1:41
- [Dave] Or how is he still singing that note?
1:43
- [Paige] I have no idea.
1:44
- [Dave] Incredible breath control
1:45
So that's what an interrogative question is.
1:48
- [Paige] Right.
1:49
It's like being interrogated.
1:50
That's, like, a similar word to interrogative,
1:52
is just having a lot of questions asked.
1:54
- [Dave] Like really aggressively.
1:56
- [Paige] Yeah, it's not a very positive thing.
1:57
- [Dave] Paige, what did you do with the cheese?
1:59
- [Paige] I don't know. (laughs)
2:00
- [Dave] Paige, why are you still eating the cheese?
2:01
- [Paige] I'm not.
2:02
- [Dave] Paige, I know you stole the cheese.
2:03
Finally, the third kind of sentence
2:05
we want to talk about today is the imperative.
2:08
An imperative is a command.
2:12
- [Paige] Right, so when you tell someone to do something.
2:14
- [Dave] So a command like, Paige, follow that bunny!
2:18
(laughs)
2:20
- [Paige] And the bunny stole the cheese.
2:22
- [Dave] Yeah.
2:22
So this is one of those sentences that doesn't
2:25
have a subject that is literally spoken out loud.
2:29
- [Paige] Right, it's just implied.
2:30
You know, if you're saying that to me,
2:33
I know that I am the subject.
2:35
- [Dave] Right. So it's you follow that bunny.
2:37
- [Paige] Right.
2:38
- [Dave] But the you is just not spoken.
2:40
Or, if you're not into bunny following, you know,
2:43
something like remember to wash the dishes,
2:45
you're still being commanded to remember.
2:48
- [Paige] Yeah, yeah.
2:49
- [Dave] So, yeah, that's our, those are our
2:51
three sentence types.
2:52
- [Paige] Yeah.
2:53
Declarative is a statement.
2:55
Interrogative is a question,
2:56
and imperative is a command.
2:58
- [Dave] So, Paige, I think we can recast our slogan
3:01
in each of these three types of sentence.
3:03
- [Paige] Okay.
3:04
- [Dave] So, okay, so declarative, right?
3:06
That's what it usually is, declarative form is
3:09
you can learn anything.
3:11
- [Paige] Okay.
3:12
- [Dave] We can make it a question, so interrogative's
3:14
can you learn anything?
3:16
- [Paige] Right.
3:17
- [Dave] The answer is yes. - [Paige] Yes.
3:18
- [Dave] And the imperative, we wanna make it a command,
3:20
would be what, Paige?
3:21
- [Paige] Learn anything!
3:22
- [Dave] Yeah!
3:24
So you can do any of those three.
3:26
- [Paige] Sure.

khan_video_5RzDVNob0-0_23300,Aren't The commutative and associative laws kind of the same ?,MCQ,"•
0:00
Use the associative law of multiplication to write-- and
0:04
here they have 12 times 3 in parentheses, and then they
0:07
want us to multiply that times 10-- in a different way.
0:11
Simplify both expressions to show they
0:13
have identical results.
0:16
So the way that they wrote it is-- let me just rewrite it.
0:19
So they have 12 times 3 in parentheses, and then they
0:24
multiply that times 10.
0:26
Now whenever something is in parentheses, that means do
0:28
that first. So this literally says let's do the 12 times 3
0:33
first. Now, what is 12 times 3?
0:35
It's 36.
0:37
So this evaluates to 36, and then we still have that times
0:40
10 over there.
0:44
And we know the trick.
0:44
Whenever we multiply something times a power of ten, we just
0:48
add the number of zeroes that we have at the back of it, so
0:51
this is going to be 360.
0:54
This is going to be equal to 360.
0:59
Now, the associative law of multiplication, once again, it
1:03
sounds like a very fancy thing.
1:04
All that means is it doesn't matter how we associate the
1:08
multiplication or it doesn't matter how we put the
1:11
parentheses, we're going to get the same answer, so let me
1:14
write it down again.
1:15
If we were to do 12 times 3 times 10, if we just wrote it
1:22
like this without parentheses, if we just went left to right,
1:24
that would essentially be exactly what we just did here
1:27
on the left.
1:27
But the associative law of multiplication
1:29
says, you know what?
1:30
We can multiply the 3 times 10 first and then multiply the
1:34
12, and we're going to get the exact same answer as if we
1:38
multiplied the 12 times the 3 and then the 10.
1:40
So let's just verify it for ourselves.
1:43
So 3 times 10 is 30, and we still want to multiply the 12
1:50
times that.
1:51
Now, what's 12 times 30?
1:53
And we've seen this several times before.
1:55
You can view it as a 12 times 3, which is 36, but we still
1:59
have this 0 here.
2:00
So that is also equal to 360.
2:03
So it didn't matter how we associated the multiplication.
2:06
You can do the 12 times 3 first or you can do the 3
2:09
times 10 first. Either way, they both evaluated to 360.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,5RzDVNob0-0,
khan_video_oIZV-ixRTcY_192081,So why does the Moon not move towards the Earth in a staight line [like a stone does when it falls towards the (centre) of the Earth] and instead revolve around the Earth in a circular orbit?,Essay,"•
0:00
When you look at footage or photographs of astronauts
0:03
in space, it doesn't look like there's any gravity at work
0:06
here.
0:07
Everything is not falling down in one direction.
0:10
In fact, it's not even clear what up or down is.
0:12
Everything just floats around.
0:14
If I were to push off of this wall,
0:15
I would just float in that direction.
0:17
So it doesn't look like there's this overarching influence
0:22
like gravity that's trying to pull everything down.
0:26
But the question is that these astronauts are still
0:29
not too far away from a supermassive body.
0:32
In fact, the space shuttle gets up only a couple
0:36
of hundred miles above the surface of the Earth.
0:38
So the space shuttle, if I were to draw it to scale,
0:41
would probably be right about there.
0:43
And we know that the force of gravity between two objects
0:47
is equal to big G, the gravitational constant, times
0:51
the mass of the first object, times the mass
0:55
of the second object over the distance between the two
0:59
objects squared.
1:00
And if the space shuttle is right here,
1:02
only a few hundred miles above the surface of the Earth,
1:06
this r isn't that different.
1:08
It's a little bit further than if you
1:10
were at the surface of the Earth.
1:11
Remember that r is measured from wherever you are to the center,
1:16
from the center of the Earth, or really
1:17
the center of the object to the center of the Earth.
1:20
The center of the Earth represents most of the distance
1:22
here.
1:23
So if I'm at the surface of the Earth
1:25
or if I'm just a few hundred miles above the surface
1:27
of the Earth, it's not going to change r that dramatically,
1:30
especially in terms of percentage.
1:33
So when you look at it this way, it seems pretty clear
1:35
that the force of gravity for someone who
1:38
is in space only a few hundred miles above the Earth
1:42
should not be that different than the force of gravity
1:46
for someone who is on the surface of the Earth.
1:48
So my question to you is, what gives?
1:51
If there should be gravity in space,
1:53
how can we see all of these pictures
1:55
of people floating around like this?
1:58
And the answer is that there is gravity in space,
2:02
and that these people actually are falling.
2:05
They're just moving fast enough relative to the Earth
2:08
that they keep missing it.
2:09
And let me show you what I'm talking about there.
2:16
Let's say I'm sitting here in Africa,
2:18
and I were to shoot something, if maybe I
2:20
have a really good sling shot, and I
2:22
were to sling something super fast and maybe at a 45 degree
2:25
angle, it might take off a little bit
2:27
and eventually hit another point.
2:29
And this would actually already be a super duper slingshot.
2:32
I just made it travel a couple of thousand miles or at least
2:34
over 1,000 miles.
2:36
If I make it go a little bit faster,
2:38
if I put a little bit more force on,
2:40
if I just propelled the projectile a little bit faster,
2:43
it might go a little bit further,
2:45
but it will eventually fall back to the Earth.
2:47
Let's try to propel it a little bit faster than that.
2:50
Then it'll still fall to the Earth.
2:52
Let's propel it even faster than that.
2:54
Well then, it's still eventually going to fall to the Earth.
2:57
I think you might see where this is going.
2:59
Let's go even faster than that.
3:01
So if we go even faster than that,
3:02
eventually it'll fall to the Earth.
3:04
Even faster than that, so if you were
3:07
to throw an object even faster than that,
3:10
it would then go really far and then fall to the Earth.
3:14
I think you see what's happening.
3:15
Every time you go faster and faster,
3:17
you throw this projectile faster and faster,
3:20
it gets further and further, up to some velocity
3:24
that you release this projectile,
3:27
and whenever it's trying to fall to the Earth,
3:30
it's going so fast that it keeps missing the Earth.
3:32
So it'll keep going around and around and around the Earth,
3:36
and a projectile like that would essentially be in orbit.
3:40
So what's happening is if there was
3:42
no gravity for that projectile, if there was no gravity,
3:46
the projectile would just go straight away into space.
3:51
But because there's gravity, it's constantly pulling it
3:54
towards the center of the Earth, or the center
3:57
of that projectile and the center of the Earth
4:00
are being pulled towards each other,
4:01
I guess is a better way to think about it.
4:03
The force of gravity is doing that.
4:05
And so it's curving its path.
4:07
And if it's going fast enough, if the projectile or whatever
4:10
object we're talking about is going fast enough,
4:12
it'll just keep going round and round the Earth.
4:15
And since there is almost, pretty much, for most purposes
4:20
no air if you go high enough, especially the altitude
4:24
that the space shuttle is, no noticeable drag,
4:28
this thing can just keep on going
4:29
for a substantial amount of time.
4:31
Although there is just a little bit of drag,
4:33
and that's why over time you do have satellites slow down,
4:37
because there is just a little bit of air resistance.
4:39
So the answer to this conundrum is
4:42
that there actually is gravity.
4:45
It's not a gravity-free environment.
4:47
It's just that the astronauts and the space shuttle
4:50
and everything else that's in the space shuttle,
4:52
it's all falling, but it's moving
4:55
fast enough that it never hits the Earth.
4:57
It keeps missing the Earth.
4:58
It keeps going round and round and round,
5:01
but it is completely under the influence of gravity.
5:04
If they were to just slow themselves down,
5:07
if they were to just brake relative to the Earth,
5:11
and if they were to just put their brakes on right
5:14
over there, they would all just plummet to the Earth.
5:17
So there's nothing special about going 300 or 400 miles up
5:21
into space, that all of a sudden gravity disappears.
5:24
The influence of gravity, actually on some level,
5:26
it just keeps going.
5:27
You can't, it might become unnoticeably
5:29
small at some point, but definitely
5:31
for only a couple of hundred miles up in the air,
5:33
there is definitely gravity there.
5:35
It's just they're in orbit, they're going fast enough.
5:38
So if they just keep falling, they're
5:39
never going to hit the Earth.
5:41
And if you want to simulate gravity,
5:42
and this is actually how NASA does simulate gravity,
5:45
is that they will put people in a plane,
5:47
and they call it the vomit rocket
5:49
because it's known to make people sick,
5:51
and they'll make them go in a projectile motion.
5:54
So if this is the ground, in a projectile path
5:57
or in a parabolic path I should say,
5:59
so the plane will take off, and it
6:02
will do a path exactly the same as something in free fall
6:07
or in a parabolic path.
6:09
And so anyone who's sitting in that plane
6:11
will experience free fall.
6:13
So if you've ever been in, if you've ever right
6:16
when you jump off of a or if you've ever bungee
6:18
jumped or skydived or even the feeling
6:21
when a roller coaster is going right over the top,
6:23
and it's pulling you down, and your stomach
6:25
feels a little ill, that feeling of free fall, that's
6:28
the exact same feeling that these astronauts feel
6:31
because they're in a constant state of free fall.
6:34
But that is an indistinguishable feeling from,
6:37
if you were just in deep space and you weren't anywhere close
6:40
any noticeable mass, that is an identical feeling that you
6:45
would feel to having no gravitational force around you.
6:50
So hopefully that clarifies things a little bit.
6:52
To someone who's just sitting in the space shuttle,
6:54
and if they had no windows, there's
6:56
no way of them knowing whether they
6:58
are close to a massive object and they're just
7:00
in free fall around it, they're in orbit, or whether they're
7:03
just completely far away from any massive object,
7:06
and they really are in a state of or in a place
7:09
where there's very little gravity.",Khan Academy Video,Social Studies,,,data/khan/predicted_video_questions,oIZV-ixRTcY,

But it's all about what's happening in this instant.
1:37
And to think about why that is not a super easy problem
1:40
to address with traditional algebra, let's
1:42
draw a little graph here.
1:44
So on this axis I'll have distance.
1:49
I'll say y is equal to distance.
1:51
I could have said d is equal to distance,
1:53
but we'll see, especially later on in calculus,
1:55
d is reserved for something else.
1:57
We'll say y is equal to distance.
1:59
And in this axis, we'll say time.
2:01
And I could say t is equal to time,
2:02
but I'll just say x is equal to time.
2:07
And so if we were to plot Usain Bolt's distance
2:09
as a function of time, well at time zero
2:12
he hasn't gone anywhere.
2:13
He is right over there.
2:16
And we know that this gentleman is
2:17
capable of traveling 100 meters in 9.58 seconds.
2:23
So after 9.58 seconds, we'll assume
2:25
that this is in seconds right over here,
2:27
he's capable of going 100 meters.
2:32
And so using this information, we
2:33
can actually figure out his average speed.
2:37
Let me write it this way, his average speed
2:41
is just going to be his change in distance
2:46
over his change in time.
2:50
And using the variables that are over here,
2:52
we're saying y is distance.
2:53
So this is the same thing as change
2:54
in y over change in x from this point to that point.
2:59
And this might look somewhat familiar to you
3:01
from basic algebra.
3:02
This is the slope between these two points.
3:05
If I have a line that connects these two points,
3:11
this is the slope of that line.
3:13
The change in distance is this right over here.
3:15
Change in y is equal to 100 meters.
3:19
And our change in time is this right over here.
3:22
So our change in time is equal to 9.58 seconds.
3:27
We started at 0, we go to 9.58 seconds.
3:30
Another way to think about it, the rise over the run you might
3:33
have heard in your algebra class.
3:34
It's going to be 100 meters over 9.58 seconds.
3:37
So this is 100 meters over 9.58 seconds.
3:43
And the slope is essentially just rate of change,
3:45
or you could view it as the average rate
3:47
of change between these two points.
3:49
And you'll see, if you even just follow the units,
3:51
it gives you units of speed here.
3:54
It would be velocity if we also specified the direction.
3:57
And we can figure out what that is,
3:58
let me get the calculator out.
4:02
So let me get the calculator on the screen.
4:06
So we're going 100 meters in the 9.58 seconds.
4:13
So it's 10.4, I'll just write 10.4, I'll round to 10.4.
4:17
So it's approximately 10.4, and then the units
4:20
are meters per second.
4:23
And that is his average speed.
4:26
And what we're going to see in a second
4:28
is how average speed is different
4:31
than instantaneous speed.
4:32
How it's different than what the speed
4:34
he might be going at any given moment.
4:36
And just to have a concept of how fast this is,
4:38
let me get the calculator back.
4:40
This is in meters per second.
4:41
If you wanted to know how many meters he's going in an hour,
4:43
well there's 3,600 seconds in an hour.
4:48
So he'll be able to go this many meters 3,600 times.
4:51
So that's how many meters he can,
4:53
if he were able to somehow keep up that speed in an hour.
4:56
This is how fast he's going meters per hour.
4:58
And then, if you were to say how many miles per hour,
5:01
there's roughly 1600-- and I don't know the exact number,
5:03
but roughly 1600 meters per mile.
5:06
So let's divide it by 1600.
5:08
And so you see that this is roughly a little over 23,
5:11
about 23 and 1/2 miles per hour.
5:14
So this is approximately, and I'll
5:16
write it this way-- this is approximately 23.5 miles
5:28
per hour.
5:29
And relative to a car, not so fast.
5:31
But relative to me, extremely fast.
5:34
Now to see how this is different than instantaneous velocity,
5:38
let's think about a potential plot of his distance
5:41
relative to time.
5:42
He's not going to just go this speed immediately.
5:44
He's not just going to go as soon as the gun fires,
5:46
he's not just going to go 23 and 1/2 miles per hour all the way.
5:49
He's going to accelerate.
5:51
So at first he's going to start off going a little bit slower.
5:54
So the slope is going to be a little bit lot lower
5:56
than the average slope.
5:57
He's going to go a little bit slower,
5:58
then he's going to start accelerating.
6:00
And so his speed, and you'll see the slope here
6:02
is getting steeper and steeper and steeper.
6:05
And then maybe near the end he starts tiring off a little bit.
6:09
And so his distance plotted against time
6:11
might be a curve that looks something like this.
6:14
And what we calculated here is just
6:15
the average slope across this change in time.
6:20
What we could see at any given moment
6:21
the slope is actually different.
6:23
In the beginning, he has a slower rate
6:26
of change of distance.
6:28
Then over here, then he accelerates over here,
6:30
it seems like his rate of change of distance, which
6:32
would be roughly-- or you could view it
6:34
as the slope of the tangent line at that point,
6:36
it looks higher than his average.
6:38
And then he starts to slow down again.
6:40
When you average it out, it gets to 23 and 1/2 miles per hour.
6:43
And I looked it up, Usain Bolt's instantaneous velocity,
6:46
his peak instantaneous velocity, is actually
6:49
closer to 30 miles per hour.
6:51
So the slope over here might be 23 whatever miles per hour.
6:54
But the instantaneous, his fastest point
6:57
in this 9.58 seconds is closer to 30 miles per hour.
7:01
But you see it's not a trivial thing to do.
7:03
You could say, OK, let me try to approximate the slope right
7:06
over here.
7:07
And you could do that by saying, OK, well,
7:09
what is the change in y over the change of x right around this?
7:13
So you could say, well, let me take some change of x,
7:18
and figure out what the change of y is around it,
7:20
or as we go past that.
7:23
So you get that.
7:23
But that would just be an approximation,
7:25
because you see that the slope of this curve
7:27
is constantly changing.
7:28
So what you want to do is see what
7:30
happens as your change of x gets smaller
7:32
and smaller and smaller.
7:33
As your change of x get smaller and smaller and smaller,
7:35
you're going to get a better and better approximation.
7:37
Your change of y is going to get smaller
7:39
and smaller and smaller.
7:40
So what you want to do, and we're
7:41
going to go into depth into all of this,
7:43
and study it more rigorously, is you
7:44
want to take the limit as delta x approaches
7:49
0 of your change in y over your change in x.
7:57
And when you do that, you're going
8:00
to approach that instantaneous rate of change.
8:02
You could view it as the instantaneous slope
8:04
at that point in the curve.
8:06
Or the slope of the tangent line at that point in the curve.
8:08
Or if we use calculus terminology,
8:10
we would view that as the derivative.
8:12
So the instantaneous slope is the derivative.
8:17
And the notation we use for the derivative is a dy over dx.
8:22
And that's why I reserved the letter y.
8:24
And then you say, well, how does this
8:25
relate to the word differential?
8:28
Well, the word differential is relating--
8:30
this dy is a differential, dx is a differential.
8:33
And one way to conceptualize it, this
8:35
is an infinitely small change in y
8:37
over an infinitely small change in x.
8:40
And by getting super, super small changes in y
8:42
over change in x, you're able to get your instantaneous slope.
8:46
Or in the case of this example, the instantaneous speed
8:49
of Usain Bolt right at that moment.
8:53
And notice, you can't just put a 0 here.
8:55
If you just put change in x is zero,
8:56
you're going to get something that's undefined.
8:58
You can't divide by 0.
9:00
So we take the limit as it approaches 0.
9:02
And we'll define that more rigorously

Wittenberg, 1536

###The Protestant Reformation
Today there are many types of Protestant Churches. For example, Baptist is currently the largest denomination in the United States but there are many dozens more. How did this happen? Where did they all begin? To understand the Protestant Reform movement, we need to go back in history to the early 16th century when there was only one church in Western Europe - what we would now call the Roman Catholic Church - under the leadership of the Pope in Rome. Today, we call this ""Roman Catholic"" because there are so many other types of churches (ie Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, Calvinist, Anglican - you get the idea).

###The Church and the State
So, if we go back to the year 1500, the Church (what we now call the Roman Catholic Church) was very powerful (politically and spiritually) in Western Europe (and in fact ruled over significant territory in Italy called the Papal States). But there were other political forces at work too. There was the Holy Roman Empire (largely made up of German speaking regions ruled by princes, dukes and electors), the Italian city-states, England, as well as the increasingly unified nation states of France and Spain (among others). The power of the rulers of these areas had increased in the previous century and many were anxious to take the opportunity offered by the Reformation to weaken the power of the papacy (the office of the Pope) and increase their own power in relation to the Church in Rome and other rulers.

Keep in mind too, that for some time the Church had been seen as an institution plagued by internal power struggles (at one point in the late 1300s and 1400s church was ruled by three Popes simultaneously). Popes and Cardinals often lived more like kings than spiritual leaders. Popes claimed temporal (political) as well as spiritual power. They commanded armies, made political alliances and enemies, and, sometimes, even waged war. Simony (the selling of Church offices) and nepotism (favoritism based on family relationships) were rampant. Clearly, if the Pope was concentrating on these worldly issues, there wasn't as much time left for caring for the souls of the faithful. The corruption of the Church was well known, and several attempts had been made to reform the Church (notably by John Wyclif and Jan Hus), but none of these efforts successfully challenged Church practice until Martin Luther's actions in the early 1500s.

###Martin Luther
Martin Luther was a German monk and Professor of Theology at the University of Wittenberg. Luther sparked the Reformation in 1517 by posting, at least according to tradition, his ""95 Theses"" on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany - these theses were a list of statements that expressed Luther's concerns about certain Church practices - largely the sale of indulgences, but they were based on Luther's deeper concerns with Church doctrine. Before we go on, notice that the word Protestant contains the word ""protest"" and that reformation contains the word ""reform"" - this was an effort, at least at first, to protest some practices of the Catholic Church and to reform that Church,

###Indulgences
The sale of indulgences was a practice where the church acknowledged a donation or other charitable work with a piece of paper (an indulgence), that certified that your soul would enter heaven more quickly by reducing your time in purgatory. If you committed no serious sins that guaranteed your place in hell, and you died before repenting and atoning for all of your sins, then your soul went to Purgatory - a kind of way-station where you finished atoning for your sins before being allowed to enter heaven.

Pope Leo X had granted indulgences to raise money for the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. These indulgences were being sold by Johann Tetzel not far from Wittenberg, where Luther was Professor of Theology. Luther was gravely concerned about the way in which getting into heaven was connected with a financial transaction. But the sale of indulgences was not Luther's only disagreement with the institution of the Church.

###Faith Alone
Martin Luther was very devout and had experienced a spiritual crisis. He concluded that no matter how ""good"" he tried to be, no matter how he tried to stay away from sin, he still found himself having sinful thoughts. He was fearful that no matter how many good works he did, he could never do enough to earn his place in heaven (remember that, according to the Catholic Church, doing good works, for example commissioning works of art for the Church, helped one gain entrance to heaven). This was a profound recognition of the inescapable sinfulness of the human condition. After all, no matter how kind and good we try to be, we all find ourselves having thoughts which are unkind and sometimes much worse. Luther found a way out of this problem when he read St. Paul, who wrote ""The just shall live by faith"" (Romans 1:17). Luther understood this to mean that those who go to heaven (the just) will get there by faith alone - not by doing good works. In other words, God's grace is something freely given to human beings, not something we can earn. For the Catholic Church on the other hand, human beings, through good works, had some agency in their salvation.

###Scripture Alone
Luther (and other reformers) turned to the Bible as the only reliable source of instruction (as opposed to the teachings of the Church). The invention of the printing press in the middle of the 15th century (by Gutenberg in Mainz, Germany) together with the translation of the Bible into the vernacular (the common languages of French, Italian, German, English, etc.) meant that it was possible for those that could read to learn directly from Bible without having to rely on a priest or other church officials. Before this time, the Bible was available in Latin, the ancient language of Rome spoken chiefly by the clergy. Before the printing press, books were handmade and extremely expensive. The invention of the printing press and the translation of the bible into the vernacular meant that for the first time in history, the Bible was available to those outside of the Church. And now, a direct relationship to God, unmediated by the institution of the Catholic Church, was possible.

When Luther and other reformers looked to the words of the Bible (and there were efforts at improving the accuracy of these new translations based on early Greek manuscripts), they found that many of the practices and teachings of the Church about how we achieve salvation didn't match Christ's teaching. This included many of the Sacraments, including Holy Communion (also known as the Eucharist). According to the Catholic Church, the miracle of Communion is transubstantiation - when the priest administers the bread and wine, they change (the prefix ""trans"" means to change) their substance into the body and blood of Christ. Luther denied that anything changed during Holy Communion. Luther thereby challenged one of the central sacraments of the Catholic Church, one of its central miracles, and thereby one of the ways that human beings can achieve grace with God, or salvation.

###The Counter-Reformation
The Church initially ignored Martin Luther, but Luther's ideas (and variations of them, including Calvinism) quickly spread throughout Europe. He was asked to recant (to disavow) his writings at the Diet of Worms (an unfortunate name for a council held by the Holy Roman Emperor in the German city of Worms). When Luther refused, he was excommunicated (in other words, expelled from the church). The Church's response to the threat from Luther and others during this period is called the Counter-Reformation (""counter"" meaning against).

###The Council of Trent
In 1545 the Church opened the Council of Trent to deal with the issues raised by Luther. The Council of Trent was an assembly of high officials in the Church who met (on and off for eighteen years) principally in the Northern Italian town of Trent for 25 sessions.

##Selected Outcomes of the Council of Trent:
1. The Council denied the Lutheran idea of justification by faith. They affirmed, in other words, their Doctrine of Merit, which allows human beings to redeem themselves through Good Works, and through the sacraments.

2. They affirmed the existence of Purgatory and the usefulness of prayer and indulgences in shortening a person's stay in purgatory.

3. They reaffirmed the belief in transubstantiation and the importance of all seven sacraments

4. They reaffirmed the authority of both scripture the teachings and traditions of the Church

5. They reaffirmed the necessity and correctness of religious art (see below)

###The Council of Trent on Religious Art
At the Council of Trent, the Church also reaffirmed the usefulness of images - but indicated that church officials should be careful to promote the correct use of images and guard against the possibility of idolatry. The council decreed that images are useful ""because the honour which is shown them is referred to the prototypes which those images represent"" (in other words, through the images we honor the holy figures depicted). And they listed another reason images were useful, ""because the miracles which God has performed by means of the saints, and their salutary examples, are set before the eyes of the faithful; that so they may give God thanks for those things; may order their own lives and manners in imitation of the saints; and may be excited to adore and love God, and to cultivate piety.""

###Violence
The Reformation was a very violent period in Europe, even family members were often pitted against one another in the wars of religion. Each side, both Catholics and Protestants, were often absolutely certain that they were in the right and that the other side was doing the devil's work.

The artists of this period - Michelangelo in Rome, Titian in Venice, Durer in Nuremberg, Cranach in Saxony - were impacted by these changes since the Church had been the single largest patron for artists. And now art was now being scrutinized in an entirely new way. The Catholic Church was looking to see if art communicated the stories of the Bible effectively and clearly (see Veronese's Feast in the House of Levi for more on this). Protestants on the other hand, for the most part lost the patronage of the Church and religious images (sculptures, paintings, stained glass windows etc) were destroyed in iconoclastic riots.

###Other developments
It is also during this period that the Scientific Revolution gained momentum and observation of the natural world replaced religious doctrine as the source of our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Copernicus up-ended the ancient Greek model of the heavens by suggesting that the sun was at the center of the solar system and that the planets orbited around it.

At the same time, exploration, colonization and (the often forced) Christianization of what Europe called the ""new world"" continued. By the end of the century, the world of the Europeans was a lot bigger and opinions about that world were more varied and more uncertain than they had been for centuries. 

Please note, this tutorial focuses on Western Europe. There are other forms of Christianity in other parts of the world including for example the Eastern Orthodox Church.
