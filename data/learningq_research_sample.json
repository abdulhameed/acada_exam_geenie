    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn talking about the adaptive immune system, we've already\n0:04\nseen that there's a couple of actors.\n0:16\nYou have your humoral response.\n0:20\nSo this is responding to things that are floating\n0:22\naround in the fluids of the body and not necessarily\n0:24\nthings that have infiltrated your body cells and then you\n0:27\nhave your cell mediated response.\n0:35\nAnd then in the humoral response-- and we're talking\n0:38\nabout specific humoral response-- this is where the B\n0:40\ncells, the B lymphocytes are at their most active.\n0:45\nAnd essentially what they do is, you got a B cell here.\n0:48\nIt has a very specific antibody, specific to just\n0:52\nthis B cell, not B cells in general.\n0:55\nIf this happens to be the one of the billions of B cells\n0:59\nthat happens to have the matching key-- or maybe I\n1:02\nshould say the matching lock for the key that is the\n1:05\nintruding pathogen-- that pathogen will\n1:09\nbind to that B cell.\n1:11\nMaybe it's a virus, maybe it's a bacteria.\n1:14\nAnd then the B cell will get activated and we'll talk about\n1:17\nin this video that the activation\n1:19\ndoesn't always happen.\n1:20\nIn fact, it usually doesn't happen just from this, but so\n1:23\nfar we've said it gets activated, it goes into memory\n1:28\nB cells, which are essentially multiple versions of this\n1:31\noriginal B cell-- just saying, hey, let's have multiple\n1:33\nversions of this-- because it tends to recognize this virus.\n1:36\nSo in the future if we get this virus, those multiple\n1:39\nversions, those memory cells are going to be there to have\n1:42\nthis interaction.\n1:43\nThis interaction's going to be more likely to happen in the\n1:45\nfuture because I'm going to have more of this\n1:47\nvariety of B cell.\n1:48\nAnd then you have effector cells.\n1:53\nAnd these are essentially-- so both of these are B cells.\n1:56\nSo this guy, once he gets activated, he proliferates,\n2:00\nkeeps dividing and cloning himself.\n2:02\nThe memory cells just stick around waiting to be activated\n2:05\nin the future.\n2:06\nAnd I'm only drawing one of these membrane bound\n2:10\nantibodies, but there are actually 10,000 on them.\n2:13\nI mean, I could draw a bunch of these.\n2:15\nI don't have to just draw one.\n2:17\nThe memories just wade around in the future, but there's\n2:19\nmore of them now.\n2:19\nSo in the future, if we get this virus again, this\n2:23\ninteraction's going to happen faster and so they're going to\n2:26\nget activated faster.\n2:27\nAnd then the effector B cells essentially turn\n2:32\ninto antibody factories.\n2:35\nThis antibody goes in and it says, let me just produce--\n2:39\nI've been activated.\n2:39\nLet me produce many, many more versions\n2:42\nof that exact antibody.\n2:44\nSo they get spit out.\n2:46\nI drew that one little wrong.\n2:48\nSo that exact antibody, that can then be spit out to go\n2:53\ndisable or tag antigens-- and not just any antigen-- this\n2:57\nantigen right here.\n3:00\nAnd we also saw that the other thing that the B cell does is\n3:03\nit becomes an antigen presenting cell.\n3:06\nSo what it does is, as soon as it recognizes this, it's had\n3:11\nthis interaction with an antigen that just matches the\n3:14\nvariable portion of its membrane bound antibody.\n3:17\nIt endocytosizes that.\n3:19\nIt brings that into itself.\n3:22\nIt's membrane facilitated so it just kind of pulls it in,\n3:25\nchunks it up, and then presents a piece of that\n3:27\nantibody on an MHC II molecule.\n3:31\nWe saw that in the last video.\n3:33\nSo it cuts that up and presents a piece of it right\n3:36\nthere and that's why we call it an antigen presenting cell.\n3:39\nNow in this video, we're going to talk about why we even have\n3:42\nthese MHC II molecules.\n3:44\nWhat are we presenting these antigens to?\n3:47\nSo we're going to start talking about the cell\n3:48\nmediated-- and actually, even more than the cell mediated,\n3:50\nwe're going to talk about T cells.\n3:56\nAnd I said in the first video, they're called T cells because\n3:59\nthey mature in the thymus.\n4:07\nAnd there are two types of T cells and it's all very\n4:09\nconfusing because you have B cells and T cells, but then\n4:11\nthere are two types of T cells.\n4:13\nYou have helper T cells-- and most people just write T with\n4:18\na lower-case or subscript h there.\n4:21\nAnd then you have cytotoxic T cells-- or T cells that kill\n4:26\nother cells.\n4:32\nNow just so that you have a big, overarching impression of\n4:36\nwhat does what-- B cells.\n4:39\nWhen they are activated, they generate antibodies.\n4:43\nAt 30,000 feet, that's the best summary of what an\n4:46\nactivated B cell does.\n4:47\nIt actually generate antibodies.\n4:49\nThose antibodies attach to viruses and bacteria and other\n4:53\ntypes of pathogens and disables them-- either tags\n4:55\nthem so that macrophages can go and eat them up or just by\n5:02\nthrowing all of those antibodies on to the surface\n5:06\nof the pathogen in question.\n5:08\nIt might disable the pathogens or essentially bundle them\n5:11\naltogether so that it'll be easier for macrophages to pick\n5:14\nthem up, but this is only effective for things that are\n5:17\nfloating around.\n5:19\nFree floating antibodies are only effective for things that\n5:21\nare floating around.\n5:24\nCytotoxic T cells, which I'll cover in more detail in a\n5:27\nfuture video-- these actually attack cells that have been\n5:32\ninfiltrated.\n5:34\nSo this is attack, kill, infiltrated cells-- and when I\n5:42\nsay infiltrated, it could be a cell that a virus has gone\n5:45\ninto or some bacteria has penetrated it.\n5:47\nAnd when I say infiltrated, it doesn't necessarily even mean\n5:49\nsomething from the outside.\n5:50\nIt could even be a cancerous cell that shows itself to be\n5:53\nabnormal in some way and so the cytotoxic T cells will at\n5:57\nleast attempt to kill them.\n5:59\nBut what I want to focus on-- out of the three types of\n6:02\nlymphocytes-- remember, everything we've been talking\n6:06\nabout was leukocytes, white blood cells, but lymphocytes\n6:09\nare a subset of that and these three are lymphocytes.\n6:12\nAnd they're called that because they began their\n6:14\ndevelopment in the bone marrow.\n6:18\nSo this guy and this guy actually do stuff.\n6:24\nThis guy generates antibodies that attach to pathogens\n6:27\nfloating around.\n6:28\nThis guy directly attacks cells that are\n6:31\nbroken in some way.\n6:32\nThey've either been infiltrated, they're abnormal,\n6:34\nthey're cancerous-- who knows what.\n6:36\nAnd I'll do a whole video on that, but that leads us to a\n6:39\nvery obvious question.\n6:40\nWhat does this guy do?\n6:42\nWhat does the helper T cell do if he doesn't directly\n6:47\ninterface either with pathogens or produce things\n6:50\nthat interface with pathogens-- or if he himself\n6:53\ndoesn't go and directly kill cells?\n6:55\nAnd the answer is that the helper T cell's kind of the\n6:58\nalarm of the immune system.\n7:01\nAnd on some level, it's almost the most important.\n7:03\nSo we talked already in the last video about antigen\n7:08\npresenting cells-- that either when a macrophage or a\n7:11\ndendritic cell takes things in, it cuts them up and\n7:15\npresents it on its surface as these MHC II proteins or in\n7:19\ncomplex with these MHC II complexes or proteins.\n7:24\nAnd so do B cells.\n7:27\nB cells are more specific.\n7:28\nNow, once something is presented, now the helper T\n7:33\ncell can come into the picture.\n7:34\nSo this is a-- let me do a dendritic cell-- and I'm doing\n7:39\ndendritic cells actually on purpose because dendritic\n7:42\ncells are actually the best cells at\n7:45\nactivating helper T cells.\n7:46\nWe're going to talk about in a second what happens when a\n7:49\nhelper T cell gets activated.\n7:51\nSo let's say I have this dendritic cell.\n7:54\nIt's called dendritic so it looks like it has\n7:55\ndendrites on it.\n8:01\nSo I have this dendritic cell here.\n8:03\nIt's a phagocyte.\n8:06\nLet's say it's already consumed some type of bacteria\n8:10\nor virus and it's cut it up and now it's presenting kind\n8:14\nof the body parts of that virus on the MHC II complex.\n8:23\nIt's kind of its way of saying, hey, I found this\n8:25\nshady thing floating around in the body's tissues.\n8:29\nMaybe someone ought to raise an alarm.\n8:32\nMaybe this is part of some type of bigger thing going on\n8:35\nand some type of alarm bell has to be released.\n8:37\nAnd that's what the helper T cell does.\n8:40\nSo let's say this guy-- he's presented it.\n8:42\nHe says, I found this thing.\n8:43\nI killed it.\n8:43\nHere's a part of it.\n8:44\nThe helper T cell has a T cell receptor on it.\n8:49\nLet's say this is the helper T cell right here.\n8:55\nAnd it has a T cell receptor on it and the T cell receptors\n9:00\nbond to-- and I'll be very particular here.\n9:03\nSo this is the T cell receptor.\n9:07\nIt's just like a protein, but like the membrane bound\n9:11\nantibodies on B cells that every B cell or almost every B\n9:16\ncell has a different version, different variable chain,\n9:18\nthat's also true of helper T cells-- that just like the B\n9:24\ncells, this has some variation in where it binds.\n9:27\nSo this right here is going to be variable from one helper T\n9:31\ncell to another.\n9:31\nFor example, I might have another helper T cell here.\n9:35\nThat also has a T cell receptor, but the variable\n9:41\nportion on that T cell receptor is different than the\n9:47\nvariable portion on this T cell receptor.\n9:49\nSo this helper T cell will not bind to this dendritic cell or\n9:55\nthe MHC II complex of this dendritic cell.\n9:58\nOnly this one would.\n9:59\nAnd the mechanism of how you get this variation is very\n10:02\nsimilar to the mechanism in how you get the variation on\n10:05\nthe antibodies and the B cells.\n10:07\nDuring these helper T cells' development, at some point the\n10:12\ngenes that code for this part of this receptor get shuffled\n10:15\naround and they get shuffled around intentionally so that\n10:18\neach T cell has a certain specificity to a combination\n10:23\nof an MHC II complex and a certain polypeptide, a certain\n10:28\npart of a virus.\n10:29\nSo only this guy's going to be activated, not this guy.\n10:32\nSo this is why we call it the specific immune system.\n10:35\nNow we said, what does that helper T\n10:36\ncell do at that point?\n10:40\nHe said, hey, I happen to be the one helper T cell that can\n10:44\nbond to this guy, this antigen that's presented.\n10:46\nIt becomes activated.\n10:49\nAnd I won't go into the details, but in general,\n10:51\ndendritic cells are the best ones at activating it,\n10:54\nespecially a naive T cell.\n11:02\nIn general, when we talk about a naive B cell or a naive\n11:05\nhelper T cell, these are cells that are non-memory,\n11:08\nnon-effector, that have never been touched by-- they've\n11:11\nnever been activated, in the case of a B cell.\n11:14\nThey've never been activated by something binding to their\n11:18\nmembrane bound antibody-- or a naive helper T cell is a\n11:23\nnon-effector, non-memory helper T cell that's never had\n11:26\nanything bound to it.\n11:28\nSo if this guy is naive and then he finally has a reaction\n11:33\nwith this antigen presenting cell, he becomes non-naive.\n11:37\nHe becomes activated and when activated, two things happen.\n11:41\nWell, just like with B cells, he proliferates many, many,\n11:44\nmany copies of himself and some subset of those copies\n11:48\ndifferentiate into effector cells.\n11:54\nAnd effector just means it does something.\n11:56\nIt does something now instead of saving the memory.\n12:01\nAnd then some subset of them become memory helper T cells\n12:08\nafter getting activated.\n12:12\nNow the memory T cells, just like memory B cells-- now you\n12:15\nhave more copies of this.\n12:16\nSo in 10 years in the future, if something like this\n12:17\nhappens, this interaction's going to be\n12:19\nmore likely to happen.\n12:20\nThese guys have the same T cell receptor as their parent.\n12:33\nIt's just that the memory T cells-- or actually even the\n12:36\nmemory B cells-- they last longer.\n12:38\nThey don't kill themselves.\n12:39\nThey'll last for years so that if 10 years later, something\n12:42\nlike this starts presenting itself, you're going to have\n12:44\nmore of these guys around to bump into this guy so that you\n12:47\ncan raise the alarm bells.\n12:49\nThis guy's also going to have the same chain right there.\n12:56\nSo you're saying, fine.\n12:57\nI have these memory cells.\n12:58\nThey're going to stick around so that this reaction can\n13:00\nhappen in the future, but I still haven't answered the\n13:02\nquestion, what does the effector T cell do?\n13:05\nWhat the effector T cell does is it raises the alarm.\n13:16\nSo there's an effector T cell.\n13:18\nIt has been activated.\n13:22\nRemember, this is very particular.\n13:23\nOnly this version of T cells, but once it got activated, it\n13:27\nproduced many copies of itself because it says, hey, I'm\n13:29\nresponding to a particular type of pathogen.\n13:32\nSo that this is a helper T cell.\n13:34\nThis is an effector.\n13:37\nAnd what these do is they start releasing these\n13:39\nmolecules called cytokines.\n13:42\nSo they start releasing cytokines.\n13:50\nThere are many, many different types of cytokines and I'm not\n13:52\ngoing to go into detail on all that, but what cytokines do is\n13:56\nthat they really raise the alarm.\n13:58\nSo if you have other activated lymphatic cells or other\n14:03\nactivated immunological cells-- when the cytokines\n14:07\nenter those cells-- remember, cytokines\n14:08\nare really just proteins.\n14:10\nWhen the cytokines enter-- or polypeptides-- when they enter\n14:14\nthose cells, it makes them get in gear.\n14:17\nIt makes them multiply more often or it makes them get\n14:21\nmore active in their immune response.\n14:24\nSo what this does-- these cytokines you can view as\n14:26\nchemical alarm bells chemical or peptide alarm bells alarm\n14:34\nbells it it tells everyone to get in gear.\n14:38\nSo that's one role, and so you can see this is actually a\n14:40\nvery central role and it'll tell both activated cytotoxic\n14:45\nT cells to get in gear, which we haven't talked about yet.\n14:47\nAnd it'll also tell B cells to keep proliferating.\n14:50\nSo when an activated B cell gets some of-- so this is an\n14:53\nactivated B cell.\n14:55\nWhen it gets some of these cytokines, that maybe come\n14:58\nfrom a local helper T cell, it'll tell it, hey no, divide\n15:01\nmore often.\n15:02\nDivide more often.\n15:03\nOnly if you've been activated already.\n15:04\nAnd we'll talk more about why it has to be that case,\n15:07\nbecause you don't want all the B cells to be activated.\n15:10\nAnd the other thing that the effector T cell does-- in the\n15:13\nB cell discussion, I said, OK, if I have a B cell, and it has\n15:21\nits membrane bound antibody, has its\n15:24\nmembrane bound antibody.\n15:25\nAnd remember, this is a particular version, it has its\n15:29\nparticular variable chain right here.\n15:31\nAnd this guy binds to a pathogen.\n15:34\nSo this binds to a pathogen.\n15:36\nMaybe it's a virus right there.\n15:38\nUp to now, I've been saying that this guy's activated.\n15:41\nAnd he's going to-- well, when he binds to the pathogen he'll\n15:44\ntake this in and he'll take part of the pathogen and cut\n15:49\nit up and place it on an MHC II molecule.\n15:55\nAnd we said, then he'll be activated.\n15:57\nHe'll proliferate and he'll differentiate into memory and\n16:00\neffector B cells-- but that's not quite true.\n16:02\nThis first stage happens.\n16:04\nThis guy bonds.\n16:05\nThis B cell happened to be specific to this virus.\n16:08\nCuts up the virus.\n16:10\nPuts parts of the virus on its surface and presents parts of\n16:13\nthe antigen.\n16:14\nBut in most cases, this B cell isn't yet activated.\n16:19\nYou can kind of view it as in its resting state, ready to be\n16:22\nactivated, but it hasn't started proliferating and\n16:24\ndifferentiating into effector and memory molecules yet.\n16:27\nAnd in order for that to happen, an activated helper T\n16:36\ncell that is also specific to this very same virus-- so you\n16:40\ncould imagine someplace else in the cell-- this virus was\n16:45\neaten by a dendritic cell.\n16:52\nSo this exact same virus, this exact same species of virus,\n16:55\nis eaten by that dendritic cell and so the dendritic cell\n16:59\neats it up, it cuts it up, and then it presents it-- it's\n17:05\nantigen presenting so it presents it just like that.\n17:10\nThen this will activate a very specific T\n17:12\ncell, maybe that one.\n17:14\nSo a very specific T cell will come and bump into it.\n17:20\nNot just any T cell, the one with the\n17:23\nright variable portion.\n17:24\nSo think about what's happening.\n17:25\nThe variable portion for this T cell, it connects to this\n17:33\npart of the virus plus the MHC II, but it's really reacting\n17:38\nto the same virus.\n17:39\nIt might be a different part.\n17:40\nThis little part that was cut off might be someplace inside\n17:43\nthe virus while the epitope for the B cell might be some\n17:47\nplace on the outside of the virus, but they're both\n17:50\nspecific to the same virus.\n17:53\nNow once this guy gets activated and he starts\n17:56\nproducing memory and effector cells-- or they're descended\n17:59\nfrom him, one of those effector cells specific to\n18:02\nthis virus are needed to come bind to this guy.\n18:06\nSo then this guy could then go along and bump around and\n18:09\neventually end up here.\n18:11\nAnd he is also specific to this virus.\n18:14\nSo this binding site right here is the same as this\n18:16\nbinding site.\n18:17\nThis combination of antigen plus MHC II.\n18:21\nAnd so when this guy binds-- and remember, this binding\n18:29\nsite is the same as this and it only binds to this\n18:31\ncombination right here-- this is what activates the B cell\n18:36\nin most cases.\n18:37\nThis is T-dependent activation, which\n18:41\nis usually the case.\n18:42\nSometimes all you need is this first thing, but in general\n18:45\nyou need the first thing and then you also need a T cell to\n18:48\ncome and activate it, and only then will the B cell get\n18:52\nactivated and start proliferating and dividing and\n18:55\ndifferentiating itself and producing-- when its effector\n18:58\ncells will produce a lot of antibodies.\n19:00\nAnd so there's a natural question.\n19:01\nWhy do biological systems-- or why do we\n19:04\nhave this double system?\n19:05\nAnd at least my sense of it is, it's a failsafe mechanism.\n19:10\nIf every time a virus came and attached this, this guy just\n19:13\nstarted going crazy and producing antibodies against\n19:15\nthis thing, there's some chance that maybe after\n19:20\ndevelopment, this chain right here or his genes for\n19:26\ngenerating these chains become specific, not for foreign\n19:30\npathogens, but maybe they become specific for self\n19:35\nmolecules, molecules that are naturally\n19:37\nproduced within the body.\n19:38\nIt's just a random mutation, but if he started going crazy\n19:40\nfor that, his antibodies will start attacking molecules that\n19:45\nare naturally in the body and then that could really hurt.\n19:47\nThat what causes autoimmune diseases, where your own\n19:51\nimmune cells start activating yourself.\n19:53\nBut if you have this double handshake system where this\n19:55\nhas to happen and this has to happen, the likelihood of both\n19:59\nof these guys after they leave their development stage\n20:03\nbecoming specific to a self protein or a self cell or a\n20:09\nself molecule is very unlikely.\n20:12\nSo it kind of inhibits this guy from going wild, even if\n20:15\nhe has some type of a mutation.\n20:17\nAnyway, hopefully that explains a little bit of what\n20:19\nhelper T cells do.\n20:20\nWe'll talk a lot more about it.\n20:22\nI know it can be a little bit confusing.\n20:23\nIn the next video, we'll talk about cytotoxic T cells.",

    "question_type": "MCQ",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's imagine we have a huge cloud\n0:02\nof hydrogen atoms floating in space.\n0:05\nHuge, and when I say huge cloud, huge both in distance\n0:08\nand in mass.\n0:09\nIf you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,\n0:11\nit would just be this really, really massive thing.\n0:15\nSo you have this huge cloud.\n0:16\nWell, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually\n0:20\nattracted to each other.\n0:21\nIt's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.\n0:25\nBut it would slowly affect these atoms.\n0:27\nAnd they would slowly draw close to each other.\n0:30\nIt would slowly condense.\n0:31\nThey'd slowly move towards the center\n0:34\nof mass of all of the atoms.\n0:37\nThey'd slowly move in.\n0:39\nSo if we fast forward, this cloud's\n0:42\ngoing to get denser and denser.\n0:46\nAnd the hydrogen atoms are going to start\n0:48\nbumping into each other and rubbing up against each other\n0:51\nand interacting with each other.\n0:53\nAnd so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.\n0:56\nNow remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.\n0:58\nSo the temperature is going up.\n1:03\nAnd it'll-- they'll keep condensing.\n1:05\nThey'll just keep condensing and condensing\n1:07\nuntil something really interesting happens.\n1:09\nSo let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here\n1:12\nin the center.\n1:16\nAnd there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.\n1:19\nIt's really dense.\n1:20\nI could never draw the actual number of atoms here.\n1:22\nThis is really to give you an idea.\n1:24\nThere's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,\n1:28\nfrom everything that wants to get\n1:29\nto that center of mass of our entire cloud.\n1:32\nThe temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.\n1:38\nAnd at that point, something neat happens.\n1:40\nAnd to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,\n1:43\nlet's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.\n1:46\nA hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just\n1:48\ngoing to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.\n1:49\nSo the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.\n1:50\nIf you want to think about a hydrogen atom,\n1:52\nit also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.\n1:57\nAnd let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.\n1:59\nAnd obviously this distance isn't to scale.\n2:02\nThis distance is also not to scale.\n2:04\nAtoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms\n2:05\nare actually much, much, much, much smaller\n2:07\nthan the actual radius of an atom.\n2:10\nAnd so is the electron.\n2:11\nBut anyway, this just gives you an idea.\n2:13\nSo we know from the Coulomb forces,\n2:14\nfrom electromagnetic forces, that these two positively\n2:17\ncharged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere\n2:20\nnear each other.\n2:22\nBut we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four\n2:25\nforces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,\n2:28\nthat if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures\n2:31\nand huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close\n2:35\nenough to each other, then all of a sudden,\n2:37\nthe strong force will overtake.\n2:39\nIt's much stronger than the Coulomb force.\n2:41\nAnd then these two hydrogens will actually--\n2:43\nthese nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?\n2:48\nWell, anyway, they would actually fuse together.\n2:50\nAnd so that is what actually happens\n2:53\nonce this gets hot and dense enough.\n2:57\nYou now have enough pressure and enough temperature\n2:59\nto overcome the Coulomb force and bring\n3:02\nthese protons close enough to each other for fusion\n3:05\nto occur, for fusion ignition.\n3:12\nAnd the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.\n3:14\nIt's not ignition.\n3:15\nIt's not combustion in the traditional sense.\n3:16\nIt's not like you're burning a carbon molecule\n3:20\nin the presence of oxygen.\n3:22\nIt's not combustion.\n3:23\nIt's ignition.\n3:24\nAnd the reason why it's called ignition\n3:25\nis because when two of these protons,\n3:27\nor two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus\n3:32\nhas a slightly smaller mass.\n3:35\nAnd so in the first stage of this,\n3:36\nyou actually have two protons under enough pressure--\n3:42\nobviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--\n3:44\nwith enough pressure they get close enough.\n3:46\nAnd then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.\n3:51\nOne of these guys degrades into a neutron.\n3:56\nAnd the resulting mass of the combined protons\n3:59\nis lower than the mass of each of the original.\n4:01\nBy a little bit, but that little bit of mass\n4:04\nresults in a lot of energy-- plus energy.\n4:11\nAnd this energy is why we call it ignition.\n4:13\nAnd so what this energy does is it provides\n4:16\na little bit of outward pressure,\n4:17\nso that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.\n4:21\nSo once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.\n4:24\nAnd then that energy provides outward pressure\n4:26\nto balance what is now a star.\n4:30\nSo now we are at where we actually\n4:32\nhave the ignition at the center.\n4:35\nWe have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying\n4:39\nto get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.\n4:43\nNow, what is the hydrogen being fused into?\n4:46\nWell, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just\n4:50\nkind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens\n4:54\nin stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.\n5:00\nI have trouble spelling.\n5:01\nWhich is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.\n5:03\nThis is still hydrogen because it\n5:04\nhas one proton and one neutron now.\n5:07\nIt is not helium yet.\n5:08\nThis does not have two-- it does not have two protons.\n5:12\nBut then the deuterium keeps fusing.\n5:14\nAnd then we eventually end up with helium.\n5:19\nAnd we can even see that on the periodic table.\n5:21\nOh, I lost my periodic table.\n5:22\nWell, I'll show you the next video.\n5:23\nBut we know hydrogen in its atomic state\n5:30\nhas an atomic number of 1.\n5:32\nAnd it also has a mass of 1.\n5:34\nIt only has one nucleon in its nucleus.\n5:38\nBut it's being fused.\n5:39\nIt goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,\n5:42\nwhich is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.\n5:46\nAnd then that eventually gets fused--\n5:48\nand I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--\n5:50\ninto helium.\n5:51\nAnd by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.\n5:56\nSo it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,\n5:58\nin particular, that isotope of helium--\n6:00\nit has an atomic mass of 4.\n6:03\nAnd this process releases a ton of energy.\n6:06\nBecause the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced\n6:09\nis slightly lower than four times the atomic mass\n6:15\nof each of the constituent hydrogens.\n6:17\nSo all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it\n6:21\nneeds super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--\n6:24\nkeeps the star from collapsing.\n6:28\nAnd once a star is in this stage,\n6:31\nonce it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen\n6:35\nin its core, where the pressure and the temperature\n6:37\nis the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.\n6:41\nThis is now a main sequence star.\n6:48\nAnd that's actually where the sun is right now.\n6:50\nNow there's questions of, well, what if there just\n6:53\nwasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?\n6:56\nAnd there actually are things that\n6:57\nnever get to quite that threshold\n6:59\nto fuse all the way into helium.\n7:00\nThere are a few things that don't quite\n7:02\nmake the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.\n7:05\nSo they are generating some of their heat.\n7:06\nOr there are even smaller objects\n7:08\nthat just get to the point there's\n7:10\na huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually\n7:13\noccurring inside of the core.\n7:15\nAnd something like Jupiter would be an example.\n7:17\nAnd you could go several masses above Jupiter\n7:20\nwhere you get something like that.\n7:21\nSo you have to reach a certain threshold\n7:23\nwhere the mass, where the pressure and the temperature\n7:25\ndue to the heavy mass, get so large that you\n7:27\nstart this fusion.\n7:28\nAnd-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,\n7:31\nthe slower the fusion will occur.\n7:33\nBut if you're super massive, the fusion\n7:35\nwill occur really, really fast.\n7:37\nSo that's the general idea of just how stars get formed\n7:40\nand why they don't collapse on themselves\n7:43\nand why they are these kind of balls\n7:45\nof fusion reactions existing in the universe.\n7:48\nIn the next few videos, we'll talk\n7:50\nabout what happens once that hydrogen fuel in the core\n7:54\nstarts to run out.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:02\nMale: Hello and welcome to the wonderful world\n0:03\nof fungi or [funji]; both are acceptable pronunciations,\n0:08\nbut I say fungi because it's fungus, not [funjus],\n0:11\nthough [funjus] is also fun to say.\n0:14\nFungi are a little bit like plants\n0:15\nand more like animals than you might think.\n0:17\nThey diverged from protists about a billion years ago\n0:20\nand today scientists estimate that there are\n0:22\nabout 1.5 million species of fungi on the earth,\n0:26\nthough in a formal taxonomic way,\n0:28\nwe only know about 100,000 or so of them,\n0:30\nand those that we have met are wonderful, weird\n0:33\nand in some cases, deadly.\n0:35\nThe fact is, death is pretty much what fungi are all about.\n0:38\nSure, there are the fun fungi,\n0:40\nlike the single-celled saccharomyces,\n0:42\nalso known as yeast.\n0:43\nWithout them we wouldn't have beer or wine or bread.\n0:46\nIt's also true that fungi are responsible\n0:48\nfor all kinds of diseases from athlete's foot\n0:50\nto potentially deadly histoplasmosis,\n0:53\nAKA Spelunker's Lung caused by fungus\n0:56\nfound in bird and bat droppings.\n0:57\nFungi can even make people crazy.\n0:59\nWhen the fungus Claviceps purpurea\n1:01\ngrows on grains used to make bread or beer,\n1:03\nit causes gangrene, nervous spasms, burning sensations,\n1:07\nhallucinations and temporary insanity.\n1:10\nOnce compound in this fungus, lysergic acid,\n1:12\nis the raw material used to make LSD.\n1:14\nFinally, there's the destruction that some\n1:16\nfungi bring onto other animals.\n1:18\nMore than 6 million bats in North America\n1:20\nhave died since just 2007 due to a fungal disease\n1:23\ncalled White Nose Syndrome,\n1:25\nand a fungus has been implicated in several\n1:26\nextinctions of amphibians and threatens many more,\n1:29\nperhaps as many as 1/3 of all amphibians on earth.\n1:32\nBut none of this is what I mean\n1:33\nwhen I talk about fungi and death.\n1:36\nWhile some members of the fungus family are total bummers,\n1:38\nall of them together perform perhaps the most vital function\n1:41\nin the global food web.\n1:43\nThey feast on the deceased remains\n1:45\nof almost all organisms on the planet.\n1:48\nBy doing that, they convert the organic matter\n1:50\nthat we're all made of back into soil\n1:53\nfrom which new life will spring.\n1:55\nSo fungi, they thrive on death\n1:57\nand in the process make all life possible.\n1:59\n(bopppy music)\n2:09\nAha! You didn't expect to see me in the chair so soon,\n2:11\nbut before we go any deeper into the kingdom fungi,\n2:14\nI wanted to make a toast to Louis Pasteur\n2:17\nin the form of a Biolo-graphy.\n2:19\n(1920's music)\n2:24\nBy Pasteur's time, beer had been brewed\n2:26\nfor thousands of years in cultures all over the world.\n2:29\nSome experts think it may have been\n2:31\nthe very reason that our hunter-gatherer ancestors\n2:34\nstarted farming and cobbled together\n2:36\ncivilization in the first place.\n2:37\nFor all those millennia, no one understood\n2:39\nhow its most important ingredient worked.\n2:42\nUntil brewers could actually see what yeast were doing,\n2:45\nthe magic of fermentation was essentially \"magic.\"\n2:49\nPasteur himself was never a big beer drinker,\n2:51\nbut part of his academic duties in France\n2:54\nrequired him to help find solutions to problems\n2:56\nfor the local alcohol industry.\n2:58\nAs part of this work in 1857, he began\n3:01\nstudying yeast under a microscope\n3:04\nand discovered that they were, in fact, living organisms.\n3:07\nIn a series of experiments on the new-found creatures,\n3:09\nhe found that in the absence of free oxygen\n3:12\nyeast were able to obtain energy\n3:15\nby decomposing substances that contained oxygen.\n3:18\nWe now know that Pasteur was observing yeast\n3:20\nundergoing the process of anaerobic respiration,\n3:22\nAKA fermentation; breaking down the sugars in grains\n3:26\nlike malted barley and converting them\n3:29\ninto alcohol, carbon dioxide,\n3:30\nand the range of flavors that we associate with beer.\n3:34\nAlong the way, Pasteur also discovered that beer\n3:36\nwas often contaminated by other bacteria and fungi.\n3:38\nThe growth of these beer-spoiling microbes, he found,\n3:41\ncould be thwarted for up to 90 days\n3:43\nby keeping the beer between 55 and 60 degrees Celcius\n3:46\nfor a short period of time.\n3:47\nToday, we call that heating process pasteurization\n3:51\nand it's used in everything from milk\n3:53\nto canned foods to syrups to wines.\n3:56\nFor our purposes, the thing to hold onto here is\n3:58\nPasteur discovered that yeast decomposed sugars to get energy.\n4:02\nIt turns out most fungi spend most of their time\n4:05\ndecomposing all kinds of organic matter.\n4:07\nOften the matter is dead when fungi get to it,\n4:10\nbut not always.\n4:11\nWhen a tree or a person or a deer keels over,\n4:14\nfungi move in and start the work of decomposition.\n4:16\nSame goes for that orange you forgot\n4:18\nat the bottom of the fruit bowl.\n4:19\nIf it weren't for this fungal function,\n4:21\nplants and the animals that eat them couldn't exist\n4:23\nbecause the elements that they take from the soil\n4:26\nwould never return.\n4:27\nThankfully, the decomposition performed by fungi\n4:29\nrecycles the nutrients for the enjoyment\n4:31\nof plants and animals, as well as for other fungi.\n4:34\nAll of this points to one of the main traits\n4:35\nthat all fungi have in common.\n4:37\nFrom single-celled yeast to giant multi-cellular mushrooms,\n4:40\nfungi, like us, are heterotrophs, but instead of eating,\n4:44\nthey absorb nutrition from their surroundings.\n4:47\nThey do this mostly be secreting powerful enzymes\n4:49\nthat break down complex molecules into\n4:50\nsmaller organic compounds, which they use\n4:53\nto feed, grow and reproduce.\n4:55\nMost multi-cellular fungi contain networks\n4:57\nof tiny tubular filaments called hyphae,\n4:59\nthen grow through and within whatever they're feasting on.\n5:02\nUnlike plant cell walls, which are made of cellulose,\n5:04\nthe cell walls of fungi are strengthened\n5:06\nby the nitrogenous carbohydrate, chitin,\n5:08\nthe same material found in the exoskeletons\n5:10\nof insects, spiders and other arthropods.\n5:12\nThe interwoven mass of hyphae\n5:14\nthat grows into the food source is called they mycelium.\n5:16\nIt's structured to maximize its surface area,\n5:19\nwhich as we've learned in both plants and animals,\n5:21\nis the name of the game when it comes to absorbing stuff.\n5:23\nMycelia are so densely packed that one cubic centimeter\n5:26\nof rich soil can contain enough hyphae\n5:29\nto stretch out one kilometer if you laid them end-to-end.\n5:32\nAs hyphae secrete the digestive enzymes,\n5:34\nfungi use the food to synthesize more proteins\n5:37\nand the hyphae continued to grow, allowing the fungi\n5:39\nto conquer new territory and grow even more.\n5:42\nAs a result, fungi can get crazy big; record-holding big.\n5:46\nA single honey mushroom in the Blue Mountains of Oregon\n5:49\nis thought to occupy some 2,386 acres.\n5:53\nBy area, the largest organism on the planet.\n5:56\nThere all kinds of crazy ways that fungi are classified,\n5:58\nbut probably the easiest and most useful\n5:59\nis organizing them by how they interact with other organisms.\n6:02\nThe straight up decomposers that break down dead stuff,\n6:05\nthe mutualists which form beneficial relationships\n6:07\nwith other organisms, especially plants,\n6:09\nand then there are the predators and the parasites.\n6:12\nDecomposer fungi secrete enzymes that break down\n6:15\nand absorb nutrients from non-living organic material\n6:17\nsuch as that tree that nobody heard fall in the forest.\n6:20\nIn fact, the ability of fungi to break down lignin,\n6:22\nwhich is like what makes wood woody,\n6:24\nand break it into glucose and other simple sugars,\n6:26\nis crucial for this cycle of life.\n6:28\nThey're pretty much the only organism that can do that.\n6:30\nThey can even decompose proteins\n6:32\ninto component amino acids.\n6:33\nBasically all the black bits in the soil\n6:36\nin your backyard are tiny fragments\n6:38\nof former plants digested by fungi.\n6:40\nMutualist fungi are a smaller group.\n6:42\nMany have specialized hyphae called haustoria\n6:44\nthat tangle themselves with plant roots\n6:46\nfor the benefit of both organisms.\n6:47\nThese guys help plants absorb nutrients,\n6:49\nespecially phosphates,\n6:51\nby breaking them down more efficiently\n6:52\nthan the roots can themselves.\n6:54\nIn turn, the fungi send out their hyphae\n6:56\ninto the plant's root tissue\n6:57\nand withdraws like a finder's fee, basically,\n7:00\nin the form of energy-rich sugars.\n7:01\nThese mutualistic relationships\n7:03\nare known as mycorrhizae, from the Greek words\n7:05\nmykos, or fungus, and rhiza, or root.\n7:08\nMycorrhizae are enormously important\n7:10\nin natural ecosystems, as well as in agriculture.\n7:12\nAlmost all vascular plants, in fact,\n7:14\nhave fungi attached to their roots\n7:16\nand rely on them for essential nutrients.\n7:18\nGrowers of barley, the main ingredient in beer,\n7:20\nwill even inoculate barley seed beds\n7:22\nwith specific mycorrhizal fungi to help promote growth.\n7:25\nOther fungi aren't nearly so kind to their hosts.\n7:27\nPredatory fungi actively capture prey with their hyphae.\n7:31\nThe soil fungus arthrobotrys uses\n7:32\nmodified hoops on its filaments\n7:34\nto snare nematodes and absorb their inner tissue.\n7:37\nThen there are the parasites,\n7:38\nthose fungi that feed on living organisms\n7:40\nwithout killing them, at least for a while.\n7:42\nTake one of my personal favorites,\n7:44\nthe zombie ant fungus, or ophiocordyceps.\n7:46\nIt shoots spores into an ant\n7:48\nwhere their hyphae grow into its body\n7:50\nand absorb nutrients from nonessential ant organs.\n7:53\nWhen the fungus is ready to reproduce,\n7:55\nit invades the ant's brain\n7:56\nand directs it to march to a cool, moist location\n7:59\nin the forest where it's so-called fruiting spores\n8:02\nerupt through the ant's head to spread even more spores.\n8:06\nJust to prove that even fungi have superheroes,\n8:08\nin 2012 scientists discovered\n8:11\nthat these zombie spores have themselves\n8:13\nbeen targeted by another parasitic fungus.\n8:16\nNot a lot is known about this ant-saving fungus,\n8:18\nother than it sterilizes many of the zombie spores\n8:21\nthrough a process likened to chemical castration.\n8:24\nThat is so messed up!\n8:25\nWeird!\n8:26\nAll right now, since I brought that up\n8:28\nwe should talk briefly about fungus sex.\n8:29\nFungi reproduce any way they can,\n8:32\neither sexually or asexually.\n8:34\nSome species even do it both ways.\n8:36\nWhichever way they choose, most propagate themselves\n8:38\nby producing enormous numbers of spores,\n8:41\nmuch like we saw in non-vascular plants\n8:43\nand the simplest vascular plants, the ferns.\n8:46\nBut, and this a big but, sexual reproduction\n8:48\nin fungi isn't like sex in any other organism\n8:51\nwe've studied so far.\n8:52\nThe concepts of male and female don't apply here at all.\n8:56\nSome fungi reproduce on their own,\n8:58\nothers can reproduce with any other\n9:00\nindividual that happens to be around,\n9:02\nand still others can only mate\n9:04\nwith a member of a different so-called \"mating type.\"\n9:06\nThey're not different sexes,\n9:08\nthey just have different molecular mechanisms\n9:10\nthat either make them compatible or not.\n9:12\nSometimes these types are called plus and minus,\n9:14\nand other times one and two.\n9:16\nIn any case, it's still considered sexual reproduction\n9:18\nbecause each parent contributes genetic information\n9:20\nwhen they make with the spore-making.\n9:22\nIt all starts with this beautiful chemical mating dance.\n9:25\nThe mycelium from one fungus sends out pheromones\n9:28\nthat are picked up and bound to receptors\n9:30\nby another willing and able partner.\n9:32\nThis binding compels each mycelium\n9:34\nto send its hyphae toward the other.\n9:36\nWhen they meet, they fuse the cytoplasm of their cells;\n9:39\nthe stage of reproduction called plasmogamy.\n9:41\nSometime between hours and centuries later,\n9:43\nyes, it can literally take hundreds of years\n9:46\nfor fungi to have sex,\n9:47\nthis union leads to the production of spores\n9:50\nthat each fungus is then able to disperse.\n9:53\nCertain types of fungi, including the tasty morel,\n9:55\nproduce spores in a sac-like asci\n9:57\ncontained in fruiting bodies known as ascocarps.\n10:00\nThat is that part that you pick\n10:01\nwhen you're wandering through the forest.\n10:03\nSome fungi shoot their spores off into the breeze,\n10:04\nother spores float away on the water.\n10:07\nMore enterprising spores will hitch a ride\n10:09\non passing critters,\n10:10\nhopefully, to be dropped off somewhere\n10:12\nwhere there's plenty of nutrients to absorb\n10:13\nso they, too, can grow, send out sexual pheromones\n10:16\nwhen their time comes,\n10:18\nand let their hyphae do the tango.\n10:20\nFinally, for some fungi sexual reproduction\n10:22\njust isn't all it's cracked up to be.\n10:24\nThey'd rather just get on with it themselves.\n10:26\nSome of these grow filamented structures\n10:28\nthat produce spores by mitosis.\n10:30\nThese structures are visible and they're called molds.\n10:33\nThis stuff on the orange in the bottom of the fruit bowl\n10:35\nor on the heel of the piece of bread\n10:37\nthat you left for a roommate\n10:38\nwho decided to leave it for the other roommate\n10:40\nwho thought that you'd rather have it.\n10:41\nIn the unicellular yeast, the asexual reproduction\n10:44\noccurs by old fashioned cell division\n10:46\nor the formation of buds that get pinched off\n10:48\ninto separate organisms.\n10:49\nSince some species of yeast,\n10:51\nlike our beer-making friend Saccharomyces cerevisiae,\n10:53\nconvert sugars into alcohol, brewers create conditions\n10:56\nthat encourage high rates of yeast production,\n10:59\nlike giving them lots of sugar and oxygen\n11:01\nsince more yeast means more alcohol.\n11:03\nSo, yeah, fungi.\n11:04\nThey feast on death and they can make us go insane\n11:06\nand turn ants into unholy zombies of the night,\n11:09\nbut because of their hard work, in strange ways,\n11:12\nthey make possible stuff like agriculture\n11:14\nand beer and everything else worth living for.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nSAL: In the last video, where we talked about macrostates,\n0:03\nwe set up this situation where I had this canister, or the\n0:07\ncylinder, and had this movable ceiling.\n0:09\nI call that a piston.\n0:11\nAnd the piston is being kept up by the pressure from the\n0:15\ngas in the canister.\n0:15\nAnd it's being kept down by, in the last example I had, a\n0:19\nrock or a weight on top.\n0:21\nAnd above that I had a vacuum.\n0:22\nSo essentially there's some force per area, or pressure,\n0:26\nbeing applied by the bumps of the\n0:27\nparticles into this piston.\n0:30\nAnd if this weight wasn't here-- let's assume that the\n0:32\npiston itself or this movable ceiling itself, it has no\n0:35\nmass-- if that weight wasn't there it would just be pushed\n0:38\nindefinitely far, because there'd be no pressure from\n0:41\nthe vacuum.\n0:41\nBut this weight is applying some force on\n0:44\nthat same area downwards.\n0:45\nSo we're at some equilibrium point, some stability.\n0:49\nAnd we plotted that on this PV diagram right here.\n0:53\nI'll do it in magenta.\n0:55\nSo that's our state 1 that we were in right there.\n1:00\nAnd then what I did in the last video, I just blew away\n1:03\nhalf of this block.\n1:04\nAnd as soon as I blew away half of this block, obviously\n1:07\nthe force that's being applied by the block will immediately\n1:10\ngo down by half, and so the gas will push up on it.\n1:13\nAnd it happened so fast that, al of a sudden the gas is\n1:16\npushing up.\n1:17\nRight when it happens, the gas near the top of the canister\n1:20\nis going to have lower pressure, because it has less\n1:23\npushing up against it.\n1:24\nThe molecules that are down here don't even know that I\n1:27\nblew away this block yet.\n1:29\nIt's going to take some time.\n1:30\nAnd essentially the gas is going to push it up, and then\n1:33\nmaybe it'll oscillate down, and then push it up, and\n1:35\noscillate down a little bit.\n1:37\nIt'll take some time eventually until we get to\n1:39\nanother equilibrium state, where we have a new, probably,\n1:43\nor definitely lower pressure.\n1:45\nWe definitely have a higher volume.\n1:49\nI won't talk too much about it yet, but we probably have a\n1:51\nlower temperature as well.\n1:52\nAnd this is our new state.\n1:56\nAnd our macrostate's pressure and volume are defined once\n2:00\nwe're at the new equilibrium, so we're right here.\n2:03\nSo my question in the last video was,\n2:05\nhow did we get here?\n2:06\nIs there any way to have defined a path to get from our\n2:09\nfirst state-- where pressure and volume were well defined,\n2:13\nbecause the system wasn't thermodynamic equilibrium-- to\n2:17\nget to our second state?\n2:19\nAnd the answer was no.\n2:21\nBecause between this state and this state\n2:24\nall hell broke loose.\n2:25\nI had different temperatures at different\n2:27\npoints in the system.\n2:31\nI could have had a different pressure here\n2:33\nthan I had up here.\n2:35\nThe volume might have been fluctuating\n2:36\nfrom moment to moment.\n2:38\nSo when you're outside of equilibrium-- and I had\n2:40\nwritten it down over there-- you cannot define, or you\n2:44\ncan't say that those macro variables are well defined.\n2:48\nSo there was no path that you could say how we got from--\n2:52\nerase this-- how we got from state 1 to state 2.\n2:57\nYou could just say, OK, we were in some type of\n2:59\nequilibrium.\n3:00\nSo we were in state 1.\n3:01\nThen I blew away half the rock.\n3:03\nThe pressure went down, the volume went up.\n3:06\nThe temperature also probably went down.\n3:08\nAnd so I ended up in this other state once I reached\n3:11\nequilibrium.\n3:12\nAnd that's all fair and good, but wouldn't it have been nice\n3:15\nif there was some way?\n3:16\nIf we could have said, look, you know, there's some way\n3:18\nthat we got from this point to this point?\n3:21\nIf we could perform my little rock experiment in a slightly\n3:25\ndifferent manner, so that all this hell didn't break loose,\n3:27\nso that maybe at every point in between my macro variables\n3:32\nare actually defined?\n3:33\nSo how could I do that?\n3:34\nRemember, I said that the macro variables, the\n3:37\nmacrostates, whether it's pressure, temperature, volume,\n3:40\nand there are others, but I said these are only defined\n3:42\nwhen we are in a thermodynamic equilibrium.\n3:46\nAnd that just means that things have reached a\n3:48\nstability point.\n3:49\nThat, for example, the temperature is consistent\n3:52\nthroughout the system.\n3:53\nIf it's not consistent throughout the system, I\n3:55\nshouldn't be talking about it.\n3:56\nIf the temperature is different here than it is up\n3:59\nhere, I shouldn't say that the temperature of\n4:01\nthe system is x.\n4:02\nIt's different at different points.\n4:03\nI really can't make a well-defined statement about\n4:06\ntemperature, similar for pressure or for volume,\n4:10\nbecause the volume is also fluctuating.\n4:12\nBut what if I perform that same experiment?\n4:15\nThat same process, I should call it.\n4:18\nLet me draw it again.\n4:20\nSo I have my canister.\n4:23\nAnd instead of starting with a rock, just one big rock-- let\n4:27\nme draw, this is my piston right here, at the top of the\n4:31\nmovable ceiling of the cylinder.\n4:33\nAnd I have some gas inside of it.\n4:37\nInstead of having just one big rock like I had over here, how\n4:42\nabout I start with an equal weight of rock?\n4:44\nBut let's say I have a bunch of small pebbles that add up\n4:48\nto that same rock.\n4:49\nSo just a bunch of, well, you know, just a pile of pebbles.\n4:54\nYou know, maybe they're sand.\n4:55\nThey're super duper small.\n5:01\nInstead of just blowing away half of the sand all at once,\n5:05\nlike I did with that rock over there, and immediately jumping\n5:08\nto that state and throwing the whole system into this\n5:11\nundefined state of non-equilibrium.\n5:14\nInstead of doing that, let me just do things very slowly and\n5:16\nvery gently.\n5:17\nLet me just take out one grain of sand at a time.\n5:21\nSo if I just take out one grain of sand.\n5:27\nAnd so I took out an\n5:28\ninfinitesimal amount of weight.\n5:30\nSo what's going to happen?\n5:31\nWell this piston's going to move up a little bit.\n5:33\nAnd let me draw that.\n5:35\nSo let me copy and paste it.\n5:42\nSo I just took out one little piece of sand.\n5:45\nThe force pushing down will be a little bit less.\n5:47\nThe pressure pushing down will be a little less.\n5:49\nAnd so my piston-- let me see if I can draw this-- it will\n5:54\nhave moved up-- let me erase it-- it will have moved up a\n5:59\nvery infinitesimal-- infinitesimal means an\n6:02\ninfinitely small amount-- it would have moved an infinitely\n6:08\nsmall amount of time.\n6:10\nAnd so you wouldn't have thrown that system into this,\n6:12\nyou know, havoc that I did this last time.\n6:15\nOf course, we haven't moved all the way here yet.\n6:17\nBut what we have done is, we would have moved from that\n6:19\npoint maybe to this other point right here that's just a\n6:24\nlittle bit closer to there.\n6:26\nI've just removed a little bit of the weight.\n6:29\nSo my pressure went down just a little bit.\n6:31\nAnd my volume went up a just a little bit.\n6:32\nTemperature probably went down.\n6:34\nAnd the key here is I'm trying to do it in such small\n6:37\nincrements that as I do it, my system is pretty much super\n6:43\nclose to equilibrium.\n6:46\nI'm just doing it just slow enough that at every step it\n6:49\nachieves equilibrium almost immediately.\n6:51\nOr it's almost in equilibrium the whole time I'm doing it.\n6:54\nAnd then I do it again, and do it again.\n6:57\nAnd I'll just draw my drawings a little less neat, just for\n7:00\nthe sake of time.\n7:02\nLet's say I remove another little dot of sand that's\n7:06\ninfinitely small mass.\n7:09\nAnd now my little piston will move just a little bit higher.\n7:14\nAnd I have, remember I have one less sand up here than I\n7:17\nhad over here.\n7:19\nAnd then my volume in my gas increases a little bit.\n7:23\nMy pressure goes down a little bit.\n7:24\nAnd I've moved to this point here.\n7:27\nWhat I'm doing here is I'm setting up what's called a\n7:30\nquasi-static process.\n7:39\nAnd the reason why it's called that is\n7:40\nbecause it's almost static.\n7:42\nIt's almost in equilibrium the whole time.\n7:45\nEvery time I move a grain of sand I'm just moving a little\n7:48\nbit closer.\n7:49\nAnd obviously even a grain of sand, the reality is if I were\n7:52\nto do this in real life, even a grain of sand on a small\n7:55\nscale is going to reek a little bit\n7:56\nof havoc on my system.\n7:58\nThis piston is going to go up a little bit.\n8:00\nSo say, let me just do even a smaller grain of sand, and do\n8:03\nit even a little bit slower so that I'm always in\n8:05\nequilibrium.\n8:06\nSo you can imagine this is kind of a theoretical thing.\n8:08\nIf I did an infinitely small grains of sand, and did it\n8:11\njust slow enough so that it's just gently moved from this\n8:15\npoint to this point.\n8:16\nBut we like to think of it theoretically, because it\n8:19\nallows us to describe a path.\n8:21\nBecause remember, why am I being so careful here?\n8:23\nWhy am I so careful to make sure that the state, the\n8:26\nsystem is in equilibrium the whole time when I get from\n8:29\nthere to there?\n8:31\nBecause our macrostates, our macro variables like pressure,\n8:35\nvolume, and temperature, our only defined when we're in\n8:38\nequilibrium.\n8:39\nSo if I do this process super slowly, in super small\n8:42\nincrements, it allows me to keep my pressure and volume\n8:46\nand actually my temperature of macrostates at\n8:49\nany point in time.\n8:50\nSo I could actually plot a path.\n8:51\nSo if I keep doing it small, small, small, I could actually\n8:53\nplot a path to say, how did I get from state 1 to state 2 on\n8:59\nthis on this PV diagram.\n9:01\nAnd you might say, hey, you know, Sal, this is all-- And\n9:05\nI'll take a little step back here.\n9:06\nI always found this really confusing.\n9:08\nYou know, you'll see a lot of talk in thermodynamic circles,\n9:13\nor even in your book about-- it has to be a quasi-static\n9:15\nprocess, and I always used to wonder, why are people going\n9:18\nthrough these pains to describe this process where\n9:20\nyou're removing sand after sand?\n9:22\nAnd the whole point is because you want to get as close to\n9:25\nequilibrium the whole time you're doing it as possible so\n9:27\nthat your pressure and volume are defined the whole time.\n9:31\nThe reality is, in the real world you can never get\n9:33\nsomething that's continuously defined, but you can just do\n9:36\nreally, really, really small increments.\n9:39\nSo that at each small increment you're at some\n9:41\nequilibrium.\n9:42\nAnd if you're not happy with that, you can do even smaller\n9:44\nincrements.\n9:44\nSo at some point, at some limiting point, you do have\n9:47\nsome type of continuous state change, while you're always in\n9:51\nequilibrium.\n9:52\nIt's almost an oxymoron, because you're saying you're\n9:55\nstatic, you're saying that you're in equilibrium the\n9:59\nwhole time, but clearly you're also changing the whole time.\n10:02\nYou keep removing little pieces of sand.\n10:05\nBut you're moving them just slowly enough that all that\n10:07\ncrazy up and down motion, and all of the flux, and all of\n10:11\nthe weird temperature changes don't happen.\n10:13\nAnd it just, you know, just that it slowly, slowly,\n10:16\nslowly creeps up.\n10:18\nThe reason why I'm even going through this exercise is\n10:21\nbecause it's key when we start talking about thermodynamics\n10:24\nand these PV diagrams, and we'll start talking about\n10:27\ncarnot engines and all of that, that we be able to at\n10:30\nleast theoretically describe the path that we take on this\n10:34\nPV diagram.\n10:35\nAnd we wouldn't have been able to do that if we can't assume\n10:37\nthat we're dealing with a quasi-static process.\n10:41\nNow there's another term that you'll hear in thermodynamic\n10:45\ncircles that really, I mean, to me it really, I don't know,\n10:48\nI had trouble comprehending it the first time I heard it,\n10:50\ncalled reversible.\n10:54\nAnd sometimes these terms quasi-static and reversible\n10:57\nare used interchangeably, but there is a difference.\n11:03\nReversible processes are quasi-static, and most\n11:06\nquasi-static processes are reversible, but there are a\n11:08\nfew special cases that aren't.\n11:10\nBut the idea of a reversible process is something that\n11:12\nhappens so slowly.\n11:14\nSo in this example I took off a grain of sand and I got to\n11:17\nthe state, but if I assume that no friction when, you\n11:20\nknow, when this piston moved up a little bit, in the real\n11:23\nworld, let's say if this piston was metal, when this\n11:27\nrubs against the canister, there'd be a little bit of\n11:29\nfriction generated and a little bit of energy would be\n11:32\ndissipated as friction or heat.\n11:33\nBut in a reversible process, we're assuming that, look,\n11:36\nthis is frictionless.\n11:37\nWhen anything happens in the system, when we go from this\n11:40\nstate right here-- let's say this the state a,\n11:42\nthis is state b.\n11:43\nSo this is state a, this is state b.\n11:46\nWhen we go from this state to this state, one, we're\n11:48\ninfinitesimally close to equilibrium the whole time, so\n11:51\nall of our macrostates are well defined.\n11:54\nAnd even more, when we move from one state to the other,\n11:57\nthere's no loss or dissipation of energy.\n11:59\nSo those are two important characteristics.\n12:03\nOne, infinitely close to equilibrium at all times, and\n12:06\nno loss of energy.\n12:07\nAnd the reason why that matters for a reversible\n12:10\nprocess is because if we wanted, if we were sitting in\n12:13\nstate b, we could just add another grain of sand back in,\n12:18\npush down this piston infinitely slowly, at an\n12:22\ninfinitely small increment, and get back to state a.\n12:26\nSo that's why it's called reversible.\n12:27\nYou could be at this point right here, and take out a\n12:32\nlittle bit of sand, and get to this point right here.\n12:34\nBut if you want, since no energy was lost, you could add\n12:37\na little bit of sand, and get back to this point right here.\n12:40\nNow the reality in the real world is, there is no such\n12:44\nthing as a perfectly reversible process.\n12:46\nThere will always be, whenever you do anything, there will\n12:48\nalways be some energy or heat lost to the process.\n12:54\nIn the real world, if I moved down here, if I tried to put\n12:58\nthe sand back I would lose some energy and probably get\n13:00\nto a little slightly different point.\n13:02\nBut you don't have to worry about that.\n13:03\nThe important takeaway from this video is that, in the\n13:07\nsituation I described there, there was no intermediate\n13:11\nmacrostate variables, because our system was in flux, it\n13:14\nwasn't in equilibrium.\n13:16\nSo if we wanted to get intermediate states, we just\n13:18\nhave to essentially do this process slower.\n13:21\nAnd so slow, I mean, it theoretically would take you\n13:24\nforever, so we can only approximate it.\n13:26\nBut the sand gives you an idea of what we're talking about.\n13:29\nAnd if we did it slowly with these infinitesimally small\n13:32\nparticles of sand, then we can define the state at every\n13:35\npoint along the process.\n13:39\nAnd that's why we call it quasi-static, because at any\n13:41\npoint it's almost static.\n13:43\nIt's almost in equilibrium.\n13:44\nSo our pressures, volumes, and temperatures can be defined.\n13:48\nAnd if we add to that the notion that we haven't lost\n13:51\nany heat when we're going in one direction or another, we\n13:55\ncould say it's reversible, because if we took a piece of\n13:57\nsand away, we can always add a little bit of sand next.\n14:02\nNow, actually, with that said, let me give you the one\n14:04\nexample of maybe a quasi-static-- no, actually\n14:07\nI'll save that for future video.\n14:08\nAnyway, hopefully you understand that these are two\n14:11\nconcepts that used to really confuse me, and hopefully this\n14:14\nclears it up a little bit.\n14:15\nAnd I think more than what it is, I think the first time I\n14:18\nread about them I'm like, OK, well what's the big deal?\n14:20\nThe big deal is, it allows you to define your macrostates for\n14:25\nevery state in between these two states\n14:27\nthat you care about.\n14:28\nWhen you just did it as a regular kind of\n14:30\nnon-quasi-static process, in between you\n14:34\ndon't know what happened.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Instructor] Let's compare the structures\n0:01\nof ethane and ethene.\n0:03\nEthane is an alkane with an A-N-E ending,\n0:07\nand it has the molecular formula C2H6.\n0:13\nEthene is an alkene with an E-N-E ending,\n0:17\nand it has the molecular formula C2H4.\n0:22\nFor two carbons,\n0:23\nsix hydrogens is the maximum number that you can have,\n0:26\nso we say that ethane is completely saturated\n0:30\nwith hydrogens.\n0:32\nIf we look at ethene,\n0:33\nwe only have four hydrogens for two carbons,\n0:36\nso we say that ethene is unsaturated.\n0:40\nSo, for two carbons, it's possible to have more,\n0:44\nso this is unsaturated.\n0:46\nNext, let's look at the carbons present in both molecules.\n0:50\nWe'll start with ethane.\n0:52\nThis carbon is sp3 hybridized,\n0:54\nand so is this one,\n0:55\nso ethane contains two sp3 hybridized carbons.\n1:01\nAnd we know the geometry around sp3 hybridized carbon\n1:05\nis tetrahedral.\n1:07\nSo we should have tetrahedral geometry\n1:10\naround both of these carbons.\n1:13\nFor ethene,\n1:14\nlet me use a different color here,\n1:16\nso this carbon and this carbon are both sp2 hybridized.\n1:20\nSo sp2 hybridized carbons.\n1:23\nAnd we know the geometry around an sp2 hybridized carbon\n1:27\nis trigonal planar.\n1:28\nSo, there's planar geometry around both of these carbons.\n1:33\nFinally, let's look at the bonding between the two carbons.\n1:38\nSo, for ethane, this sigma bond between the two carbons\n1:42\nhas some free rotation.\n1:44\nSo different confirmations of the ethane molecule\n1:47\nare possible.\n1:48\nSo we have free rotation.\n1:50\nFree rotation about the sigma bonds\n1:53\nbetween our two carbon atoms.\n1:56\nBut for ethene, if we look at those two carbon atoms,\n1:59\nso this one and this one,\n2:00\nthere's a double bond between those two carbons.\n2:04\nAnd we know that there's no free rotation\n2:07\naround a double bond.\n2:08\nSo there's no free rotations.\n2:12\nYou're not gonna get different confirmations for ethene,\n2:17\nso no free rotation, no confirmations.\n2:20\nThat affects the structure of your alkenes.\n2:24\nOn the left is ethane,\n2:25\nand if we look at our two sp3 hybridized carbons,\n2:28\nwe can see the tetrahedral geometry around them.\n2:31\nAnd for the sigma bonds between those two carbons,\n2:34\nwe know there's free rotation.\n2:36\nSo here I am rotating the molecule\n2:38\nto show different confirmations of ethane.\n2:41\nFor ethene, or ethylene, our two sp2 hybridized carbons\n2:45\nhave planar geometry around them,\n2:47\nso if I rotate this molecule to the side here,\n2:50\nyou can see that it is planar,\n2:52\nand there's no free rotation because of this double bond,\n2:55\nbecause of the presence of a pi bond.\n2:57\nSo, here I am trying to rotate the model set\n3:00\nand you can see that the molecule does not rotate.\n3:05\nYou can classify alkenes\n3:06\naccording to their degrees of substitution.\n3:09\nIf you take ethene, and you take a hydrogen off,\n3:12\nand you add-on an R group,\n3:13\nyou now have a monosubstituted alkene.\n3:17\nSo, on the right is an example of a monosubstituted alkene.\n3:21\nIf I put in the hydrogens,\n3:22\nit might be a little bit more obvious.\n3:24\nWe know that this carbon has two hydrogens\n3:27\nand we know that this carbon has one.\n3:30\nWe have an alkyl group coming off of this carbon,\n3:33\na methyl group,\n3:34\nand so this is an example of a monosubstituted alkene.\n3:38\nIf I want to name this alkene,\n3:40\nwe saw how to name them in an earlier video.\n3:43\nWe would make this carbon one, this is carbon two,\n3:46\nand this is carbon three.\n3:48\nSo, longest carbon chain, including our alkene,\n3:51\nand a three carbon alkene is called propene.\n3:55\nLet me write that down here.\n3:57\nSo this is propene.\n3:59\nNext, let's look at a disubstituted alkene.\n4:02\nSo now we're talking about two R groups.\n4:05\nHere I've put an R and R prime.\n4:08\nAn R and R prime might be the same,\n4:10\nor they might be different.\n4:12\nHere, R and R prime are on the same carbon,\n4:16\nbut it's possible to have a disubstituted alkene\n4:18\nwhere R and R prime are bonded to different carbons.\n4:24\nAnd then another example\n4:25\nof a disubstituted alkene on the right here,\n4:28\nso R and R prime are bonded to different carbons,\n4:31\nbut notice a difference.\n4:32\nThese two R groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n4:36\nSo this and this one are on opposite sides,\n4:38\nwhereas in this example, if I draw a line right here,\n4:42\nboth R groups are on the same side of the double bond,\n4:46\nand we know that one of these\n4:47\ndoesn't rotate to form the other,\n4:49\nbecause there's no free rotation around our double bond.\n4:53\nSo here we have three examples of disubstituted alkenes.\n4:57\nLet's look at this one down here and let's name it.\n5:00\nSo find our longest carbon chain\n5:02\nthat includes our double bond,\n5:04\nand I wanna give the lowest number possible\n5:06\nto our double bond,\n5:07\nso we're gonna start right here at carbon one,\n5:09\nthis is carbon two, and this is carbon three.\n5:12\nSo three carbon alkene is called propene,\n5:15\nand we have a methyl group coming off carbon two,\n5:19\nso this would be 2-Methylpropene.\n5:24\nIn terms of which type of disubstituted alkene this is,\n5:27\nlet's go ahead and draw in our hydrogens\n5:28\nso it's a little bit easier to see.\n5:30\nSo, for this carbon, there are two hydrogens bonded to it,\n5:34\nand then for the carbon on the left,\n5:36\nit has a methyl group and another methyl group.\n5:39\nSo, two R groups that happen to be the same.\n5:42\nSo that's this example of a disubstituted alkene,\n5:44\nwhere both of our R groups are bonded to one carbon.\n5:50\nNow let's look at a trisubstituted alkene.\n5:53\nSo, we have three R groups.\n5:55\nR, R prime, and R double prime.\n5:58\nAnd again, R, R prime, and R double prime\n6:00\nmight be the same, or they might be different.\n6:03\nSo here's an example of a trisubstituted alkene.\n6:07\nLet me go ahead and draw in the hydrogen on this carbon,\n6:11\nso it's easier to see that we have three R groups\n6:14\nbonded to the double bonds.\n6:17\nIf I want to name it,\n6:19\nI need to find the longest carbon chain\n6:21\nthat includes my double bond,\n6:23\nso this would be carbon one,\n6:24\nthis would be carbon two, three, four, and five.\n6:28\nSo a five carbon alkene is called pentene,\n6:32\nso let me write that in here,\n6:34\nand our double bond starts at carbon two,\n6:37\nso this would be 2-Pentene.\n6:39\nAnd finally, I have a methyl group coming off of carbon two.\n6:43\nSo, to complete the name, I need 2-Methyl,\n6:46\nso 2-Methyl-2-Pentene would be the name\n6:50\nfor this trisubstituted alkene.\n6:53\nNext, let's look at a tetrasubstituted alkene.\n6:56\nSo R, R prime, R double prime, and R triple prime.\n6:59\nThis molecule is actually tetrasubstituted.\n7:04\nIf we find our double bond,\n7:05\nso this carbon and this carbon, so this top carbon here,\n7:09\nactually, let's go ahead and name it first,\n7:11\nand then we'll look at why it's a tetrasubstituted alkene.\n7:15\nSo this would be carbon one,\n7:16\nand then I have to follow my double bond for carbon two.\n7:20\nSo, we have a cyclohexene derivative.\n7:23\nAgain, we saw this in an earlier video,\n7:25\nso let me go ahead and write cyclohexene down here.\n7:28\nSo, cyclohexene.\n7:30\nAnd we have a methyl group coming off carbon one,\n7:33\nand a methyl group coming off of carbon two.\n7:36\nSo this would be 1,2-Dimethyl,\n7:38\nso 1,2-Dimethylcyclohexene would be the name.\n7:44\nAnd now, let's look at why it's tetrasubstituted.\n7:46\nSo, let me use a different color here.\n7:48\nSo, for carbon one,\n7:50\nI have one methyl group coming off on this side,\n7:53\nand then I have this alkyl group, as part of the ring,\n7:56\ncoming off of that side.\n7:58\nSo that carbon has two R groups bonded to it,\n8:01\nand carbon two also has two R groups bonded to it.\n8:04\nSo, methyl group here, and again,\n8:06\nI have this portion of the rings.\n8:08\nSo that's why this is a tetrasubstituted alkene.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nRight now, the best estimate of when the Big Bang occurred--\n0:05\nand once again, I don't like the term that much because it\n0:08\nkind of implies some type of explosion.\n0:10\nBut what it really is is kind of an expansion\n0:12\nof space, when space started to really start\n0:14\nto expand from a singularity.\n0:16\nBut our best estimate of when this occurred\n0:18\nis 13.7 billion years ago.\n0:24\nAnd even though we're used to dealing with numbers\n0:26\nin the billions, especially when we\n0:28\ntalk about large amounts of money and what not,\n0:30\nthis is an unbelievable amount of time.\n0:32\nIt seems like something that is tractable, but it really isn't.\n0:35\nAnd in future videos, I'm actually\n0:37\ngoing to talk about the time scale.\n0:39\nSo we can really appreciate how long,\n0:41\nor even start to appreciate, or appreciate\n0:43\nthat we can't appreciate how long 13.7 billion years is.\n0:47\nAnd I also want to emphasize that this is the current best\n0:51\nestimate.\n0:52\nEven in my lifetime, even in my lifetime that I actually\n0:54\nknew about the Big Bang and that I would pay attention\n0:57\nto what the best estimate was, this number's\n0:59\nbeen moving around.\n1:00\nSo I suspect that in the future, this number\n1:02\nmight become more accurate or might move around some.\n1:04\nBut this is our best guess.\n1:06\nNow with that said, I want to think about what this tells us\n1:08\nabout the size of the observable universe.\n1:17\nSo if all of the expansion started 13.7 billion years ago,\n1:22\nthat 13.7 billion years ago, everything\n1:25\nwe know in our three-dimensional universe\n1:28\nwas in a single point, the longest\n1:31\nthat any photon of light could be traveling that's reaching us\n1:34\nright now-- so let's say that that is my eye right over here.\n1:39\nThat's my eyelashes, just like that-- so some photon of light\n1:45\nis just to getting to my eye or maybe it's\n1:47\njust getting to the lens of a telescope.\n1:50\nThe longest that that could have been traveling\n1:52\nis 13.7 billion years.\n1:55\nSo it could be traveling 13.7 billion years.\n2:07\nSo when we looked at that depiction--\n2:09\nthis I think was two or three videos ago,\n2:11\nof the observable universe-- I drew, it was this circle.\n2:18\nAnd when we see light coming from these remote objects--\n2:21\nthat light is getting to us right here.\n2:23\nThis is where we are.\n2:24\nThis is where I guess in the depiction\n2:27\nthe remote object was.\n2:28\nBut the light from that remote object\n2:30\nis just now getting to us.\n2:32\nAnd that light took 13.7 billion years to get to us.\n2:43\nNow, what I'm going to hesitate to do,\n2:45\nbecause we're talking over such large distances\n2:48\nand we're talking on such large time scales and time scales\n2:51\nover which space itself is expanding--\n2:55\nwe're going to see in this video that you cannot say that this\n2:59\nobject over here, this is not necessarily, this is NOT,\n3:03\nI'll put it in caps, this is NOT 13.7 billion light years away.\n3:13\nIf we were talking about smaller time scales\n3:15\nor I guess smaller distances, you\n3:18\ncould say approximately that.\n3:20\nThe expansion of the universe itself would not make as much\n3:23\nof a difference.\n3:24\nAnd let me make it even more clear.\n3:26\nI'm talking about an object over there.\n3:28\nBut we could even talk about that coordinate in space.\n3:33\nAnd actually, I should say that coordinate in space-time,\n3:35\nbecause we're viewing it at a certain instant as well.\n3:37\nBut that coordinate is not 13.7 billion light years away\n3:43\nfrom our current coordinate.\n3:44\nAnd there's a couple of reasons to think about it.\n3:46\nFirst of all, think about it, that light\n3:48\nwas emitted 13.7 billion years ago.\n3:51\nWhen that light was emitted, we were\n3:53\nmuch closer to that coordinate.\n3:55\nThis coordinate was much closer to that.\n3:57\nWhere we are in the universe right now\n3:59\nwas much closer to that point in the universe.\n4:01\nThe other thing to think about is\n4:04\nas this-- let me actually draw it.\n4:06\nSo let's go 300,000 years after that initial expansion\n4:16\nof that singularity.\n4:17\nSo we're just 300,000 years into the universe's history\n4:21\nright now.\n4:22\nSo this is roughly 300,000 years into the universe's life.\n4:30\nI guess we could view it that way.\n4:33\nAnd first of all, at that point things haven't differentiated\n4:37\nin a meaningful way yet right now.\n4:39\nAnd we'll talk more about this when\n4:40\nwe talk about the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n4:43\nBut at this point in the universe,\n4:45\nit was kind of this almost uniform white-hot plasma\n4:49\nof hydrogen.\n4:50\nAnd then we're going to talk about it.\n4:51\nIt was emitting microwave radiation.\n4:53\nAnd we'll talk more about that in a future video.\n4:55\nBut let's just think about two points in this early universe.\n5:01\nSo in this early universe, let's say you have that point.\n5:03\nAnd let's say you have the coordinate where we are right\n5:05\nnow.\n5:06\nYou have the coordinate where we are right now.\n5:10\nAnd in fact, I'll just make that roughly-- I won't make it\n5:12\nthe center just because I think it makes it easier\n5:14\nto visualize if it's not the center.\n5:15\nAnd let's say at that very early stage in the universe,\n5:19\nif you were able to just take some rulers instantaneously\n5:22\nand measure that, you would measure this distance\n5:26\nto be 30 million light years.\n5:36\nAnd let's just say right at that point,\n5:38\nthis object over here-- I'll do it in magenta--\n5:40\nthis object over here emits a photon, maybe\n5:43\nin the microwave frequency range.\n5:45\nAnd we'll see that that was the range that it was emitting in.\n5:48\nBut it emits a photon.\n5:50\nAnd that photon is traveling at the speed of light.\n5:52\nIt is light.\n5:53\nAnd so that photon, says, you know what, I only\n5:55\ngot 30 million light years to travel.\n5:56\nThat's not too bad.\n5:57\nI'm going to get there in 30 million years.\n6:00\nAnd I'm going to do it discrete.\n6:01\nThe math is more complicated than what I'm doing here.\n6:04\nBut I really just want to give you\n6:05\nthe idea of what's going on here.\n6:07\nSo let's just say, well, that photon\n6:09\nsays in about 10 million years, in roughly 10 million years,\n6:13\nI should be right about at that coordinate.\n6:18\nI should be about one third of the distance.\n6:20\nBut what happens over the course of those 10 million years?\n6:26\nWell, over the course of those 10 million years,\n6:28\nthe universe has expanded some.\n6:30\nThe universe has expanded maybe a good deal.\n6:32\nSo let me draw the expanded universe.\n6:35\nSo after 10 million years, the universe might look like this.\n6:40\nActually it might even be bigger than that.\n6:42\nLet me draw it like this.\n6:44\nAfter 10 million years, the universe\n6:47\nmight have expanded a good bit.\n6:49\nSo this is 10 million years into the future.\n6:53\nStill on a cosmological time scale, still almost at kind\n6:58\nof the infancy of the universe because we're\n7:00\ntalking about 13.7 billion years.\n7:02\nSo let's say 10 million years.\n7:04\n10 million years go by.\n7:07\nThe universe has expanded.\n7:09\nThis coordinate, where we're sitting today\n7:10\nat the present time, is now all the way over here.\n7:15\nThat coordinate where the photon was originally emitted\n7:19\nis now going to be sitting right over here.\n7:24\nAnd that photon, it said, OK, after 10 million light years,\n7:26\nI'm going to get over there.\n7:28\nAnd I'm approximating.\n7:29\nI'm doing it in a very discrete way.\n7:30\nBut I really just want to give you the idea.\n7:32\nSo that coordinate, where the photon roughly\n7:35\ngets in 10 million light years, is about right over here.\n7:38\nThe whole universe has expanded.\n7:39\nAll the coordinates have gotten further away from each other.\n7:42\nNow, what just happened here?\n7:44\nThe universe has expanded.\n7:45\nThis distance that was 30 million light years now--\n7:49\nand I'm just making rough numbers here.\n7:52\nI don't know the actual numbers here.\n7:53\nNow, it is actually-- this is really just\n7:55\nfor the sake of giving you the idea of why-- well, giving you\n8:01\nthe intuition of what's going on.\n8:03\nThis distance now is no longer 30 million light years.\n8:08\nMaybe it's 100 million.\n8:10\nSo this is now 100 million light years away from each other.\n8:16\nThe universe is expanding.\n8:17\nThese coordinates, the space is actually spreading out.\n8:20\nYou could imagine it's kind of a trampoline\n8:22\nor the surface of a balloon.\n8:23\nIt's getting stretched thin.\n8:25\nAnd so this coordinate where the light happens\n8:27\nto be after 10 million years, it has\n8:29\nbeen traveling for 10 million years,\n8:32\nbut it's gone a much larger distance.\n8:37\nThat distance now might be on the order of-- maybe\n8:40\nit's on the order of 30 million light years.\n8:42\nAnd the math isn't exact here.\n8:44\nI haven't done the math to figure it out.\n8:47\nSo it's done 30 million light years.\n8:50\nAnd actually I shouldn't even make it the same proportion.\n8:53\nBecause the distance it's gone and the distance it has to go,\n8:56\nbecause of the stretching, it's not\n8:58\ngoing to be completely linear.\n8:59\nAt least when I'm thinking about it in my head, it shouldn't be,\n9:02\nI think.\n9:02\nBut I'm going to make a hard statement about that.\n9:06\nBut the distance that it reversed, maybe this distance\n9:10\nright here is now 20 million light years\n9:15\nbecause it got there.\n9:16\nEvery time it moved some distance, the space that it\n9:20\nhad traversed is now stretched.\n9:23\nSo even though its traveled for 10 million years,\n9:27\nthe space that it traversed is no longer\n9:29\njust 10 million light years.\n9:31\nIt's now stretched to 20 million light years.\n9:34\nAnd the space that it has left to traverse\n9:35\nis no longer only 20 million light years.\n9:38\nIt might now be 80 million light years.\n9:41\nIt is now 80 million light years.\n9:44\nAnd so this photon might be getting frustrated.\n9:47\nThere's an optimistic way of viewing it.\n9:48\nIt is like, wow, I was able to cover\n9:50\n20 million light years in only 10 million years.\n9:53\nIt looks like I'm moving faster than the speed of light.\n9:55\nThe reality is it's not because the space coordinates\n9:58\nthemselves are spreading out.\n10:00\nThose are getting thin.\n10:01\nSo the photon is just moving at the speed of light.\n10:04\nBut the distance that it actually\n10:05\ntraversed in 10 million years is more than 10 million\n10:10\nlight years.\n10:10\nIt's 20 million light years.\n10:12\nSo you can't just multiply a rate times time\n10:15\non these cosmological scales, especially when the coordinates\n10:19\nthemselves, the distance coordinates are actually\n10:23\nmoving away from each other.\n10:24\nBut I think you see, or maybe you might see,\n10:27\nwhere this is going.\n10:29\nOK, this photon says, oh, in another-- let me write this.\n10:33\nThis is 80 million light years-- in another 40 million\n10:35\nlight years, maybe I'm going to get over here.\n10:40\nBut the reality is over that next 40 million light years--\n10:43\nsorry, in 40 million years, I might get right over here,\n10:47\nbecause this is 80 million light years.\n10:49\nBut the reality is after 40 million years--\n10:52\nso another 40 million years go by-- now, all of a sudden,\n10:56\nthe universe has expanded even more.\n10:59\nI won't even draw the whole bubble.\n11:01\nBut the place where the photon was emitted from\n11:04\nmight be over here.\n11:07\nAnd now our current position is over here.\n11:11\nWhere the light got after 10 million years is now over here.\n11:18\nAnd now, where the light is after 40 million years,\n11:24\nmaybe it's over here.\n11:27\nSo now this distance, the distance\n11:29\nbetween these two points, when we started,\n11:32\nit was 10 million light years.\n11:33\nThen it became 20 million light years.\n11:36\nMaybe now, it's on the order of-- I don't know-- maybe it's\n11:39\na billion light years.\n11:41\nMaybe now it's a billion light years.\n11:43\nAnd maybe this distance over here-- and I'm\n11:45\njust making up these numbers.\n11:46\nIn fact, that's probably be too big for that point-- maybe this\n11:49\nis now 100 million light years.\n11:52\nThis is now 100 million light years.\n11:55\nAnd now, maybe this distance right\n11:59\nhere is-- I don't know-- 500 million light years.\n12:01\nAnd maybe now the total distance between the two points\n12:04\nis a billion light years.\n12:05\nSo as you can see, the photon might getting frustrated.\n12:08\nAs it covers more and more distance,\n12:10\nit looks back and says, wow, in only 50 million years,\n12:13\nI've been able to cover 600 million light years.\n12:16\nThat's pretty good.\n12:16\nBut it's frustrated because what it thought\n12:18\nwas it only had to cover 30 million light years\n12:22\nin distance.\n12:23\nThat keeps stretching out because space\n12:25\nitself is stretching.\n12:26\nSo the reality, just going to the original idea,\n12:32\nthis photon that is just reaching us,\n12:36\nthat's been traveling for-- let's say\n12:38\nit's been traveling for 13.4 billion years.\n12:41\nSo it's reaching us is just now.\n12:43\nSo let me just fast forward 13.4 billion years\n12:46\nfrom this point now to get to the present day.\n12:49\nSo if I draw the whole visible universe right over here,\n12:54\nthis point right over here is going\n12:56\nto be-- where it was emitted from is right over there.\n13:00\nWe are sitting right over there.\n13:04\nAnd actually, let me make something clear.\n13:06\nIf I'm drawing the whole observable universe,\n13:08\nthe center actually should be where we are.\n13:10\nBecause we can observe an equal distance.\n13:12\nIf things aren't really strange, we\n13:14\ncan observe an equal distance in any direction.\n13:16\nSo actually maybe we should put us at the center.\n13:19\nSo if this was the entire observable universe,\n13:21\nand the photon was emitted from here 13.4 billion years ago--\n13:26\nso 300,000 years after that initial Big Bang,\n13:29\nand it's just getting to us, it is true\n13:35\nthat the photon has been traveling\n13:41\nfor 13.7 billion years.\n13:47\nBut what's kind of nutty about it is this object, since we've\n13:50\nbeen expanding away from each other, this object is now,\n13:53\nin our best estimates, this object\n13:56\nis going to be about 46 billion light years away from us.\n14:08\nAnd I want to make it very clear.\n14:10\nThis object is now 46 billion light years away from us.\n14:13\nWhen we just use light to observe it, it looks like,\n14:16\njust based on light years, hey, this light\n14:18\nhas been traveling 13.7 billion years to reach us.\n14:21\nThat's our only way of kind with light\n14:22\nto kind of think about the distance.\n14:24\nSo maybe it's 13.4 or whatever-- I\n14:27\nkeep changing the decimal-- but 13.4 billion light years away.\n14:31\nBut the reality is if you had a ruler today, light year rulers,\n14:36\nthis space here has stretched so much\n14:38\nthat this is now 46 billion light years.\n14:41\nAnd just to give you a hint of when\n14:43\nwe talk about the cosmic microwave background\n14:45\nradiation, what will this point in space\n14:47\nlook like, this thing that's actually\n14:49\n46 billion light years away, but the photon only\n14:52\ntook 13.7 billion years to reach us?\n14:54\nWhat will this look like?\n14:56\nWell, when we say look like, it's\n14:59\nbased on the photons that are reaching us right now.\n15:02\nThose photons left 13.4 billion years ago.\n15:05\nSo those photons are the photons being\n15:07\nemitted from this primitive structure,\n15:10\nfrom this white-hot haze of hydrogen plasma.\n15:16\nSo what we're going to see is this white-hot haze.\n15:19\nSo we're going to see this kind of white-hot plasma, white hot,\n15:26\nundifferentiated not differentiated\n15:28\ninto proper stable atoms, much less stars and galaxies,\n15:32\nbut white hot.\n15:33\nWe're going to see this white-hot plasma.\n15:36\nThe reality today is that point in space\n15:38\nthat's 46 billion years from now,\n15:40\nit's probably differentiated into stable atoms, and stars,\n15:45\nand planets, and galaxies.\n15:46\nAnd frankly, if that person, that person,\n15:49\nif there is a civilization there right now\n15:51\nand if they're sitting right there, and they're observing\n15:52\nphotons being emitted from our coordinate,\n15:54\nfrom our point in space right now,\n15:56\nthey're not going to see us.\n15:57\nThey're going to see us 13.4 billion years ago.\n16:01\nThey're going to see the super primitive state\n16:05\nof our region of space when it really\n16:07\nwas just a white-hot plasma.\n16:09\nAnd we're going to talk more about this in the next video.\n16:11\nBut think about it.\n16:12\nAny photon that's coming from that period in time,\n16:15\nso from any direction, that's been traveling\n16:17\nfor 13.4 billion years from any direction,\n16:21\nit's going to come from that primitive state\n16:23\nor it would have been emitted when the universe was\n16:27\nin that primitive state, when it was just\n16:29\nthat white-hot plasma, this undifferentiated mass.\n16:32\nAnd hopefully, that will give you\n16:33\na sense of where the cosmic microwave background\n16:36\nradiation comes from.",

my container and inside of that container,\n0:18\nI have a bunch of water molecules.\n0:21\nIt's just got a bunch of water molecules.\n0:24\nThey're all rubbing against each other.\n0:25\nIt's in its liquid form, this is liquid water.\n0:27\nand inside of the water molecules, I\n0:30\nhave some sugar molecules.\n0:33\nMaybe I'll do sugar in this pink color.\n0:35\nSo I have a bunch of sugar molecules right here.\n0:40\nI have many, many more water molecules though.\n0:43\nI want to make that clear.\n0:49\nNow in this type of situation, we call the thing that there's\n0:55\nmore of, the solvent.\n1:00\nSo in this case, there's more water molecules and you can\n1:03\nliterally just view more as the number of molecules.\n1:07\nI'm not going to go into a whole discussion of moles and\n1:10\nall of that because you may or may not have been exposed to\n1:13\nthat yet, but just imagine whatever there's more of,\n1:15\nthat's what we're going to call the solvent.\n1:17\nSo in this case, water is the solvent.\n1:24\nAnd whatever there is less of-- in this case, that is the\n1:30\nsugar-- that is considered the solute.\n1:36\nIt doesn't have to be sugar.\n1:37\nIt can be any molecule that there's less of, in the water,\n1:40\nin this case.\n1:45\nAnd we say that the sugar has been dissolved into the water.\n2:03\nAnd this whole thing right here, the combination of the\n2:06\nwater and the sugar molecules, we call a solution.\n2:10\nWe call this whole thing a solution.\n2:14\nAnd a solution has the solvent and the solute.\n2:16\nThe solvent is water.\n2:18\nThat's the thing doing the dissolving and the thing that\n2:21\nis dissolved is the sugar.\n2:23\nThat's the solute.\n2:24\nNow all of this may or may not be review for you, but I'm\n2:27\ndoing it for a reason-- because I want to talk about\n2:32\nthe idea of a diffusion.\n2:39\nAnd the idea is actually pretty straightforward.\n2:43\nIf I have, let's say, the same container.\n2:46\nLet me do it in a slightly different container here, just\n2:49\nto talk about diffusion.\n2:50\nWe'll go back to water and sugar--\n2:52\nespecially back to water.\n2:54\nLet's say we have a container here and let's say it just has\n2:58\na bunch of-- let's say it just has some air particles in it.\n3:00\nIt could be anything-- oxygen or carbon dioxide.\n3:03\nSo let me just draw a couple of air molecules here.\n3:07\nSo let's say that that is a gaseous-- just for the sake of\n3:11\nargument-- gaseous oxygen.\n3:12\nSo each of this is an O2-- each of those, right?\n3:14\nAnd let's say that this is the current configuration, that\n3:16\nall of this is a vacuum here and that there's some\n3:19\ntemperatures.\n3:20\nSo these water molecules, they have some\n3:22\ntype of kinetic energy.\n3:25\nThey're moving in some type of random directions right there.\n3:29\nSo my question is, what is going to happen in this type\n3:34\nof container?\n3:35\nWell, any of these guys are going to be randomly bumping\n3:38\ninto each other.\n3:39\nThey're more likely to bump into things in this down-left\n3:43\ndirection than they are in the up-right direction.\n3:45\nSo if this guy was happening to go in this down-left\n3:47\ndirection, he's going to bump into something and then\n3:50\nricochet into the up-right direction.\n3:52\nBut in the up-right direction, there's\n3:53\nnothing to bounce into.\n3:55\nSo in general, everything is moving in random directions,\n3:57\nbut you're more likely to be able to move in\n4:00\nthe rightward direction.\n4:01\nWhen you go to the left, you're more likely to bump\n4:02\ninto something.\n4:04\nSo it's almost common sense.\n4:06\nOver time, if you just let this system come to some type\n4:09\nof equilibrium-- I'm not going to go into detail\n4:11\non what that means.\n4:12\nYou can watch the thermodynamics videos if you'd\n4:14\nlike to see that.\n4:15\nYou'll eventually see the container will look\n4:18\nsomething like this.\n4:19\nI can't guarantee it.\n4:20\nThere's some probability it would actually stay like this,\n4:22\nbut very likely that those five particles are going to\n4:25\nget relatively spread out.\n4:27\nThis is diffusion and so it's really just the spreading of\n4:32\nparticles or molecules from high concentration to low\n4:36\nconcentration areas, right?\n4:39\nIn this case, the molecules are going to spread in that\n4:41\ndirection from a high concentration to a low\n4:43\nconcentration area.\n4:45\nNow you're saying, Sal, what is concentration?\n4:47\nAnd there's many ways to measure concentration and you\n4:51\ncan go into molarity and molality and all of that.\n4:54\nBut the very simple idea is, how much of that particle do\n4:57\nyou have per unit space?\n4:59\nSo here, you have a lot of those particles per unit space\n5:02\nand here you have very few of those\n5:04\nparticles per unit space.\n5:05\nSo this is a high concentration and that's a low\n5:09\nconcentration.\n5:09\nSo you could imagine other experiments like this.\n5:12\nYou could imagine a solution like-- let's do\n5:17\nsomething like this.\n5:21\nLet's say I have two containers.\n5:25\nLet's go back to the solution situation.\n5:27\nThis was a gas, but I started off with that example so let's\n5:29\nstay with that example.\n5:31\nSo let's say that I have a door right there that's larger\n5:35\nthan either the water or the sugar molecules.\n5:38\nOn either side, I have a bunch of water molecules.\n5:52\nSo I have a lot of water molecules.\n5:53\nSo if I just had water molecules here-- they're all\n5:55\nbouncing around in random directions-- and so the odds\n5:58\nof a water molecule going this way, equivalent to odds of a\n6:01\nwater molecule going that way, assuming that both sides have\n6:04\nthe same level of water molecule, otherwise the\n6:06\npressures would be different.\n6:07\nBut let's say that the top of this is the same\n6:10\nas the top of this.\n6:11\nSo there's no more pressure going in one\n6:12\ndirection or another.\n6:13\nSo if for whatever reason, a bunch more water molecules\n6:17\nwere going in the rightward direction, then all of a\n6:18\nsudden this would fill up with more water and we know that\n6:20\nthat isn't likely to occur.\n6:22\nSo this is just two containers of water.\n6:28\nNow let's put some solute in it.\n6:30\nLet's dissolve some solute in it and let's say we do all the\n6:33\ndissolving on the left-hand side.\n6:35\nSo we put some sugar molecules on the left-hand side.\n6:40\nAnd these are small enough to fit through this little pipe.\n6:42\nThat's one assumption that I'm making.\n6:44\nSo what's going to happen?\n6:45\nAll of these things have some type of kinetic energy.\n6:47\nThey're all bouncing around.\n6:52\nWell, over time, the water's going back and forth.\n6:56\nThis water molecule might go that way.\n6:57\nThat water molecule might go that way, but they net each\n7:00\nother out, but over time one of these big sugar molecules\n7:03\nwill be going in just the right direction to go\n7:06\nthrough-- maybe this guy's, instead of going that\n7:08\ndirection, he starts off going in that direction.\n7:10\nHe goes just through this tunnel connecting the two\n7:15\ncontainers and he'll end up there, right?\n7:18\nAnd this guy will still be bouncing around.\n7:20\nThere's some probability he goes back, but there's still\n7:23\nmore sugar particles here than there.\n7:25\nSo there's still more probability that one of these\n7:31\nguys will go to that side than one of these guys\n7:33\nwill go to that side.\n7:34\nSo you can imagine if you're doing this with gazillions of\n7:36\nparticles-- I'm only doing it with four-- over time, the\n7:40\nparticles will have spread out so that their concentrations\n7:43\nare roughly equal.\n7:44\nSo that maybe you'll have two here over time.\n7:46\nBut when you're only dealing with three or four or five\n7:49\nparticles, there's some probability it doesn't happen,\n7:51\nbut when you're doing it with a gazillion and they're super\n7:53\nsmall, it's a very, very, very high likelihood.\n7:56\nBut anyway, this whole process-- we went from a\n7:59\ncontainer of high concentration to a container\n8:02\nof low concentration and the particles would have spread\n8:06\nfrom the low concentration container to the high\n8:08\nconcentration container.\n8:09\nSo they diffused.\n8:11\nThis is diffusion.\n8:16\nAnd just so that we learn some other words that tend to be\n8:18\nused with the idea of diffusion-- when we started\n8:21\noff, this had a higher concentration.\n8:24\nThe left-hand side container had higher concentration.\n8:33\nIt's all relative, right?\n8:34\nIt's higher than this guy.\n8:37\nAnd this right here had a lower concentration.\n8:42\nAnd there are words for these things.\n8:44\nThis solution with a high concentration is called a\n8:47\nhypertonic solution.\n8:50\nLet me write that in yellow.\n8:58\nHyper, in general, meaning having a lot of something,\n9:01\nhaving too much of something.\n9:02\nAnd this lower concentration is hypotonic.\n9:13\nYou might have heard maybe one of your relatives, if they\n9:16\nhaven't had a meal in awhile say, I'm hypoglycemic.\n9:20\nThat means that they have not-- they're feeling\n9:22\nlightheaded.\n9:22\nThere's not enough sugar in their bloodstream and they\n9:24\nwant to pass out so they want a meal.\n9:26\nIf you just had a candy bar, maybe you're hyperglycemic--\n9:29\nor maybe you're just hyper in general.\n9:32\nSo these are just good prefixes to know, but\n9:35\nhypertonic-- you have a lot of the solute.\n9:38\nYou have a high concentration.\n9:40\nAnd then in hypotonic, not too much of the solute so you have\n9:44\na low concentration.\n9:46\nThese are good words to know.\n9:47\nSo in general, diffusion-- if there's no barriers to the\n9:51\ndiffusion like we had here, you will have the solute go\n9:54\nfrom a high concentration or hypertonic solution if they\n9:58\ncan travel to a hypotonic solution, to a hypo, where the\n10:03\nconcentration is lower.\n10:05\nNow let's do an interesting experiment here.\n10:08\nWe've talked about diffusion and so far we've been talking\n10:10\nabout the diffusion of the solute, right?\n10:14\nAnd in general-- and this is not always the case-- if you\n10:17\nwant to be as general as possible, the solute is\n10:19\nwhatever you have less of, the solvent is whatever\n10:22\nyou have more of.\n10:23\nAnd the most common solvent tends to be water, but it\n10:26\ndoesn't have to be water.\n10:27\nIt could be some type of alcohol.\n10:28\nIt could be mercury.\n10:31\nIt could be a whole set of molecules, but water in most\n10:34\nbiological or chemical systems tends to be the\n10:38\nmost typical solvent.\n10:39\nIt's what other things are dissolved into.\n10:41\nBut what happens if we have a tunnel where the solute is too\n10:46\nbig to travel, but water is small enough to travel?\n10:51\nLet's think about that situation.\n10:55\nIn order to think about it, I'm going to do something\n10:57\ninteresting.\n10:58\nLet's say we have a container here.\n11:02\nActually, I won't even draw a container.\n11:03\nLet's just say we have an outside environment that has a\n11:07\nbunch of water.\n11:09\nThis is the outside environment and then you have\n11:12\nsome type of membrane.\n11:19\nWater can go in and out of this membrane.\n11:22\nSo it's semi-permeable.\n11:23\nWell, it's permeable to water, but the solute cannot go\n11:26\nthrough the membrane.\n11:27\nSo let's say that the solute is sugar.\n11:28\nSo we have water on the outside and\n11:33\nalso inside the membrane.\n11:36\nSo these are little small water molecules.\n11:39\nThis is a membrane right here.\n11:43\nAnd let's say that we have some sugar molecules again--\n11:46\nI'm just picking on sugar.\n11:47\nIt could have been anything.\n11:48\nSo we have some sugar molecules here that are just a\n11:51\nlittle bit bigger-- or they could be a lot bigger.\n11:55\nActually, they're a lot bigger than water molecules.\n11:57\nYou have a bunch of-- and I only draw four, but you have a\n11:59\ngazillion of them, right?\n12:01\nYou have that much more water molecules.\n12:03\nI'm just trying to show you have more water molecules than\n12:05\nsugar molecules.\n12:06\nAnd this membrane is semi-permeable.\n12:13\nPermeable means it allows things to pass.\n12:15\nSemi-permeables means it's not completely permeable.\n12:18\nSo semi-permeable-- in this context, I'm saying I allow\n12:20\nwater to pass through the membrane.\n12:22\nSo water can pass, but sugar cannot.\n12:28\nSugar is too large.\n12:35\nSo if we were to zoom in on the actual membrane itself--\n12:39\nmaybe the membrane looks like this.\n12:40\nI'm going to zoom in on this membrane.\n12:44\nSo it has little holes in the membrane, just like that.\n12:48\nAnd maybe the water molecules are about that size.\n12:51\nSo they can go through those holes.\n12:53\nSo the water molecules can go back and forth through the\n12:56\nholes, but the sugar molecules are about that big.\n13:01\nSo they cannot go through that hole.\n13:04\nThey're too big for this opening right here to go back\n13:07\nand forth between them.\n13:08\nNow what do you think is going to happen in this situation?\n13:12\nSo first of all, let's use our terminology.\n13:14\nRemember, sugar is our solute.\n13:15\nWater is our solvent.\n13:17\nSemi-permeable membrane.\n13:18\nWhich side of the membrane has a higher or lower\n13:21\nconcentration of solute?\n13:24\nWell, the inside does.\n13:25\nThe inside is hypertonic.\n13:32\nThe outside has a lower\n13:33\nconcentration so it's hypotonic.\n13:44\nNow, if these openings were big enough, based on what we\n13:47\njust talked about-- these guys are bouncing around, water is\n13:51\ntravelling in either direction, and equal\n13:53\nprobability or-- actually I'm going to talk\n13:56\nabout that in a second.\n13:58\nIf everything was wide open, it would be equal probability,\n14:01\nbut if it was wide open, these guys eventually would bounce\n14:03\ntheir ways over to this side and you'd probably end up with\n14:06\nequal concentrations eventually.\n14:08\nAnd so you would have your traditional diffusion, where\n14:10\nhigh concentration of solute to low\n14:13\nconcentrations of solute.\n14:14\nBut in this case, these guys-- they can't\n14:17\nfit through the hole.\n14:18\nOnly water can go back and forth.\n14:20\nIf these guys were not here, water would have an equal\n14:25\nlikelihood of going in this direction as they would be\n14:28\ngoing in that direction, a completely equal likelihood.\n14:33\nBut because these guys are on the right-hand side of-- or in\n14:40\nthis case, on the inside of our membrane.\n14:42\nThis is our inside of our membrane zoomed up-- it's less\n14:47\nlikely because these guys might be in the approach\n14:50\nposition of the holes-- that's slightly less likely for water\n14:55\nto be in the approach position for the holes so it's actually\n14:58\nmore probable that water could enter than water exit.\n15:02\nAnd I want to make that very clear.\n15:04\nIf these sugar molecules were not here, obviously it's\n15:07\nequally likely for water to go in either direction.\n15:09\nNow that these sugar molecules are there, these sugar\n15:12\nmolecules might be on the right-hand side.\n15:15\nThey might be blocking-- I guess the best way to think\n15:18\nabout it is blocking the approach to the hole.\n15:20\nThey'll never be able to go through the hole themselves\n15:22\nand might not even be blocking the hole, but they're going in\n15:24\nsome random direction.\n15:25\nSo if a water molecule was approaching-- it's all\n15:29\nprobabilistic and we're dealing with gazillions of\n15:31\nmolecules-- it's that much more likely to be blocked to\n15:34\nget outside.\n15:35\nBut the water molecules from the outside-- there's nothing\n15:37\nblocking them to get in so you're going to have a flow of\n15:40\nwater inside.\n15:41\nSo in this situation, with a semi-permeable membrane,\n15:44\nyou're going to have water.\n15:45\nYou're going to have a net inward flow of water.\n15:49\nAnd so this is kind of interesting.\n15:51\nWe have the solvent flowing from a hypotonic situation to\n15:56\na hypertonic solution, but it's only\n15:59\nhypotonic in the solute.\n16:07\nBut water-- if you flip it the other way-- if you've used\n16:11\nsugar as the solvent, then you could say, we're going from a\n16:15\nhigh concentration of water to a low concentration of water.\n16:19\nI don't want to confuse you too much.\n16:20\nThis is what tends to confuse people, but just think about\n16:23\nwhat's going to happen.\n16:24\nNo matter in what situation, the solution is going to do\n16:27\nwhat it can to try to equilibriate the\n16:30\nconcentration.\n16:30\nTo make the concentrations on both\n16:32\nsides as close as possible.\n16:33\nAnd it's not just some magic.\n16:35\nIt's not like the solution knows.\n16:36\nIt's all based on probabilities and these things\n16:38\nbumping around, but in this situation, water is more\n16:41\nlikely to flow into the container.\n16:43\nSo it's actually going to go from the hypotonic side when\n16:46\nwe talk about low concentration of solute to the\n16:50\nside that has high concentrations of solute, of\n16:53\nsugar-- and actually, if this thing is stretchable, more\n16:57\nwater will keep flowing in and this membrane\n17:01\nwill stretch out.\n17:04\nI won't go to too much detail here, but this idea of water--\n17:08\nof the solvent-- if in this case, water is the solvent--\n17:12\nof water as a solvent diffusing through a\n17:15\nsemi-permeable membrane, this is called osmosis.\n17:22\nYou've probably heard learning by osmosis-- if you put a book\n17:25\nagainst your head, maybe it'll just seep into your brain.\n17:27\nSame idea.\n17:28\nThat's where the word comes from.\n17:29\nThis idea of water seeping through membranes to try to\n17:33\nmake concentrations more equal.\n17:35\nSo if you say, well, I have high concentration here, low\n17:38\nconcentration here.\n17:39\nIf there was no membrane here, these big molecules would\n17:43\nexit, but because there's this semi-permeable membrane here,\n17:48\nthey can't.\n17:48\nSo the system just probabilistically-- no magic\n17:52\nhere-- more water will enter to try to equilibriate\n17:56\nconcentration.\n17:57\nEventually-- if maybe there's a few molecules out here-- not\n18:01\nas high concentration here-- eventually if everything was\n18:06\nallowed to happen fully, you'll get to the point where\n18:08\nyou have just as many-- you have just as high\n18:11\nconcentration on this side as you have on the right-hand\n18:13\nside because this right-hand side is going to fill with\n18:16\nwater and also probably become a larger volume.\n18:19\nAnd then, once again, the probabilities of a water\n18:21\nmolecule going to the right and to the left will be the\n18:23\nsame and you'll get to some type of equilibrium.\n18:25\nBut I want to make it very clear-- diffusion is the idea\n18:29\nof any particle going from higher concentration and\n18:33\nspreading into a region that has a lower concentration and\n18:35\njust spreading out.\n18:36\nOsmosis is the diffusion of water.\n18:41\nAnd usually you're talking about the diffusion of water\n18:44\nas a solvent and usually it's in the context of a\n18:47\nsemi-permeable membrane, where the actual solute cannot\n18:51\ntravel through the membrane.\n18:53\nAnyway, hopefully you've found that useful and\n18:55\nnot completely confusing.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- DNA gets a lot of attention as the store\n0:02\nof our genetic information, and it deserves that.\n0:06\nIf we didn't have DNA, there would be no way\n0:07\nof keeping the information that makes us us,\n0:10\nand other organisms what those organisms are.\n0:13\nAnd DNA has some neat properties, it can replicate itself,\n0:16\nand we go into a lot of depth on that in other videos.\n0:19\nSo DNA producing more DNA, we call that,\n0:23\nwe call that replication, but just being able\n0:26\nto replicate yourself on its own isn't enough\n0:28\nto actually produce an organism.\n0:31\nAnd to produce an organism, you somehow have to\n0:33\ntake that information in the DNA, and then\n0:35\nproduce things like a structural molecules,\n0:39\nenzymes, transport molecules, signaling molecules,\n0:43\nthat actually do the work of the organism.\n0:48\nAnd that process, the first step, and this is all a review\n0:51\nthat we've seen in other videos.\n0:53\nThe first step is to go from DNA to RNA,\n0:55\nand in particular, messenger RNA.\n0:58\n\"Messenger RNA,\" and this process right over here,\n1:02\nthis is called transcription.\n1:04\n\"Transcription,\" we go into a lot of detail\n1:06\non this in other videos.\n1:08\nAnd then you wanna go from that messenger RNA,\n1:10\nit goes to the ribosomes and then tRNA goes and grabs\n1:14\namino acids, and they form actual proteins.\n1:17\nSo you go from messenger RNA, and then in conjunction,\n1:21\nso this is all, this is in conjunction with tRNA\n1:24\nand amino acids, so let me say \"+tRNA,\" and \"amino acids.\"\n1:32\nAnd I'll write \"amino acids\" in, I'll write it in a brighter\n1:35\ncolor, since that's going to be the focus of this video.\n1:39\nSo tRNA and amino acids, you're able to construct proteins.\n1:45\nYou are able to construct proteins,\n1:47\nwhich are made up of chains of amino acids,\n1:51\nand it's the proteins that do\n1:53\na lot of the work of the organism.\n1:56\nProteins, which are nothing but chains of amino acids,\n1:59\nor they're made up of, sometimes\n2:00\nmultiple chains of amino acids.\n2:02\nSo you can image, I'm just going to, that's an amino acid.\n2:05\nThat's another amino acid.\n2:07\nThis is an amino acid.\n2:10\nThis is an amino acid, you could keep going.\n2:13\nSo these chains of amino acids, based on\n2:16\nhow these different, based on the properties\n2:19\nof these different amino acids,\n2:21\nand how the protein takes shape and how\n2:23\nit might interact with its surrounding,\n2:24\nthese proteins can serve all sorts of different functions.\n2:27\nAnything from part of your immune system,\n2:30\nantibodies, they can serve as enzymes,\n2:33\nthey can serve as signaling hormones, like insulin.\n2:38\nThey're involved in muscle contraction.\n2:40\nActin and myosin, we actually have\n2:42\na fascinating video on that.\n2:43\nTransport of oxygen.\n2:45\nHemoglobin.\n2:46\nSo proteins, the way at least my brain of it,\n2:48\nis they do a lot of the work.\n2:50\nDNA says, well, what contains the information,\n2:54\nbut a lot of the work of organism is actually done,\n2:57\nis actually done by the proteins.\n3:00\nAnd as I just said, the building blocks\n3:02\nof the proteins are the amino acids.\n3:05\nSo let's focus on that a little bit.\n3:07\nSo up here are some examples of amino acids.\n3:10\nAnd there are 20 common amino acids,\n3:12\nthere are a few more depending on what organism you look at,\n3:17\nand theoretically there could be many more.\n3:19\nBut in most biological systems,\n3:21\nthere are 20 common amino acids that the DNA is coding for,\n3:24\nand these are two of them.\n3:26\nSo let's just first look at what is common.\n3:29\nSo, we see that both these, and actually all three of this,\n3:33\nthis is just a general form, you have an amino group.\n3:36\nYou have an amino group, and this where,\n3:39\nthis is why we call it an \"amino,\" an amino acid.\n3:42\nSo you have an amino group.\n3:44\nAmino group right over here.\n3:46\nNow you might say, \"well, it's called an amino acid,\"\n3:49\n\"so where is the acid?\"\n3:50\nAnd that comes from this carboxyl group right over here.\n3:55\nSo that's why we call it an acid.\n3:57\nThis carboxyl group is acidic.\n4:02\nIt likes to donate this proton.\n4:04\nAnd then in between, we have a carbon,\n4:06\nand we call that the alpha carbon.\n4:09\nWe call that the alpha carbon.\n4:12\nAlpha carbon, and that alpha carbon is bonded,\n4:14\nit has a covalent bond to the amino group,\n4:16\ncovalent bond to the carboxyl group,\n4:18\nand a covalent bond to a hydrogen.\n4:20\nNow, from there, that's where you get the variation\n4:24\nin the different amino acids, and actually,\n4:26\nthere's even some exceptions for how the nitrogen is,\n4:30\nbut for the most part, the variation between\n4:32\nthe amino acids is what this fourth covalent bond\n4:36\nfrom the alpha carbon does.\n4:38\nSo you see in serine, you have this,\n4:43\nwhat you could call it an alcohol.\n4:45\nYou could have an alcohol side chain.\n4:47\nIn valine right over here, you have a\n4:50\nfairly pure hydrocarbon, hydrocarbon side chain.\n4:54\nAnd so in general, we refer to these side chains\n4:58\nas an R group, and it's these R groups\n5:01\nthat play a big role in defining the shape of the proteins,\n5:05\nand how they interact with their environment\n5:07\nand the types of things they can do.\n5:08\nAnd you can even see, just from these examples\n5:10\nhow these different sides chains might behave differently.\n5:13\nThis one has an alcohol side chain,\n5:16\nand we know that oxygen is electronegative,\n5:18\nit likes to hog electrons, it's amazing how much\n5:21\nof chemistry or even biology you can deduce\n5:23\nfrom just pure electronegativity.\n5:26\nSo, oxygen likes to hog electrons, so you're gonna have\n5:28\na partially-negative charge there.\n5:31\nHydrogen has a low electronegativity relative to oxygen,\n5:38\nso it's gonna have its electrons hogged,\n5:40\nso you're gonna have a partially positive charge,\n5:42\njust like that, and so this has a polarity to it,\n5:46\nand so it's going to be hydrophilic, it's going to,\n5:48\nat least this part of the molecule is going to\n5:50\nbe able to be attracted and interact with water.\n5:54\nAnd that's in comparison to what we have over here,\n5:57\nthis hydrocarbon side chain, this has no polarity over here,\n6:02\nso this is going to be hydrophobic.\n6:04\nSo this is going to be hydrophobic.\n6:08\nAnd so when we start talking about the structures\n6:10\nof proteins, and how the structures of proteins\n6:12\nare influenced by its side chains,\n6:14\nyou could image that parts of proteins that have\n6:17\nhydrophobic side chains, those are gonna\n6:18\nwanna get onto the inside of the proteins\n6:21\nif we're in an aqueous solution,\n6:23\nwhile the ones that are more hydrophilic\n6:24\nwill wanna go onto the outside,\n6:26\nand you might have some side chains\n6:27\nthat are all big and bulky, and so they might\n6:29\nmake it hard to tightly pack, and then you might have\n6:32\nother side chains that are nice and small\n6:34\nthat make it very easy to pack, so these things\n6:36\nreally do help define the shape,\n6:39\nand we're gonna talk about that a lot more\n6:41\nwhen we talk about the structure.\n6:44\nBut how do these things actually connect?\n6:47\nAnd we're gonna go into much more detail\n6:49\nin another video, but if you have...\n6:51\nIf you have serine right over here, and then you have\n6:56\nvaline right over here, they connect through\n7:01\nwhat we call peptide bonds, and a peptide\n7:03\nis the term for two or more amino acids connected together,\n7:08\nso this would be a dipeptide, and the bond\n7:10\nisn't this big, I just, actually let me just,\n7:12\nlet me draw it a little bit smaller.\n7:14\nSo...\n7:15\nThat's serine.\n7:17\nThis is valine.\n7:20\nThey can form a peptide bond, and this would be the smallest\n7:23\npeptide, this would be a dipeptide right over here.\n7:27\n\"Peptide,\" \"peptide bond,\" or sometimes\n7:30\ncalled a peptide linkage.\n7:32\nAnd as this chain forms, that polypeptide,\n7:35\nas you add more and more things to it,\n7:37\nas you add more and more amino acids,\n7:42\nthis is going to be, this can be a protein\n7:44\nor can be part of a protein that does all of these things.\n7:47\nNow one last thing I wanna talk about,\n7:50\nthis is the way, the way these amino acids have been drawn\n7:52\nis a way you'll often see them in a textbook,\n7:54\nbut at physiological pH's, the pH's inside of your body,\n7:59\nwhich is in that, you know, that low sevens range,\n8:01\nso it's a pH of roughly 7.2 to 7.4.\n8:08\nWhat you have is this, the carboxyl group right over here,\n8:12\nis likely to be deprotonated, it's likely\n8:15\nto have given away its hydrogen,\n8:16\nyou're gonna find that more likely than when you have...\n8:19\nIt's gonna be higher concentrations having been\n8:21\ndeprotonated than being protonated.\n8:23\nSo, at physiological conditions, it's more likely\n8:26\nthat this oxygen has taken both of those electrons,\n8:33\nand now has a negative charge,\n8:35\nso it's given, it's just given away the hydrogen proton\n8:37\nbut took that hydrogen's electron.\n8:40\nSo it might be like this, and then the amino group,\n8:43\nthe amino group at physiological pH's,\n8:46\nit's likely to actually grab a proton.\n8:49\nSo nitrogen has an extra loan pair,\n8:52\nso it might use that loan pair to grab a proton,\n8:55\nin fact it's physiological pH's,\n8:56\nyou'll find a higher concentration of it having\n8:58\ngrabbed a proton than not grabbing a proton.\n9:01\nSo, the nitrogen will have grabbed a proton,\n9:05\nuse its loan pairs to grab a proton,\n9:07\nand so it is going to have...\n9:09\nSo it is going to have a...\n9:11\nIt is going to have a positive charge.\n9:14\nAnd so sometimes you will see amino acids\n9:19\ndescribed this way, and this is actually more accurate\n9:21\nfor what you're likely to find at physiological conditions,\n9:24\nand these molecules have an interesting name,\n9:26\na molecule that is neutral even though\n9:28\nparts of it have charge, like this,\n9:31\nthis is called a zwitterion.\n9:33\nThat's a fun, fun word.\n9:35\nZwitterion.\n9:39\nAnd \"zwitter\" in German means \"hybrid,\"\n9:41\nand \"ion\" obviously means that it's going to have charge,\n9:44\nand so this has hybrid charge,\n9:46\neven though it has charges at these ends,\n9:47\nthe charges net out to be neutral.",

a review,\n0:10\nif you've watched the mitosis video,\n0:12\nin mitosis, we start with a cell,\n0:16\nthat has a diploid number of chromosomes.\n0:19\nI'll just write 2n to show it has a diploid number.\n0:22\nFor human beings, this would be 46 chromosomes.\n0:29\n46 for humans, you get 23 chromosomes from your mother,\n0:33\n23 chromosomes from your father or you can say\n0:36\nyou have 23 homologous pairs, which leads to 46 chromosomes.\n0:42\nNow after the process of mitosis happens\n0:44\nand you have your cytokinesis and all the rest,\n0:47\nyou end up with two cells that each\n0:49\nhave the same genetic information as the original.\n0:53\nSo you now have two cells\n0:56\nthat each have the diploid number of chromosomes.\n0:59\nSo, 2n and 2n.\n1:04\nAnd now each of these cells\n1:05\nare just like this cell was,\n1:08\nit can go through interphase again.\n1:10\nIt grows and it can replicate its DNA\n1:15\nand centrosomes and grow some more\n1:16\nthen each of these can go through mitosis again.\n1:19\nAnd this is actually how\n1:21\nmost of the cells in your body grow.\n1:23\nThis is how you turn from a single cell organism into you,\n1:27\nor for the most part, into you.\n1:30\nSo that is mitosis.\n1:32\nIt's a cycle.\n1:33\nAfter each of these things go through mitosis,\n1:36\nthey can then go through\n1:37\nthe entire cell cycle again.\n1:38\nLet me write this a little bit neater.\n1:40\nMitosis, that s was a little bit hard to read.\n1:43\nNow what happens in meiosis?\n1:45\nWhat happens in meiosis?\n1:48\nI'll do that over here.\n1:50\nIn meiosis, something slightly different happens\n1:54\nand it happens in two phases.\n1:58\nYou will start with a cell\n2:00\nthat has a diploid number of chromosomes.\n2:03\nSo you will start with a cell\n2:06\nthat has a diploid number of chromosomes.\n2:09\nAnd in it's interphase, it also replicates its DNA.\n2:12\nAnd then it goes through something called Meiosis One.\n2:15\nAnd in Meiosis One,\n2:16\nwhat you end up with is two cells\n2:18\nthat now have haploid number of chromosomes.\n2:23\nSo you end up with two cells,\n2:26\nYou now have two cells that each have a\n2:28\nhaploid number of chromosomes.\n2:31\nSo you have n and you have n.\n2:34\nSo if we're talking about human beings,\n2:35\nyou have 46 chromosomes here,\n2:37\nand now you have 23 chromosomes in this nucleus.\n2:40\nAnd now you have 23 in this nucleus.\n2:42\nBut you're still not done.\n2:45\nThen each of these will go through a phase,\n2:47\nwhich I'll talk about in a second, which is\n2:49\nvery similar to mitosis, which will\n2:53\nduplicate this entire cell into two.\n2:56\nSo actually, let me do it like this.\n2:57\nSo now, this one,\n3:01\nyou're going to have four cells\n3:04\nthat each have the haploid number\n3:06\nthat each have the haploid number of chromosomes.\n3:11\nAnd they don't all necessarily have the same\n3:13\ngenetic informatioin anymore.\n3:15\nBecause as we go through this first phase,\n3:17\nright over here of meiosis, and this first phase\n3:19\nhere you go from diploid to haploid, right over here,\n3:23\nthis is called Meiosis One.\n3:25\nMeiosis One,\n3:29\nyou're essentially splitting the homologous pairs\n3:32\nand so this one might get some of the\n3:36\nones that you originally got from your father,\n3:38\nand some that you originally got from your mother,\n3:39\nsome that you originally got from your father,\n3:41\nsome that you originally got from your mother,\n3:43\nthey split randomly, but each homogolous pair\n3:46\ngets split up.\n3:48\nAnd then in this phase, Meiosis Two,\n3:51\nso this phase right over here is called Meiosis Two,\n3:55\nit's very similar\n3:56\nto mitosis, except your now dealing with cells that start off\n4:00\nwith the haploid number.\n4:02\nIt's important to realize that meiosis is not a cycle.\n4:05\nThese cells that you have over here, these are gametes.\n4:09\nThis are sex cells.\n4:10\nThese are gametes.\n4:12\nThis can now be used in fertilization.\n4:14\nIf we're talking about, if you're male, this is happening\n4:18\nin your testes, and these are going to be sperm cells\n4:22\nIf you are female, this is happening in your ovaries\n4:26\nand these are going to be egg cells.\n4:28\nIf you a tree, this could be pollen or it could be an ovul.\n4:34\nBut these are used for fertilization.\n4:37\nThese will fuse together in sexual reproduction\n4:39\nto get to a fertilized egg, which then can undergo\n4:44\nmitosis to create an entirely new organism.\n4:48\nSo not a cycle here,\n4:49\nalthough these will find sex cells\n4:52\nfrom another organism and fuse with them\n4:57\nand those can turn into another organism.\n4:59\nAnd I guess the whole circle of life starts again.\n5:01\nBut it's not the case with mitosis where this can keep\n5:04\ngoing and going, going.\n5:05\nThis cell is just like this cell, while these sex cells\n5:10\nare differeent than this one right over here.\n5:12\nNow, where does this happen in the body?\n5:14\nWe've talked about this in previous videos.\n5:16\nThese are your somatic cells right over here.\n5:19\nThese are the ones that make up the bulk of your body,\n5:22\nsomatic cells.\n5:23\nAnd where is this happening?\n5:25\nWell, this is happening in germ cells,\n5:27\nAs we mentioned, if you're male it's in your tesis\n5:29\nand if you're female it's in your ovaries.\n5:32\nAnd germ cells actually can undergo mitosis\n5:36\nto produce other germ cells that have a diploid\n5:38\nnumber of chromosomes, or they can undergo\n5:42\nmeiosis in order to produce sperm or egg cells\n5:46\nin order to produce gametes.",

vessels, round and round through the body.\n0:15\nAnd the purpose of this whole system\n0:17\nis to get blood out here to the capillary beds.\n0:21\nSo here's a capillary bed.\n0:22\nAnd that's where the blood vessels become very skinny.\n0:25\nAnd they divide.\n0:27\nAnd because they're so skinny, they\n0:29\nhave a lot more surface area.\n0:31\nAnd that increased surface area allows the blood\n0:33\nto exchange its oxygen and nutrients with these cells\n0:37\nhere that I'm drawing, which need those things.\n0:41\nSo the blood gives its oxygen to these cells.\n0:44\nAnd by the time it gets through the capillary bed,\n0:47\nit's lost its own oxygen.\n0:48\nAnd so now it's blue.\n0:50\nAnd that blood goes back to the heart.\n0:53\nNow, I haven't drawn it, but here also the blood\n0:56\ngoes through the lungs and gets new oxygen,\n0:58\nso that when it goes around again, it has oxygen.\n1:01\nSo this is a closed loop, with blood going round\n1:04\nand round and round.\n1:05\nBut it has a problem, which is that the heart needs\n1:08\nto pump quite strong for blood to go around fast enough\n1:12\nand feed all the cells in your body.\n1:15\nAnd what that means is that the pressure that the heart exerts\n1:18\nis very high.\n1:19\nSo there's high pressure in the heart.\n1:21\nAnd there's high pressure throughout these blood vessels.\n1:24\nAnd what that actually does is it forces some fluid out\n1:28\nof your blood vessels, and especially\n1:31\nout of these capillaries here.\n1:32\nIt forces some fluid out.\n1:34\nAnd that fluid is not exactly blood,\n1:37\nbecause, for example, the red blood\n1:39\ncells which are in your blood are too big to squeeze out.\n1:44\nBut the sort of more liquidy part\n1:46\nof your blood, which is like the plasma, that does\n1:49\nget squeezed out.\n1:49\nAnd so that's what ends up here.\n1:52\nAnd that fluid mixes in with the cells\n1:56\nwhich are outside of the capillaries.\n1:59\nAnd it accumulates.\n2:01\nNow, this is a problem, because if we let this go on,\n2:04\nwe would lose pretty much all of the fluid in the blood.\n2:07\nAnd we would get a buildup of fluid out here.\n2:09\nAnd that would be an unsustainable situation.\n2:14\nSo that's where your lymphatic system comes in.\n2:16\nThis is the problem that it addresses.\n2:19\nSo your lymphatic system is actually\n2:20\nanother plumbing system, which I'm going to try to draw here.\n2:25\nSo it's another plumbing system.\n2:26\nIt has these vessels which kind of\n2:29\nstart in the middle of nowhere.\n2:31\nAnd they collect this fluid.\n2:34\nThe fluid goes in.\n2:35\nThey collect it.\n2:36\nAnd they bring it back into circulation.\n2:40\nSo they bring it back into the blood.\n2:43\nAnd that way, it goes back in.\n2:45\nAnd the blood can continue to circulate.\n2:47\nAnd we now do have a sustainable situation.\n2:51\nSo these vessels here we call lymphatic vessels.\n2:55\nAnd if you'll notice, they're a little bit\n2:56\ndifferent from blood vessels because they\n3:00\ndon't form a closed loop.\n3:02\nThe lymph, as this stuff is called,\n3:05\nlymph-- so that's the fluid that gets forced out of your blood.\n3:09\nThe lymph goes in here.\n3:11\nAnd it gets dumped out into the blood vessels there.\n3:13\nIt doesn't go back around to the start.\n3:17\nSo that's kind of the basic explanation\n3:19\nfor why we need these lymphatic vessels.\n3:21\nBut to give it a little bit more depth,\n3:24\nlet's take one of these capillaries.\n3:26\nAnd we're going to zoom in.\n3:28\nAnd we're going to draw it a little bit rotated here.\n3:31\nHope that doesn't throw you off.\n3:34\nThese are the endothelial cells lining that capillary.\n3:39\nAnd we're going to study exactly how fluid gets forced out.\n3:46\nSo as we move along this capillary,\n3:49\nthe blood is going to become deoxygenated.\n3:53\nAnd so I'm drawing the changing colors.\n3:55\nEven though, in reality, it's not the endothelial cells that\n3:58\nare changing colors, but having these colors will help orient,\n4:01\nI think.\n4:04\nAnd so flowing through this capillary,\n4:06\nyou have little red blood cells, which\n4:09\nI'll try to draw as little disks there.\n4:13\nYou have little red blood cells.\n4:14\nAnd of course you have lots of water, a lot of water.\n4:20\nAnd finally, you also have a bunch of little proteins.\n4:24\nSome of the proteins are actually bigger than others,\n4:27\nso we'll draw them in varying sizes.\n4:29\nBut all this stuff is present in the blood.\n4:32\nAnd because of the high pressure, it gets squeezed out.\n4:36\nSo the first question is exactly where and how\n4:38\ndoes it get squeezed out?\n4:39\nAnd the answer is it gets through between the cells.\n4:43\nThe cells are not quite held together\n4:46\ntightly enough to prevent stuff from getting out.\n4:49\nBut they are held tightly enough to prevent the bigger things\n4:52\nfrom getting out.\n4:52\nSo the red blood cells and the bigger proteins won't get out.\n4:56\nBut what will get out is some of the fluid, some of the water,\n4:59\nand some of the smaller proteins, which\n5:02\nwe'll draw like this.\n5:06\nSo actually, by the time the blood gets down\n5:08\nto the latter part of the capillary,\n5:11\nit's lost some of these smaller proteins\n5:14\nand some of this fluid.\n5:16\nAnd so let's show that by actually erasing some of it.\n5:18\nAnd so the concentration of bigger proteins is higher.\n5:24\nAnd you could even say that the concentration of red blood\n5:27\ncells is a little higher.\n5:30\nSo we have a higher concentration\n5:34\nof solutes in this part of the capillary\n5:38\nthan we had over there.\n5:39\nAnd the reason why I'm mentioning this\n5:41\nis because there's actually a subtlety, a complication here,\n5:45\nwhich is that although lymph or what will soon\n5:48\nbe lymph is being forced out of the capillary over here,\n5:53\nactually some fluid comes back into the blood\n5:56\nvessel over here.\n5:58\nAnd to understand that, you need to know\n6:00\nthat the concentration of solutes\n6:02\nis higher here, which leads to a higher osmotic pressure pulling\n6:07\nfluid back in.\n6:09\nAnd to understand it, you also need\n6:10\nto know that the pressure, the regular hydrostatic pressure,\n6:14\nis lower in the latter part of the capillary\n6:17\ncompared to the earlier part.\n6:19\nSo the pressure goes down.\n6:21\nAnd the pressure was what was pushing the lymph out\n6:26\nof the blood vessel over here.\n6:27\nSo now we have less pushing out, and more pulling back in.\n6:31\nThe stuff that's pulling back in is the osmotic pressure\n6:35\ncaused by the increased concentration.\n6:39\nSo here, some of the fluid and some of the smaller proteins\n6:46\nmight get pulled back in.\n6:48\nSo now you might be confused because I\n6:50\nsaid that fluid is getting pushed out,\n6:53\nis leaking out of the blood vessels.\n6:55\nAnd here I'm saying that it's leaking out but then\n6:57\ncoming back in.\n6:58\nBut the fact is that more goes out than comes back in.\n7:03\nAnd so let's draw these arrows a little bigger.\n7:06\nSo more goes out than comes back in.\n7:09\nAnd so net result of the blood traveling\n7:12\nthrough this capillary is that you end up\n7:15\nwith lymph squeezed out.\n7:18\nSo now you know a little more detail\n7:19\nabout how and why we end up with lymph.\n7:22\nBut you might be asking yourself,\n7:23\nwhy don't these cells just tighten up their connections\n7:26\nthere to prevent stuff from getting out?\n7:29\nBut the answer is, you have to remember\n7:31\nthat we have other cells around here which want to be fed.\n7:35\nThey want to get glucose and other such things\n7:38\nfrom the blood.\n7:40\nAnd so it's important that little glucose molecules\n7:44\nand small proteins like hormones can get out\n7:47\ninto this space near these cells so\n7:50\nthat it can interact with them.\n7:52\nSo basically, if these endothelial cells\n7:55\nin the capillaries were tightly connected together,\n7:58\nthen all these cells in your body\n8:00\nwould kind of be sealed off.\n8:02\nAnd you might be wondering, well,\n8:04\nare these gaps also necessary so that oxygen\n8:06\ncan get to the cells?\n8:08\nAnd actually, oxygen is different.\n8:10\nIt's very small.\n8:11\nIt's just two atoms, one molecule.\n8:13\nSo oxygen can just go right through the cells.\n8:16\nIt can just travel right through walls\n8:18\nand get where it needs to.\n8:21\nSo hopefully this gives you a better idea\n8:23\nof how lymph is kind of formed from capillaries,\n8:27\nhow a bunch is squeezed out and only some of it gets back in.\n8:31\nSo finally, I just wanted to draw a pretty ugly human being,\n8:38\nand make the point that you pretty much have capillaries\n8:43\nall over your body.\n8:44\nThey're feeding all your muscles, all\n8:46\nyour different tissues.\n8:47\nAnd for that reason, you need lymph vessels\n8:50\nto take lymph away from pretty much all of your body.\n8:53\nSo you have lymph vessels coming out of your legs,\n8:55\ncoming out of your arms, and so on.\n8:57\nAnd in a sense, they have a similar structure\n8:59\nto blood vessels, which is that they start very small.\n9:02\nAnd many of them come together and join up\n9:05\ninto a bigger lymph vessel.\n9:06\nAnd that lymph vessel joins with another, bigger lymph vessel,\n9:09\nand so on.\n9:10\nAnd so it's kind of like they start out as capillaries,\n9:14\nand then they merge together and get bigger and bigger.\n9:16\nBut of course they have the big difference\n9:18\nfrom blood vessels, which is that they're not a closed loop.\n9:21\nUltimately, when they've consolidated\n9:23\ninto big lymphatic vessels, they just\n9:26\ndump their contents back into blood circulation.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nYou've probably heard of\n0:02\npeople having a stroke,\n0:04\nand you're probably familiar with the notion\n0:07\nthat it has something to do\n0:09\nwith the brain, and you'd be right.\n0:10\nIn particular, it's a rapid loss of\n0:14\nbrain function because of\n0:15\nsomething strange happening\n0:17\nwith the blood flow to the brain.\n0:20\nAnd let me show you that\n0:21\nin a little bit more detail.\n0:23\nAnd to do that,\n0:24\nlet's think about\n0:24\nthe 2 major types of strokes.\n0:26\nThere's the ischemic strokes,\n0:34\nand the other type of stroke\n0:35\nis hemorrhagic,\n0:36\nand these can kind of be sub-categorized,\n0:38\nbut I won't go into all of the details there.\n0:44\nAnd if I really just define\n0:46\nischemia and hemorrhaging to you,\n0:48\nI think you'll have an idea\n0:49\nof how these strokes are different\n0:50\nand how they interrupt the blood flow\n0:53\nto different parts of the brain.\n0:55\nYou know from the videos on\n0:57\nstenosis and ischemia\n0:59\nand the videos on heart attacks\n1:00\nthat ischemia is\n1:01\na lack of blood flow\n1:03\nto certain body tissues.\n1:05\nSo an ischemic stroke is actually\n1:07\nvery, very similar to what we saw\n1:09\nin a heart attack,\n1:10\nexcept it's not occurring\n1:11\nin a coronary blood vessel,\n1:12\nit's occurring in a blood vessel\n1:14\nin the brain.\n1:16\nSo let me draw that right over here.\n1:18\nLet's say that this is\n1:19\na blood vessel in the brain.\n1:25\nAnd let's say that blood is flowing\n1:27\nin that direction (this is an artery).\n1:30\nAnd so you could imagine\n1:31\nthat maybe there is a big blood clot\n1:33\nthat forms in some part of the brain.\n1:35\nLet me do the blood clot in magenta.\n1:37\nThis blood clot might form because --\n1:38\nno, that's not magenta --\n1:40\nthe blood clot might form\n1:41\nbecause maybe there's a plaque there,\n1:43\nmaybe the plaque got ruptured,\n1:45\neither way, this clot is restricting\n1:48\nthe flow of blood.\n1:49\nAnd we know that this blood clot --\n1:50\nwe can call this a thrombus,\n1:55\nor we could say that thrombosis\n1:57\nhas occurred over here--\n1:58\neither way, the blood flow is restricted,\n2:01\nand the brain tissue that's further downstream\n2:05\nis not going to get its oxygen,\n2:07\nand it might die; it might experience infarction.\n2:11\nAnd that's why ischemic strokes are also\n2:13\nsometimes called cerebral infarctions.\n2:19\nThese are all very fancy words,\n2:20\nbut I think, hopefully, they're becoming\n2:22\na little bit more common in our vocabulary,\n2:24\nthey keep showing up over and over again.\n2:27\nAnd I also want to be clear:\n2:29\nmost strokes are actually\n2:30\nischemic strokes.\n2:32\nThe numbers I looked up, they say,\n2:34\n87% of strokes are ischemic.\n2:39\nNow, the other type of way\n2:41\nthat you could have ischemia\n2:42\nin one of these blood vessels,\n2:44\nand this is completely analogous\n2:45\nto what we saw in the heart,\n2:47\nwhen we had heart attacks, is:\n2:49\nyou could have thrombosis,\n2:50\nor you could also have an embolism.\n2:52\nWhenever someone says thrombosis,\n2:55\nor a thrombus, or thrombi,\n2:57\nthey're talking about blood clots.\n2:59\nWhenever someone talks about\n3:00\nan embolus, or emboli, or embolism,\n3:03\nthey're talking about something\n3:04\nmoving through the blood\n3:05\nthat eventually blocks a blood vessel.\n3:08\nSo you can actually have\n3:09\na thromboembolism,\n3:10\nyou can actually have a blood clot\n3:14\nthat gets broken off --\n3:17\nso let me ignore this for now--\n3:19\nlet me paint over it a little bit\n3:22\nso that this isn't the main cause of blockage--\n3:24\nbut you could actually have a blood clot\n3:26\nthat breaks off, becomes an embolus,\n3:33\nand since it's an embolus due to a blood clot,\n3:35\nyou call it a thrombembolus --\n3:37\nI always have trouble saying all of these words--\n3:39\nand eventually it blocks an artery over here.\n3:46\nSo this right here is an embolism,\n3:51\nbut either way, you're blocking the blood flow\n3:53\nfurther down the brain,\n3:55\n[which] could cause infarction,\n3:56\nthat brain tissue will die,\n3:57\nand whatever that brain tissue did\n4:00\nfor mental function, or whatever,\n4:03\nis going to make it very hard\n4:04\nfor this person who is experiencing this stroke\n4:06\nto do those things.\n4:08\nNow, it's not always noticeable,\n4:08\nthat's called a silent stroke,\n4:11\nbut damage is occurring.\n4:13\nThe person experiencing the stroke--\n4:15\nand I'm not a doctor,\n4:16\nso take all of this with a grain of salt--\n4:18\nthe person experiencing the stroke\n4:20\ncould be anywhere from -\n4:21\nwell, one, they may not even notice\n4:22\nthat damage is occurring,\n4:24\nthey might have a headache,\n4:25\nor it might be more severe,\n4:26\nthey might actually\n4:28\nnot be able to properly move\n4:29\na side of their body,\n4:30\nor a side of their face,\n4:32\nor properly be able to speak,\n4:33\nso it really depends on what\n4:34\npart of the brain is being damaged.\n4:37\nBut in either of these situations,\n4:39\nan ischemic stroke is caused by\n4:40\nsome type of restriction or blockage\n4:43\nthat causes things downstream to not\n4:45\nget proper oxygen, and then,\n4:47\nso you can imagine,\n4:48\ncells over here aren't going\n4:49\nto get their oxygen,\n4:50\nand then they might actually die.\n4:53\nA hemorrhagic stroke -\n4:54\nto hemorrhage means to bleed,\n4:56\nit's literally just a fancy word for bleeding-\n4:58\nand so in a hemorrhagic stroke\n5:00\nyou have a situation where a blood vessel\n5:02\ncan actually break, where you have a blood vessel-\n5:06\nI'm actually trying to draw\n5:07\nthe same blood vessel- where it actually breaks.\n5:09\nWe'll talk more in the future\n5:10\nof why a blood vessel might break -\n5:12\nstrongly related to high blood pressure\n5:14\nand other risk factors,\n5:15\nbut I don't want to get into that right now -\n5:17\nbut you could imagine if a blood vessel breaks,\n5:20\nyou have all this blood spewing into the brain\n5:22\nin, kind of, an uncontrolled way.\n5:24\nSo let's say this little diagram\n5:26\n[that] I drew right here,\n5:28\nthat part of the brain,\n5:29\nif you have a hemorrhagic stroke,\n5:30\nyou have all of this blood\n5:31\nthat's flowing into the brain,\n5:32\nand all of that uncontrolled blood\n5:35\nwill mess up that part of the brain,\n5:37\nthat causes those neurons\n5:39\nand brain tissue to malfunction\n5:40\nand maybe causes some of them to die,\n5:43\nand it would also cause\n5:44\nthe blood flow further dowstream\n5:46\nto be impaired, so the stuff\n5:47\ndownstream aren't going to get\n5:49\nthe blood they need\n5:50\nbecause all the blood\n5:51\nis being released everywhere else.\n5:54\nAnd since 87% of strokes are ischemic strokes,\n5:57\nthe remainder are hemorrhagic,\n5:59\nso this is the remaining 13% of strokes.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's talk about one of the most\n0:01\nimportant biological processes.\n0:04\nFrankly, if this process didn't occur, we probably\n0:07\nwouldn't have life on Earth, and I wouldn't be making this\n0:09\nvideo for you, because there'd be no place for me to\n0:11\nactually get food.\n0:13\nAnd the process is called photosynthesis.\n0:20\nAnd you're probably reasonably familiar with the idea.\n0:23\nThe whole idea is plants, and actually bacteria and algae\n0:28\nand other things, but we normally\n0:29\nassociate it with plants.\n0:31\nLet me make it in very simple terms. So we normally\n0:33\nassociate it with plants.\n0:36\nAnd it's a process that plants use, and we might have learned\n0:38\nthis when we were very young.\n0:39\nIt's the process that plants use to take carbon dioxide\n0:43\nplus some water plus some sunlight and turn it into some\n0:56\nsugars or some maybe carbohydrates.\n1:00\nCarbohydrates or sugars plus oxygen.\n1:04\nObviously, this has two very profound pieces to it for us\n1:09\nas a living species.\n1:10\nOne, we need carbohydrates or we need sugars in order to\n1:14\nfuel our bodies.\n1:15\nYou saw that in the cellular respiration videos.\n1:17\nWe generate all of our ATP by performing cellular\n1:21\nrespiration on glucose, which is essentially a byproduct, or\n1:24\na broken down carbohydrate.\n1:27\nIt's the simplest one for us to process in cellular\n1:30\nrespiration.\n1:31\nAnd the second hugely important part\n1:33\nis getting the oxygen.\n1:34\nOnce again, we need to breathe oxygen in order for us to\n1:38\nbreak down glucose, in order to respire, in order to\n1:42\nperform cellar respiration.\n1:44\nSo these two things are key for life, especially for life\n1:50\nthat breathes oxygen.\n1:54\nSo this process, other than the fact that it's\n1:56\ninteresting, that there are organisms around us, mostly\n2:01\nplants, that are able to harness actual sunlight.\n2:05\nYou have these fusion reactions in the sun 93\n2:07\nmillion miles away, and it's releasing these photons, and\n2:11\nsome small subset of those photons reach\n2:13\nthe surface of Earth.\n2:14\nThey make their way through clouds and whatever else.\n2:17\nAnd then these plants and bacteria and algae are able to\n2:21\nharness that somehow and turn them into sugars that we can\n2:25\nthen eat or maybe the cow eats them and we eat the cow if\n2:29\nwe're not vegetarians, and we can then use that for energy.\n2:33\nNot that the cow is all carbohydrates, but this is\n2:35\nessentially what is used as the fuel or the energy for all\n2:39\nof the other important compounds that we eat.\n2:41\nThis is where we get all of our fuel.\n2:43\nSo this is fuel for animals.\n2:48\nOr you know, if you eat a potato directly, you are\n2:50\ndirectly getting your carbohydrates.\n2:52\nBut anyway, this is a very simple notion of\n2:55\nphotosynthesis, but it's not incorrect.\n2:56\nI mean, if you had to know one thing about photosynthesis,\n2:58\nthis would be it.\n3:00\nBut let's delve a little bit deeper and try to get into the\n3:03\nguts of it and see if we can understand a little bit better\n3:05\nhow this actually happens.\n3:06\nI find it amazing that somehow photons of sunlight are used\n3:10\nto create these sugar molecules or these\n3:13\ncarbohydrates.\n3:14\nSo let's delve a little bit deeper.\n3:16\nSo we can write the general equation for photosynthesis.\n3:21\nWell, I've almost written it here.\n3:23\nBut I'll write it a little bit more scientifically specific.\n3:27\nYou start off with some carbon dioxide.\n3:30\nYou add to that some water, and you add to that-- instead\n3:34\nof sunlight, I'm going to say photons because these are what\n3:38\nreally do excite the electrons in the chlorophyll that go\n3:42\ndown, and you'll see this process probably in this\n3:44\nvideo, and we'll go in more detail in the next few videos.\n3:47\nBut that excited electron goes to a high energy state, and as\n3:50\nit goes to a lower energy state, we're able to harness\n3:52\nthat energy to produce ATPs, and you'll see NADPHs, and\n3:57\nthose are used to produce carbohydrates.\n3:59\nBut we'll see that in a little bit.\n4:01\nBut the overview of photosynthesis, you start off\n4:03\nwith these constituents, And then you end up with a\n4:10\ncarbohydrate.\n4:11\nAnd a carbohydrate could be glucose,\n4:12\ndoesn't have to be glucose.\n4:14\nSo the general way we can write a carbohydrates is CH2O.\n4:20\nAnd we'll put an n over here, that we could have n multiples\n4:24\nof these, and normally, n will be at least three.\n4:27\nIn the case of glucose, n is 6.\n4:29\nYou have 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens and 6 oxygens.\n4:34\nSo this is a general term for carbohydrates, but you could\n4:36\nhave many multiples of that.\n4:38\nYou could have these long-chained carbohydrates, so\n4:40\nyou end up with a carbohydrate and then you end\n4:42\nup with some oxygen.\n4:45\nSo this right here isn't so different than what I wrote up\n4:48\nhere in my first overview of how we always imagined\n4:52\nphotosynthesis in our heads.\n4:53\nIn order to make this equation balance-- let's see, I have n\n4:56\ncarbons so I need n carbons there.\n4:59\nLet's see, I have two n hydrogens here.\n5:02\nTwo hydrogens and I have n there, so I need two n\n5:05\nhydrogens here.\n5:06\nSo I'll put an n out there.\n5:07\nAnd lets see how many oxygens.\n5:10\nI have two n oxygens, plus another n, so I\n5:12\nhave three n oxygens.\n5:13\nSo let's see, I have one n, and you put an n here, and\n5:18\nthen I have two n, and I think this equation balances out.\n5:21\nSo this is a 30,000-foot view of what's going on in\n5:26\nphotosynthesis.\n5:27\nBut when you dig a little deeper, you'll see that this\n5:29\ndoesn't happen directly, that this happens through a bunch\n5:32\nof steps that eventually gets us to the carbohydrate.\n5:37\nSo in general, we can break down photosynthesis.\n5:40\nI'll rewrite the word.\n5:42\nWe can break down photosynthesis-- and we'll\n5:47\ndelve deeper into future videos, but I want to get you\n5:49\nthe overview first-- into two stages.\n5:54\nWe can call one the light reactions.\n5:58\nOr sometimes they are called the light-dependent reactions,\n6:01\nand that actually would probably be a better\n6:04\nway to write it.\n6:04\nLet me write it like that.\n6:05\nLight dependent means that they need light to occur.\n6:10\nLight-dependent reactions.\n6:12\nAnd then you have something called the dark reactions, and\n6:14\nthat's actually a bad name, because it also\n6:18\noccurs in the light.\n6:19\nDark reactions, I wrote in a slightly darker color.\n6:23\nAnd the reason why I said it's a bad name is because it still\n6:26\noccurs in the light.\n6:32\nBut the reason why they probably called it the dark\n6:34\nreaction is that you don't need light, or that part of\n6:38\nphotosynthesis isn't dependent on photons to occur.\n6:41\nSo a better term for it would have been\n6:45\nlight-independent reaction.\n6:55\nSo just to be clear, the light reactions\n6:58\nactually need sunlight.\n6:59\nThey actually need photons for them to proceed.\n7:03\nThe dark reactions do not need photons for them to happen,\n7:07\nalthough they do occur when the sun is out.\n7:10\nThey don't need those photons, but they need the byproducts\n7:13\nfrom the light reaction to occur, so that's why it's\n7:14\ncalled the light-independent reaction.\n7:17\nThey occur while the sun is out, but they\n7:19\ndon't need the sun.\n7:20\nThis needs the sun, so let me make it very clear.\n7:24\nSo this requires sunlight.\n7:26\nThis requires photons.\n7:31\nAnd let me just make a very brief overview of this.\n7:35\nThis'll maybe let us start building a scaffold from which\n7:38\nwe can dig deeper.\n7:40\nSo the light reactions need photons, and\n7:42\nthen it needs water.\n7:46\nSo water goes into the light reactions and out of the other\n7:48\nside of the light reactions.\n7:49\nWe end up with some molecular oxygen.\n7:52\nSo that's what happens in the light reactions, and I'm going\n7:54\nto go much deeper into what actually occurs.\n7:57\nAnd what the light the actions produce is ATP, which we know\n8:03\nis the cellular or the biological currency of energy.\n8:07\nIt produces ATP and it produces NADPH.\n8:14\nNow, when we studied cellular respiration, we saw the\n8:16\nmolecule NADH.\n8:18\nNADPH is very similar.\n8:21\nYou just have this P there.\n8:23\nYou just have this phosphate group there, but they really\n8:25\nperform similar mechanisms. That this agent right here,\n8:31\nthis molecule right here, is able to give away-- now let's\n8:37\nthink about what this means-- it's able to give away this\n8:41\nhydrogen and the electron associated with this hydrogen.\n8:44\nSo if you give away an electron to someone else or\n8:48\nsomeone else gains an electron, that something else\n8:51\nis being reduced.\n8:53\nLet me write that down.\n8:54\nThis is a good reminder.\n8:56\nOIL RIG.\n8:59\nOxidation is losing an electron.\n9:02\nReduction is gaining an electron.\n9:04\nYour charge is reduced when you gain an electron.\n9:07\nIt has a negative charge.\n9:08\nSo this is a reducing agent.\n9:10\nIt gets oxidized by losing the hydrogen and the\n9:14\nelectron with it.\n9:15\nI have a whole discussion on the biological versus\n9:18\nchemistry view of oxidation, but it's the same idea.\n9:21\nWhen I lose a hydrogen, I also lose the ability to hog that\n9:25\nhydrogen's electron.\n9:27\nSo this right here, when it reacts with other things, it's\n9:30\na reducing agent.\n9:31\nIt gives away this hydrogen and the electron associated\n9:37\nwith it, and so the other thing gets reduced.\n9:40\nSo this thing is a reducing agent.\n9:46\nAnd what's useful about it is when this hydrogen, and\n9:49\nespecially the electron associated with that hydrogen,\n9:52\ngoes from the NADPH to, say, another molecule and goes to a\n9:56\nlower energy state, that energy can also be used in the\n10:01\ndark reactions.\n10:02\nAnd we saw in cellular respiration the very similar\n10:04\nmolecule, NADH, that through the Kreb Cycle, or actually\n10:09\nmore importantly, that through the electron transport chain,\n10:11\nwas able to help produce ATP as it gave away its electrons\n10:17\nand they went to lower energy states.\n10:18\nBut I don't want to confuse you too much.\n10:20\nSo the light reactions, you take in photons, you take in\n10:23\nwater, it spits out oxygen, and it spits out ATP and NADPH\n10:28\nthat can then be used in the dark reactions.\n10:32\nAnd the dark reactions, for most plants we talk about,\n10:35\nit's called the Calvin Cycle.\n10:39\nAnd I'll go into a lot more detail of what actually occurs\n10:43\nin the Calvin Cycle, but it takes in the ATP, the NADPH,\n10:48\nand it produces-- it doesn't directly produce glucose.\n10:56\nIt produces-- oh, you probably saw this.\n11:00\nYou could call it PGAL.\n11:02\nYou could call it G3P.\n11:05\nThese all stand for-- let me write these down-- this is\n11:09\nphosphoglyceraldehyde.\n11:21\nMy handwriting broke down.\n11:23\nOr you could call it glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.\n11:35\nSame exact molecule.\n11:38\nYou can almost imagine it as-- this is a very gross\n11:41\noversimplification-- as three carbons with a phosphate group\n11:45\nattached to it.\n11:48\nBut this can then be used to produce other carbohydrates,\n11:51\nincluding glucose.\n11:52\nIf you have two of these, you can use those\n11:54\ntwo to produce glucose.\n11:57\nSo let's just take a quick overview again because this is\n11:59\nsuper important.\n12:00\nI'm going to make videos on the light reactions and the\n12:03\ndark reactions.\n12:04\nThose will be the next two videos I make.\n12:05\nSo photosynthesis, you start with photons.\n12:08\nAll of these occur when the sun is out, but only the light\n12:11\nreactions actually need the photons.\n12:14\nThe light reactions take photons-- we're going to go\n12:16\ninto more detail about what actually occurs--\n12:17\nand it takes in water.\n12:19\nOxygen gets spit out.\n12:21\nATP and NADPH get spit out, which are then used by the\n12:24\ndark reaction, or the Calvin Cycle, or the\n12:28\nlight-independent reaction, because these still\n12:30\noccur in the light.\n12:31\nThey just don't need photons.\n12:32\nSo they're the light-independent reaction.\n12:34\nAnd it uses that in conjunction-- and we'll talk\n12:37\nabout other molecules that are used in conjunction.\n12:39\nOh, and I forgot a very important constituent of the\n12:43\ndark reaction.\n12:45\nIt needs carbon dioxide.\n12:47\nThat's where you get your carbons to keep producing\n12:50\nthese phosphoglyceraldehydes, or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.\n12:54\nSo that's super important.\n12:56\nIt takes in the carbon dioxide, the products from the\n13:00\nlight reactions, and then uses that in the Calvin Cycle to\n13:05\nproduce this very simple building block of other\n13:09\ncarbohydrates.\n13:09\nAnd if you remember from glycolysis, you might remember\n13:12\nthat this PGAL molecule, or this G3P-- same thing-- this\n13:16\nwas actually the first product when we split glucose in two\n13:20\nwhen we performed the glycolysis.\n13:21\nSo now we're going the other way.\n13:23\nWe're building glucose so that we can split\n13:25\nit later for energy.\n13:26\nSo this is an overview of photosynthesis, and in the\n13:29\nnext couple of videos, I'm actually going to delve a\n13:31\nlittle bit deeper and tell you about the light reactions and\n13:33\nthe dark reactions and how they actually occur.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWe've learned a little bit about gravity.\n0:02\nWe've learned a little bit about electrostatic.\n0:05\nSo, time to learn about a new fundamental\n0:09\nforce of the universe.\n0:10\nAnd this one is probably second most familiar to us,\n0:13\nnext to gravity.\n0:13\nAnd that's magnetism.\n0:17\nWhere does the word come from?\n0:18\nWell, I think several civilizations-- I'm no\n0:21\nhistorian-- found these lodestones, these objects that\n0:29\nwould attract other objects like it, other magnets.\n0:33\nOr would even attract metallic objects like iron.\n0:37\nFerrous objects.\n0:39\nAnd they're called lodestones.\n0:41\nThat's, I guess, the Western term for it.\n0:43\nAnd the reason why they're called magnets is because\n0:45\nthey're named after lodestones that were found near the Greek\n0:50\nprovince of Magnesia.\n0:56\nAnd I actually think the people who lived there were\n0:58\ncalled Magnetes.\n1:00\nBut anyway, you could Wikipedia that and learn more\n1:03\nabout it than I know.\n1:05\nBut anyway let's focus on what magnetism is.\n1:08\nAnd I think most of us have at least a working knowledge of\n1:12\nwhat it is; we've all played with magnets and we've dealt\n1:15\nwith compasses.\n1:16\nBut I'll tell you this right now, what it really is, is\n1:20\npretty deep.\n1:22\nAnd I think it's fairly-- I don't think anyone has-- we\n1:25\ncan mathematically understand it and manipulate it and see\n1:28\nhow it relates to electricity.\n1:31\nWe actually will show you the electrostatic force and the\n1:33\nmagnetic force are actually the same thing, just viewed\n1:37\nfrom different frames of reference.\n1:39\nI know that all of that sounds very\n1:40\ncomplicated and all of that.\n1:41\nBut in our classical Newtonian world we treat them as two\n1:45\ndifferent forces.\n1:46\nBut what I'm saying is although we're kind of used to\n1:48\na magnet just like we're used to gravity, just like gravity\n1:52\nis also fairly mysterious when you really think about what it\n1:54\nis, so is magnetism.\n1:56\nSo with that said, let's at least try to get some working\n1:59\nknowledge of how we can deal with magnetism.\n2:02\nSo we're all familiar with a magnet.\n2:07\nI didn't want it to be yellow.\n2:10\nI could make the boundary yellow.\n2:12\nNo, I didn't want it to be like that either.\n2:16\nSo if this is a magnet, we know that a magnet\n2:21\nalways has two poles.\n2:24\nIt has a north pole and a south pole.\n2:28\nAnd these were just labeled by convention.\n2:30\nBecause when people first discovered these lodestones,\n2:33\nor they took a lodestone and they magnetized a needle with\n2:37\nthat lodestone, and then that needle they put on a cork in a\n2:40\nbucket of water, and that needle would point to the\n2:44\nEarth's north pole.\n2:46\nThey said, oh, well the side of the needle that is pointing\n2:48\nto the Earth's north, let's call that the north pole.\n2:50\nAnd the point of the needle that's pointing to the south\n2:52\npole-- sorry, the point of the needle that's pointing to the\n2:57\nEarth's geographic south, we'll call\n2:59\nthat the south pole.\n3:00\nOr another way to put it, if we have a magnet, the\n3:03\ndirection of the magnet or the side of the magnet that\n3:05\norients itself-- if it's allowed to orient freely\n3:07\nwithout friction-- towards our geographic north, we call that\n3:11\nthe north pole.\n3:12\nAnd the other side is the south pole.\n3:14\nAnd this is actually a little bit-- obviously we call the\n3:23\ntop of the Earth the north pole.\n3:26\nYou know, this is the north pole.\n3:30\nAnd we call this the south pole.\n3:34\nAnd there's another notion of magnetic north.\n3:38\nAnd that's where-- I guess, you could kind of say-- that\n3:42\nis where a compass, the north point of a\n3:47\ncompass, will point to.\n3:48\nAnd actually, magnetic north moves around because we have\n3:51\nall of this moving fluid inside of the earth.\n3:54\nAnd a bunch of other interactions.\n3:55\nIt's a very complex interaction.\n3:56\nBut magnetic north is actually roughly in northern Canada.\n4:01\nSo magnetic north might be here.\n4:04\nSo that might be magnetic north.\n4:05\nAnd magnetic south, I don't know exactly where that is.\n4:07\nBut it can kind of move around a little bit.\n4:09\nIt's not in the same place.\n4:10\nSo it's a little bit off the axis of the geographic north\n4:14\npole and the south pole.\n4:16\nAnd this is another slightly confusing thing.\n4:19\nMagnetic north is the geographic location, where the\n4:23\nnorth pole of a magnet will point to.\n4:26\nBut that would actually be the south pole, if you viewed the\n4:31\nEarth as a magnet.\n4:35\nSo if the Earth was a big magnet, you would actually\n4:38\nview that as a south pole of the magnet.\n4:40\nAnd the geographic south pole is the\n4:43\nnorth pole of the magnet.\n4:44\nYou could read more about that on Wikipedia, I know it's a\n4:46\nlittle bit confusing.\n4:47\nBut in general, when most people refer to magnetic\n4:49\nnorth, or the north pole, they're talking about the\n4:51\ngeographic north area.\n4:53\nAnd the south pole is the geographic south area.\n4:56\nBut the reason why I make this distinction is because we know\n5:00\nwhen we deal with magnets, just like electricity, or\n5:03\nelectrostatics-- but I'll show a key difference very\n5:06\nshortly-- is that opposite poles attract.\n5:10\nSo if this side of my magnet is attracted to Earth's north\n5:14\npole then Earth's north pole-- or Earth's magnetic north--\n5:19\nactually must be the south pole of that magnet.\n5:22\nAnd vice versa.\n5:23\nThe south pole of my magnet here is going to be attracted\n5:26\nto Earth's magnetic south.\n5:28\nWhich is actually the north pole of the\n5:29\nmagnet we call Earth.\n5:31\nAnyway, I'll take Earth out of the equation because it gets a\n5:34\nlittle bit confusing.\n5:35\nAnd we'll just stick to bars because that tends to be a\n5:37\nlittle bit more consistent.\n5:40\nLet me erase this.\n5:44\nThere you go.\n5:45\nI'll erase my Magnesia.\n5:49\nI wonder if the element magnesium was first discovered\n5:52\nin Magnesia, as well.\n5:53\nProbably.\n5:55\nAnd I actually looked up Milk of\n5:57\nMagnesia, which is a laxative.\n5:58\nAnd it was not discovered in Magnesia, but it has\n6:02\nmagnesium in it.\n6:04\nSo I guess its roots could be in Magnesia if magnesium was\n6:08\ndiscovered in Magnesia.\n6:09\nAnyway, enough about Magnesia.\n6:11\nBack to the magnets.\n6:13\nSo if this is a magnet, and let me draw another magnet.\n6:18\nActually, let me erase all of this.\n6:23\nAll right.\n6:24\nSo let me draw two more magnets.\n6:32\nWe know from experimentation when we were all kids, this is\n6:36\nthe north pole, this is the south pole.\n6:38\nThat the north pole is going to be attracted to the south\n6:43\npole of another magnet.\n6:45\nAnd that if I were to flip this magnet around, it would\n6:48\nactually repel north-- two north facing magnets would\n6:52\nrepel each other.\n6:54\nAnd so we have this notion, just like we had in\n6:56\nelectrostatics, that a magnet generates a field.\n7:01\nIt generates these vectors around it, that if you put\n7:05\nsomething in that field that can be affected by it, it'll\n7:09\nbe some net force acting on it.\n7:15\nSo actually, before I go into magnetic field, I actually\n7:17\nwant to make one huge distinction between magnetism\n7:24\nand electrostatics.\n7:25\nMagnetism always comes in the form of a dipole.\n7:30\nWhat does a dipole mean?\n7:30\nIt means that we have two poles.\n7:32\nA north and a south.\n7:34\nIn electrostatics, you do have two charges.\n7:40\nYou have a positive charge and a negative charge.\n7:43\nSo you do have two charges.\n7:44\nBut they could be by themselves.\n7:46\nYou could just have a proton.\n7:48\nYou don't have to have an electron there\n7:49\nright next to it.\n7:50\nYou could just have a proton and it would create a positive\n7:54\nelectrostatic field.\n7:56\nAnd our field lines are what a positive point\n7:57\ncharge would do.\n7:59\nAnd it would be repelled.\n8:00\nSo you don't always have to have a negative charge there.\n8:05\nSimilarly you could just have an electron.\n8:07\nAnd you don't have to have a proton there.\n8:08\nSo you could have monopoles.\n8:10\nThese are called monopoles, when you just have one charge\n8:12\nwhen you're talking about electrostatics.\n8:14\nBut with magnetism you always have a dipole.\n8:17\nIf I were to take this magnet, this one right here, and if I\n8:20\nwere to cut it in half, somehow miraculously each of\n8:28\nthose halves of that magnet will turn\n8:30\ninto two more magnets.\n8:31\nWhere this will be the south, this'll be the north, this'll\n8:34\nbe the south, this will be the north.\n8:36\nAnd actually, theoretically, I've read-- my own abilities\n8:41\ndon't go this far-- there could be such a thing as a\n8:44\nmagnetic monopole, although it has not been\n8:46\nobserved yet in nature.\n8:48\nSo everything we've seen in nature has been a dipole.\n8:51\nSo you could just keep cutting this up, all the way down to\n8:54\nif it's just one electron left.\n8:56\nAnd it actually turns out that even one electron is still a\n8:59\nmagnetic dipole.\n9:00\nIt still is generating, it still has a north pole and a\n9:04\nsouth pole.\n9:05\nAnd actually it turns out, all magnets, the magnetic field is\n9:08\nactually generated by the electrons within it.\n9:12\nBy the spin of electrons and that-- you know, when we talk\n9:14\nabout electron spin we imagine some little\n9:16\nball of charge spinning.\n9:18\nBut electrons are-- you know, it's hard to--\n9:20\nthey do have mass.\n9:21\nBut it starts to get fuzzy whether they\n9:23\nare energy or mass.\n9:24\nAnd then how does a ball of energy spin?\n9:26\nEt cetera, et cetera.\n9:27\nSo it gets very almost metaphysical.\n9:31\nSo I don't want to go too far into it.\n9:33\nAnd frankly, I don't think you really can get an intuition.\n9:35\nIt is almost-- it is a realm that we don't\n9:38\nnormally operate in.\n9:39\nBut even these large magnets you deal with, the magnetic\n9:43\nfield is generated by the electron spins inside of it\n9:47\nand by the actual magnetic fields generated by the\n9:51\nelectron motion around the protons.\n9:53\nWell, I hope I'm not overwhelming you.\n9:56\nAnd you might say, well, how come sometimes a metal bar can\n9:58\nbe magnetized and sometimes it won't be?\n10:00\nWell, when all of the electrons are doing random\n10:02\ndifferent things in a metal bar, then it's not magnetized.\n10:06\nBecause the magnetic spins, or the magnetism created by the\n10:10\nelectrons are all canceling each other out,\n10:11\nbecause it's random.\n10:12\nBut if you align the spins of the electrons, and if you\n10:16\nalign their rotations, then you will have a magnetically\n10:20\ncharged bar.\n10:21\nBut anyway, I'm past the ten-minute mark, but hopefully\n10:23\nthat gives you a little bit of a working knowledge of\n10:26\nwhat a magnet is.\n10:27\nAnd in the next video, I will show what the effect is.\n10:31\nWell, one, I'll explain how we think about a magnetic field.\n10:34\nAnd then what the effect of a magnetic\n10:36\nfield is on an electron.\n10:38\nOr not an electron, on a moving charge.\n10:41\nSee you in the next video.",

least if my\n0:09\nmemory serves me correctly, I have yet to give you the first\n0:12\nlaw of thermodynamics.\n0:13\nAnd I think now is as good a time as any.\n0:17\nThe first law of thermodynamics.\n0:24\nAnd it's a good one.\n0:26\nIt tells us that energy-- I'll do it in this magenta color--\n0:32\nenergy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be\n0:38\ntransformed from one form or another.\n0:41\nSo energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.\n0:56\nSo let's think about a couple of examples of this.\n0:59\nAnd we've touched on this when we learned mechanics and\n1:02\nkinetics in our physics playlist, and we've done a\n1:07\nbunch of this in the chemistry playlist as well.\n1:10\nSo let's say I have some rock that I just throw as fast as I\n1:15\ncan straight up.\n1:17\nMaybe it's a ball of some kind.\n1:19\nSo I throw a ball straight up.\n1:21\nThat arrow represents its velocity vector, right?\n1:24\nit's going to go up in the air.\n1:25\nLet me do it here.\n1:27\nI throw a ball and it's going to go up in the air.\n1:29\nIt's going to decelerate due to gravity.\n1:31\nAnd at some point, up here, the ball is not going to have\n1:35\nany velocity.\n1:36\nSo at this point it's going to slow down a little bit, at\n1:39\nthis point it's going to slow down a little bit more.\n1:41\nAnd at this point it's going to be completely stationary\n1:42\nand then it's going to start accelerating downwards.\n1:45\nIn fact, it was always accelerating downwards.\n1:46\nIt was decelerating upwards, and then it'll start\n1:49\naccelerating downwards.\n1:50\nSo here its velocity will look like that.\n1:52\nAnd here its velocity will look like that.\n1:53\nThen right when it gets back to the ground, if we assume\n1:56\nnegligible air resistance, its velocity will be the same\n1:59\nmagnitude as the upward but in the downward direction.\n2:03\nSo when we looked at this example, and we've done this\n2:05\ntons in the projectile motion videos in the physics\n2:09\nplaylist, over here we said, look, we have some kinetic\n2:13\nenergy here.\n2:13\nAnd that makes sense.\n2:14\nI think, to all of us, energy intuitively means that you're\n2:18\ndoing something.\n2:19\nSo kinetic energy.\n2:21\nEnergy of movement, of kinetics.\n2:23\nIt's moving, so it has energy.\n2:25\nBut then as we decelerate up here, we clearly have no\n2:29\nkinetic energy, zero kinetic energy.\n2:34\nSo where did our energy go?\n2:35\nI just told you the first law of thermodynamics, that energy\n2:38\ncannot be created or destroyed.\n2:40\nBut I clearly had a lot of kinetic energy over here, and\n2:43\nwe've seen the formula for that multiple times, and here\n2:46\nI have no kinetic energy.\n2:48\nSo I clearly destroyed kinetic energy, but the first law of\n2:53\nthermodynamics tells me that I can't do that.\n2:55\nSo I must have transformed that kinetic energy.\n2:58\nI must have transformed that kinetic energy\n3:00\ninto something else.\n3:01\nAnd in the case of this ball, I've transformed it into\n3:04\npotential energy.\n3:05\nSo now I have potential energy.\n3:08\nAnd I won't go into the math of it, but potential energy is\n3:10\njust the potential to turn into other forms of energy.\n3:17\nI guess that's the easy way to do it.\n3:18\nBut the way to think about it is, look, the ball is really\n3:20\nhigh up here, and by virtue of its position in the universe,\n3:24\nif something doesn't stop it, it's going to fall back down,\n3:28\nor it's going to be converted into another form of energy.\n3:30\nNow let me ask you another question.\n3:32\nLet's say I throw this ball up and let's say we actually do\n3:34\nhave some air resistance.\n3:36\nSo I throw the ball up.\n3:38\nI have a lot of kinetic energy here.\n3:41\nThen at the peak of where the ball is, it's all potential\n3:46\nenergy, the kinetic energy has disappeared.\n3:49\nAnd let's say I have air resistance.\n3:50\nSo when the ball comes back down, the air was kind of\n3:53\nslowing it down, so when it reaches this bottom point,\n3:57\nit's not going as fast as I threw it.\n4:01\nSo when I reach this bottom point here, my ball is going a\n4:04\nlot slower than I threw it up to begin with.\n4:07\nAnd so if you think about what happened, I have a lot of\n4:09\nkinetic energy here.\n4:10\nI'll give you the formula.\n4:11\nThe kinetic energy is the mass of the ball, times the\n4:14\nvelocity of the ball, squared, over 2.\n4:17\nThat's the kinetic energy over here.\n4:19\nAnd then I throw it.\n4:20\nIt all turns into potential energy.\n4:22\nThen it comes back down, and turns into kinetic energy.\n4:24\nBut because of air resistance, I have a\n4:26\nsmaller velocity here.\n4:28\nI have a smaller velocity than I did there.\n4:31\nKinetic energy is only dependent on the magnitude of\n4:33\nthe velocity.\n4:34\nI could put a little absolute sign there to show that we're\n4:37\ndealing with the magnitude of the velocity.\n4:39\nSo I clearly have a lower kinetic energy here.\n4:42\nSo lower kinetic energy here than I did here, right?\n4:50\nAnd I don't have any potential energy left.\n4:52\nLet's say this is the ground.\n4:54\nWe've hit the ground.\n4:55\nSo I have another conundrum.\n4:57\nYou know, when I went from kinetic energy to no kinetic\n5:00\nenergy there, I can go to the first law and\n5:02\nsay, oh, what happened?\n5:03\nAnd the first law says, oh, Sal, it all turned into\n5:05\npotential energy up here.\n5:07\nAnd you saw it turned into potential energy because when\n5:09\nthe ball accelerated back down, it turned back into\n5:12\nkinetic energy.\n5:12\nBut then I say, no, Mr. First Law of Thermodynamics, look,\n5:17\nat this point I have no potential energy, and I had\n5:20\nall kinetic energy and I had a lot of kinetic energy.\n5:22\nNow at this point, I have no potential energy once again,\n5:26\nbut I have less kinetic energy.\n5:27\nMy ball has fallen at a slower rate than I\n5:30\nthrew it to begin with.\n5:31\nAnd the thermodynamics says, oh, well that's\n5:33\nbecause you have air.\n5:34\nAnd I'd say, well I do have air, but where\n5:36\ndid the energy go?\n5:37\nAnd then the first law of thermodynamics says, oh, when\n5:41\nyour ball was falling-- let me see, that's the ball.\n5:47\nLet me make the ball yellow.\n5:50\nSo when your ball was falling, it was rubbing\n5:52\nup against air particles.\n5:54\nIt was rubbing up against molecules of air.\n5:59\nAnd right where the molecules bumped into the wall, there's\n6:02\na little bit of friction.\n6:04\nFriction is just essentially, your ball made these molecules\n6:08\nthat it was bumping into vibrate a little bit faster.\n6:11\nAnd essentially, if you think about it, if you go back to\n6:13\nthe macrostate/ microstate problem or descriptions that\n6:16\nwe talked about, this ball is essentially transferring its\n6:20\nkinetic energy to the molecules of air that it rubs\n6:24\nup against as it falls back down.\n6:26\nAnd actually it was doing it on the way up as well.\n6:28\nAnd so that kinetic energy that you think you lost or you\n6:32\ndestroyed at the bottom, of here, because your ball's\n6:34\ngoing a lot slower, was actually transferred to a lot\n6:36\nof air particles.\n6:38\nIt was a lot of-- to a bunch of air particles.\n6:41\nNow, it's next to impossible to measure exactly the kinetic\n6:45\nenergy that was done on each individual air particle,\n6:47\nbecause we don't even know what their microstates were to\n6:49\nbegin with.\n6:50\nBut what we can say is, in general I transferred some\n6:53\nheat to these particles.\n6:56\nI raised the temperature of the air particles that the\n7:01\nball fell through by rubbing those particles or giving them\n7:05\nkinetic energy.\n7:06\nRemember, temperature is just a measure of kinetic-- and\n7:10\ntemperature is a macrostate or kind of a gross way or a macro\n7:14\nway, of looking at the kinetic energy of\n7:17\nthe individual molecules.\n7:18\nIt's very hard to measure each of theirs, but if you say on\n7:21\naverage their kinetic energy is x, you're essentially\n7:22\ngiving an indication of temperature.\n7:24\nSo that's where it went.\n7:25\nIt went to heat.\n7:27\nAnd heat is another form of energy.\n7:29\nSo that the first law of thermodynamics\n7:30\nsays, I still hold.\n7:32\nYou had a lot of kinetic energy, turned into potential,\n7:36\nthat turned into less kinetic energy.\n7:37\nAnd where did the remainder go?\n7:39\nIt turned into heat.\n7:40\nBecause it transferred that kinetic energy to these air\n7:44\nparticles in the surrounding medium.\n7:47\nFair enough.\n7:49\nSo now that we have that out of the way, how do we measure\n7:51\nthe amount of energy that something contains?\n7:57\nAnd here we have something called the internal energy.\n8:00\nThe internal energy of a system.\n8:03\nOnce again this is a macrostate, or you could call\n8:06\nit a macro description of what's going on.\n8:08\nThis is called u for internal.\n8:10\nThe way I remember that is that the word internal does\n8:13\nnot begin with a U.\n8:15\nU for internal energy.\n8:25\nLet me go back to my example-- that I had in the past, that I\n8:30\ndid in our previous video, if you're watching these in\n8:33\norder-- of I have, you know, some gas with some movable\n8:39\nceiling at the top.\n8:40\nThat's its movable ceiling.\n8:42\nThat can move up and down.\n8:43\nWe have a vacuum up there.\n8:44\nAnd I have some gas in here.\n8:50\nThe internal energy literally is all of the energy that's in\n8:53\nthe system.\n8:54\nSo it includes, and for our purposes, especially when\n8:58\nyou're in a first-year chemistry course, it's the\n9:01\nkinetic energy of all the atoms or molecules.\n9:10\nAnd in a future video, I'll actually calculate it for how\n9:13\nmuch kinetic energy is there in a container.\n9:16\nAnd that'll actually be our internal energy plus all of\n9:19\nthe other energy.\n9:19\nSo these atoms, they have some kinetic energy because they\n9:22\nhave some translational motion, if we look at the\n9:24\nmicrostates.\n9:25\nIf they're just individual atoms, you can't really say\n9:28\nthat they're rotating, because what does it mean for an atom\n9:30\nto rotate, right?\n9:31\nBecause its electrons are just jumping around anyway.\n9:34\nSo if they're individual atoms they can't rotate, but if\n9:36\nthey're molecules they can rotate, if it looks\n9:38\nsomething like that.\n9:40\nThere could be some rotational energy there.\n9:43\nIt includes that.\n9:44\nIf we have bonds-- so I just drew a molecule.\n9:47\nThe molecule has bonds.\n9:49\nThose bonds contain some energy.\n9:51\nThat is also included in the internal energy.\n9:53\nIf I have some electrons, let's say that this was not\n9:56\na-- well I'm doing it using a gas, and gases aren't good\n9:59\nconductors-- but let's say I'm doing it for a solid.\n10:03\nSo I'm using the wrong tools.\n10:05\nSo let's say I have some metal.\n10:11\nThose are my metal-- let me do more-- my metal atoms. And in\n10:16\nthat metal atom, I have, a bunch of electrons-- well\n10:21\nthat's the same color-- I have a bunch of-- let me use a\n10:24\nsuitably different color-- I have a bunch\n10:26\nof electrons here.\n10:29\nAnd I have fewer here.\n10:31\nSo these electrons really want to get here.\n10:33\nMaybe they're being stopped for some reason, so they have\n10:35\nsome electrical potential.\n10:37\nMaybe there's a gap here, you know, where they can't conduct\n10:40\nor something like that.\n10:41\nInternal energy includes that as well.\n10:43\nThat's normally the scope out of what you'd see in a\n10:45\nfirst-year chemistry class.\n10:46\nBut it includes that.\n10:47\nIt also includes literally every form of energy that\n10:51\nexists here.\n10:52\nIt also includes, for example, in a metal, if we were to heat\n10:54\nthis metal up they start vibrating, right?\n10:57\nThey start moving left and right, or up or down, or in\n11:00\nevery possible direction.\n11:01\nAnd if you think about a molecule or an atom that's\n11:04\nvibrating, it's going from here, and then it goes there,\n11:09\nthen it goes back there.\n11:10\nIt goes back and forth, right?\n11:12\nAnd if you think about what's happening, when it's in the\n11:14\nmiddle point it has a lot of kinetic energy, but at this\n11:17\npoint right here, when it's about to go back, it's\n11:19\ncompletely stationary for a super small moment.\n11:23\nAnd at that point, all of its kinetic energy\n11:25\nis potential energy.\n11:26\nAnd then it turns into kinetic energy.\n11:27\nThen it goes back to potential energy again.\n11:29\nIt's kind of like a pendulum, or it's\n11:30\nactually harmonic motion.\n11:33\nSo in this case, internal energy also includes the\n11:37\nkinetic energy for the molecules that are moving\n11:38\nfast. But it also includes the potential energies for the\n11:42\nmolecules that are vibrating, they're at that point where\n11:44\nthey don't have kinetic energy.\n11:45\nSo it also includes potential energy.\n11:47\nSo internal energy is literally all of the energy\n11:52\nthat's in a system.\n11:54\nAnd for most of what we're going to do, you can assume\n11:58\nthat we're dealing with an ideal gas.\n12:00\nInstead of, it becomes a lot more complicated with solids,\n12:02\nand conductivity, and vibrations and all that.\n12:05\nWe're going to assume we're dealing with an ideal gas.\n12:07\nAnd even better, we're going to assume we're dealing with a\n12:09\nmonoatomic ideal gas.\n12:11\nAnd maybe this is just helium, or neon.\n12:15\nOne of the ideal gases.\n12:16\nThey don't want to bond with each other.\n12:18\nThey don't form molecules with each other.\n12:23\nLet's just assume that they're not.\n12:25\nThey're just individual atoms. And in that case, the internal\n12:32\nenergy, we really can simplify to it being the kinetic\n12:35\nenergy, if we ignore all of these other things.\n12:37\nBut it's important to realize, internal energy is everything.\n12:39\nIt's all of the energy inside of a system.\n12:44\nIf you said, what's the energy of the system?\n12:45\nIts internal energy.\n12:48\nSo the first law of thermodynamics says that\n12:52\nenergy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.\n12:56\nSo let's say that internal energy is changing.\n12:59\nSo I have this system, and someone tells me, look, the\n13:03\ninternal energy is changing.\n13:06\nSo delta U, that's just a capital delta that says, what\n13:09\nis the change an internal energy?\n13:10\nIt's saying, look, if your internal energy is changing,\n13:14\nyour system is either having something done to it, or it's\n13:17\ndoing something to someone else.\n13:18\nSome energy is being transferred to it\n13:20\nor away from it.\n13:22\nSo, how do we write that?\n13:24\nWell the first law of thermodynamics, or even the\n13:27\ndefinition of internal energy, says that a change in internal\n13:29\nenergy is equal to heat added to the system-- and once again\n13:35\na very intuitive letter for heat, because heat does not\n13:40\nstart with Q, but the convention is\n13:43\nto use Q for heat.\n13:45\nThe letter h is reserved for enthalpy, which is a very,\n13:49\nvery, very similar concept to heat.\n13:51\nWe'll talk about that maybe in the next video.\n13:54\nIt's equal to the heat added to the system, minus the work\n13:59\ndone by the system.\n14:03\nAnd you could see this multiple ways.\n14:05\nSometimes it's written like this.\n14:06\nSometimes it's written that the change in internal energy\n14:10\nis equal to the heat added to the system, plus the work done\n14:18\non the system.\n14:19\nAnd this might be very confusing, but you should just\n14:21\nalways-- and we'll really kind of look at this 100 different\n14:25\nways in the next video.\n14:25\nAnd actually this is a capital U.\n14:27\nLet me make sure that I write that as a capital U.\n14:29\nBut we're going to do it 100 different ways.\n14:31\nBut if you think about it, if I'm doing work I lose energy.\n14:35\nI've transferred the energy to someone else.\n14:37\nSo this is doing work.\n14:41\nLikewise, if someone is giving me heat that is increasing my\n14:45\nenergy, at least to me these are reasonably intuitive\n14:48\ndefinitions.\n14:48\nNow if you see this, you say, OK, if my energy is going up,\n14:54\nif this is a positive thing, I either have to have this go\n14:57\nup, or work is being done to me.\n15:05\nOr energy is being transferred into my system.\n15:09\nI'll give a lot more examples of what exactly that means in\n15:11\nthe next video.\n15:12\nBut I just want to make you comfortable\n15:14\nwith either of these.\n15:15\nBecause you're going to see them all the time, and you\n15:16\nmight even get confused even if your teacher\n15:18\nuses only one of them.\n15:19\nBut you should always do this reality check.\n15:22\nWhen something does work, it is transferring energy to\n15:25\nsomething else, right?\n15:27\nSo if you're doing work, it'll take away, this is taking\n15:30\naway, your internal energy.\n15:32\nLikewise, heat transfer is another way for energy to go\n15:36\nfrom one system to another, or from one entity to another.\n15:40\nSo if my total energy is going up, maybe heat is being added\n15:45\nto my system.\n15:46\nIf my energy is going down, either heat is being taken\n15:51\naway from my system, or I'm doing more work on something.\n15:55\nI'll do a bunch of examples with that.\n15:57\nAnd I'm just going to leave you with this video with some\n15:59\nother notation that you might see.\n16:01\nYou might see change in internal energy is equal to\n16:05\nchange-- let me write it again-- change in internal\n16:09\nenergy, capital U.\n16:11\nYou'll sometimes see it as, they'll write a delta Q, which\n16:14\nkind of implies change in heat.\n16:17\nBut I'll explain it in a future video why that doesn't\n16:18\nmake a full sense, but you'll see this a lot.\n16:21\nBut you can also view this as the heat added to the system,\n16:24\nminus the change in work, which is a little\n16:28\nnon-intuitive because when you talk about heat or work you're\n16:30\ntalking about transferring of energy.\n16:32\nSo when you talk about change in transfer it becomes a\n16:33\nlittle-- So sometimes a delta work, they just mean this\n16:36\nmeans that work done by a system.\n16:41\nSo obviously if you have some energy, you do some work,\n16:44\nyou've lost that energy, you've given it to someone\n16:46\nelse, you'd have a minus sign there.\n16:48\nOr you might see it written like this, change in internal\n16:52\nenergy is equal to heat added-- I won't say even this\n16:58\nkind of reads to me as change in heat.\n16:59\nI'll just call this the heat added-- plus the work done\n17:06\nonto the system.\n17:07\nSo this is work done to, this is work done by the system.\n17:15\nEither way.\n17:16\nAnd you shouldn't even memorize this, you should just\n17:19\nalways think about it a little bit.\n17:20\nIf I'm doing work I'm going to lose energy.\n17:22\nIf work is done to me I'm going to gain energy.\n17:24\nIf I lose heat, if this is a negative number, I'm going to\n17:27\nlose energy.\n17:29\nIf I gain heat I'm going to gain energy.\n17:31\nAnyway, I'll leave you there for this video, and in the\n17:33\nnext video we'll really try to digest this internal energy\n17:37\nformula 100 different ways.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nVoiceover: What I want to talk about in this video\n0:01\nare the notions of Electronegativity,\n0:05\nelectro, negati, negativity,\n0:13\nand a closely, and a closely related\n0:15\nidea of Electron Affinity, electron affinity.\n0:22\nAnd they're so closely related that in general,\n0:24\nif something has a high electronegativity,\n0:27\nthey have a high electron affinity,\n0:29\nbut what does this mean?\n0:31\nWell, electron affinity is how much does that atom\n0:34\nattract electrons, how much does it like electrons?\n0:37\nDoes it want, does it maybe want more electrons?\n0:41\nElectronegativity is a little bit more specific.\n0:45\nIt's when that atom is part of a covalent bond,\n0:49\nwhen it is sharing electrons with another atom,\n0:53\nhow likely is it or how badly does it want\n0:55\nto hog the electrons in that covalent bond?\n0:58\nNow what do I mean by hogging electrons?\n1:01\nSo let me make, let me write this down.\n1:03\nSo how badly wants to hog,\n1:13\nand this is an informal definition clearly,\n1:15\nhog electrons, keep the electrons,\n1:18\nto spend more of their time closer to them\n1:20\nthen to the other party in the covalent bond.\n1:23\nAnd this is how, how much they like electrons,\n1:28\nor how much affinity they have towards electrons.\n1:32\nSo how much they want electrons.\n1:39\nAnd you can see that these are very,\n1:41\nthese are very related notions.\n1:43\nThis is within the context of a covalent bond,\n1:45\nhow much electron affinity is there?\n1:47\nWell this, you can think of it as a slightly broader notion,\n1:50\nbut these two trends go absolutely in line with each other.\n1:54\nAnd to think about, to just think about\n1:55\nelectronegativity makes it a little bit more tangible.\n1:58\nLet's think about one of the most famous\n1:59\nsets of covalent bonds,\n2:00\nand that's what you see in a water molecule.\n2:03\nWater, as you probably know, is H two O,\n2:07\nyou have an oxygen atom,\n2:11\nand you have two hydrogens.\n2:13\nEach of the hydrogen's have one valence electron,\n2:17\nand the oxygen has, we see here, at it's outermost shell,\n2:21\nit has one, two, three, four, five, six valence electrons.\n2:25\nOne, two, three, four, five, six valence electrons.\n2:31\nAnd so you can imagine, hydrogen would be happy\n2:33\nif it was able to somehow pretend like it had another\n2:35\nelectron then it would have an electron configuration\n2:37\na stable, first shell that only requires two electrons,\n2:41\nthe rest of them require eight,\n2:42\nhydrogen would feel, hey I'm stable like helium\n2:45\nif it could get another electron.\n2:46\nAnd oxygen would feel, hey I'm stable like neon\n2:49\nif I could get two more electrons.\n2:51\nAnd so what happens is they share each other's electrons.\n2:53\nThis, this electron can be shared in conjunction\n2:57\nwith this electron for this hydrogen.\n2:59\nSo that hydrogen can kind of feel like it's using\n3:01\nboth and it gets more stable,\n3:03\nit stabilizes the outer shell,\n3:04\nor it stabilizes the hydrogen.\n3:06\nAnd likewise, that electron could be,\n3:08\ncan be shared with the hydrogen,\n3:10\nand the hydrogen can kind of feel more like helium.\n3:13\nAnd then this oxygen can feel like\n3:14\nit's a quid pro quo,\n3:16\nit's getting something in exchange for something else.\n3:18\nIt's getting the electron, an electron,\n3:20\nit's sharing an electron from each of these hydrogens,\n3:22\nand so it can feel like it's, that it stabilizes it,\n3:26\nsimilar to a, similar to a neon.\n3:30\nBut when you have these covalent bonds,\n3:32\nonly in the case where they are equally\n3:34\nelectronegative would you have a case\n3:35\nwhere maybe they're sharing,\n3:37\nand even there what happens\n3:38\nin the rest of the molecule might matter,\n3:40\nbut when you have something like this,\n3:42\nwhere you have oxygen and hydrogen,\n3:43\nthey don't have the same electronegativity.\n3:45\nOxygen likes to hog electrons more than hydrogen does.\n3:49\nAnd so these electrons are not gonna spend\n3:51\nan even amount of time.\n3:52\nHere I did it kind of just drawing these,\n3:54\nyou know, these valence electrons as these dots.\n3:57\nBut as we know, the electrons are in this\n3:59\nkind of blur around, around the,\n4:03\naround the actual nuclei,\n4:06\naround the atoms that make up the atoms.\n4:09\nAnd so, in this type of a covalent bond,\n4:11\nthe electrons, the two electrons that this bond represents,\n4:15\nare going to spend more time around the oxygen\n4:18\nthen they are going to spend around the hydrogen.\n4:20\nAnd these, these two electrons are gonna spend\n4:23\nmore time around the oxygen,\n4:25\nthen are going to spend around the hydrogen.\n4:27\nAnd we know that because oxygen is more electronegative,\n4:30\nand we'll talk about the trends in a second.\n4:31\nThis is a really important idea in chemistry,\n4:34\nand especially later on as you study organic chemistry.\n4:36\nBecause, because we know that\n4:39\noxygen is more electronegative,\n4:40\nand the electrons spend more time\n4:41\naround oxygen then around hydrogen,\n4:44\nit creates a partial negative charge on this side,\n4:47\nand partial positive charges on this side right over here,\n4:50\nwhich is why water has many of the properties that it does,\n4:55\nand we go into much more in depth in that in other videos.\n4:59\nAnd also when you study organic chemistry,\n5:00\na lot of the likely reactions that are\n5:02\ngoing to happen can be predicted,\n5:04\nor a lot of the likely molecules that form\n5:06\ncan be predicted based on elecronegativity.\n5:09\nAnd especially when you start going\n5:10\ninto oxidation numbers and things like that,\n5:12\nelectronegativity will tell you a lot.\n5:15\nSo now that we know what electronegativity is,\n5:19\nlet's think a little bit about what is,\n5:21\nas we go through, as we start,\n5:24\nas we go through, as we go through a period,\n5:27\nas say as we start in group one,\n5:29\nand we go to group, and as we go all the way\n5:35\nall the way to, let's say the halogens,\n5:38\nall the way up to the yellow column right over here,\n5:42\nwhat do you think is going to be\n5:44\nthe trend for electronegativity?\n5:47\nAnd once again, one way to think about it\n5:49\nis to think about the extremes.\n5:50\nThink about sodium, and think about chlorine,\n5:53\nand I encourage you to pause\n5:54\nthe video and think about that.\n5:56\nAssuming you've had a go at it,\n5:58\nand it's in some ways the same idea,\n6:01\nor it's a similar idea as ionization energy.\n6:03\nSomething like sodium has only one electron\n6:06\nin it's outer most shell.\n6:07\nIt'd be hard for it to complete that shell,\n6:09\nand so to get to a stable state it's much easier\n6:12\nfor it to give away that one electron that it has,\n6:15\nso it can get to a stable configuration like neon.\n6:18\nSo this one really wants to give away an electron.\n6:22\nAnd we saw in the video on ionization energy,\n6:24\nthat's why this has a low ionization energy,\n6:26\nit doesn't take much energy, in a gaseous state,\n6:29\nto remove an electron from sodium.\n6:32\nBut chlorine is the opposite.\n6:33\nIt's only one away from completing it's shell.\n6:35\nThe last thing it wants to do is give away electron,\n6:37\nit wants an electron really, really, really, really badly\n6:40\nso it can get to a configuration of argon,\n6:42\nso it can complete it's third shell.\n6:45\nSo the logic here is that sodium wouldn't mind\n6:49\ngiving away an electron,\n6:50\nwhile chlorine really would love an electron.\n6:52\nSo chlorine is more likely to hog electrons,\n6:55\nwhile sodium is very unlikely to hog electrons.\n6:59\nSo this trend right here,\n7:00\nwhen you go from the left to the right,\n7:02\nyour electronegativity, let me write this,\n7:04\nyour getting more electronegative.\n7:07\nMore electro, electronegative, as you,\n7:13\nas you go to the right.\n7:16\nNow what do you think the trend is going to be\n7:18\nas you go down, as you go down in a group?\n7:22\nWhat do you think the trend is going to be as you go down?\n7:25\nWell I'll give you a hint.\n7:27\nThink about, think about atomic radii, and given that,\n7:31\npause the video and think about\n7:31\nwhat do you think the trend is?\n7:32\nAre we gonna get more or less electronegative\n7:34\nas we move down?\n7:36\nSo once again I'm assuming you've given a go at it,\n7:39\nso as we know, from the video on atomic radii,\n7:41\nour atom is getting larger, and larger, and larger,\n7:44\nas we add more and more and more shells.\n7:46\nAnd so cesium has one electron in it's outer most shell,\n7:50\nin the sixth shell,\n7:52\nwhile, say, lithium has one electron.\n7:55\nEverything here, all the group one elements,\n7:57\nhave one electron in it's outer most shell,\n7:59\nbut that fifty fifth electron,\n8:01\nthat one electron in the outer most shell in cesium,\n8:03\nis a lot further away then the outer most electron\n8:05\nin lithium or in hydrogen.\n8:08\nAnd so because of that, it's, well one,\n8:12\nthere's more interference between that electron and the\n8:14\nnucleus from all the other electrons in between them,\n8:16\nand also it's just further away,\n8:18\nso it's easier to kind of grab it off.\n8:20\nSo cesium is very likely to give up,\n8:24\nit's very likely to give up electrons.\n8:27\nIt's much more likely to give up electrons than hydrogen.\n8:30\nSo, as you go down a given group,\n8:33\nyou're becoming less, less electronegative, electronegative.\n8:39\nSo what, what are, based on this,\n8:41\nwhat are going to be the most electronegative\n8:44\nof all the atoms?\n8:46\nWell they're going to be the ones\n8:47\nthat are in the top and the right of the periodic table,\n8:50\nthey're going to be these right over here.\n8:52\nThese are going to be the most electronegative,\n8:54\nSometimes we don't think as much about the noble gases\n8:56\nbecause they aren't, they aren't really that reactive,\n8:59\nthey don't even form covalent bond,\n9:01\nbecause they're just happy.\n9:02\nWhile these characters up here,\n9:03\nthey sometimes will form covalent bonds,\n9:06\nand when they do, they really like to hog those electrons.\n9:09\nNow what are the least electronegative,\n9:11\nsometimes called very electropositive?\n9:13\nWell these things down here in the bottom left.\n9:15\nThese, over here, they have only,\n9:18\nyou know in the case of cesium,\n9:19\nthey have one electron to give away\n9:21\nthat would take them to a stable state like, like xenon,\n9:25\nor in the case of these group two elements\n9:27\nthey might have to give away two,\n9:28\nbut it's much easier to give away two\n9:29\nthen to gain a whole bunch of them.\n9:31\nAnd they're big, they're big atoms.\n9:34\nSo those outer most electrons are getting\n9:35\nless attracted to the positive nucleus.\n9:39\nSo the trend in the periodic table\n9:40\nas you go from the bottom left,\n9:42\nto the top right,\n9:44\nyou're getting more, more electro, electronegative.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's continue with our study of the planet Lubricon VI.\n0:04\nNow the one thing I did not tell you in the last video\n0:07\nis that Lubricon VI is not rotating at all.\n0:14\nAnd because it's not rotating, it\n0:15\ncan really not have an equator.\n0:18\nSo when we talked about in the path of this frozen sock,\n0:21\ninstead of saying it's traveling across an equator,\n0:23\nI should say it's traveling along a great circle.\n0:25\nIf you assume that earth is a sphere--\n0:27\nand it's not a perfect sphere-- but if you assume\n0:29\nit's a sphere, our equator would be a perfect sphere.\n0:32\nBut in order to have an equator, you need to have some rotation.\n0:35\nThis right over here, we'll just say\n0:36\nit's traveling along the largest possible circle\n0:40\nthat it can travel along.\n0:41\nIt's traveling along one of the great circles of this sphere,\n0:44\nthis block of sock right over there.\n0:46\nAnd now that we know it's not rotating,\n0:48\nI want to enter another thought experiment.\n0:50\nBecause this little frozen block of sock is not the only thing\n0:54\nthat's on the surface of Lubricon VI.\n0:58\nOver here-- we were viewing it at a distance--\n1:01\nbut right over there, if we were to zoom in,\n1:03\nyou would see sitting on the surface of Lubricon VI--\n1:08\nso once again, that's the surface-- is a frozen banana.\n1:12\nSo this right over here is a block of ice.\n1:16\nAnd in that block of ice we have a banana.\n1:19\nIt's a frozen banana.\n1:21\nSo that's my best attempt at drawing our banana.\n1:25\nAnd this relative to the surface of Lubricon VI\n1:29\nis absolutely stationary.\n1:32\nIt has absolutely no tangential velocity like this block had\n1:36\nand will continue to have for all eternity.\n1:39\nThis has absolutely no tangential velocity.\n1:42\nAnd so my question for you, if we\n1:44\nthink about what are the forces acting on this?\n1:48\nWell, we have the force of gravity\n1:51\ntowards the center of Lubricon VI.\n1:53\nSo we have the force of gravity.\n1:55\nAnd I'm drawing all the forces from the center\n1:57\nof mass of this block of banana.\n1:59\nSo once again, let me draw that same color.\n2:01\nWe have the force of gravity acting radially inward.\n2:10\nAnd then we know that this banana is not\n2:12\nplummeting straight into the center of the Earth.\n2:14\nThere must be some other force that is keeping it stationary.\n2:19\nAnd that force is the force of the surface\n2:21\nof Lubricon VI on the banana or on this block that's keeping it\n2:26\nfrom plunging towards the center of the planet.\n2:29\nSo that, in this case, is the normal force.\n2:37\nAnd my question to you is, are these two things\n2:42\nequal in the case of the banana?\n2:47\nWell, as far as we can tell, this banana\n2:49\nis completely at rest.\n2:50\nThis planet right over here, at least relative to the planet,\n2:54\nthis planet right here has absolutely no rotation.\n2:57\nAnd this banana has no relative motion towards the planet.\n3:01\nIt is not accelerating in absolutely any direction.\n3:04\nAnd if it's not accelerating in any direction,\n3:07\nthe net forces on it in any dimension\n3:10\nmust all or must be 0, or all of the forces\n3:13\nmust cancel out with each other.\n3:15\nSo in the case of this banana, the normal force exactly\n3:20\ncancels out the force of gravity.\n3:22\nThese two things, the normal force\n3:26\nis exactly equal to the inward force of gravity.\n3:30\nOr I guess we should say that they add to 0.\n3:32\nThey're going in opposite directions.\n3:34\nSo I should say the normal force plus the force of gravity\n3:40\nare going to be equal 0.\n3:41\nThey have the same exact magnitude.\n3:43\nThey're going in opposite directions.\n3:45\nSo when you add them together, they are going to cancel out.\n3:49\nNow, with that little thought experiment out of the way,\n3:52\nlet's return to the frozen sock.\n3:55\nThe frozen sock, as we already learned,\n3:57\nis orbiting around this planet at a altitude of 0\n4:02\nfor all eternity at 1 kilometer per hour.\n4:05\nAnd we know that the force of gravity\n4:07\nis acting on it towards the center of the planet\n4:09\nand there is a normal force that's\n4:11\nkeeping it from plummeting, from spiraling\n4:14\ntowards the center of the planet.\n4:15\nBut my question to you is, in the case of the frozen sock\n4:19\nright over here, are these two forces\n4:22\nequal like they are for the banana?\n4:29\nSo in the case of the frozen sock, the traveling,\n4:32\norbiting sock, if these two forces had the same magnitude,\n4:39\nbut just going in opposite directions the way\n4:41\nwe've drawn it right over here, it would completely cancel out.\n4:44\nAnd then we would have no net force.\n4:47\nSo let me make it clear.\n4:48\nIf the normal force plus the force of gravity\n4:55\ncanceled out with each other, if this equalled 0,\n4:58\nthen we would have absolutely no net force\n5:03\nand the object would not accelerate in any direction.\n5:06\nAn object in motion will stay in motion.\n5:09\nSo this one right over here, if it\n5:10\nhad no net force acting on it, it\n5:13\nwould not stay on the surface of the planet.\n5:16\nIt would just travel in a straight line,\n5:18\nin a tangential line from where it happens to be at this moment\n5:20\nforever.\n5:21\nSo if it was right over here-- I know this isn't the path,\n5:24\nit would just keep traveling forever\n5:26\noff the surface of the planet.\n5:30\nWe know that clearly is not what's happening.\n5:32\nIt is orbiting around the planet.\n5:34\nIt has a circular path.\n5:36\nAnd since it has a circular path--\n5:39\nso if I were to draw a cross-section of its--\n5:41\nif I were to look at its path from the side,\n5:43\nit has a circular path like that.\n5:45\nIt is going like that.\n5:46\nIt is constantly being accelerated inward.\n5:52\nThere is some centripetal acceleration\n5:55\ngoing on, inward acceleration.\n5:58\nSo in order for that inward acceleration to be going on,\n6:01\nthere must be some net inward force.\n6:04\nSo in this situation, in the situation for the stationary\n6:07\nbanana, these two guys cancelled each other out.\n6:11\nBut for the case of the moving frozen sock, the sock that\n6:15\nis orbiting for all of eternity, it is in orbit.\n6:18\nIt has a circular path.\n6:20\nSo there are centripetal motion.\n6:22\nThere is some net inward force going on here.\n6:25\nSo\n6:25\nIn this situation, the magnitude of the force of gravity\n6:32\nis going to be greater than the magnitude of the normal force.\n6:40\nSo we don't have this situation.\n6:41\nIn that situation, you wouldn't orbit.\n6:43\nWe have the situation where you do\n6:45\nhave some net centripetal force.\n6:47\nThe force of gravity, the magnitude of it,\n6:49\nis slightly larger than the magnitude of the normal force.\n6:53\nAnd an interesting thing to think about,\n6:55\nand we might address it in a future tutorial,\n6:57\nis what would happen if this started going faster and faster\n7:01\nand faster, if the frozen sock were to accelerate.\n7:04\nWhat then?\n7:05\nHow would the relationship between these two things\n7:08\npotentially change, if they change at all?",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] We've already talked about how DNA's structure\n0:03\nas this double helix, this twisted ladder,\n0:05\nmakes it suitable for being the molecular basis of heredity.\n0:10\nAnd what we wanna do in this video is get\n0:11\na better appreciation for why it is suitable,\n0:14\nand the mechanism by which it is\n0:16\nthe molecular basis for heredity.\n0:18\nAnd we're gonna focus on a conceptual level,\n0:19\nI'm not gonna go into all of the,\n0:21\nI guess you could say biochemical details.\n0:23\nReally just give you the conceptual idea of what happens.\n0:26\nSo right over here this could be a fragment of DNA,\n0:30\nI have, what, I have--\n0:31\nThis is eight base pairs depicted.\n0:34\nAnd just to be clear, and we talked about this\n0:35\nin the introductory video to DNA,\n0:37\nDNA is much more than, you know, a handful of base pairs.\n0:42\nThe DNA molecule can be tens of millions of base pairs long.\n0:47\nSo for example this might be a section\n0:49\nof a much longer molecule,\n0:51\nso the much longer strand of DNA,\n0:54\nand even there I'm probably not giving justice to it.\n0:57\nBut this might just be this very, very small section,\n1:03\nlet me do this in a different color,\n1:04\nthis little section right over here,\n1:06\nzoomed in.\n1:08\nSo once again it might be part of a molecule\n1:10\nthat has not seven or eight base pairs,\n1:13\nbut might have 70 million base pairs.\n1:16\nSo just like that.\n1:20\nSo let's understand what a molecular basis of heredity\n1:23\nwould need to do.\n1:25\nWell first of all it would need to be replicable.\n1:27\nOr we would need to be able to replicate it.\n1:31\nAs a cell divides,\n1:32\nthe two new cells would want to have\n1:35\nthe same genetic material.\n1:37\nSo how does DNA replicate?\n1:39\nAnd this process is called replication.\n1:45\nAnd we covered this in the introduction video as well,\n1:47\nbut it's nice to see the different processes\n1:49\nnext to each other.\n1:51\nAnd replication, you can imagine taking\n1:54\neither splitting these two sides of the ladder,\n1:58\nand actually let's do that.\n2:00\nSo let me copy and paste,\n2:03\nso if I take that side right over there,\n2:06\nso let me copy and then paste it.\n2:10\nAnd then there we go,\n2:12\na little bit of it is dropping below the video\n2:15\nbut I think that serves the purpose.\n2:18\nAnd then let's copy and paste the other side.\n2:23\nSo let me select that.\n2:28\nAnd then I copy and then I paste,\n2:32\nand it's just like that.\n2:35\nAnd so you can imagine if you were to split these,\n2:38\nthese things you could call them two sides of the ladder,\n2:41\nthat either side could be used to construct the other side.\n2:43\nAnd then you would have two strands,\n2:45\ntwo identical strands of the DNA.\n2:49\nAnd so let's see what that actually looks like.\n2:52\nSo let me get my pen tool out now,\n2:54\nlet me deselect this, get the pen tool out.\n2:58\nIt's a new tool I'm using,\n2:59\nso let me make sure I'm doing it right.\n3:01\nAlright, so from this side,\n3:02\nfrom this left side,\n3:03\nor at least what we are looking at as the left side,\n3:05\nyou can then construct another right side\n3:07\nbased on this information.\n3:09\nA always pairs with T if we're talking about DNA.\n3:14\nSo adenine pairs with thymine just like that.\n3:17\nThymine pairs with adenine\n3:19\nLet me do that a little bit neater.\n3:22\nThymine pairs with adenine,\n3:26\nguanine pairs with cytosine,\n3:29\ncytosine pairs with guanine,\n3:32\nfalling a little bit down here.\n3:33\nAnd just like that I was able to construct\n3:35\na new right hand side using that left hand side.\n3:38\nSo maybe I'll do the new sugar phosphate\n3:44\nbackbone in yellow.\n3:45\nAnd we can do the same thing here\n3:47\nusing the original right hand side.\n3:49\nSo using the original right hand side,\n3:51\nonce again the T is paired with the A,\n3:54\nlet me do that in adenine's color.\n3:57\nSo we have an adenine and thymine,\n3:59\nadenine and thymine,\n4:00\nadenine and thymine.\n4:02\nThymine pairs with adenine,\n4:03\nso thymine, adenine.\n4:05\nThymine, adenine.\n4:07\nGuanine pairs with cytosine.\n4:11\nAnd then cytosine pairs with guanine.\n4:14\nSo cytosine just like that.\n4:17\nAnd so you can take half of each of this ladder,\n4:19\nand then you can use it to construct the other half,\n4:21\nand what you've essentially done is\n4:22\nyou've replicated the actual DNA.\n4:25\nAnd this is actually a kind of conceptual level\n4:28\nof how replication is done\n4:29\nbefore a cell divides and replicates,\n4:32\nand the entire cell duplicates itself.\n4:35\nSo that's replication.\n4:37\nSo the next thing you're probably thinking about,\n4:39\n\"Okay, well it's nice to be able to replicate yourself\n4:41\n\"but that's kind of useless if that information can't be\n4:44\n\"used to define the organism in some way\n4:47\n\"to express what's actually happening.\"\n4:50\nAnd so let's think about how the genes\n4:54\nin this DNA molecule are actually expressed.\n4:59\nSo I'll write this as \"expression\".\n5:03\nAnd actually that warrants a little bit of a detour\n5:07\nbecause you hear sometimes the words\n5:09\nDNA and chromosome and gene\n5:11\nused somewhat interchangeably,\n5:13\nand they are clearly related,\n5:15\nbut it's worth knowing what is what.\n5:17\nSo when you're talking about DNA\n5:18\nyou're talking literally about this molecule here\n5:21\nthat has this sugar phosphate base\n5:23\nand it has the sequence of base pairs,\n5:25\nit's got this double helix structure,\n5:27\nand so this whole thing this could be a DNA molecule.\n5:29\nNow when you have a DNA molecule\n5:32\nand it's packaged together with other molecules\n5:34\nand proteins and kind of given a broader structure,\n5:37\nthen you're talking about a chromosome.\n5:41\nAnd when you're talking about a gene,\n5:42\nyou're talking about a section of DNA\n5:45\nthat's used to express a certain trait.\n5:48\nOr actually used to code for a certain type of protein.\n5:53\nSo for example this could be,\n5:55\nthis whole thing could be a strand of DNA,\n5:57\nbut this part right over, let's say in orange I'll do it,\n6:01\nthis part in orange right over here could be one gene,\n6:04\nit might define information for one gene,\n6:09\nit could define a protein,\n6:11\nthis section right over here\n6:13\ncould be used to define another gene.\n6:17\nAnd genes could be anywhere from\n6:20\nseveral thousand base pairs long,\n6:22\nall the way up into the millions.\n6:24\nAnd as we'll see,\n6:25\nthe way that a gene is expressed,\n6:27\nthe way we get from the information for that section of DNA\n6:30\ninto a protein which is really how it's expressed,\n6:33\nis through a related molecule to DNA,\n6:37\nand that is RNA.\n6:40\nActually let me write this down.\n6:41\nRNA.\n6:45\nSo RNA stands for ribonucleic acid.\n6:50\nRibonucleic acid, let me write that down.\n7:02\nAnd so you might remember that DNA is\n7:04\ndeoxyribonucleic acid,\n7:07\nso the sugar backbone in RNA\n7:09\nis a very similar molecule,\n7:11\nwell now it's got its oxy,\n7:12\nit's not deoxyribonucleic acid,\n7:15\nit's ribonucleic acid.\n7:17\nThe R, let me make it clear where the RNA come from,\n7:19\nthe R is right over there,\n7:22\nthen you have the nucleic, that's the n,\n7:27\nand then it's a, acid.\n7:29\nSame reason why we call the DNA nucleic acid.\n7:32\nSo you have this RNA.\n7:35\nSo what role does this play as we are trying\n7:38\nto express the information in this DNA?\n7:41\nWell the DNA,\n7:41\nespecially if we're talking about cells with nucleii,\n7:44\nthe DNA sits there but that information has to\n7:47\nfor the most part get outside of the nucleus\n7:49\nin order to be expressed.\n7:50\nAnd one of the functions that RNA plays\n7:53\nis to be that messenger,\n7:54\nthat messenger between a certain section of DNA\n7:57\nand kind of what goes on outside of the nucleus,\n7:59\nso that that can be translated into an actual protein.\n8:04\nSo the step that you go from DNA to mRNA,\n8:07\nmessenger RNA,\n8:08\nis called transcription.\n8:11\nLet me write that down.\n8:20\nAnd what happens in transcription,\n8:21\nlet's go back to looking at one side of this DNA molecule.\n8:27\nSo let's say you have that right over there,\n8:30\nlet me copy and paste it.\n8:34\nSo there we go, actually I didn't wanna do that.\n8:38\nI wanted the other side.\n8:39\nSo actually I think I'm on the wrong, let me go back here.\n8:44\nAnd so let me copy and then let me paste.\n8:48\nThere we go.\n8:49\nSo let's say you have part of this DNA molecule,\n8:56\nor you have 1/2 of it\n8:57\njust like we did when we replicated it.\n8:58\nBut now we're not just trying to duplicate the DNA molecule,\n9:01\nwe're actually trying to create\n9:02\na corresponding mRNA molecule.\n9:05\nAt least for that section of,\n9:08\nat least for that gene.\n9:09\nSo this might be part of a gene\n9:11\nActually whoops, let me make sure I'm using the right tool.\n9:14\nThis might be part of a gene that is this section\n9:17\nof our DNA molecule right over there.\n9:20\nAnd so transcription is a very similar conceputal idea,\n9:23\nwhere we're now going to construct\n9:25\na strand of RNA and specifically mRNA\n9:28\n'cause it's going to take that information\n9:29\noutside of the nucleus.\n9:32\nAnd so it's very similar\n9:33\nexcept for when we're talking about RNA,\n9:35\nadenine, instead of pairing with thymine,\n9:38\nis now going to pair with uracil.\n9:41\nSo let me write this down,\n9:42\nso now you're gonna have adenine pairs not with thymine\n9:45\nbut uracil.\n9:47\nDNA has uracil instead of the thymine.\n9:49\nBut you're still going to have cytosine and guanine pairing.\n9:52\nSo for the RNA and in this case the mRNA\n9:56\nthat's going to leave the nucleus\n9:59\nA is going to pair with U,\n10:01\nU for uracil,\n10:03\nso uracil, that's the base we're talking about,\n10:06\nlet me write it down, uracil.\n10:09\nThymine is still going to pair with adenine,\n10:15\njust like that.\n10:16\nGuanine is gonna pair with cytosine,\n10:20\nand cytosine is going to pair with guanine.\n10:26\nAnd so when you do that,\n10:27\nnow these two characters can detach,\n10:29\nand now you have a single strand of RNA\n10:32\nand in this case messenger RNA,\n10:33\nthat has all the information\n10:37\non that section of DNA.\n10:41\nAnd so now that thing can leave the nucleus,\n10:44\ngo attach to a ribosome,\n10:46\nand we'll talk more about that in future videos\n10:48\nexactly how that's happened,\n10:50\nand then this code can be used\n10:52\nto actually code for proteins.\n10:55\nNow how does that happen?\n10:56\nAnd that process is called translation.\n11:01\nWhich is really taking this base pair sequence\n11:04\nand turning it into an amino acid sequence.\n11:07\nProteins are made up of sequences of amino acids.\n11:10\nSo translation.\n11:11\nSo let's take our mRNA or this little section of our mRNA,\n11:15\nand actually let me draw it like this.\n11:20\nNow let's see, I have it is U A C,\n11:23\nso it's gonna be U A C then U U\n11:28\nthen A C G okay?\n11:30\nAnd then we have an A,\n11:33\nlet me make sure I change it to the right color.\n11:35\nWe have an A there, and then we have this U U A,\n11:41\nC G, alright,\n11:43\nnow let me put a C right over there,\n11:45\nI'm just taking this and I'm writing it horizontally.\n11:47\nI have a C here, not a G, it's a C.\n11:52\nAnd then finally I have a G.\n11:54\nAnd of course it'll keep going on and on and on.\n11:57\nAnd what happens is each sequence of three,\n12:01\nand you have to be very careful where it starts,\n12:03\nand so this is in some ways a delicate and surprising,\n12:05\nbut at the same time surprisingly robust process,\n12:08\nevery three of these bases code for a specific amino acid.\n12:14\nAnd so three bases together,\n12:16\nso these bases right over here,\n12:18\nthese I guess you could say this three letter word\n12:20\nor this three letter sequence,\n12:22\nthat's called a codon.\n12:25\nAnd this is going to be the next codon.\n12:29\nAnd we actually haven't drawn the next codon after that\n12:31\n'cause we need three bases to get to the next codon.\n12:35\nAnd how many possible codons do you have?\n12:38\nWell you have one of four bases\n12:40\nand you have them in three different places,\n12:42\nso you have four times four times four,\n12:44\npossible codon words I guess you could say.\n12:47\nAnd four times four times four is 64.\n12:50\nSo you have 64 possible codons.\n12:56\nWhich is good because you have 20 possible amino acids.\n12:58\nSo this is overkill and allows codons to be used\n13:01\nfor other purposes as well.\n13:02\nAnd they also, you might have more than one codon\n13:04\ncoding for the same amino acid.\n13:07\nSo you have 64 possible codons\n13:08\nthat need to code for 20 amino acids.\n13:11\nAnd so this codon right over here with the ribosome,\n13:14\nand we'll talk more about how that happens,\n13:16\ncan code for\n13:22\namino acid 1.\n13:25\nSo let me just write it here, this is amino acid 1.\n13:28\nAnd actually this amino acid is brought to here,\n13:31\nthey're actually matched together by another type of RNA,\n13:34\nthis is mRNA we're talking about right over here.\n13:37\nThis is mRNA, but there's another type of RNA\n13:41\ncalled tRNA\n13:43\nthat essentially brings these two characters together.\n13:47\nSo the tRNA,\n13:48\nand I'm just gonna, it's got some structure here,\n13:49\nI'm not drawing it completely right,\n13:51\nbut it's going to match right over here,\n13:52\nwhere maybe it has an A, a U, and a G right over here\n13:58\nand on this end it was attached to this amino acid,\n14:01\nand so it matches them together.\n14:03\nAnd then they're gonna have another tRNA\n14:08\nthat might attach to amino acid 2,\n14:12\nwhich I will do in purple,\n14:16\nand that just happens to coincide with,\n14:19\nso it can complement right over here,\n14:21\nso it attaches in the right place,\n14:22\nso it's A A U right over here,\n14:25\nthis tRNA.\n14:26\nAnd so it'll construct the sequence of amino acids.\n14:29\nAnd as you put these amino acids together,\n14:31\nthen you're actually constructing a protein.\n14:34\nSo protein is essentially a bunch,\n14:38\na sequence of these amino acids put together.\n14:42\nAnd these proteins are essentially the molecules\n14:46\nthat run life for the most part.\n14:49\nObviously you know if you eat an animal\n14:51\nit's going to be made up of fat and sugars and proteins,\n14:53\nbut the proteins are the things that actually do a lot\n14:56\nof the whether they're enzymes, whether they're structural,\n14:58\nthe muscle is formed from proteins,\n15:00\nthese are the things,\n15:01\nand I'm just drawing a small segment of them,\n15:03\nthey could be thousands or more of these amino acids long.\n15:08\nAnd they kind of form these incredibly complex shapes\n15:11\nand they have all of these functions.\n15:13\nThis is what's kind of doing the work of life.\n15:15\nAnd this for the most part,\n15:17\nand this is kind of how the information for life is stored.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the very first immunology video, where we talked about\n0:02\nnonspecific defense mechanisms, we said if we had\n0:05\nsome type of a pathogen-- let's say it's a bacteria--\n0:09\nthat our phagocytes can recognize either proteins on\n0:14\nthe bacteria or maybe it was some other type of pathogen--\n0:16\nsome other marker on the pathogen.\n0:18\nIt doesn't know what type of pathogen it is, but that's\n0:20\nenough for the phagocyte.\n0:23\nIt'll engulf the pathogen.\n0:25\nSo let's say this is the phagocyte.\n0:28\nSomehow one of their receptors touches one of the proteins\n0:32\nthat's on the surface of this bacteria in this case and\n0:36\nsays, gee, that's not a good thing to have around and so\n0:38\nit'll engulf it.\n0:39\nSo the membrane is just going to surround the pathogen-- and\n0:44\nthis part is going to go in.\n0:46\nIt's going to kind of pinch in and the pathogen is going to\n0:48\nget surrounded and get engulfed--\n0:50\nphagocytozed by the phagocyte.\n0:53\nSo the end product-- we saw this on the first video where\n0:56\nI talked about phagocytes-- is we're going to end up-- so\n1:00\nthen the membrane's going to be completely around.\n1:02\nThis is going to pinch in and bubble around this thing and\n1:05\nso we're going to have the pathogen sitting\n1:08\ninside of the phagocyte.\n1:11\nIt's going to be surrounded by a membrane.\n1:13\nThat membrane's called a phagosome.\n1:16\nAnd we learned there's different types of\n1:17\nphagocytes-- could be a macrophage, could be a\n1:22\nneutrophil, could be a dendritic cell-- and we have\n1:28\nit like this and then we also saw in that video, it's not\n1:30\njust done-- the macrophage doesn't\n1:32\njust digest this thing.\n1:34\nThat by itself is very useful.\n1:35\nIt got this bacteria out of the way.\n1:38\nIf this was a virus, it got that virus out of the way.\n1:40\nBut it does even more than that.\n1:42\nIt takes that and then it lyses it-- or it breaks it up.\n1:45\nIt doesn't have to actually use-- well, it breaks it up.\n1:50\nThere's several ways it can do it, but the bottom line is, it\n1:53\nprocesses it.\n1:58\nIt'll break up the pathogen-- and we saw that first video on\n2:01\nphagocytes that we'll actually have a lysosome bond to it and\n2:05\ndump all sorts of particles that are going to break up and\n2:08\ncut up this bacteria, in this case, into\n2:10\nits constituent molecules.\n2:18\nAnd then some subset of the leftovers, particular chains\n2:24\nof the peptides-- and remember, proteins are long\n2:27\nchains of amino acids.\n2:28\nPolypeptides are short chains.\n2:30\nSo you take short chains of those and they're going to\n2:32\nbond to special proteins.\n2:37\nAnd this is essentially the topic of this video.\n2:39\nSo let's say they bond to that special protein, bond to that\n2:42\nspecial protein.\n2:43\nAnd then those proteins get transported or get to the\n2:47\nmembrane or the outer surface of the cell and they present\n2:49\nthemselves along with the piece of the pathogen.\n2:53\nSo the end product after phagocytozed this pathogen is\n2:57\nthat the phagocyte will look something like this and it\n3:01\nwill have these antigen presenting proteins, I guess\n3:08\nwe can call them, that had bound to parts of that\n3:11\noriginal pathogen.\n3:13\nLet me do it right here.\n3:16\nSo it has a little bit of the original pathogen on it that I\n3:20\ndrew in green right here.\n3:23\nAnd these proteins right here, these are called-- it's a\n3:26\nfancy word and I talked about it in the previous video--\n3:29\nthese are called major histocompatibility complexes,\n3:47\nor MHC for short.\n3:53\nAnd when we're talking about phagocytes or macrophages or\n3:58\ndendritic cells that are particular cases of\n4:00\nphagocytes, the major histocompatibility complexes\n4:03\nthat they present after they've digested this\n4:05\nmolecule-- this is an MHC class II.\n4:09\nLet me write this down.\n4:11\nThis is an MHC class II protein.\n4:16\nIt might seem like I'm really going into the minutiae of\n4:18\nwhat these proteins are, but we're going to see this is key\n4:21\nfor activating other parts of the immune system, especially\n4:25\nthe cell mediated parts of the immune system.\n4:27\nSo this was the case with a macrophage or a dendrite.\n4:30\nThey engulf something, they chew it all up, and then parts\n4:34\nof the chewed up thing that they ate, they attach to these\n4:36\nMHC II proteins and these MHC proteins go to the\n4:41\nsurface of the cell.\n4:42\nThe same thing-- or actually not the quite the same thing--\n4:45\na very similar thing happens with B cells.\n4:49\nSo if we have a B cell-- that's a good color.\n4:52\nB for blue.\n4:53\nWe know B stands for bursa, but it could stand for bone\n4:57\nmarrow just as well.\n4:58\nLet's say we have a B cell and it's got its membrane bound\n5:02\nantibody on it.\n5:03\nRemember, it's very specific to that B cells.\n5:07\nSo all of the membrane bound antibodies, all 10,000 or so\n5:10\nof them on this B cell, they all expressed the same\n5:14\nvariable part.\n5:16\nSo this is a particular B cell.\n5:18\nSo remember, this was nonspecific.\n5:20\nWhen we talked about phagocytosis, these guys just\n5:23\nsay, you're a bacteria.\n5:24\nYou're a virus.\n5:24\nI don't know what kind you are.\n5:25\nI'm just going to eat you up.\n5:26\nYou look shady.\n5:27\nI'm going to eat you up.\n5:28\nI don't know what type you are or whether\n5:29\nI've seen you before.\n5:30\nWhen we're talking about B cells, we're talking about the\n5:32\nadaptive or the specific immune system.\n5:35\nAnd so these-- the variable ends of these membrane bound\n5:39\nantibodies are specific to certain parts of certain\n5:43\npathogens, to certain epitopes.\n5:45\nRemember, epitopes were the parts of certain pathogens\n5:49\nthat these specific chains can recognize and bond to.\n5:53\nSo let's say that we're dealing with a\n5:55\nvirus in this situation.\n5:57\nAnd let's say the virus just happens to\n5:59\nbond to this B cell.\n6:01\nRemember, there might be other-- in fact, there\n6:02\ndefinitely are tons of other B cells around, but their\n6:08\nvariable portions are all different.\n6:17\nAnd that's what I always find amazing about B cells is that\n6:19\nthey come from the same genetic line, their genes have\n6:23\nbeen shuffled around in their development so that they can\n6:26\nproduce billions of combinations of these\n6:29\nproteins, or the variable ends of their antibodies.\n6:34\nSo let's say we have some virus.\n6:37\nLet me say it's a bacteria.\n6:38\nWhen I did the other B cell example, I said we're dealing\n6:40\nwith viruses.\n6:41\nBut let's say some new bacteria and just some part of\n6:46\nits surface just happens to bind to only this B cell--\n6:50\nbecause this B cell has just the right combination.\n6:52\nSo some part of his surface binds just to that B cell\n6:57\nright there.\n6:57\nThat part of the surface that binds, remember, that was\n6:59\ncalled the epitope.\n7:01\nThat's that part of the pathogen that binds to our\n7:05\nvariable sequencer.\n7:06\nIt won't bind to this B cell or this B cell because they\n7:09\nhave different sequences here, but it binds to this B cell\n7:12\nand then that starts the activation process.\n7:15\nWe'll go into-- sometimes this by itself can get the B cell\n7:19\nactivated, but you normally need help from helper T\n7:22\ncells-- and we'll talk more about that.\n7:24\nAnd we said, once this happens, once you get\n7:27\nactivated or the activation process starts, this guy\n7:30\nactually gets engulfed-- and I didn't talk about that in the\n7:32\nlast video just because I didn't want to go into too\n7:34\nmuch detail.\n7:35\nSo this whole thing gets engulfed by the B cell.\n7:42\nAnd then when it gets activated, it proliferates\n7:46\nitself and you normally need the T cells there and some\n7:49\npart of them become plasma B cells, some part of them\n7:52\nbecome memory B cells.\n7:58\nRemember, the plasma B cells say, gee, I've been activated.\n8:02\nI'm just going to produce a ton of these antibodies.\n8:05\nSo the plasma B cell will just produce tons of these\n8:07\nantibodies and start spitting them out so that they can\n8:10\nattach to more and more of that pathogen and just mess\n8:14\nthem up in different ways, either tag them so that other\n8:18\nmacrophages or phagocytes eat them up-- or tag two of them\n8:23\nso you bundle them up so that they can't operate properly.\n8:25\nWhatever.\n8:25\nI'm not going to go into detail on that.\n8:27\nThat's when it gets activated.\n8:28\nBut the interesting thing is that the B cell will also do\n8:31\nwhat the phagocytes do.\n8:33\nThe B cell will also take this guy into the cell.\n8:41\nMaybe he's initially attached to the antibody-- and break\n8:47\nhim up, take pieces of this pathogen and attach it to MHC\n8:55\nII proteins and then present them on the surface.\n8:59\nSo a B cell will also present the antigen.\n9:06\nSo this is also an MHC II complex-- a major\n9:11\nhistocompatibility complex-- and just so you know, histo\n9:13\nmeans tissue.\n9:14\nSo this is related to whether something is compatible with\n9:17\nthe tissue in your body and we'll talk more about that and\n9:19\nhow it relates to transplants and all of that.\n9:21\nSo this is also an MHC class II.\n9:25\nIn both cases, whether we're talking about B cells that\n9:28\nrecognize a very specific pathogen-- and it could be a\n9:31\nspecific virus, a specific protein, a specific bacteria,\n9:37\nor in the cases of phagocytes, they'll just say,\n9:40\noh, you look shady.\n9:41\nLet me take you in.\n9:42\nI don't know what type of bacteria or virus or protein\n9:44\nyou are, but in either case, they both engulf them, take\n9:47\npieces of them, cut them up, and present them on their\n9:50\nsurface in a complex with the major\n9:52\nhistocompatibility complexes.\n9:57\nSo cells that do this are called professional antigen\n10:01\npresenting cells.\n10:05\nThis is what they do for a living, although they do other\n10:07\nthings, as we've seen.\n10:09\nThe phagocytes eat things.\n10:10\nThe B cells generate antibodies or memories so that\n10:14\nthey can later be activated to generate antibodies, but these\n10:17\nare called professional antigen presenting cell.\n10:25\nAnd the antigen in question is this little piece of the\n10:29\nactual thing that you're trying to track, that little\n10:35\npiece-- the actual part of the pathogen, that's what the\n10:38\nantigen-- so it's presenting the antigen.\n10:40\nIt's professional because it takes pathogens from in the\n10:48\nfluid of our system and then engulfs them, breaks them up,\n10:51\nand then presents them.\n10:53\nNow there are also nonprofessional antigen\n10:57\npresenting cells.\n10:58\nAnd in fact, most cells are this.\n11:00\nIn fact, even these guys.\n11:02\nActually, I'm going to wait for the next video.\n11:03\nI realize all of my videos are getting long.\n11:05\nSo you're probably thinking, these guys in either case\n11:10\nengulf them, cut them up, present them,\n11:12\nwhat is it good for?\n11:13\nYou'll see these MHC II, these are what are recognized by\n11:18\nhelper T cells.\n11:20\nIt'll all form part of the puzzle of how our immune\n11:23\nsystem works.\n11:24\nSo in the next video, I'll talk about MHC I presenting\n11:28\ncells, which is pretty much all body cells.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] We've already talked about how DNA's structure\n0:03\nas this double helix, this twisted ladder,\n0:05\nmakes it suitable for being the molecular basis of heredity.\n0:10\nAnd what we wanna do in this video is get\n0:11\na better appreciation for why it is suitable,\n0:14\nand the mechanism by which it is\n0:16\nthe molecular basis for heredity.\n0:18\nAnd we're gonna focus on a conceptual level,\n0:19\nI'm not gonna go into all of the,\n0:21\nI guess you could say biochemical details.\n0:23\nReally just give you the conceptual idea of what happens.\n0:26\nSo right over here this could be a fragment of DNA,\n0:30\nI have, what, I have--\n0:31\nThis is eight base pairs depicted.\n0:34\nAnd just to be clear, and we talked about this\n0:35\nin the introductory video to DNA,\n0:37\nDNA is much more than, you know, a handful of base pairs.\n0:42\nThe DNA molecule can be tens of millions of base pairs long.\n0:47\nSo for example this might be a section\n0:49\nof a much longer molecule,\n0:51\nso the much longer strand of DNA,\n0:54\nand even there I'm probably not giving justice to it.\n0:57\nBut this might just be this very, very small section,\n1:03\nlet me do this in a different color,\n1:04\nthis little section right over here,\n1:06\nzoomed in.\n1:08\nSo once again it might be part of a molecule\n1:10\nthat has not seven or eight base pairs,\n1:13\nbut might have 70 million base pairs.\n1:16\nSo just like that.\n1:20\nSo let's understand what a molecular basis of heredity\n1:23\nwould need to do.\n1:25\nWell first of all it would need to be replicable.\n1:27\nOr we would need to be able to replicate it.\n1:31\nAs a cell divides,\n1:32\nthe two new cells would want to have\n1:35\nthe same genetic material.\n1:37\nSo how does DNA replicate?\n1:39\nAnd this process is called replication.\n1:45\nAnd we covered this in the introduction video as well,\n1:47\nbut it's nice to see the different processes\n1:49\nnext to each other.\n1:51\nAnd replication, you can imagine taking\n1:54\neither splitting these two sides of the ladder,\n1:58\nand actually let's do that.\n2:00\nSo let me copy and paste,\n2:03\nso if I take that side right over there,\n2:06\nso let me copy and then paste it.\n2:10\nAnd then there we go,\n2:12\na little bit of it is dropping below the video\n2:15\nbut I think that serves the purpose.\n2:18\nAnd then let's copy and paste the other side.\n2:23\nSo let me select that.\n2:28\nAnd then I copy and then I paste,\n2:32\nand it's just like that.\n2:35\nAnd so you can imagine if you were to split these,\n2:38\nthese things you could call them two sides of the ladder,\n2:41\nthat either side could be used to construct the other side.\n2:43\nAnd then you would have two strands,\n2:45\ntwo identical strands of the DNA.\n2:49\nAnd so let's see what that actually looks like.\n2:52\nSo let me get my pen tool out now,\n2:54\nlet me deselect this, get the pen tool out.\n2:58\nIt's a new tool I'm using,\n2:59\nso let me make sure I'm doing it right.\n3:01\nAlright, so from this side,\n3:02\nfrom this left side,\n3:03\nor at least what we are looking at as the left side,\n3:05\nyou can then construct another right side\n3:07\nbased on this information.\n3:09\nA always pairs with T if we're talking about DNA.\n3:14\nSo adenine pairs with thymine just like that.\n3:17\nThymine pairs with adenine\n3:19\nLet me do that a little bit neater.\n3:22\nThymine pairs with adenine,\n3:26\nguanine pairs with cytosine,\n3:29\ncytosine pairs with guanine,\n3:32\nfalling a little bit down here.\n3:33\nAnd just like that I was able to construct\n3:35\na new right hand side using that left hand side.\n3:38\nSo maybe I'll do the new sugar phosphate\n3:44\nbackbone in yellow.\n3:45\nAnd we can do the same thing here\n3:47\nusing the original right hand side.\n3:49\nSo using the original right hand side,\n3:51\nonce again the T is paired with the A,\n3:54\nlet me do that in adenine's color.\n3:57\nSo we have an adenine and thymine,\n3:59\nadenine and thymine,\n4:00\nadenine and thymine.\n4:02\nThymine pairs with adenine,\n4:03\nso thymine, adenine.\n4:05\nThymine, adenine.\n4:07\nGuanine pairs with cytosine.\n4:11\nAnd then cytosine pairs with guanine.\n4:14\nSo cytosine just like that.\n4:17\nAnd so you can take half of each of this ladder,\n4:19\nand then you can use it to construct the other half,\n4:21\nand what you've essentially done is\n4:22\nyou've replicated the actual DNA.\n4:25\nAnd this is actually a kind of conceptual level\n4:28\nof how replication is done\n4:29\nbefore a cell divides and replicates,\n4:32\nand the entire cell duplicates itself.\n4:35\nSo that's replication.\n4:37\nSo the next thing you're probably thinking about,\n4:39\n\"Okay, well it's nice to be able to replicate yourself\n4:41\n\"but that's kind of useless if that information can't be\n4:44\n\"used to define the organism in some way\n4:47\n\"to express what's actually happening.\"\n4:50\nAnd so let's think about how the genes\n4:54\nin this DNA molecule are actually expressed.\n4:59\nSo I'll write this as \"expression\".\n5:03\nAnd actually that warrants a little bit of a detour\n5:07\nbecause you hear sometimes the words\n5:09\nDNA and chromosome and gene\n5:11\nused somewhat interchangeably,\n5:13\nand they are clearly related,\n5:15\nbut it's worth knowing what is what.\n5:17\nSo when you're talking about DNA\n5:18\nyou're talking literally about this molecule here\n5:21\nthat has this sugar phosphate base\n5:23\nand it has the sequence of base pairs,\n5:25\nit's got this double helix structure,\n5:27\nand so this whole thing this could be a DNA molecule.\n5:29\nNow when you have a DNA molecule\n5:32\nand it's packaged together with other molecules\n5:34\nand proteins and kind of given a broader structure,\n5:37\nthen you're talking about a chromosome.\n5:41\nAnd when you're talking about a gene,\n5:42\nyou're talking about a section of DNA\n5:45\nthat's used to express a certain trait.\n5:48\nOr actually used to code for a certain type of protein.\n5:53\nSo for example this could be,\n5:55\nthis whole thing could be a strand of DNA,\n5:57\nbut this part right over, let's say in orange I'll do it,\n6:01\nthis part in orange right over here could be one gene,\n6:04\nit might define information for one gene,\n6:09\nit could define a protein,\n6:11\nthis section right over here\n6:13\ncould be used to define another gene.\n6:17\nAnd genes could be anywhere from\n6:20\nseveral thousand base pairs long,\n6:22\nall the way up into the millions.\n6:24\nAnd as we'll see,\n6:25\nthe way that a gene is expressed,\n6:27\nthe way we get from the information for that section of DNA\n6:30\ninto a protein which is really how it's expressed,\n6:33\nis through a related molecule to DNA,\n6:37\nand that is RNA.\n6:40\nActually let me write this down.\n6:41\nRNA.\n6:45\nSo RNA stands for ribonucleic acid.\n6:50\nRibonucleic acid, let me write that down.\n7:02\nAnd so you might remember that DNA is\n7:04\ndeoxyribonucleic acid,\n7:07\nso the sugar backbone in RNA\n7:09\nis a very similar molecule,\n7:11\nwell now it's got its oxy,\n7:12\nit's not deoxyribonucleic acid,\n7:15\nit's ribonucleic acid.\n7:17\nThe R, let me make it clear where the RNA come from,\n7:19\nthe R is right over there,\n7:22\nthen you have the nucleic, that's the n,\n7:27\nand then it's a, acid.\n7:29\nSame reason why we call the DNA nucleic acid.\n7:32\nSo you have this RNA.\n7:35\nSo what role does this play as we are trying\n7:38\nto express the information in this DNA?\n7:41\nWell the DNA,\n7:41\nespecially if we're talking about cells with nucleii,\n7:44\nthe DNA sits there but that information has to\n7:47\nfor the most part get outside of the nucleus\n7:49\nin order to be expressed.\n7:50\nAnd one of the functions that RNA plays\n7:53\nis to be that messenger,\n7:54\nthat messenger between a certain section of DNA\n7:57\nand kind of what goes on outside of the nucleus,\n7:59\nso that that can be translated into an actual protein.\n8:04\nSo the step that you go from DNA to mRNA,\n8:07\nmessenger RNA,\n8:08\nis called transcription.\n8:11\nLet me write that down.\n8:20\nAnd what happens in transcription,\n8:21\nlet's go back to looking at one side of this DNA molecule.\n8:27\nSo let's say you have that right over there,\n8:30\nlet me copy and paste it.\n8:34\nSo there we go, actually I didn't wanna do that.\n8:38\nI wanted the other side.\n8:39\nSo actually I think I'm on the wrong, let me go back here.\n8:44\nAnd so let me copy and then let me paste.\n8:48\nThere we go.\n8:49\nSo let's say you have part of this DNA molecule,\n8:56\nor you have 1/2 of it\n8:57\njust like we did when we replicated it.\n8:58\nBut now we're not just trying to duplicate the DNA molecule,\n9:01\nwe're actually trying to create\n9:02\na corresponding mRNA molecule.\n9:05\nAt least for that section of,\n9:08\nat least for that gene.\n9:09\nSo this might be part of a gene\n9:11\nActually whoops, let me make sure I'm using the right tool.\n9:14\nThis might be part of a gene that is this section\n9:17\nof our DNA molecule right over there.\n9:20\nAnd so transcription is a very similar conceputal idea,\n9:23\nwhere we're now going to construct\n9:25\na strand of RNA and specifically mRNA\n9:28\n'cause it's going to take that information\n9:29\noutside of the nucleus.\n9:32\nAnd so it's very similar\n9:33\nexcept for when we're talking about RNA,\n9:35\nadenine, instead of pairing with thymine,\n9:38\nis now going to pair with uracil.\n9:41\nSo let me write this down,\n9:42\nso now you're gonna have adenine pairs not with thymine\n9:45\nbut uracil.\n9:47\nDNA has uracil instead of the thymine.\n9:49\nBut you're still going to have cytosine and guanine pairing.\n9:52\nSo for the RNA and in this case the mRNA\n9:56\nthat's going to leave the nucleus\n9:59\nA is going to pair with U,\n10:01\nU for uracil,\n10:03\nso uracil, that's the base we're talking about,\n10:06\nlet me write it down, uracil.\n10:09\nThymine is still going to pair with adenine,\n10:15\njust like that.\n10:16\nGuanine is gonna pair with cytosine,\n10:20\nand cytosine is going to pair with guanine.\n10:26\nAnd so when you do that,\n10:27\nnow these two characters can detach,\n10:29\nand now you have a single strand of RNA\n10:32\nand in this case messenger RNA,\n10:33\nthat has all the information\n10:37\non that section of DNA.\n10:41\nAnd so now that thing can leave the nucleus,\n10:44\ngo attach to a ribosome,\n10:46\nand we'll talk more about that in future videos\n10:48\nexactly how that's happened,\n10:50\nand then this code can be used\n10:52\nto actually code for proteins.\n10:55\nNow how does that happen?\n10:56\nAnd that process is called translation.\n11:01\nWhich is really taking this base pair sequence\n11:04\nand turning it into an amino acid sequence.\n11:07\nProteins are made up of sequences of amino acids.\n11:10\nSo translation.\n11:11\nSo let's take our mRNA or this little section of our mRNA,\n11:15\nand actually let me draw it like this.\n11:20\nNow let's see, I have it is U A C,\n11:23\nso it's gonna be U A C then U U\n11:28\nthen A C G okay?\n11:30\nAnd then we have an A,\n11:33\nlet me make sure I change it to the right color.\n11:35\nWe have an A there, and then we have this U U A,\n11:41\nC G, alright,\n11:43\nnow let me put a C right over there,\n11:45\nI'm just taking this and I'm writing it horizontally.\n11:47\nI have a C here, not a G, it's a C.\n11:52\nAnd then finally I have a G.\n11:54\nAnd of course it'll keep going on and on and on.\n11:57\nAnd what happens is each sequence of three,\n12:01\nand you have to be very careful where it starts,\n12:03\nand so this is in some ways a delicate and surprising,\n12:05\nbut at the same time surprisingly robust process,\n12:08\nevery three of these bases code for a specific amino acid.\n12:14\nAnd so three bases together,\n12:16\nso these bases right over here,\n12:18\nthese I guess you could say this three letter word\n12:20\nor this three letter sequence,\n12:22\nthat's called a codon.\n12:25\nAnd this is going to be the next codon.\n12:29\nAnd we actually haven't drawn the next codon after that\n12:31\n'cause we need three bases to get to the next codon.\n12:35\nAnd how many possible codons do you have?\n12:38\nWell you have one of four bases\n12:40\nand you have them in three different places,\n12:42\nso you have four times four times four,\n12:44\npossible codon words I guess you could say.\n12:47\nAnd four times four times four is 64.\n12:50\nSo you have 64 possible codons.\n12:56\nWhich is good because you have 20 possible amino acids.\n12:58\nSo this is overkill and allows codons to be used\n13:01\nfor other purposes as well.\n13:02\nAnd they also, you might have more than one codon\n13:04\ncoding for the same amino acid.\n13:07\nSo you have 64 possible codons\n13:08\nthat need to code for 20 amino acids.\n13:11\nAnd so this codon right over here with the ribosome,\n13:14\nand we'll talk more about how that happens,\n13:16\ncan code for\n13:22\namino acid 1.\n13:25\nSo let me just write it here, this is amino acid 1.\n13:28\nAnd actually this amino acid is brought to here,\n13:31\nthey're actually matched together by another type of RNA,\n13:34\nthis is mRNA we're talking about right over here.\n13:37\nThis is mRNA, but there's another type of RNA\n13:41\ncalled tRNA\n13:43\nthat essentially brings these two characters together.\n13:47\nSo the tRNA,\n13:48\nand I'm just gonna, it's got some structure here,\n13:49\nI'm not drawing it completely right,\n13:51\nbut it's going to match right over here,\n13:52\nwhere maybe it has an A, a U, and a G right over here\n13:58\nand on this end it was attached to this amino acid,\n14:01\nand so it matches them together.\n14:03\nAnd then they're gonna have another tRNA\n14:08\nthat might attach to amino acid 2,\n14:12\nwhich I will do in purple,\n14:16\nand that just happens to coincide with,\n14:19\nso it can complement right over here,\n14:21\nso it attaches in the right place,\n14:22\nso it's A A U right over here,\n14:25\nthis tRNA.\n14:26\nAnd so it'll construct the sequence of amino acids.\n14:29\nAnd as you put these amino acids together,\n14:31\nthen you're actually constructing a protein.\n14:34\nSo protein is essentially a bunch,\n14:38\na sequence of these amino acids put together.\n14:42\nAnd these proteins are essentially the molecules\n14:46\nthat run life for the most part.\n14:49\nObviously you know if you eat an animal\n14:51\nit's going to be made up of fat and sugars and proteins,\n14:53\nbut the proteins are the things that actually do a lot\n14:56\nof the whether they're enzymes, whether they're structural,\n14:58\nthe muscle is formed from proteins,\n15:00\nthese are the things,\n15:01\nand I'm just drawing a small segment of them,\n15:03\nthey could be thousands or more of these amino acids long.\n15:08\nAnd they kind of form these incredibly complex shapes\n15:11\nand they have all of these functions.\n15:13\nThis is what's kind of doing the work of life.\n15:15\nAnd this for the most part,\n15:17\nand this is kind of how the information for life is stored.",

over time, you're\n0:09\ntrying to breed watermelons that have fewer seeds,\n0:11\nand you should see whether you are actually making progress.\n0:15\nAnd you don't want to cut open every watermelon\n0:17\nin your watermelon farm or patch or whatever\n0:21\nit might be called, because you want to sell most of them.\n0:23\nYou just want to sample a few watermelons,\n0:25\nand then take samples of those watermelons\n0:28\nto figure out how dense the seeds are, and hope that you\n0:33\ncan calculate statistics on those samples that\n0:36\nare decent estimates of the parameters for the population.\n0:40\nSo let's start doing that.\n0:42\nSo let's say that you take these little cubic inch chunks out\n0:45\nof a random sample of your watermelons.\n0:48\nAnd then you count the number of seeds in them.\n0:50\nAnd you have 8 samples like this.\n0:54\nSo in one of them, you found 4 seeds.\n0:57\nIn the next, you found 3, 5, 7, 2, 9, 11, and 7.\n1:06\nSo this is a sample, just to make\n1:08\nsure we're visualizing it right.\n1:10\nIf this is the population of all of the chunks--\n1:15\nI guess we could view this as a cubic inch--\n1:17\nthe cubic inch chunks in my entire watermelon farm,\n1:21\nI'm sampling a very small sample of them.\n1:26\nMaybe I could have had a million over here.\n1:29\nA million chunks of watermelon could\n1:30\nhave been produced from my farm, but I'm only\n1:33\nsampling-- so capital N would be 1 million,\n1:36\nlowercase n is equal to 8.\n1:39\nAnd once again, you might want to have more samples,\n1:41\nbut this'll make our math easy.\n1:43\nNow, let's think about what statistics we can measure.\n1:47\nWell, the first one that we often do\n1:49\nis a measure of central tendency.\n1:51\nAnd that's the arithmetic mean.\n1:53\nBut here, we're trying to estimate the population mean\n1:56\nby coming up with the sample mean.\n2:00\nSo what is the sample mean going to be?\n2:04\nWell, all we have to do is add up these points,\n2:08\nadd up these measurements, and then divide\n2:10\nby the number of measurements we have.\n2:12\nSo let's get our calculator out for that.\n2:15\nActually, maybe I don't need my calculator.\n2:17\nLet's see.\n2:18\nSo 4 plus 3 is 7.\n2:20\n7 plus 5 is 12.\n2:21\n12 plus 7 is 19.\n2:24\n19 plus 2 is 21, plus 9 is 30, plus 11 is 41, plus 7 is 48.\n2:33\nSo I'm going to get 48 over 8 data points.\n2:36\nSo this worked out quite well.\n2:38\n48 divided by 8 is equal to 6.\n2:41\nSo our sample mean is 6.\n2:43\nIt's our estimate of what the population mean might be.\n2:47\nBut we also want to think about how much in our population\n2:50\nwe want to estimate, how much spread is there,\n2:56\nor how much do our measurements vary from this mean.\n3:01\nSo there, we say, well, we can try to estimate the population\n3:05\nvariance by calculating the sample variance.\n3:08\nAnd we're going to calculate the unbiased sample variance.\n3:13\nHopefully, we're fairly convinced at this point\n3:15\nwhy we divide by n minus 1.\n3:16\nSo we're going to calculate the unbiased sample variance.\n3:20\nAnd if we do that, what do we get?\n3:24\nI'll do this in a different color.\n3:25\nIt's going to be 4 minus 6 squared plus 3 minus 6 squared\n3:32\nplus 5 minus 6 squared plus 7 minus 6 squared\n3:38\nplus 2 minus 6 squared plus 9 minus 6 squared\n3:44\nplus 11 minus 6 squared plus 7 minus 6 squared, all of that\n3:51\ndivided by-- not by 8.\n3:54\nRemember, we want the unbiased sample variance.\n3:57\nWe're going to divide it by 8 minus 1.\n4:00\nSo we're going to divide by 7.\n4:03\nLet me give myself a little bit more real estate.\n4:05\nThe unbiased sample variance-- and I could even\n4:07\ndenote it by this to make it clear that we're\n4:09\ndividing by lowercase n minus 1-- is going\n4:13\nto be equal to-- let's see, 4 minus 6 is negative 2.\n4:18\nThat squared is positive 4.\n4:20\nSo I did that one.\n4:21\n3 minus 6 is negative 3.\n4:23\nThat squared is going to be 9.\n4:25\n5 minus 6 squared is 1 squared, which is 1.\n4:29\n7 minus 6 is once again 1 squared, which is 1.\n4:33\n2 minus 6, negative 4 squared is 16.\n4:40\n9 minus 6 squared, well, that's going to be 9.\n4:43\n11 minus 6 squared, that is 25.\n4:48\nAnd then finally, 7 minus 6 squared, that's another 1.\n4:52\nAnd we're going to divide it by 7.\n4:56\nLet's see if we can add this up in our heads.\n4:58\n4 plus 9 is 13, plus 1 is 14, 15, 31, 40, 65, 66.\n5:10\nSo this is going to be equal to 66 over 7.\n5:15\nAnd we could either divide-- we get that's 9 and 3/7.\n5:20\nWe could write that as 9 and 3/7.\n5:23\nOr if we want to write that as a decimal,\n5:25\nI could just take 66 divided by 7\n5:30\ngives us 9 point-- I'll just round it.\n5:33\nSo it's approximately 9.43.\n5:43\nNow, that gave us our unbiased sample variance.\n5:48\nWell, how could we calculate a sample standard deviation?\n5:51\nWe want to somehow get added estimate of what the population\n5:55\nstandard deviation might be.\n5:57\nWell, the logic, I guess, is reasonable to say, well,\n6:01\nthis is our unbiased sample variance.\n6:03\nIt's our best estimate of what the true population\n6:07\nvariance is.\n6:08\nWhen we think about population parameters\n6:10\nto get the population standard deviation,\n6:15\nwe just take the square root of the population variance.\n6:19\nSo if we want to get an estimate of the sample standard\n6:23\ndeviation, why don't we just take\n6:25\nthe square root of the unbiased sample variance?\n6:32\nSo that's what we'll do.\n6:33\nSo we'll define it that way.\n6:34\nWe'll call it the sample standard deviation.\n6:36\nWe're going to define it to be equal to the square root\n6:40\nof the unbiased sample variance.\n6:42\nIt's going to be the square root of this quantity,\n6:45\nand we can take our calculator out.\n6:47\nIt's going to be the square root of what I just typed in.\n6:50\nI can do 2nd answer.\n6:51\nIt'll be the last entry here.\n6:52\nSo the square root of that is-- and I'll just round.\n6:54\nIt's approximately equal to 3.07.\n7:01\nNow, I'm going to tell you something\n7:02\nvery counterintuitive.\n7:04\nOr at least initially it's counterintuitive,\n7:06\nbut hopefully you'll appreciate this over time.\n7:09\nThis we've already talked about in some depth.\n7:12\nPeople have even created simulations\n7:14\nto show that this is an unbiased estimate of population variance\n7:19\nwhen we divide it by n minus 1.\n7:21\nAnd that's a good starting point if we're\n7:22\ngoing to take the square root of anything.\n7:24\nBut it actually turns out that because the square root\n7:28\nfunction is nonlinear, that this sample standard\n7:32\ndeviation-- and this is how it tends\n7:35\nto be defined-- sample standard deviation, that this sample\n7:42\nstandard deviation, which is the square root of our sample\n7:53\nvariance, so from i equals 1 to n\n7:57\nof our unbiased sample variance, so we divide it by n minus 1.\n8:01\nThis is how we literally divide our sample standard deviation.\n8:04\nBecause the square root function is nonlinear,\n8:11\nit turns out that this is not an unbiased estimate\n8:16\nof the true population standard deviation.\n8:20\nAnd I encourage people to make simulations of that\n8:23\nif they're interested.\n8:24\nBut then you might say, well, we went through great pains\n8:27\nto divide by n minus 1 here in order\n8:29\nto get an unbiased estimate of the population variance.\n8:32\nWhy don't we go through similar pains\n8:34\nand somehow figure out a formula for an unbiased estimate\n8:38\nof the population standard deviation?\n8:41\nAnd the reason why that's difficult\n8:43\nis to unbias the sample variance,\n8:46\nwe just have to divide by n minus 1 instead of n.\n8:48\nAnd that'd work for any probability distribution\n8:52\nfor our population.\n8:54\nIt turns out to do the same thing\n8:55\nfor the standard deviation.\n8:57\nIt's not that easy.\n8:59\nIt's actually dependent on how that population is actually\n9:02\ndistributed.\n9:03\nSo in statistics, we just define the sample standard deviation.\n9:07\nAnd the one that we typically use\n9:10\nis based on the square root of the unbiased sample variance.\n9:15\nBut when you take that square root,\n9:19\nit does give you a biased result when\n9:25\nyou're trying to use this to estimate the population\n9:27\nstandard deviation.\n9:28\nBut it's the simplest, best tool we have.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] Let's now see if we can balance a chemical\n0:02\nequation with slightly more complex molecules.\n0:07\nSo, here we have a chemical equation,\n0:10\ndescribing a chemical reaction.\n0:11\nThis is actually a combustion reaction.\n0:14\nYou have some ethylene right over here,\n0:17\nin the presence of oxygen, and you need to get a\n0:20\nlittle bit of energy to get this going, but then you're\n0:22\ngoing to have this reaction that's actually going to\n0:24\nrelease energy as well, but we're not accounting for\n0:26\nthe energy, at least the way we've written it.\n0:28\nRight over here, you have some ethylene, and this little\n0:32\ng in parentheses, says it's in the gas form\n0:35\nor gaseous form, so gaseous ethylene plus some\n0:40\ndioxygen molecule, which is the most prevalent form of\n0:43\noxygen molecule that you would find in the atmosphere.\n0:47\nAnd so, that's also in the gas form.\n0:49\nPut them together, you end up with some carbon dioxide\n0:52\ngas and some liquid water.\n0:55\nThis is the classic combustion reaction.\n0:58\nBut now let's think about, how do we balance this thing?\n1:01\nLet's make sure we have the same number\n1:03\nof each atom on both sides.\n1:07\nAnd when you see something more complicated like this,\n1:09\nwhere, you know, here I have an oxygen and two different\n1:13\nmolecules over here, and a lot of these molecules have\n1:17\nmultiple elements in it.\n1:19\nIt might be very daunting.\n1:20\nWhere do I start?\n1:21\nAnd this is where the art of balancing chemical\n1:23\nequations starts to come into play.\n1:26\nThe general idea is,\n1:28\nTry to balance the...\n1:30\ntry to balance the molecules that have multiple\n1:33\nelements in them first, and leave the...\n1:37\nmolecules that only have one element in them for last.\n1:40\nAnd the idea there is, is that these are harder.\n1:43\nThey're going to have all sorts of implications,\n1:44\nand then, at the end of the day, you can just set\n1:46\na number here for the number of dioxygens.\n1:50\nIf you saved, say the ethylene for last,\n1:54\nthen every time, and you're trying to balance the carbons,\n1:57\nyou try to change the number of carbons, you're going to\n1:59\nchange the number of hydrogens,\n2:00\nwhich is going to change the...\n2:01\nYou're going to have to balance over and over, and you're\n2:03\ngoing to go into this really really really confusing circle.\n2:05\nSo, the best thing to do, try to balance\n2:08\nthe complex molecules first, and then\n2:11\nsave the single element molecules for last.\n2:15\nSo let's do that.\n2:16\nSo, let's start with the carbons.\n2:19\nSo, over here, I have two carbons.\n2:22\nOver here, I only have one carbon.\n2:26\nI only have one carbon.\n2:28\nSo, it seems like the best way to balance it is, I should\n2:31\nhave two molecules of carbon dioxide,\n2:35\nand I haven't even thought about the oxygens yet.\n2:37\nBy putting that two there, that's going to change the\n2:39\nnumber of oxygens I have on the righthand side.\n2:42\nBut at least it balances my carbons.\n2:44\nI now have two carbons on the lefthand side,\n2:47\nand I have two carbons on the righthand side.\n2:49\nI’m no longer magically destroying\n2:52\na carbon atom, all right.\n2:55\nNow, let's move on to the hydrogens, and remember,\n2:57\nwhat I said is, let's wait to do the oxygens last,\n3:00\nbecause we have a molecule\n3:03\nthat only contains oxygen right over here,\n3:06\nso we'll save oxygen for last.\n3:08\nSo, let's do hydrogen next.\n3:11\nSo, hydrogen, right over here, we have four hydrogens.\n3:15\nAnd on the righthand side, we have two hydrogens.\n3:18\nSo, it seems like the easiest thing to do to balance\n3:21\nthe hydrogens is to have two of these water molecules.\n3:25\nNow I have four hydrogens here,\n3:27\nand I have four hydrogens there.\n3:30\nNow, let's do the oxygen.\n3:33\nNow, let's do the oxygen.\n3:34\nI've balanced the carbons and the hydrogens.\n3:36\nAnd the reason why oxygen's going to be interesting,\n3:38\nI can just count the amount of oxygen I now have here,\n3:41\nafter changing the amount of molecules I have.\n3:45\nAnd then I can adjust this accordingly, because this is\n3:48\nonly going to affect the number of oxygens\n3:50\nthat I have on the lefthand side.\n3:52\nRight now, on the lefthand side, I have two oxygens,\n3:54\nand on the righthand side, let me count this,\n3:57\nI have two O two's, really.\n4:00\nSo, this is going to be four oxygens here,\n4:02\nand then I have, each of these water molecules has\n4:05\none oxygen, but I have two water molecules,\n4:07\nso this is going to be two oxygens, two oxygens here.\n4:11\nSo, on the righthand side, I have four plus two oxygens.\n4:15\nSo, I have six oxygens on the righthand side.\n4:17\nI need six oxygens on the lefthand side.\n4:19\nI need this number to be six.\n4:21\nSo, how do I do that?\n4:23\nWell, I just need three of these molecules.\n4:24\nIf I have three molecules, each of them have two oxygens,\n4:27\nI'm going to have a total of six oxygens.\n4:29\nAnd just like that, we have balanced this\n4:31\ncombustion reaction, this chemical equation.",

It could be\n4:21\njust this change in energy over time.\n4:23\nBut we'll learn, especially when we do quantum mechanics,\n4:25\nthat it all gets jumbled up as we start approaching the\n4:29\nscales or the size of an atom.\n4:31\nAnyway, I said this was an incorrect way of doing it.\n4:34\nWhat's the correct way?\n4:37\nSo it turns out-- this is a picture, not a picture really,\n4:40\nthis is also a depiction.\n4:42\nSo it's an interesting question, what I just said.\n4:44\nHow can you have a picture of an atom?\n4:47\nBecause is actually turns out that most wavelengths of\n4:49\nlight, especially the visible wavelengths of light, are much\n4:52\nlarger than the size of an atom.\n4:56\nEverything else we quote-unquote, observe in\n4:58\nlife, it's by reflected light.\n5:00\nBut all of a sudden when you're dealing with an atom,\n5:02\nreflected light you could almost view it as too big, or\n5:06\ntoo blunt of an instrument with which to observe an atom.\n5:09\nAnyway, this is a depiction of a helium atom.\n5:14\nA helium atom has two protons and two neutrons.\n5:18\nOr at least this helium atom has two\n5:19\nprotons and two neutrons.\n5:21\nAnd the way they depict it here in the nucleus, right\n5:24\nthere, maybe these are the two-- I'm assuming they're\n5:26\nusing red for proton and purple for neutron.\n5:32\nPurple seems like more of a neutral color.\n5:34\nAnd they're sitting at the center of this atom.\n5:39\nAnd then this whole haze around there, those are the\n5:42\ntwo electrons that helium has, or that at least\n5:45\nthis helium atom has.\n5:47\nMaybe you could gain or lose an electron.\n5:49\nBut these are the two electrons.\n5:50\nAnd you say, hey, Sal, how can two electrons be this blur\n5:55\nthat's kind of smeared around this atom.\n5:58\nAnd that's where it gets philosophically interesting.\n6:01\nSo you cannot describe an electron's path around a\n6:09\nnucleus with the traditional orbit idea that we've\n6:12\nencountered when we look at planets or if we just imagine\n6:16\nthings at kind of a larger scale.\n6:18\nIt turns out that an electron, you cannot know exactly its\n6:24\nmomentum and location at any given point in time.\n6:28\nAll you can know is a probability distribution of\n6:31\nwhere it is likely to be.\n6:33\nAnd the way they depicted this, black is a higher\n6:36\nprobability, so you're much more likely to find the\n6:39\nelectron here than you are here.\n6:42\nBut the electron really could be anywhere.\n6:43\nIt could even to be here, even though it's completely white\n6:46\nthere, with some very, very, very, very, very low\n6:49\nprobability.\n6:50\nAnd so this function of where an electron is, this is called\n6:55\nan orbital.\n6:56\nOrbital.\n6:57\nNot to be confused with orbit.\n7:00\nOrbital.\n7:02\nRemember, an orbit was something like this.\n7:05\nIt's like Venus going around the Sun.\n7:08\nSo it's very physically easy for us to imagine.\n7:12\nWhile an orbital is actually a mathematical probability\n7:16\nfunction that tells us where we're\n7:17\nlikely to find an electron.\n7:18\nWe'll deal a lot more with that when we cover quantum\n7:21\nmechanics, but that's not going to be in the scope of\n7:23\nthis kind of introductory set of chemistry lectures.\n7:26\nBut it's interesting, right?\n7:28\nAn electron's behavior is so bizarre at that scale that you\n7:32\ncan't-- I mean, to call it a particle is almost misleading.\n7:35\nIt is called a particle, but it's not a particle in the\n7:38\nsense that we're used to in our everyday life.\n7:40\nIt's this thing that you can't even say exactly where it is.\n7:45\nIt can be anywhere in this haze.\n7:47\nAnd we'll learn later that there are different shapes of\n7:49\nthe hazes is as we add more and more electrons to an atom.\n7:53\nBut to me, it starts to address philosophical issues\n7:57\nof what matter even is, or do the things we look at, how\n8:01\nreal are they?\n8:02\nOr how real are they, at least as we've defined reality?\n8:04\nAnyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.\n8:07\nBut the whole notion of electrons, protons, they're\n8:12\nall kind of predicated on this notion of charge.\n8:15\nAnd we've talked about it before when we learned about\n8:17\nCoulomb's law.\n8:18\nYou could review Coulomb's laws videos in the physics\n8:22\nplaylist. But the idea is that an electron\n8:27\nhas a negative charge.\n8:29\nA proton, sometimes written like that,\n8:31\nhas a positive charge.\n8:33\nAnd a neutron has no charge.\n8:37\nAnd so that's what was tempting about the original\n8:39\nmodel of an electron.\n8:42\nIf they say, OK, if this thing has positive charges, right?\n8:45\nSo let's say this is two neutrons and two protons.\n8:47\nLet's say it's a helium atom.\n8:48\nThen we'll have some positive charges here.\n8:51\nWe have some negative charges out here.\n8:54\nOpposite charges attract.\n8:56\nAnd so if these things had some velocity, enough\n9:03\nvelocity, they would orbit around this, just the way a\n9:08\nplanet will orbit around the Sun.\n9:10\nBut now we learn, even though this is partially true, that\n9:15\nthe further away an electron is from the nucleus, it does\n9:23\nhave more, it's true, potential energy.\n9:27\nIn that it will want to move towards the nucleus, but\n9:31\nbecause of all the mechanics at the quantum level, it won't\n9:34\njust do something simple like move in a path like that, like\n9:37\na comet would do around the Sun, it actually has this kind\n9:41\nof wave-like behavior, where it just has this probability\n9:43\nfunction that describes it.\n9:45\nBut the further away an orbital, it\n9:48\ndoes have more potential.\n9:50\nWe're going to go a lot more into that in future videos.\n9:53\nBut anyway, how do you recognize what an element is?\n9:56\nI've talked a lot about the philosophy and all of that,\n9:58\nbut how do I know that this is helium?\n10:00\nIs it by the number of neutrons it has?\n10:03\nIs it by the number of protons it has?\n10:05\nIs it by the number of electrons?\n10:07\nWell the answer is, it's by the number of protons.\n10:09\nSo if you know the number of protons in an element, you\n10:13\nknow what that element is.\n10:14\nAnd the number of protons, this is defined\n10:21\nas the atomic number.\n10:26\nNow, so let's say I said something has four protons.\n10:33\nHow do we know what it is?\n10:34\nWell if we haven't memorized it, we could look it up on the\n10:37\nperiodic table of elements, which we'll be dealing with a\n10:39\nlot in this playlist. And you'd say, oh, four protons,\n10:43\nthat is beryllium.\n10:45\nRight there.\n10:46\nAnd the atomic number is the number that you see up there.\n10:50\nAnd that' s literally the number of protons.\n10:52\nAnd that is what differentiates\n10:55\none atom from another.\n10:56\nIf you have fifteen protons, you're dealing with\n10:59\nphosphorus.\n11:00\nAnd all of a sudden, if you have seven protons, you're\n11:06\ndealing with nitrogen.\n11:07\nIf you have eight, you're dealing with oxygen.\n11:09\nThat is what defines the element.\n11:11\nNow, we'll talk in the future about what happens with charge\n11:15\nand all of that.\n11:17\nOr what happens when you gain or lose electrons.\n11:19\nBut that does not change what element you're dealing with.\n11:21\nAnd likewise, when you change the number of neutrons, that\n11:26\nalso does not change the element you're dealing with.\n11:30\nBut that leads to an obvious question of, well, how many\n11:32\nneutrons and electrons do you have?\n11:35\nWell, if an atom is charge-neutral, that means it\n11:43\nhas the same number of electrons.\n11:46\nSo let's say that I have carbon.\n11:52\nIts atomic number is six.\n11:53\nAnd let's say its mass number is twelve.\n12:00\nNow what does this mean?\n12:01\nAnd let me say further that this is a neutral particle.\n12:05\nThis is a neutral atom.\n12:07\nSo the atomic number for carbon is six.\n12:10\nThat tells us exactly how many protons it has.\n12:13\nSo if I were to draw a little model here, and this is in no\n12:16\nway an accurate model.\n12:17\nI'll draw six-- two, three, four, five, six\n12:21\nprotons in the center.\n12:23\nAnd the weight of these protons, each proton is one\n12:26\natomic mass unit, and we'll talk more about how that\n12:28\nrelates to kilograms. It's a very small\n12:31\nfraction of a kilogram.\n12:32\nRoughly I think it's 1.6 times 10 to the\n12:36\nminus 27th of a kilogram.\n12:38\nSo let's say each of these are one atomic mass unit, and\n12:45\nthat's approximately equal to, I think, 1.67 times 10 to the\n12:48\nminus 27 kilograms. This is a very small number.\n12:53\nIt's actually almost impossible to visualize.\n12:57\nAt least it is for me.\n12:58\nThis tells me the mass of the entire carbon atom, of this\n13:03\nparticular carbon atom.\n13:04\nAnd this can actually change from carbon\n13:05\natom to carbon atom.\n13:07\nAnd this is essentially the mass of all of the protons\n13:10\nplus all of the neutrons.\n13:12\nAnd each proton has an atomic mass of one, in atomic mass\n13:17\nunits, and each neutron has an atomic mass of\n13:20\none atomic mass unit.\n13:22\nSo this is really the number of protons plus\n13:28\nthe number of neutrons.\n13:33\nSo in this case we have six protons, so we must also have\n13:37\nsix neutrons.\n13:39\nSix neutrons plus six protons.\n13:42\nNow, where are the electrons?\n13:44\nWell, I said it's neutral, so the proton has an equal\n13:49\npositive charge as the electron's negative charge.\n13:51\nSo this is a neutral atom, and it has six protons, so it also\n13:55\nhas six electrons.\n13:56\nLet me draw that.\n13:57\nSo we said it has six neutrons in here.\n13:59\nOne, two, three, four, five, six.\n14:01\nSo that's the nucleus right there.\n14:04\nAnd then if we were to draw the electons-- well, I could\n14:09\ndraw it as a smear, but if we want to kind of visualize it a\n14:12\nlittle better, we could say, OK, there's going to be six\n14:13\nelectrons orbiting.\n14:15\nOne, two, three, four, five, six.\n14:18\nAnd they're going to be moving around in this unpredictable\n14:21\nway that we would have to describe with\n14:22\na probability function.\n14:24\nAnd so the interesting thing about it is, most of the mass\n14:30\nof an atom is sitting right in here.\n14:32\nI mean, you might notice that when people care about the\n14:34\nmass, when they care about the atomic mass number of an atom,\n14:40\nthey ignore the electrons.\n14:41\nAnd that's because the mass of a proton, one proton\n14:47\nmass-wise, is equal to 1,836 electons.\n14:52\nSo for thinking about the mass of an atom, for all basic\n14:58\npurposes, you can ignore the mass of an electron.\n15:01\nIt's really the mass of the nucleus that counts as the\n15:08\nmass of the atom.\n15:10\nNow, you might see this periodic table here, and you\n15:12\nsay, OK, they gave us the atomic number up there.\n15:15\nThe atomic number of oxygen is eight.\n15:18\nIt means it has eight protons.\n15:20\nThe atomic number of silicon is 14.\n15:22\nIt has 14 protons.\n15:24\nNow what is this right here?\n15:27\nLet's see, in carbon.\n15:28\nIn carbon they have this 12.0107.\n15:34\nThat is the atomic weight of carbon.\n15:36\nLet me write this.\n15:41\nAtomic weight of carbon.\n15:47\nThe atomic weight of carbon is 12.0107.\n15:56\nNow, what does that mean?\n15:57\nDoes that mean that carbon has six protons and then the\n16:03\nremainder, the remaining 6.0107 neutrons, it has kind\n16:09\nof this fraction of a neutron?\n16:11\nNo.\n16:12\nIt means if you were to average all the different\n16:16\nversions of carbon you find on the planet and you were to\n16:19\naverage the number of neutrons based on the quantity of the\n16:25\ndifferent types of carbon, this is the\n16:27\naverage you would get.\n16:28\nSo it turns out that carbon, the two major forms, the main\n16:32\none you'll find is carbon-12.\n16:35\nSo that's like this.\n16:36\nSo that has six protons and six neutrons.\n16:39\nAnd then another isotope of carbon.\n16:42\nNow an isotope is the same element with a different\n16:45\nnumber of neutrons.\n16:46\nAnother isotope of carbon is carbon-14, which is much more\n16:50\nscarce on the planet.\n16:52\nWe don't know how much in the universe, but on the planet.\n16:55\nNow, if you were to average these, not just a straight-up\n16:58\naverage, then you would get carbon-13 and then the atomic\n17:01\nweight would be 13, but you weight this one much higher\n17:04\nbecause this exists in much larger quantities on Earth.\n17:07\nI mean, this is pretty much all of the\n17:08\ncarbon that you see.\n17:09\nBut there's a little bit of this.\n17:10\nSo if you weight them appropriately, the average\n17:13\nbecomes this.\n17:14\nSo most of the carbon you'll find-- if you just found\n17:17\ncarbon someplace, on average its weight in atomic mass\n17:22\nunits is going to be 12.0107.\n17:27\nBut that idea of an isotope is an interesting one.\n17:29\nRemember, when you change the neutrons, you're not changing\n17:32\nthe actual, fundamental element.\n17:33\nYou're just getting a different isotope, a different\n17:36\nversion, of the element.\n17:37\nSo these two versions of carbon are both isotopes.\n17:41\nNow, I want to leave this video with what I think is\n17:43\nkind of the neatest idea behind atoms. And it's the\n17:46\nmost philosophically interesting things about them.\n17:49\nIt's that the relative size-- so, we have these electrons,\n17:54\nwhich represent very little of the mass of an atom.\n17:58\nIt's 1/2000 of the mass of an atom are the electrons.\n18:01\nAnd even those, it's hard to even describe them as\n18:04\nparticles, because you can't even tell me exactly where and\n18:08\nhow fast one of these particles is moving.\n18:11\nThey just have a probability function.\n18:12\nSo most of the atom is sitting inside the nucleus.\n18:16\nAnd this is the interesting thing.\n18:17\nIf you look at an atom on average, if you\n18:21\nsay this is my atom.\n18:23\nLet's say I had two atoms that are bonded to each other.\n18:26\nAnd I were to say, how much of this is actual stuff?\n18:29\nAnd when I say stuff, that's a very abstract concept, because\n18:32\nwe're talking about the nucleus, right?\n18:33\nBecause the nucleus is where all the\n18:34\nmass is, all the stuff.\n18:36\nIt turns out that it's actually an infinitesimally\n18:39\nsmall fraction of the volume of the atom where-- the volume\n18:44\nof the atom is hard to define, because the electron can\n18:45\npretty much be anywhere, but if you view the volume as\n18:48\nwhere you're most likely to find the electron, or with 90%\n18:52\nprobability you're likely to find the electron, then the\n18:55\nnucleus is, in a lot of cases and the way I think about it,\n18:59\nit's about 1/10,000 of the volume.\n19:01\nSo if you think about it, when you look at something, if you\n19:03\nlook at your hand or if you look at the wall or if you\n19:06\nlook at your computer, 99.999% of it is free space.\n19:14\nIt's nothing.\n19:15\nIt's vacuum.\n19:18\nIf you had ultra-small-- I guess we could call them\n19:20\nparticles or something-- most of them would pass straight\n19:23\nthrough whatever you look at.\n19:24\nSo it already starts to kind of\n19:26\nquestion our hold on reality.\n19:28\nWhat is there when, if-- and this is fact, this isn't\n19:32\ntheory right here-- that if you take anything down to the\n19:35\nbuilding blocks, down to the atomic level, most of the\n19:39\nspace of that kind of, quote-unquote object, is free\n19:43\nvacuum space.\n19:44\nYou could go straight through it if you could get down to\n19:46\nthat scale.\n19:47\nThis image of a helium atom, they say right here this is\n19:50\none femtometer.\n19:52\nRight?\n19:52\nOne femtometer.\n19:57\nThis is the scale of the nucleus of a\n20:00\nhelium atom, right?\n20:01\nOne femtometer.\n20:03\nThis is one angstrom, right?\n20:04\nAnd they say that equals 100,000 femtometers.\n20:06\nAnd just to get a sense of scale, one angstrom is 1 times\n20:10\n10 to the negative 10 meters, right?\n20:13\nSo the atom is roughly on the scale of an angstrom.\n20:15\nIn the case of helium, the nucleus is\n20:17\neven a smaller fraction.\n20:18\nIt's 1/100,000.\n20:20\nSo if you had-- let's say you had liquid helium, which you'd\n20:23\nhave to get very cold to get.\n20:25\nIf you're looking at that, most of it is free space.\n20:27\nIf you're looking at an iron bar, the great, great, great,\n20:30\ngreat, great, great majority of it is free space.\n20:33\nAnd we're not even talking about, maybe there's some free\n20:35\nspace inside the nucleus that we could talk\n20:37\nabout in the future.\n20:38\nBut to me, that just blows my mind that most things we look\n20:41\nat are not really solid.\n20:44\nThey're really just empty space, but they look solid\n20:47\nbecause of the way light reflects on them or the forces\n20:50\nthat repel us.\n20:51\nBut there really isn't something to touch there.\n20:55\nThat most of this right here is all free space.\n20:57\nI think I've said the word free space now, and I think\n21:00\nI'll leave further\n21:02\nmind-blowing to the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nI've now supplied you with two definitions of the state\n0:03\nvariable entropy.\n0:04\nAnd it's S for entropy.\n0:06\nThe thermodynamic definition said that the change in\n0:09\nentropy is equal to the heat added to the system divided by\n0:12\nthe temperature at which the heat is added.\n0:14\nSo obviously, if the temperature is changing while\n0:16\nwe add the heat, which is normally the case, we're going\n0:18\nto have to do a little bit of calculus.\n0:20\nAnd then you can view this as the mathematical, or the\n0:22\nstatistical, or the combinatorical\n0:24\ndefinition of entropy.\n0:26\nAnd this essentially says that entropy is equal to some\n0:29\nconstant times the natural log of the number of states the\n0:32\nsystem can take on.\n0:33\nAnd this is the case when all the states are equally\n0:35\nprobable, which is a pretty good assumption.\n0:37\nIf you have just a gazillion molecules that could have a\n0:41\ngazillion gazillion states, you can assume they're all\n0:43\nroughly equally likely.\n0:44\nThere's a slightly more involved definition if they\n0:46\nhad different probabilities, but we won't\n0:48\nworry about that now.\n0:49\nSo given that we've seen these two definitions, it's a good\n0:52\ntime to introduce you to the second law of thermodynamics.\n1:00\nAnd that's this.\n1:01\nAnd it's a pretty simple law, but it explains a whole range\n1:04\nof phenomena.\n1:06\nIt tells us that the change in entropy for the universe when\n1:16\nany process is undergone is always greater\n1:19\nthan or equal to 0.\n1:22\nSo that tells us that when anything ever happens in the\n1:26\nuniverse, the net effect is that there's more entropy in\n1:30\nthe universe itself.\n1:31\nAnd this seems very deep, and it actually is.\n1:34\nSo let's see if we can apply it to see why it explains, or\n1:38\nwhy it makes sense, relative to some examples.\n1:41\nSo let's say I have two reservoirs that are in contact\n1:44\nwith each other.\n1:45\nSo I have T1.\n1:49\nAnd let's call this our hot reservoir.\n1:52\nAnd then I have T2.\n1:56\nI'll call this our cold reservoir.\n1:58\nWell, we know from experience.\n1:59\nWhat happens if I put a hot cup of water, and it's sharing\n2:03\na wall with a cold glass of water, or cold cube of water,\n2:07\nwhat happens?\n2:08\nWell, their temperatures equalize.\n2:09\nIf these are the same substance, we'll end up\n2:11\nroughly in between, if they're in the same phase.\n2:13\nSo essentially, we have a transfer of heat from the\n2:15\nhotter substance to the colder substance.\n2:18\nSo we have some heat, Q, that goes from the hotter substance\n2:23\nto the colder substance.\n2:24\nYou don't see, in everyday reality, heat going from a\n2:27\ncolder substance to a hotter substance.\n2:29\nIf I put an ice cube in, let's say, some hot tea, you don't\n2:33\nsee the ice cube getting colder and the\n2:35\nhot tea getting hotter.\n2:36\nYou see them both getting to some equal temperature, which\n2:39\nessentially the T is giving heat to the ice cube.\n2:42\nNow in this situation there are reservoirs, so I'm\n2:44\nassuming that their temperatures stay constant.\n2:46\nWhich would only be the case if they were both infinite,\n2:49\nwhich we know doesn't exist in the real world.\n2:51\nIn the real world, T1's temperature as it gave heat\n2:53\nwould go down, and T2's temperature would go up.\n2:56\nBut let's just see whether the second law of thermodynamics\n2:59\nsays that this should happen.\n3:01\nSo what's happening here?\n3:04\nWhat's the net change in entropy for T1?\n3:07\nSo the second law of thermodynamics says that the\n3:09\nchange in entropy for the universe is greater than 0.\n3:13\nBut in this case, that's equal to the change in entropy for\n3:16\nT1 plus the change in entropy for-- oh, I shouldn't--\n3:23\ninstead of T1, let me call it just 1.\n3:28\nFor system 1, that's this hot system up here, plus the\n3:31\nchange in entropy for system 2.\n3:33\nSo what's the change in entropy for system 1?\n3:35\nIt loses Q1 at a high temperature.\n3:43\nSo this equals minus the heat given to the system is Q over\n3:50\nsome hot temperature T1.\n3:53\nAnd then we have the heat being added to the system T2.\n3:57\nSo plus Q over T2.\n4:02\nThis is the change in entropy for the system 2, right?\n4:05\nThis guy loses the heat, and is at temperature 1, which is\n4:08\na higher temperature.\n4:09\nThis guy gains the heat, and he is at a temperature 2,\n4:12\nwhich is a colder temperature.\n4:13\nNow, is this going to be greater than 0?\n4:18\nLet's think about it a little bit.\n4:19\nIf I divide-- let me rewrite this.\n4:22\nSo I can rearrange them, so that we can write this as Q\n4:25\nover T2 minus this one.\n4:28\nI'm just rearranging it.\n4:30\nMinus Q over T1.\n4:33\nNow, which number is bigger?\n4:35\nT2 to T1?\n4:36\nWell, T1 is bigger, right?\n4:39\nThis is bigger.\n4:43\nNow, if I have a bigger number, bigger than this--\n4:46\nwhen we use the word bigger, you have to\n4:47\ncompare it to something.\n4:48\nNow, T1 is bigger than this.\n4:50\nWe have the same number in the numerator\n4:52\nin both cases, right?\n4:54\nSo if I take, let's say, 1 over some, let's say, 1/2\n4:58\nminus 1/3, we're going to be bigger than 0.\n5:01\nThis is a larger number than this number, because this has\n5:03\na bigger denominator.\n5:04\nYou're dividing by a larger number.\n5:06\nThat's a good way to think about it.\n5:08\nYou're dividing this Q by some number here to get something,\n5:11\nand then you're subtracting this Q\n5:13\ndivided by a larger number.\n5:14\nSo this fraction is going to be a smaller absolute number.\n5:16\nSo this is going to be greater than 0.\n5:20\nSo that tells us the second law of thermodynamics, it\n5:23\nverifies this observation we see in the real world, that\n5:28\nheat will flow from the hot body to the cold body.\n5:32\nNow, you might say, hey, Sal.\n5:33\nI have a case that will show you that you are wrong.\n5:38\nYou could say, look.\n5:39\nIf I put an air conditioner in a room-- Let's say this is the\n5:45\nroom, and this is outside.\n5:50\nYou'll say, look what the air conditioner does.\n5:54\nThe room is already cold, and outside is already hot.\n5:59\nBut what the air conditioner does, is it makes the cold\n6:01\neven colder, and it makes the hot even hotter.\n6:04\nIt takes some Q and it goes in that direction.\n6:08\nRight?\n6:09\nIt takes heat from the cold room, and puts it out\n6:11\ninto the hot air.\n6:12\nAnd you're saying, this defies the second law of\n6:14\nthermodynamics.\n6:15\nYou have just disproved it.\n6:17\nYou deserve a Nobel Prize.\n6:18\nAnd I would say to you, you're forgetting one small fact.\n6:24\nThis air conditioner inside here, it has some type of a\n6:27\ncompressor, some type of an engine, that's\n6:29\nactively doing this.\n6:31\nIt's putting in work to make this happen.\n6:33\nAnd this engine right here-- I'll do it in magenta-- it's\n6:38\nalso expelling some more heat.\n6:40\nSo let's call that Q of the engine.\n6:47\nSo if you wanted to figure out the total entropy created for\n6:52\nthe universe, it would be the entropy of the cold room plus\n7:02\nthe change in entropy for outside-- I'll call it\n7:06\noutside, maybe I'll call this, for the room.\n7:10\nRight?\n7:10\nSo you might say, OK.\n7:11\nThis change in entropy for the room, it's giving away heat--\n7:14\nlet's see the room is roughly at a constant temperature for\n7:16\nthat one millisecond we're looking at it.\n7:19\nIt's giving away some Q at some temperature T1.\n7:23\nAnd then-- so that's a minus.\n7:26\nAnd then this the outside is gaining some heat at some\n7:30\ntemperature T2.\n7:32\nAnd so you'll immediately say, hey.\n7:33\nThis number right here is a smaller number than this one.\n7:39\nRight?\n7:39\nBecause the denominator is higher.\n7:41\nSo if you just look at this, this would be negative\n7:43\nentropy, and you'd say hey, this defies the second law of\n7:46\nthermodynamics.\n7:47\nNo!\n7:47\nBut what you have to throw in here is another notion.\n7:50\nYou have to throw in here the notion that the outside is\n7:52\nalso getting this heat from the engine over the outside\n7:58\ntemperature.\n7:59\nAnd this term, I can guarantee you-- I'm not giving you\n8:03\nnumbers right now-- will make this\n8:05\nwhole expression positive.\n8:07\nThis term will turn the total net entropy to the universe to\n8:12\nbe positive.\n8:13\nNow let's think a little bit how about what entropy is and\n8:17\nwhat entropy isn't in terms of words.\n8:18\nSo when you take an intro chemistry class, the teacher\n8:22\noften says, entropy equals disorder.\n8:28\nWhich is not incorrect.\n8:30\nIt is disorder, but you have to be very careful what we\n8:34\nmean by disorder.\n8:35\nBecause the very next example that's often given is that\n8:39\nthey'll say, look.\n8:40\nA clean room-- let's say your bedroom is clean, and then it\n8:45\nbecomes dirty.\n8:45\nAnd they'll say, look.\n8:46\nThe universe became more disordered.\n8:48\nThe dirty room has more disorder than the clean room.\n8:53\nAnd this is not a case of entropy increase.\n8:56\nSo this is not a good example.\n9:01\nWhy is that?\n9:04\nBecause clean and dirty are just states of the room.\n9:07\nRemember, entropy is a macro state variable.\n9:14\nIt's something you use to describe a system where you're\n9:16\nnot in the mood to sit there and tell me what exactly every\n9:19\nparticle is doing.\n9:20\nAnd this is a macro variable that actually tells me how\n9:23\nmuch time would it take for me to tell you what every\n9:27\nparticle is doing.\n9:28\nIt actually tells you how many states there are, or how much\n9:30\ninformation I would have to give you to tell\n9:32\nyou the exact state.\n9:34\nNow, when you have a clean room and a dirty room, these\n9:36\nare two different states of the same room.\n9:39\nIf the room has the same temperature, and it has the\n9:42\nsame number of molecules in it and everything, then they have\n9:46\nthe same entropy.\n9:47\nSo clean to dirty, it's not more entropy.\n9:49\nNow, for example, I could have a dirty, cold room.\n9:58\nAnd let's say I were to go into that room and, you know,\n10:01\nI work really hard to clean it up.\n10:03\nAnd by doing so, I add a lot of heat to the system, and my\n10:06\nsweat molecules drop all over the place, and so there's just\n10:09\nmore stuff in that room, and it's all warmed up to me-- so\n10:13\nto a hot, clean room with sweat in it-- so it's got more\n10:22\nstuff in here that can be configured in more ways, and\n10:25\nbecause it's hot, every molecule in the room can take\n10:28\non more states, right?\n10:29\nBecause the average kinetic energy is up, so they can kind\n10:32\nof explore the spaces of how many kinetic energies it can\n10:36\nhave. There's more potential energies that each molecule\n10:39\ncan take on.\n10:40\nThis is actually an increase in entropy.\n10:42\nFrom a dirty, cold room to a hot, clean room.\n10:45\nAnd this actually goes well with what we know.\n10:47\nI mean, when I go into room and I start cleaning it, I am\n10:50\nin putting heat into the room.\n10:52\nAnd the universe is becoming more-- I guess we could say\n10:55\nit's the entropy is increasing.\n10:57\nSo where does the term disorder apply?\n11:03\nWell, let's take a situation where I take a ball.\n11:07\nI take a ball, and it falls to the ground.\n11:10\nAnd then it hits the ground.\n11:12\nAnd there should have been a question that you've been\n11:14\nasking all the time, since the first law of thermodynamics.\n11:20\nSo the ball hits the ground, right?\n11:21\nIt got thrown up, it had some potential energy at the top,\n11:24\nthen that all gets turned into kinetic energy and it hits the\n11:26\nground, and then it stops.\n11:28\nAnd so your obvious question is, what happened to all that\n11:30\nenergy, right?\n11:31\nLaw of conservation of energy.\n11:33\nWhere did all of it go?\n11:34\nIt had all that kinetic energy right before it hit the\n11:35\nground, then it stopped.\n11:37\nRight?\n11:37\nIt seems like it disappeared.\n11:39\nBut it didn't disappear.\n11:40\nSo when the ball was falling, it had a bunch of-- you know,\n11:44\neverything had a little bit of heat.\n11:45\nBut let's say the ground was reasonably ordered.\n11:51\nThe ground molecules were vibrating with some kinetic\n11:56\nenergy and potential energies.\n11:58\nAnd then our ball molecules were also\n12:00\nvibrating a little bit.\n12:02\nBut most of their motion was downwards, right?\n12:06\nMost of the ball molecules' motion was downwards.\n12:09\nNow, when it hits the ground, what happens-- let me show you\n12:12\nthe interface of the ball.\n12:14\nSo the ball molecules at the front of the ball are going to\n12:17\nlook like that.\n12:19\nAnd there's a bunch of them.\n12:20\nIt's a solid.\n12:21\nIt will maybe be some type of lattice.\n12:24\nAnd then it hits the ground.\n12:25\nAnd when it hits the ground-- so the ground is another solid\n12:30\nlike that-- All right, we're looking at the microstate.\n12:35\nWhat's going to happen?\n12:37\nThese guys are going to rub up against these guys, and\n12:39\nthey're going to transfer their-- what was downward\n12:41\nkinetic energy, and a very ordered downward kinetic\n12:45\nenergy-- they're going to transfer it to\n12:47\nthese ground particles.\n12:49\nAnd they're going to bump into the ground particles.\n12:50\nAnd so when this guy bumps into that guy, he might start\n12:54\nmoving in that direction.\n12:55\nThis guy will start oscillating in that direction,\n12:57\nand go back and forth like that.\n12:59\nThat guy might bounce off of this guy, and go in that\n13:02\ndirection, and bump into that guy, and\n13:04\ngo into that direction.\n13:05\nAnd then, because that guy bumped here, this guy bumps\n13:09\nhere, and because this guy bumps here, this guy bumps\n13:11\nover there.\n13:12\nAnd so what you have is, what was relatively ordered motion,\n13:16\nespecially from the ball's point of view, when it starts\n13:19\nrubbing up against these molecules of the ground, it\n13:22\nstarts making the kinetic energy, or their movement, go\n13:24\nin all sorts of random directions.\n13:26\nRight?\n13:27\nThis guy's going to make this guy go like that, and that guy\n13:29\ngo like that.\n13:30\nAnd so when the movement is no longer ordered, if I have a\n13:33\nlot of molecules-- let me do it in a different color-- if I\n13:36\nhave a lot of molecules, and they're all moving in the\n13:38\nexact same direction, then my micro state looks like my\n13:41\nmacro state.\n13:42\nThe whole thing moves in that direction.\n13:44\nNow, if I have a bunch of molecules, and they're all\n13:47\nmoving in random directions, my ball as a whole will be\n13:51\nstationary.\n13:52\nI could have the exact same amount of kinetic energy at\n13:54\nthe molecular level, but they're all going to be\n13:56\nbouncing into each other.\n13:58\nAnd in this case, we described the kinetic energy as internal\n14:02\nenergy, or we describe it as temperature, where temperature\n14:06\nis the average kinetic energy.\n14:07\nSo in this case, when we talk about, the world is becoming\n14:10\nmore disordered, you think about the order of maybe the\n14:13\nvelocities or the energies of the molecules.\n14:16\nBefore they were reasonably ordered, the molecules-- they\n14:18\nmight have been vibrating a little bit, but they were\n14:20\nmainly going down in the ball.\n14:22\nBut when they bump into the ground, all of a sudden they\n14:24\nstart vibrating in random directions a little bit more.\n14:26\nAnd they make the ground vibrate in more random\n14:28\ndirections.\n14:29\nSo it makes-- at the microstate-- everything became\n14:32\njust that much more disordered.\n14:36\nNow there's an interesting question here.\n14:37\nThere is some probability you might think-- Look, this ball\n14:41\ncame down and hit the ground.\n14:43\nWhy doesn't the ball just-- isn't there some probability\n14:46\nthat if I have a ground, that these molecules just rearrange\n14:50\nthemselves in just the right way to just hit these ball\n14:56\nmolecules in just the right way?\n14:58\nThere's some probability, just from the random movement, that\n15:00\nat get some second, all the ground molecules just hit the\n15:04\nball molecules just right to send the ball back up.\n15:08\nAnd the answer is yes.\n15:10\nThere's actually some infinitesimally small chance\n15:13\nthat that happens.\n15:14\nThat you could have a ball that's sitting on the ground--\n15:16\nand this is interesting-- could have a ball that's\n15:19\nsitting on the ground, and while you're looking, you'll\n15:21\nprobably have to wait a few gazillion years for it to\n15:24\nhappen, if it happens at all-- it could just randomly pop up.\n15:28\nAnd there's some random, very small chance that these\n15:33\nmolecules just randomly vibrate in just the right way\n15:36\nto be ordered for a second, and then the ball will pop up.\n15:39\nBut the probability of this happening, relative to\n15:43\neverything else, is essentially 0.\n15:46\nSo when people talk about order and disorder, the\n15:49\ndisorder is increasing, because now these molecules\n15:52\nare going in more random directions, and they can take\n15:54\non more potential states.\n15:57\nAnd we saw that here.\n15:59\nAnd you know, on some level, entropy seems something kind\n16:01\nof magical, but on some level, it seems\n16:04\nrelatively common sense.\n16:06\nIn that video-- I think was the last video-- I had a case\n16:10\nwhere I had a bunch of molecules, and then I had this\n16:13\nextra space here, and then I removed the wall.\n16:18\nAnd we saw that these molecules will-- we know,\n16:23\nthere's always some modules that are bouncing off this\n16:26\nwall before, because we probably had some pressure\n16:28\nassociated with it.\n16:29\nAnd then as soon as we remove that wall, the molecule that\n16:31\nwould have bounced there just keeps going.\n16:34\nThere's nothing to stop it from there.\n16:36\nIn that direction, there's a lot of stuff.\n16:37\nIt could bump into other molecules, and it could\n16:39\nbumping into these walls.\n16:40\nBut in this direction, the odds of it bumping into\n16:42\neverything is, especially for these leading molecules, is\n16:45\nessentially 0.\n16:45\nSo it's going to expand to fill the container.\n16:48\nSo that's kind of common sense.\n16:50\nBut the neat thing is that the second law of thermodynamics,\n16:53\nas we saw in that video, also says that this will happen.\n16:57\nThat the molecules will all expand to fill the container.\n17:00\nAnd that the odds of this happening are very low.\n17:05\nThat they all come back and go into a ordered state.\n17:11\nNow there is some chance, just from the random movements once\n17:13\nthey fill, that they all just happen to come back here.\n17:15\nBut it's a very, very small probability.\n17:18\nAnd even more-- and I want to make this very clear-- S is a\n17:22\nmacro state.\n17:25\nWe never talk about the entropy for\n17:28\nan individual molecule.\n17:30\nIf we know what an individual molecule is doing, we\n17:32\nshouldn't be worrying about entropy.\n17:33\nWe should be worrying about the system as a whole.\n17:38\nSo even if we're looking at the system, if we're not\n17:43\nlooking directly at the molecules, we won't even know\n17:45\nthat this actually happened.\n17:48\nAll we can do is look at the statistical\n17:50\nproperties of the molecules.\n17:52\nHow many molecules they are, what their temperature is, all\n17:54\ntheir macro dynamics, the pressure, and\n17:56\nsay, you know what?\n17:57\nA box that has these molecules has more state than a smaller\n18:01\nbox, than the box when we had the wall there.\n18:03\nEven if, by chance, all of the molecules happened to be\n18:06\ncollecting over there, we wouldn't know that that\n18:08\nhappened, because we're not looking at the micro states.\n18:10\nAnd that's a really important thing to consider.\n18:13\nWhen someone says that a dirty room has a higher entropy than\n18:17\na clean room, they're looking at the micro states.\n18:20\nAnd entropy essentially is a macro state variable.\n18:23\nYou could just say that a room has a\n18:24\ncertain amount of entropy.\n18:26\nSo entropy is associated with the room, and it's only useful\n18:32\nwhen you really don't know exactly what's\n18:33\ngoing on in the room.\n18:34\nYou just have a general sense of how much stuff there is in\n18:37\nthe room, what's the temperature of the room,\n18:39\nwhat's the pressure in the room.\n18:40\nJust the general macro properties.\n18:42\nAnd then entropy will essentially tell us how many\n18:45\npossible micro states that macro system can actually\n18:50\nhave. Or how much information-- and there's a\n18:53\nnotion of information entropy-- how much information\n18:56\nwould I have to give you to tell you what the exact micro\n19:00\nstate is of a system at that point in time.\n19:03\nWell anyway.\n19:03\nHopefully you found this discussion a little bit\n19:05\nuseful, and it clears up some misconceptions about entropy,\n19:08\nand gives you a little bit more intuition about what it\n19:11\nactually is.\n19:12\nSee you in the next video.",

Actually, we've even\n1:32\ncome up with this statement over here.\n1:34\nWe can rewrite this over here as the 0 vector is equal to\n1:38\nlambda times my eigenvector minus A times my eigenvector.\n1:43\nI just subtracted Av from both sides.\n1:45\nWe know lambda times some eigenvector is the same thing\n1:48\nas lambda times the identity matrix times that eigenvector.\n1:54\nSo all I'm doing is rewriting this like that.\n1:58\nYou multiply the identity matrix times an eigenvector or\n2:00\ntimes any vector, you're just going to get that vector.\n2:02\nSo these two things are equivalent.\n2:03\nMinus Av.\n2:07\nThat's still going to be able to the 0 vector.\n2:09\nSo far all I've done is manipulated this thing.\n2:11\nThis is really how we got to that thing up there.\n2:15\nYou factor out the v so to speak because we know that\n2:18\nmatrix vector products exhibit the distributive property.\n2:21\nAnd we get lambda times the identity matrix minus A times\n2:28\nmy eigenvector have got to be equal to 0.\n2:33\nOr another way to say it is, for any lambda eigenvalue, and\n2:43\nlet me write it for any eigenvalue lambda, the\n2:51\neigenvectors that correspond to that lambda, we can call\n2:54\nthat the eigenspace for a lambda.\n2:59\nSo that's a new word, eigenspace.\n3:04\nEigenspace just means all of the eigenvectors that\n3:07\ncorrespond to some eigenvalue.\n3:09\nThe eigenspace for some particular eigenvalue is going\n3:16\nto be equal to the set of vectors that\n3:18\nsatisfy this equation.\n3:19\nWell, the set of vectors that satisfy this equation is just\n3:22\nthe null space of that right there.\n3:26\nSo it's equal to the null space of this\n3:29\nmatrix right there.\n3:30\nThe null space of lambda times the identity matrix.\n3:34\nAnd by an identity matrix minus A.\n3:36\nAnd so everything I've done here, this is true-- this is\n3:39\nthe general case.\n3:39\nBut now we can apply this notion to this\n3:42\nmatrix A right here.\n3:44\nSo we know that 5 is an eigenvalue.\n3:48\nLet's say for lambda is equal to 5, the eigenspace that\n3:53\ncorresponds to 5 is equal to the null space of?\n3:59\nWell, what is 5 times the identity matrix?\n4:03\nIt's going to be the 2 by 2 identity matrix.\n4:06\n5 times the identity matrix is just 5, 0, 0, 5 minus A.\n4:15\nThat's just 1, 2, 4, 3.\n4:19\nSo that is equal to the null space of the matrix.\n4:27\n5 minus 1 is 4.\n4:29\n0 minus 2 is minus 2.\n4:32\n0 minus 4 is minus 4.\n4:36\nAnd then, 5 minus 3 is 2.\n4:40\nSo the null space of this matrix right here-- and this\n4:43\nmatrix is just an actual numerical representation of\n4:46\nthis matrix right here.\n4:48\nThe null space of this matrix is the set of all of the\n4:51\nvectors that satisfy this or all of the eigenvectors that\n4:55\ncorrespond to this eigenvalue.\n4:56\nOr, the eigenspace that corresponds to\n4:59\nthe eigenvalue 5.\n5:00\nThese are all equivalent statements.\n5:02\nSo we just need to figure out the null space of this guy is\n5:05\nall of the vectors that satisfy the equation 4 minus\n5:09\n2, minus 4, 2 times some eigenvector is\n5:13\nequal to the 0 vector.\n5:15\nAnd the null space of a matrix is equal to the null space of\n5:19\nthe reduced row echelon form of a matrix.\n5:21\nSo what's the reduced row echelon form of this guy?\n5:24\nWell, I guess a good starting point-- let me keep my first\n5:29\nrow the same, 4 minus 2.\n5:31\nAnd let me replace my second row with my second row\n5:34\nplus my first row.\n5:35\nSo minus 4 plus 4 is 0.\n5:38\n2 plus minus 2 is 0.\n5:40\nNow, let me divide my first row by 4 and I\n5:44\nget 1, minus 1/2.\n5:47\nAnd then I get 0, 0.\n5:49\nSo what's the null space of this?\n5:51\nThis corresponds to v.\n5:53\nThis times v1, v2-- that's just another way of writing my\n5:58\neigenvector v-- has got to be equal to the 0 vector.\n6:03\nOr another way to say it is that my first entry v1, which\n6:08\ncorresponds to this pivot column, plus or minus 1/2\n6:12\ntimes my second entry has got to be equal to\n6:15\nthat 0 right there.\n6:17\nOr, v1 is equal to 1/2 v2.\n6:24\nAnd so if I wanted to write all of the eigenvectors that\n6:27\nsatisfy this, I could write it this way.\n6:29\nMy eigenspace that corresponds to lambda equals 5.\n6:35\nThat corresponds to the eigenvalue 5 is equal to the\n6:39\nset of all of the vectors, v1, v2, that are equal to some\n6:48\nscaling factor.\n6:49\nLet's say it's equal to t times what?\n6:53\nIf we say that v2 is equal to t, so v2 is going to be equal\n6:58\nto t times 1.\n7:01\nAnd then, v1 is going to be equal to 1/2 times v2\n7:05\nor 1/2 times t.\n7:09\nJust like that.\n7:13\nFor any t is a member of the real numbers.\n7:16\nIf we wanted to, we could scale this up.\n7:17\nWe could say any real number times 1, 2.\n7:20\nThat would also be the span.\n7:23\nLet me do that actually.\n7:24\nIt'll make it a little bit cleaner.\n7:26\nActually, I don't have to do that.\n7:27\nSo we could write that the eigenspace for the eigenvalue\n7:32\n5 is equal to the span of the vector 1/2 and 1.\n7:42\nSo it's a line in R2.\n7:44\nThose are all of the eigenvectors that satisfy--\n7:47\nthat work for the equation where the\n7:48\neigenvalue is equal to 5.\n7:51\nNow what about when the eigenvalue is\n7:53\nequal to minus 1?\n7:59\nSo let's do that case.\n8:00\nWhen lambda is equal to minus 1, then we have-- it's going\n8:07\nto be the null space.\n8:09\nSo the eigenspace for lambda is equal to minus 1 is going\n8:13\nto be the null space of lambda times our identity matrix,\n8:18\nwhich is going to be minus 1 and 0, 0, minus 1.\n8:23\nIt's going to be minus 1 times 1, 0, 0, 1, which is just\n8:26\nminus 1 there.\n8:27\nMinus A.\n8:28\nSo minus 1, 2, 4, 3.\n8:33\nAnd this is equal to the null space of-- minus 1,\n8:37\nminus 1 is minus 2.\n8:40\n0 minus 2 is minus 2.\n8:43\n0 minus 4 is minus 4 and minus 1 minus 3 is minus 4.\n8:49\nAnd that's going to be equal to the null space of the\n8:51\nreduced row echelon form of that guy.\n8:53\nSo we can perform some row operations right here.\n8:56\nLet me just put it in reduced row echelon form.\n8:59\nSo if I replace my second row plus 2 times my first row.\n9:06\nSo I'll keep the first row the same.\n9:08\nMinus 2, minus 2.\n9:09\nAnd then my second row, I'll replace it with two times--\n9:11\nI'll replace it with it plus 2 times the first. Or even\n9:14\nbetter, I'm going to replace it with it plus minus 2 times\n9:17\nthe first. So minus 4 plus 4 is 0.\n9:23\nAnd then if I divide the top row by minus 2, the reduced\n9:26\nrow echelon form of this matrix right here or this\n9:30\nmatrix right here is going to be 1, 1, 0.\n9:34\nSo the eigenspace that corresponds to the eigenvalue\n9:38\nminus 1 is equal to the null space of this guy right here\n9:48\nIt's the set of vectors that satisfy this\n9:50\nequation: 1, 1, 0, 0.\n9:54\nAnd then you have v1, v2 is equal to 0.\n9:59\nOr you get v1 plus-- these aren't vectors,\n10:02\nthese are just values.\n10:04\nv1 plus v2 is equal to 0.\n10:10\nBecause 0 is just equal to that thing right there.\n10:14\nSo 1 times v1 plus 1 times v2 is going to be equal to that 0\n10:17\nright there.\n10:18\nOr I could write v1 is equal to minus v2.\n10:21\nOr if we say that v2 is equal to t, we could say v1 is equal\n10:28\nto minus t.\n10:30\nOr we could say that the eigenspace for the eigenvalue\n10:34\nminus 1 is equal to all of the vectors, v1, v2 that are equal\n10:41\nto some scalar t times v1 is minus t and v2 is plus t.\n10:50\nOr you could say this is equal to the span of the vector\n10:54\nminus 1 and 1.\n10:56\nSo let's just graph this a little bit just to understand\n10:59\nwhat we just did.\n11:00\nWe were able to find two eigenvalues for\n11:02\nthis, 5 and minus 1.\n11:05\nAnd we were able to find all of the vectors that are\n11:08\nessentially-- or, we were able to find the set of vectors\n11:11\nthat are the eigenvectors that correspond to each of these\n11:14\neigenvalues.\n11:15\nSo let's graph them.\n11:16\nSo if we go to R2, let me draw my axes, this\n11:19\nis my vertical axis.\n11:22\nThat's my horizontal axis.\n11:26\nSo all of the vectors that correspond to lambda equal 5\n11:30\nare along the line 1/2, 1.\n11:33\nOr the span of 1/2, 1.\n11:35\nSo that is 1.\n11:37\nThat is 1.\n11:38\nSo you go 1/2 and 1 just like that.\n11:42\nSo that's that vector, spanning vector.\n11:46\nBut anything along the span of this, all the multiples of\n11:49\nthis, are going to be valid eigenvectors.\n11:52\nSo anything along that line, all of the vectors when you\n11:55\ndraw them in standard position, point to a\n11:56\npoint on that line.\n11:59\nAll of these vectors, any vector on there is going to be\n12:01\na valid eigenvector and the corresponding eigenvalue is\n12:05\ngoing to be equal to 5.\n12:07\nSo you give me this guy right here.\n12:11\nWhen you apply the transformation, it's going to\n12:13\nbe five times this guy.\n12:18\nIf this guy is x, t of x is going to be\n12:21\nfive times this guy.\n12:22\nWhatever vector you give along this line, the transformation\n12:25\nof that guy, the transformation is literally,\n12:27\nmultiplying it by the matrix A.\n12:31\nWhere did I have the matrix A?\n12:32\nThe matrix A right up there.\n12:34\nYou're essentially just scaling this guy by 5 in\n12:36\neither direction.\n12:37\nThis is for lambda equal 5.\n12:40\nAnd for lambda equals 1, it's the span of this vector, which\n12:44\nis minus 1, 1.\n12:48\nWhich looks like this.\n12:51\nSo this vector looks like that.\n12:53\nWe care about the span of it.\n12:58\nAny vector that when you draw in standard position lies, or\n13:01\npoints to, points on this line, will be an eigenvector\n13:05\nfor the eigenvalue minus 1.\n13:08\nSo lambda equals minus 1.\n13:11\nLet's say you take the spanning vector here.\n13:13\nYou apply the transformation, you're going to get\n13:16\nminus 1 times it.\n13:17\nSo if this is x, the transformation of x is going\n13:20\nto be that right there.\n13:21\nSame length, just in the opposite direction.\n13:23\nIf you have this guy right here, you apply the\n13:26\ntransformation, it's going to be in the same spanning line\n13:29\njust like that.\n13:30\nSo the two eigenspaces for the matrix-- where did I write it?\n13:35\nI think it was the matrix 1, 2, 3-- 1, 2, 4, 3.\n13:40\nThe two eigenvalues were 5 and minus 1.\n13:45\nAnd then it has an infinite number of eigenvectors, so\n13:48\nthey actually create two eigenspaces.\n13:50\nEach of them correspond to one of the eigenvalues.\n13:54\nAnd these lines represent those two eigenspaces.\n13:57\nYou give me any vector in either of these sets and\n13:59\nthey're going to be an eigenvector.\n14:02\nI'm using the word vector too much.\n14:03\nYou give me any vector in either of these sets, and they\n14:05\nwill be an eigenvector for our matrix A.\n14:08\nAnd then, depending on which line it is, we know what their\n14:10\ntransformation is going to be.\n14:11\nIf it's going to be on this guy, we take the\n14:13\ntransformation, the resulting vector's going to be five\n14:16\ntimes the vector.\n14:17\nIf you take one of these eigenvectors and you transform\n14:20\nit, the resulting transformation of the vector's\n14:22\ngoing to be minus 1 times that vector.\n14:25\nAnyway, we now know what eigenvalues, eigenvectors,\n14:28\neigenspaces are.\n14:30\nAnd even better, we know how to actually find them.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWelcome back.\n0:01\nAt the end of the last video, I left you\n0:02\nwith a bit of a question.\n0:03\nWe had a situation where we had a 1 kilogram object.\n0:08\nThis is the 1 kilogram object, which I've drawn neater in\n0:11\nthis video.\n0:12\nThat is 1 kilogram.\n0:15\nAnd we're on earth, and I need to mention that because\n0:20\ngravity is different from planet to planet.\n0:22\nBut as I mentioned, I'm holding it.\n0:24\nLet's say I'm holding it 10 meters above the ground.\n0:27\nSo this distance or this height is 10 meters.\n0:34\nAnd we're assuming the acceleration of gravity, which\n0:39\nwe also write as just g, let's assume it's just 10 meters per\n0:42\nsecond squared just for the simplicity of the math instead\n0:44\nof the 9.8.\n0:45\nSo what we learned in the last video is that the potential\n0:48\nenergy in this situation, the potential energy, which equals\n0:53\nm times g times h is equal to the mass is 1 kilogram times\n0:59\nthe acceleration of gravity, which is 10\n1:02\nmeters per second squared.\n1:03\nI'm not going to write the units down just to save space,\n1:05\nalthough you should do this when you do it on your test.\n1:08\nAnd then the height is 10 meters.\n1:11\nAnd the units, if you work them all out, it's in newton\n1:13\nmeters or joules and so it's equal to 100 joules.\n1:17\nThat's the potential energy when I'm holding it up there.\n1:20\nAnd I asked you, well when I let go, what happens?\n1:22\nWell the block obviously will start falling.\n1:24\nAnd not only falling, it will start accelerating to the\n1:26\nground at 10 meters per second squared roughly.\n1:29\nAnd right before it hits the ground-- let me draw that in\n1:33\nbrown for ground-- right before the object hits the\n1:38\nground or actually right when it hits the ground, what will\n1:43\nbe the potential energy of the object?\n1:46\nWell it has no height, right?\n1:48\nPotential energy is mgh.\n1:49\nThe mass and the acceleration of gravity stay the same, but\n1:51\nthe height is 0.\n1:52\nSo they're all multiplied by each other.\n1:54\nSo down here, the potential energy is going\n1:56\nto be equal to 0.\n1:58\nAnd I told you in the last video that we have the law of\n2:00\nconservation of energy.\n2:01\nThat energy is conserved.\n2:02\nIt cannot be created or destroyed.\n2:04\nIt can just be converted from one form to another.\n2:06\nBut I'm just showing you, this object had 100 joules of\n2:10\nenergy or, in this case,\n2:12\ngravitational potential energy.\n2:13\nAnd down here, it has no energy.\n2:16\nOr at least it has no gravitational potential\n2:18\nenergy, and that's the key.\n2:20\nThat gravitational potential energy was converted into\n2:22\nsomething else.\n2:23\nAnd that something else it was converted\n2:25\ninto is kinetic energy.\n2:28\nAnd in this case, since it has no potential energy, all of\n2:32\nthat previous potential energy, all of this 100 joules\n2:35\nthat it has up here is now going to be converted into\n2:39\nkinetic energy.\n2:40\nAnd we can use that information to figure out its\n2:43\nvelocity right before it hits the ground.\n2:46\nSo how do we do that?\n2:47\nWell what's the formula for kinetic energy?\n2:49\nAnd we solved it two videos ago, and hopefully it\n2:52\nshouldn't be too much of a mystery to you.\n2:53\nIt's something good to memorize, but it's also good\n2:55\nto know how we got it and go back two videos if you forgot.\n3:01\nSo first we know that all the potential energy was converted\n3:05\ninto kinetic energy.\n3:07\nWe had 100 joules of potential energy, so we're still going\n3:10\nto have 100 joules, but now all of it's going to be\n3:12\nkinetic energy.\n3:13\nAnd kinetic energy is 1/2 mv squared.\n3:17\nSo we know that 1/2 mv squared, or the kinetic\n3:21\nenergy, is now going to equal 100 joules.\n3:24\nWhat's the mass?\n3:25\nThe mass is 1.\n3:27\nAnd we can solve for v now.\n3:29\n1/2 v squared equals 100 joules, and v\n3:31\nsquared is equal to 200.\n3:36\nAnd then we get v is equal to square root of 200, which is\n3:39\nsomething over 14.\n3:40\nWe can get the exact number.\n3:41\nLet's see, 200 square root, 14.1 roughly.\n3:46\nThe velocity is going to be 14.1 meters per\n3:51\nsecond squared downwards.\n3:52\nRight before the object touches the ground.\n3:55\nRight before it touches the ground.\n3:56\nAnd you might say, well Sal that's nice and everything.\n3:59\nWe learned a little bit about energy.\n4:01\nI could have solved that or hopefully you could have\n4:02\nsolved that problem just using your kinematics formula.\n4:04\nSo what's the whole point of introducing\n4:07\nthese concepts of energy?\n4:09\nAnd I will now show you.\n4:11\nSo let's say they have the same 1 kilogram object up here\n4:14\nand it's 10 meters in the air, but I'm going to change things\n4:17\na little bit.\n4:20\nLet me see if I can competently erase all of this.\n4:24\nNope, that's not what I wanted to do.\n4:29\nOK, there you go.\n4:31\nI'm trying my best to erase this, all of this stuff.\n4:37\nOK.\n4:38\nSo I have the same object.\n4:40\nIt's still 10 meters in the air and I'll\n4:43\nwrite that in a second.\n4:45\nAnd I'm just holding it there and I'm still going to drop\n4:47\nit, but something interesting is going to happen.\n4:50\nInstead of it going straight down, it's actually going to\n4:51\ndrop on this ramp of ice.\n4:57\nThe ice has lumps on it.\n5:01\nAnd then this is the bottom.\n5:02\nThis is the ground down here.\n5:04\nThis is the ground.\n5:07\nSo what's going to happen this time?\n5:09\nI'm still 10 meters in the air, so let me draw that.\n5:11\nThat's still 10 meters.\n5:12\nI should switch colors just so not everything is ice.\n5:15\nSo that's still 10 meters, but instead of the object going\n5:18\nstraight down now, it's going to go down here and then start\n5:21\nsliding, right?\n5:21\nIt's going to go sliding along this hill.\n5:24\nAnd then at this point it's going to be going really fast\n5:27\nin the horizontal direction.\n5:29\nAnd right now we don't know how fast.\n5:31\nAnd just using our kinematics formula, this would have been\n5:34\na really tough formula.\n5:35\nThis would have been difficult.\n5:38\nI mean you could have attempted it and it actually\n5:40\nwould have taken calculus because the angle of the slope\n5:42\nchanges continuously.\n5:44\nWe don't even know the formula for the angle of the slope.\n5:46\nYou would have had to break it out into vectors.\n5:48\nYou would have to do all sorts of complicated things.\n5:49\nThis would have been a nearly impossible problem.\n5:52\nBut using energy, we can actually figure out what the\n5:55\nvelocity of this object is at this point.\n5:58\nAnd we use the same idea.\n6:00\nHere we have 100 joules of potential energy.\n6:03\nWe just figured that out.\n6:05\nDown here, what's the height above the ground?\n6:07\nWell the height is 0.\n6:08\nSo all the potential energy has disappeared.\n6:10\nAnd just like in the previous situation, all of the\n6:13\npotential energy is now converted into kinetic energy.\n6:16\nAnd so what is that kinetic energy going to equal?\n6:18\nIt's going to be equal to the initial potential energy.\n6:21\nSo here the kinetic energy is equal to 100 joules.\n6:27\nAnd that equals 1/2 mv squared, just\n6:30\nlike we just solved.\n6:31\nAnd if you solve for v, the mass is 1 kilogram.\n6:34\nSo the velocity in the horizontal direction will be,\n6:39\nif you solve for it, 14.1 meters per second.\n6:42\nInstead of going straight down, now it's going to be\n6:44\ngoing in the horizontal to the right.\n6:47\nAnd the reason why I said it was ice is because I wanted\n6:49\nthis to be frictionless and I didn't want any energy lost to\n6:52\nheat or anything like that.\n6:53\nAnd you might say OK Sal, that's kind of interesting.\n6:56\nAnd you kind of got the same number for the velocity than\n6:59\nif I just dropped the object straight down.\n7:01\nAnd that's interesting.\n7:02\nBut what else can this do for me?\n7:07\nAnd this is where it's really cool.\n7:10\nNot only can I figure out the velocity when all of the\n7:15\npotential energy has disappeared, but I can figure\n7:17\nout the velocity of any point-- and this is\n7:19\nfascinating-- along this slide.\n7:21\nSo let's say when the box is sliding down here, so let's\n7:25\nsay the box is at this point.\n7:29\nIt changes colors too as it falls.\n7:31\nSo this is the 1 kilogram box, right?\n7:34\nIt falls and it slides down here.\n7:35\nAnd let's say at this point it's height above the ground\n7:40\nis 5 meters.\n7:42\nSo what's its potential energy here?\n7:44\nSo let's just write something.\n7:45\nAll of the energy is conserved, right?\n7:47\nSo the initial potential energy plus the initial\n7:51\nkinetic energy is equal to the final potential energy plus\n7:57\nthe final kinetic energy.\n7:59\nI'm just saying energy is conserved here.\n8:02\nUp here, what's the initial total energy in the system?\n8:05\nWell the potential energy is 100 and the kinetic energy is\n8:08\n0 because it's stationary.\n8:10\nI haven't dropped it.\n8:11\nI haven't let go of it yet.\n8:13\nIt's just stationary.\n8:14\nSo the initial energy is going to be equal to 100 joules.\n8:18\nThat's cause this is 0 and this is 100.\n8:20\nSo the initial energy is 100 joules.\n8:22\nAt this point right here, what's the potential energy?\n8:27\nWell we're 5 meters up, so mass times\n8:32\ngravity times height.\n8:32\nMass is 1, times gravity, 10 meters per second squared.\n8:36\nTimes height, times 5.\n8:39\nSo it's 50 joules.\n8:40\nThat's our potential energy at this point.\n8:43\nAnd then we must have some kinetic energy with the\n8:47\nvelocity going roughly in that direction.\n8:48\nPlus our kinetic energy at this point.\n8:51\nAnd we know that no energy was destroyed.\n8:54\nIt's just converted.\n8:55\nSo we know the total energy still has to be 100 joules.\n8:59\nSo essentially what happened, and if we solve for this--\n9:01\nit's very easy, subtract 50 from both sides-- we know that\n9:03\nthe kinetic energy is now also going to\n9:06\nbe equal to 50 joules.\n9:07\nSo what happened?\n9:07\nHalfway down, essentially half of the potential energy got\n9:12\nconverted to kinetic energy.\n9:14\nAnd we can use this information that the kinetic\n9:16\nenergy is 50 joules to figure out the\n9:18\nvelocity at this point.\n9:20\n1/2 mv squared is equal to 50.\n9:24\nThe mass is 1.\n9:26\nMultiply both sides by 2.\n9:27\nYou get v squared is equal to 100.\n9:30\nThe velocity is 10 meters per second along\n9:34\nthis crazy, icy slide.\n9:37\nAnd that is something that I would have challenged you to\n9:39\nsolve using traditional kinematics formulas,\n9:42\nespecially considering that we don't know really much about\n9:46\nthe surface of this slide.\n9:49\nAnd even if we did, that would have been a million times\n9:51\nharder than just using the law of conservation of energy and\n9:55\nrealizing that at this point, half the potential energy is\n9:58\nnow kinetic energy and it's going along the\n10:00\ndirection of the slide.\n10:02\nI will see you in the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Instructor] Let's get some practice now thinking\n0:01\nabout how ions typically form,\n0:03\nhow they might form compounds\n0:05\nand how we name those compounds.\n0:08\nSo let's start with something in group one.\n0:12\nIn this first column, this first column is often known\n0:15\nas alkali metals.\n0:17\nSo let's start with potassium.\n0:19\nK is the symbol for potassium.\n0:23\nNow things in group one here,\n0:25\none way to think about is their outermost shell\n0:27\nhas one electron in it.\n0:29\nSo they wouldn't mind losing that electron.\n0:32\nSo when they ionize, they tend to lose an electron\n0:35\nand become a cation, a positive ion.\n0:39\nAnd so let's look at a situation where I have some potassium\n0:44\nthat has been ionized.\n0:47\nI could write it just like this,\n0:49\nwe've seen that in previous videos\n0:51\nand we can refer to this just as a potassium ion,\n0:54\nwe could refer to this as potassium one plus.\n0:57\nWe could refer to this as a potassium cation.\n1:02\nNow let's go on to the other side of the periodic table.\n1:05\nThings that would really love to grab an electron.\n1:09\nSo things in group, in the halides,\n1:14\nwhich is this column right over here.\n1:17\nSo these are the halides.\n1:20\nThey have seven electrons in their outermost shell.\n1:23\nThey would love to have eight,\n1:25\nso they tend to be really good at grabbing electrons.\n1:29\nAnd so let's say we're dealing with chlorine,\n1:31\nand chlorine is able to ionize.\n1:34\nSo it's able to grab an electron.\n1:36\nWhen chlorine grabs an electron,\n1:39\nit will be a negatively charged ion,\n1:42\nso you could write it as Chlorine one minus,\n1:46\nbut the way that we generally refer to an anion,\n1:50\na negatively charged ion,\n1:53\ninstead of just calling this the chlorine anion,\n1:56\nwe would call this chloride.\n1:59\nSo this we would refer to as Chloride.\n2:05\nNow as you can imagine with potassium having\n2:08\na positive one charge or one plus charge\n2:10\nand this having a negative charge,\n2:12\nthey're going to be attracted to each other\n2:14\nand they can actually form an ionic compound.\n2:18\nThe ionic compound they would form, we would write\n2:22\nas, you'd write your positive ion first\n2:25\nand then you would write your negative ion.\n2:28\nAnd this right over here would be described\n2:32\nas potassium chloride.\n2:34\nLet me write that down.\n2:36\nPotassium, potassium chloride.\n2:43\nNow you might be saying, \"Well, I just,\"\n2:46\nLet me rewrite the whole thing.\n2:48\nSo you know the chloride part, you say okay,\n2:50\nthis is going to be an anion\n2:52\nbecause instead of writing chlorine\n2:54\nwhich is the name of this element,\n2:56\nI wrote this IDE at the end\n2:58\nto say, \"Hey, this is an anion,\"\n3:00\nso I know that this is the chlorine anion, this is chloride,\n3:04\nwhy didn't I do something similar for potassium?\n3:07\nWell, the way the convention works\n3:09\nis if someone says potassium chloride,\n3:11\nyou know you're dealing with an ionic compound\n3:14\nand if the chlorine has a negative one charge,\n3:16\nan ionic compound,\n3:17\nthe whole thing is gonna be neutral.\n3:19\nSo if this one over here is one minus,\n3:23\nthen you know this over here is just one-for-one,\n3:26\nthis is going to be one plus\n3:29\nso you know that you're dealing with a potassium cation\n3:33\nand you could say and a chloride ion or a chlorine anion.\n3:38\nYou could refer to it various ways,\n3:40\nbut this is potassium chloride.\n3:42\nYou have a positively charged potassium\n3:45\nand you have a negatively charged chlorine,\n3:47\nwhich we would call a chloride.\n3:50\nIn the next few videos I'll do many, many more examples\n3:52\nof this and ones that will be a little bit more complicated.",

gonna rotate again,\n0:31\nand now we have an eclipsed confirmation.\n0:34\nI rotate again, and now we have a staggered\n0:38\nconfirmation of ethane.\n0:40\nI rotate another 60 degrees,\n0:42\nand we get an eclipsed confirmation.\n0:45\nI rotate again, and we get a staggered,\n0:48\nand you get the idea.\n0:49\nOne more rotation, and we get back\n0:51\nto an eclipsed confirmation.\n0:54\nHere we have a graph of the potential energies\n0:57\nof the confirmations that we just saw in the video.\n0:59\nSo we started out right here\n1:01\nwith this eclipsed confirmation of ethane,\n1:03\nso we are at this particular potential energy.\n1:06\nAs we rotate to get to this staggered confirmation,\n1:10\nyou can see there's a decrease in potential energy.\n1:13\nSo this staggered confirmation has a lower\n1:16\npotential energy than the eclipsed confirmation.\n1:19\nWe rotate again, we get back up here\n1:21\nto this eclipsed confirmation.\n1:22\nNotice that takes energy.\n1:24\nSo it takes energy to go from this staggered\n1:26\nconfirmation to this eclipsed confirmation.\n1:30\nGoing from the eclipsed to the staggered,\n1:31\nthat's a decrease in energy.\n1:33\nGoing from staggered up to this eclipsed,\n1:35\nthat's an increase in energy.\n1:37\nGoing from the eclipsed down to the staggered\n1:39\nagain is a decrease, and finally,\n1:40\nback to the original eclipsed confirmation\n1:43\nwould be an increase in energy.\n1:45\nNotice that all of our eclipsed confirmations here\n1:49\nhave the same potential energy.\n1:51\nIf I draw a line, this is all the same potential energy.\n1:54\nWhoops, I didn't draw a very nice line there,\n1:56\nbut you get the idea.\n1:57\nTherefore, we say that these are degenerate\n2:00\nin terms of energy.\n2:02\nSame thing for the staggered confirmations.\n2:04\nAll of these staggered confirmations,\n2:06\nif I draw a line in here,\n2:07\nhave the same potential energy.\n2:10\nSo the staggered confirmations\n2:13\nare lower in energy than the eclipsed confirmations.\n2:17\nActually, the difference is 12 kilojoules per mole.\n2:21\nSo if I write that in here,\n2:22\nso 12 kilojoules per mole,\n2:25\nthat's talking about the difference in energy\n2:28\nbetween the eclipsed confirmations\n2:30\nand the staggered confirmations.\n2:33\nLower in energy means more stable.\n2:36\nThe easy way of thinking about that\n2:38\nis imagine these things as hills,\n2:41\nif I have a boulder, or a rock, or something\n2:43\ndown here at the bottom of the hill\n2:45\nand I'm comparing that boulder or rock\n2:47\nup here to a boulder at the top of the hill.\n2:50\nIn physics, you can set your potential energy\n2:52\nequal to zero at the ground.\n2:54\nSo let's say that this is ground level.\n2:56\nI say my potential energy, U,\n2:58\nis equal to zero joules at this point.\n3:01\nAnd so the boulder in this valley here,\n3:03\nlet's say it's 10 joules.\n3:05\nLet's say this is 10 joules here at this point.\n3:08\nAnd then it would take energy to push this boulder\n3:10\nup this hill to this point.\n3:13\nLet's say the final potential energy\n3:16\nof the boulder at this point would be 22 joules.\n3:19\nIt takes energy in order to do that.\n3:21\nThis final position is less stable,\n3:25\nand this is the higher potential energy.\n3:28\nSo higher in potential energy means less stable.\n3:32\nLower in potential energy means more stable.\n3:36\nSo why do we have a difference in energy\n3:37\nbetween the staggered and the eclipsed confirmation?\n3:40\nWell this is called torsional strain.\n3:43\nSo this difference in energy,\n3:45\nthis 12 kilojoules per mole,\n3:47\nis called torsional strain.\n3:51\nThe source of torsional strain has been\n3:53\na topic of debate.\n3:55\nOne of the current theories has to do\n3:57\nwith molecular orbital theory.\n3:59\nI'm gonna go with one of the older ones,\n4:01\nwhich talks about the electron pair repulsions.\n4:05\nThe electron pair repulsions are greatest\n4:08\nwhen the bonds are eclipsed.\n4:10\nSo if you think about the electrons\n4:11\nin this bond being close to the electrons\n4:14\nin this bond, and you have that same thing\n4:16\nover here and over here,\n4:18\nso in space, these electron pairs,\n4:20\nthese bonding electron pairs are closer together\n4:23\nin the eclipsed confirmation than they are\n4:25\nin the staggered.\n4:26\nIf I go down here to the staggered,\n4:27\nyou can see if you're thinking about these electron pairs\n4:30\nthey're relatively further away than they are\n4:33\nin the eclipsed confirmation.\n4:34\nWe know that electrons will repel.\n4:37\nSo electron pair repulsions are greatest\n4:39\nwhen the bonds are eclipsed,\n4:41\nand therefore, that's higher energy\n4:43\nand the electron pairs are further away\n4:46\nfrom each other when you're talking about staggered,\n4:48\ntherefore, more stable.\n4:50\nThe total energy cost between the two confirmations\n4:54\nis 12 kilojoules per mole.\n4:57\nWe have three pairs of eclipsed hydrogens.\n5:01\nIf I go back up to here,\n5:02\nhere's one pair of eclipsed hydrogens,\n5:04\nhere's another pair,\n5:05\nand here's another pair.\n5:07\nSo if the total energy is 12 kilojoules per mole,\n5:10\nand I have three pairs of eclipsed hydrogens,\n5:12\nwe could say that the energy cost\n5:14\nfor each pair of eclipsed hydrogens\n5:16\nis four kilojoules per mole.\n5:19\nSo this would be four kilojoules per mole\n5:22\nfor this pair of eclipsed hydrogens,\n5:24\nfour kilojoules per mole for this one,\n5:27\nand four kilojoules per mole for this one,\n5:29\nadding up for a total of 12.\n5:32\nSo our total energy cost is 12,\n5:34\nand now we can think about two hydrogens\n5:36\neclipsing each other as having an energy cost\n5:38\nof four kilojoules per mole.\n5:42\nWe've just seen that the staggered confirmation\n5:44\nof ethane is more stable than the eclipsed\n5:46\nconfirmation of ethane.\n5:47\nIf you want turn a staggered confirmation\n5:50\ninto an eclipsed confirmation,\n5:52\nyou would need energy.\n5:54\nAt room temperature, there's enough energy\n5:56\nfor the staggered confirmation to turn\n5:58\ninto the eclipsed.\n6:00\nEquilibrium is reached between the two confirmations,\n6:04\nand at room temperature, approximately 99%\n6:08\nof ethane molecules have an approximately\n6:11\nstaggered confirmation, whereas only\n6:14\nabout 1% have an eclipsed confirmation.\n6:17\nAgain, that's due to stability.\n6:19\nStaggered is more stable than eclipsed.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] Let's explore the Fluid Mosaic Model\n0:03\nof cell membranes.\n0:05\nNow, why is it called the Fluid Mosaic Model?\n0:08\nWell, if we were to look at a cell membrane\n0:11\nand just to be clear what we're looking at,\n0:12\nif this is a cell right over here,\n0:16\nand this is its membrane,\n0:18\nit's kind of what keeps the cell, the inside of the cell,\n0:21\nseparated from whatever is outside the cell.\n0:24\nWe're looking at a cross-section of its surface,\n0:29\nWhere down here, this is inside the cell.\n0:33\nIf we look at it relative to this diagram,\n0:35\nthis is inside the cell, and this is outside.\n0:39\nAnd when you zoom in,\n0:42\nand this little part right over here,\n0:44\nthis is actually a phospholipid bilayer that forms it.\n0:49\nAnd so when you hear that you might say,\n0:50\nwell, what is a phospholipid?\n0:53\nAnd that's a good question.\n0:54\nBecause when you understand what a phospholipid is,\n0:56\nit starts to make sense why it would form\n0:58\na bilayer like this, and why it's the basis\n1:01\nfor so many membranes in biological systems.\n1:04\nSo this is indicative of a phospholipid\n1:07\nand as its name implies, and let me write that down,\n1:10\nthis is a phospholipid.\n1:14\nIt's a lipid that involves a phosphate group.\n1:17\nAnd in general the word lipid,\n1:19\nand we have a whole video on lipids,\n1:20\nmeans something that doesn't dissolve so well in water.\n1:25\nAnd that's true, as the case of this phospholipid,\n1:27\nyou have these hydrocarbon tails\n1:30\nthat are coming from fatty acids,\n1:32\nand so these hydrocarbon tails,\n1:34\nthey have no obvious charge or no obvious polarity.\n1:37\nWe know that water's a polar molecule\n1:39\nthat's what gives it its hydrogen bonds,\n1:41\nand it's attracted to itself.\n1:43\nBut these don't have those, and so\n1:45\nthey're not going to be attracted to the water\n1:47\nand the water's not going to be attracted to it, to them,\n1:49\nand so these tails are hydrophobic.\n1:52\nSo you have hydrophobic tails,\n1:58\nand these are really kind of\n1:59\nthe lipid part of the phospholipids.\n2:02\nAnd then you have the phosphate head\n2:08\nright over here,\n2:10\nand as you can clearly see, this has some charge.\n2:13\nCharged molecules do well in polar substances like water.\n2:18\nThey're going to dissolve well, and so this part\n2:20\nright over here, is going to be hydrophilic.\n2:26\nAnd actually molecules that have a hydrophilic part\n2:29\nand a hydrophobic part,\n2:31\nthere's a special word for them.\n2:33\nAmphipathic, a word that I sometimes have trouble saying.\n2:37\nSo phospholipids are Amphipathic,\n2:44\nwhich means that they have both a hydrophilic end,\n2:47\na part that is attracted to water,\n2:48\nand a hydrophobic end, that is not attracted to water.\n2:51\nAnd hopefully that starts to explain\n2:53\nwhy they organize themselves in this way.\n2:56\nBecause you could image,\n2:57\nthe hydrophilic heads are going to want to be\n3:00\nwhere the water is, which is going to be either\n3:02\noutside the cell or inside the cells.\n3:04\nAnd the tails are hydrophobic,\n3:07\nthe water's going to go away from them\n3:08\nor they're going to go away from the water\n3:09\nand so they're just going to face each other\n3:11\nand they're going to be on the inside of the membrane.\n3:14\nBut the really cool thing is, a structure like this,\n3:16\nhaving this Amphipathic molecule,\n3:19\nallows things like these bilipid,\n3:21\nthese lipid bilayers, I should say, to form.\n3:25\nAnd it's actually fascinating.\n3:27\nYou would think that if you go far back enough,\n3:29\neven before life in cellular form, formed,\n3:33\nthat you might have had phospholipids spontaneously forming\n3:36\nthese spheres where you have a bilayer, a lipid bilayer.\n3:41\nSo you could imagine something, let me see,\n3:43\nif I drew a cross-section,\n3:45\nlet me see if I can draw it relatively neatly.\n3:48\nSo, I think I'll draw half of it, just because you get,\n3:53\nwell I'll draw the whole thing\n3:54\nand hopefully you get the idea.\n3:56\nSo that would be one layer\n3:59\nof the phosphate heads facing the outside.\n4:02\nThis is the inner layer,\n4:04\nand I'm doing a cross-section right over here.\n4:07\nAnd then you have your hydrophobic tails,\n4:11\nlet me do that in a different color.\n4:14\nSo your hydrophobic tails, I think you get the picture.\n4:18\nWe have a bunch of hydrophobic tails on either end\n4:22\nand then you could spontaneously form a structure like this\n4:24\nwhich starts to feel like, hey,\n4:25\nwell maybe there's a protocell forming.\n4:27\nAnd obviously to actually have real life you have to have\n4:30\nsome form of information that can be passed on,\n4:33\nand you have to have some type of metabolism,\n4:35\nand the cell is living, and all of the definitions of life.\n4:37\nBut at least this basic structure of the cellular membrane\n4:39\nyou could imagine how it forms in a pre-life state even,\n4:45\nby virtue of Amphipathic molecules like a phospholipid.\n4:50\nSo fair enough.\n4:51\nWe're able to form this phospholipid bilayer,\n4:54\nbut what are all these other things that I have drawn here?\n4:57\nWell, these are proteins and these are examples of,\n5:02\nthis is a protein right over here,\n5:03\nthis is a protein, this is a protein,\n5:05\nand I just drew some blobs\n5:08\nto be indicative of the variety of proteins.\n5:10\nBut the important thing to realize is,\n5:12\nif we think of cells, there's all of this diversity.\n5:15\nThere's all of this complexity that is on,\n5:18\nor embedded, inside of its membrane.\n5:20\nSo instead of just thinking of it as just kind of\n5:21\nas a uniform phospholipid bilayer,\n5:24\nthere's all sorts of stuff,\n5:28\nmaybe if we view this as a cross-section,\n5:29\nthere's all sorts of stuff embedded in it\n5:32\nand we see it right over here in this diagram.\n5:36\nYou could say there's a mosaic of things embedded in it.\n5:38\nA mosaic is a picture made up of a bunch of\n5:41\ndifferent components of all different colors,\n5:43\nand you can see that you have all different components here,\n5:45\ndifferent types of proteins.\n5:47\nYou have proteins like this, that go across the membrane.\n5:50\nWe call these transmembrane proteins,\n5:53\nthey're a special class of integral protein.\n5:55\nYou have integral proteins like this,\n5:57\nthat might only interact with one part of the bilayer\n6:00\nwhile these kind of go across it.\n6:03\nYou have things like glycolipids.\n6:06\nSo this right over here, this is a glycolipid,\n6:13\nwhich is fascinating.\n6:14\nIt lodges itself in the membrane\n6:16\nbecause it has this lipid end,\n6:17\nso that's going to be hydrophobic.\n6:19\nIt's going to get along\n6:20\nwith all of the other hydrophobic things,\n6:22\nbut then it has an end that's really a chain of sugars\n6:28\nand that part is going to be hydrophilic,\n6:29\nit's going to sit outside of the cell.\n6:31\nAnd these chains of sugars,\n6:33\nthese are actually key for cell-cell recognition.\n6:36\nYour immune system uses these to differentiate\n6:38\nbetween which cells are the ones\n6:40\nthat are actually from my body,\n6:41\nthe ones I don't want to mess with,\n6:43\nthe ones I want to protect\n6:44\nand which cells are the ones that are foreign,\n6:46\nthe ones that I might want to attack.\n6:47\nWhen people talk about blood type,\n6:49\nthey're talking about, well, what type of\n6:51\nspecific glycolipids do you have on cells.\n6:55\nAnd there's all sorts of, that's not all we're talking about\n6:58\nwhen we talk about glycolipids as a way\n7:02\nfor cells to be recognized,\n7:04\nor to be tagged in different ways.\n7:06\nSo it's a fascinating thing that these chains of sugars\n7:10\ncan lead to such complex behavior, and frankly,\n7:12\nsuch useful behavior, from our point of view.\n7:15\nBut you don't just want to have sugar chains on lipids,\n7:18\nyou also have sugar chains on proteins.\n7:21\nThis, right over here, is an example of a glycoprotein.\n7:27\nAnd as you can see, when you put all this stuff together,\n7:29\nyou get a mosaic, and I'm actually not even done.\n7:31\nYou have things like cholesterol embedded.\n7:33\nCholesterol is a lipid, so it's going to sit in the\n7:35\nhydrophobic part of the membrane\n7:37\nand that actually helps with the fluidity of the membrane,\n7:40\nmaking sure it's not too fluid or not too stiff.\n7:44\nSo this is cholesterol, right over there.\n7:49\nSo you see this mosaic of stuff,\n7:51\nbut what about the fluid part?\n7:53\nAnd I just talked about cholesterol's value\n7:55\nin making sure that it's just the right amount of fluidity.\n7:58\nWhat's neat about this, is this isn't a rigid structure.\n8:01\nIf this thing were to be jostled around a little bit\n8:04\nor maybe it would be plucked-out somehow,\n8:06\nthe phospholipids would just spontaneously re-arrange\n8:09\nto fill in the gap.\n8:10\nYou could imagine these things are all flowing around.\n8:12\nThat this membrane actually has a consistency\n8:16\nof oil or salad dressing.\n8:19\nSo it isn't like a rubbery texture,\n8:24\nlike you might imagine, or a membrane, like a balloon.\n8:26\nIt's actually fluid. These things can move around,\n8:30\nbut even though it's fluid,\n8:33\nit's good enough to separate the two environments.\n8:35\nThe environment inside the cell\n8:37\nfrom the environment outside of the cell.\n8:41\nAnd that's where the name Fluid Mosaic Model comes from.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:01\n- [Instructor] We've already seen that the change\n0:02\nin free energy, delta G,\n0:05\ncan be related to the cell potential E, by this equation.\n0:09\nUnder standard state conditions,\n0:11\nthis would be the standard change in free energy,\n0:13\nso delta G zero which is related to the\n0:15\nstandard cell potential E zero, right,\n0:18\nby the same equation.\n0:20\nThis equation down here comes from thermodynamics,\n0:23\nand we're going to plug in for delta G and delta G zero,\n0:27\nso we're going to plug this in for delta G,\n0:31\nand we're going to plug this in for delta G zero.\n0:34\nSo that gives us negative nFE is equal to,\n0:39\nnegative nFE zero, plus RT,\n0:45\nnatural log of Q,\n0:47\nwhere Q is the reaction quotient.\n0:50\nLet's divide everything by negative nF,\n0:53\nso we're going to divide everything\n0:55\nin here by negative nF,\n0:57\nand let's see what cancels out.\n1:00\nSo all of this would cancel out,\n1:02\nall of that would cancel out,\n1:04\nand we get the Nernst equation.\n1:07\nSo let me go ahead and write it,\n1:08\nthe cell potential E,\n1:11\nis equal to the standard cell

Nernst equation\n1:32\nis so important, we'll talk more about that\n1:33\nat the end of the video.\n1:35\nRight now, let's go ahead and derive\n1:38\nanother form of the Nernst equation,\n1:40\nI should say, the form when you're talking\n1:41\nabout a certain temperature.\n1:43\nSo at 25 degrees C, right,\n1:46\nmost of our reactions take place at 25 degrees C,\n1:50\nwell, temperature, right,\n1:52\ntemperature in here, this in the temperature in Kelvin,\n1:54\nso we need to convert to Kelvin.\n1:57\nSo if you add 273.15, alright,\n2:01\nyou get your temperature in Kelvin,\n2:03\nso that would be 298.15,\n2:08\nso what we're going to do is solve for RT over F,\n2:12\nto write a different form of the Nernst equation.\n2:15\nAnd so the temperature is 298.15 Kelvin,\n2:18\nso let's write that in,\n2:20\nso 298.15 Kelvin.\n2:24\nR is the gas constant,\n2:26\nso remember, the gas constant is 8.314, 8.314,\n2:31\njoules over mole Kelvin.\n2:35\nAnd F is Faraday's constant,\n2:38\nremember Faraday's constant from an earlier video, right,\n2:40\nthat's 96,500 coulombs per mole.\n2:45\nSo Faraday's constant is the\n2:48\ncharge of one mole of electrons.\n2:52\nAlright, so let's solve for\n2:53\nwhat all this is equal to,\n2:55\nso let's get some more space,\n2:57\nand let's get out the calculator.\n3:00\nSo we've already done this calculation\n3:02\nin an earlier video,\n3:03\nbut I'm going to go ahead and do it again,\n3:05\nfor this Nernst equation video.\n3:06\nSo 8.314 times 289.15,\n3:14\nwe need to divide that by Faraday's constant, 96,500.\n3:19\nSo that gives us 0.0257, alright,\n3:24\nso this is equal to,\n3:26\nthis is equal to 0.0257,\n3:31\nand for units, Kelvin would cancel out,\n3:33\nmoles would cancel out,\n3:35\nthat gives us joules over coulombs,\n3:37\nwhich is equal to volts, alright.\n3:40\nSo this is equal to volts,\n3:42\nand we can write another form of the Nernst equation.\n3:46\nSo if your reaction is at 25 degrees C,\n3:50\nyou can write the Nernst equation this way,\n3:52\nyou could say that the cell potential E,\n3:54\nis equal to the standard cell potential E zero, minus,\n3:59\nso all that RT over F is equal to this, 0.0257, right.\n4:05\nSo 0.0257 volts,\n4:09\nwe still have n,\n4:11\nremember n is the number of moles\n4:14\nI'm going to use green for that,\n4:15\nn is the number of moles\n4:17\nof electrons that are transferred\n4:19\nin your redox reaction, right.\n4:21\nSo we're going to put n in here,\n4:23\nand we still have the natural log of Q,\n4:26\nthe reaction quotient, right.\n4:28\nSo here is another form of the Nernst equation,\n4:33\nalright, so at 25 degrees, you can use this form,\n4:36\nand then we can also write this\n4:40\ninto base 10 logarithms that have natural logs.\n4:43\nSo we can do that conversion, right.\n4:45\nSo we also did that in an earlier video,\n4:47\nbut if you're trying to convert this 0.0257,\n4:52\nyou need to multiply by the natural log of 10.\n4:56\nSo when we do that,\n4:58\nso we have 0.0257 times the natural log of 10,\n5:05\nthat gives us 0.0592,\n5:08\nso this is equal to 0.0592.\n5:14\nSo we can write the Nernst equation once again,\n5:18\nalright, so E, or the cell potential,\n5:20\nis equal to the standard cell potential E zero,\n5:22\nminus 0.0592 over n.\n5:29\nAnd we essentially just change this\n5:32\nfrom natural logarithm to base 10 logarithm,\n5:34\nso this would be log of Q, log of the reaction quotient.\n5:39\nSo here is just another form of the Nernst equation.\n5:44\nSo why is the Nernst equation important\n5:47\nand why is it useful?\n5:48\nIt's useful, because it allows us to calculate\n5:51\na cell potential under non-standard state conditions,\n5:56\nso think about this cell potential\n5:59\nas being the instantaneous cell potential,\n6:02\nand you can relate that\n6:03\nto the progress of the reaction, right.\n6:05\nSo as you change concentrations,\n6:07\nthe reaction quotient Q changes, right,\n6:10\nand that means that the\n6:12\ninstantaneous cell potential changes,\n6:15\nalright, so if you change if the concentrations,\n6:17\nif you change the concentrations,\n6:19\nyou're changing the cell potential.\n6:21\nAnd so we'll see more about that in the next video,\n6:23\nso I think that the Nernst equation makes much more\n6:26\nsense when you do some problems with it,\n6:29\nand then you can understand better what it means.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nSo the atomic number is symbolized by Z\n0:05\nand it refers to the number of protons in a nucleus.\n0:09\nAnd you can find the atomic number on the periodic table.\n0:11\nSo we're going to talk about hydrogen in this video.\n0:14\nSo for hydrogen, hydrogen's atomic number is one.\n0:17\nSo it's right here, so there's one proton\n0:19\nin the nucleus of a hydrogen atom.\n0:22\nIn a neutral atom, the number of protons\n0:26\nis equal to the number of electrons,\n0:29\nbecause in a neutral atom there's\n0:31\nno overall charge and the positive charges\n0:32\nof the protons completely balance\n0:35\nwith the negative charges of the electrons.\n0:39\nSo let's go ahead and draw an atom of hydrogen.\n0:42\nWe know the atomic number of hydrogen is one,\n0:45\nso there's one proton in the nucleus.\n0:47\nSo there's my one proton in the nucleus, and we're talking\n0:50\nabout a neutral hydrogen atom, so there's one electron.\n0:53\nI'm going to draw that one electron\n0:55\nsomewhere outside the nucleus and I'm going\n0:57\nto use the oversimplified Bohr model.\n1:00\nSo this isn't actually what an atom looks like,\n1:02\nbut it's a very simply view that helps you get started.\n1:05\nSo this is one, this one version of hydrogen.\n1:10\nThis is one isotope of hydrogen.\n1:13\nSo this is called protium.\n1:15\nLet me go ahead and write that here.\n1:16\nSo this is protium and let's talk about isotopes.\n1:19\nAn isotope, isotopes are atoms of a single element.\n1:22\nSo we're talking about hydrogen here.\n1:25\nThat differ in the number of neutrons in their nuclei.\n1:30\nSo let's talk about the next isotope of hydrogen.\n1:33\nSo this is called deuteriums.\n1:35\nLet me go ahead and write deuterium here.\n1:38\nDeuterium is hydrogen, so it must have one proton\n1:43\nin the nucleus and it must have one electron outside\n1:47\nthe nucleus, but if you look at the definition\n1:50\nfor isotopes, atoms of a single element that differ\n1:53\nin the number of neutrons, protium has zero\n1:56\nneutrons in the nucleus.\n1:59\nDeuterium has one.\n2:00\nSo let me go ahead and draw in deuterium's one neutron.\n2:03\nI'll use blue here, so neutrons are going to be blue.\n2:07\nSo deuterium has one neutron and since neutrons have mass,\n2:11\ndeuterium has more mass than protium.\n2:14\nSo isotopes have different masses because they differ\n2:17\nin terms of number of neutrons.\n2:19\nNotice though, that they have the same atomic number,\n2:21\nthey have the same number of protons in the nucleus.\n2:24\nRight, it's one proton in the nucleus.\n2:26\nAnd that's important because if you change\n2:28\nthe number of protons, you're changing the element,\n2:29\nand that's not what we're doing here.\n2:32\nWe're talking about atoms of a single element.\n2:34\nDeuterium is still hydrogen, it's an isotope.\n2:38\nFinally, our last isotope, which is tritium.\n2:41\nSo tritium has one proton in the nucleus,\n2:45\none electron outside the nucleus, and we draw\n2:48\nthat in here, and it must differ in terms\n2:51\nof number of neutrons, so tritium has two neutrons.\n2:55\nLet me go ahead and draw the two\n2:57\nneutrons here in the nucleus.\n2:59\nAnd so those are the isotopes of hydrogen.\n3:03\nHow do we distinguish between the different isotopes?\n3:07\nWell we're going to write little symbols\n3:10\nto represent these isotopes.\n3:13\nAnd so the symbol that we'll draw here\n3:15\nfor protium is going to have the element symbol,\n3:18\nwhich is, of course, hydrogen, and then down here\n3:21\nwe're going to write the atomic number.\n3:24\nSo the subscript is the atomic number which is one,\n3:27\nbecause there's one proton in the nucleus,\n3:30\nand then for the superscript, we're going\n3:33\nto write in the mass number.\n3:35\nSo let me move down here so we can look\n3:38\nat the definition for the mass number.\n3:40\nThe mass number is the combined number\n3:42\nof protons and neutrons in a nucleus,\n3:45\nso it's protons and neutrons, and it's symbolized by A.\n3:51\nSo A is the mass number, which is equal\n3:53\nto the number of protons, that's the atomic\n3:56\nnumber which we symbolized by Z,\n3:58\nplus the number of neutrons.\n4:01\nSo A is equal to Z plus N.\n4:05\nAnd for protium, let's look at protium here.\n4:08\nSo in the nucleus there's only one proton\n4:12\nand zero neutrons, so one plus zero\n4:15\ngives us a mass number of one.\n4:18\nAnd I'll use red here for mass number so we can distinguish.\n4:21\nAlright, so mass number is red and let me use\n4:25\na different color here for the atomic number.\n4:31\nLet me use magenta here.\n4:33\nSo the subscript is the atomic number\n4:36\nand that's Z, and the superscript\n4:39\nis the mass number and that's A.\n4:43\nSo this symbol represents the protium isotope.\n4:47\nLet's draw one for deuterium.\n4:50\nSo it's hydrogen so we put an H here.\n4:52\nThere is still one proton in the nucleus,\n4:56\nright one proton in the nucleus,\n4:58\nso we put an atomic number of one.\n5:00\nThe mass number is the superscript,\n5:02\nit's the combined number of protons and neutrons.\n5:05\nSo we look in the nucleus here.\n5:07\nThere's one proton and one neutron.\n5:08\nSo one plus one is equal to two.\n5:12\nSo we put a two here for the superscript.\n5:14\nAnd finally for tritium, it's still hydrogen.\n5:17\nSo we put hydrogen here.\n5:20\nThere's one proton in the nucleus,\n5:24\natomic number of one, so we put a one here.\n5:26\nAnd then the combined numbers of protons\n5:29\nand neutrons, that would be three.\n5:32\nSo one proton plus two neutrons gives us three.\n5:37\nSo there's the symbol for tritium.\n5:39\nSo here are the isotopes of hydrogen\n5:42\nand using these symbols allows us\n5:44\nto differentiate between them.\n5:47\nSo let's take what we've learned\n5:49\nand do a few more practice problems here.\n5:53\nSo let's look at a symbol for carbon.\n5:56\nSo here we have carbon with subscript six, superscript 12.\n6:02\nAnd if we want to know how many protons,\n6:05\nelectrons and neutrons there are.\n6:08\nSo let's first think about protons.\n6:10\nWell we know that the subscript is\n6:12\nthe atomic number and the atomic number is\n6:14\nequal to the number of protons.\n6:16\nSo there are six protons in this atom of carbon.\n6:21\nAnd if it's a neutral atom of carbon, the number\n6:23\nof electrons must be equal to the number of protons.\n6:27\nSo if there are six protons, there\n6:29\nmust also be six electrons.\n6:32\nAnd finally, how do we figure out the number of neutrons?\n6:36\nWell let's go ahead and write down the formula we discussed.\n6:40\nThe mass number is equal to the atomic\n6:43\nnumber plus the number of neutrons.\n6:47\nSo the mass number was right here, that's 12.\n6:53\nSo we can put in a 12.\n6:55\nThe atomic number was six, right here.\n6:59\nSo we put in a six.\n7:00\nPlus the number of neutrons.\n7:03\nPlus the number of neutrons.\n7:04\nSo the number of neutrons is just equal to\n7:06\n12 minus six, which is, of course, six.\n7:10\nSo there are six neutrons.\n7:11\nSo just subtract the atomic number\n7:14\nfrom the mass number and you'll get\n7:16\nthe number of neutrons in your atom.\n7:19\nLet's do another one.\n7:21\nThis is carbon and this time we have a superscript of 13.\n7:27\nThe atomic number doesn't change\n7:30\nwhen you're talking about an isotope.\n7:32\nIf you change the atomic number,\n7:34\nyou change the element.\n7:35\nSo there's still six protons in the nucleus\n7:39\nof this atom and in a neutral atom,\n7:42\nthere must be the equal number of electrons.\n7:45\nSo six electrons and then finally,\n7:47\nhow many neutrons are there?\n7:50\nWell just like we did before, we subtract\n7:53\nthe atomic number from the mass number.\n7:57\nSo we just have to 13 minus six\n8:03\nto figure out the number of neutrons.\n8:05\nSo 13 minus six is, of course, seven.\n8:07\nSo there are seven neutrons in this atom.\n8:11\nAnother way to represent isotopes,\n8:15\nlet's say we wanted to represent this isotope\n8:17\nin a different way, sometimes you'll see it\n8:19\nwhere you write the name of the element.\n8:21\nSo this is carbon.\n8:23\nAnd then you put a hyphen here\n8:24\nand then you put the mass number.\n8:26\nSo carbon hyphen 13 refers to this isotope\n8:30\nof carbon and this is called hyphen notation.\n8:34\nSo let me go ahead and write this hyphen notation.\n8:38\nAlright, let's do one more example here.\n8:42\nLet's do one that looks a little bit scarier.\n8:45\nSo let's do uranium.\n8:48\nSo U is uranium.\n8:50\nThe atomic number of uranium is 92.\n8:52\nThe mass number for this isotope is 235.\n8:56\nSo how many protons, electrons,\n8:59\nand neutrons in this atom of uranium?\n9:02\nSo once again for protons, we look\n9:05\nat the atomic number, that's 92.\n9:07\nSo there must be 92 protons.\n9:11\nIn a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal\n9:15\nto the number of protons.\n9:16\nSo there are 92 electrons and then finally,\n9:19\nto figure out the number of neutrons,\n9:21\nwe subtract this number from the mass number.\n9:26\nSo we just need to do 235 minus 92.\n9:34\nAnd that gives us 143.\n9:37\nSo there are 143 neutrons.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's imagine we have a huge cloud\n0:02\nof hydrogen atoms floating in space.\n0:05\nHuge, and when I say huge cloud, huge both in distance\n0:08\nand in mass.\n0:09\nIf you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,\n0:11\nit would just be this really, really massive thing.\n0:15\nSo you have this huge cloud.\n0:16\nWell, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually\n0:20\nattracted to each other.\n0:21\nIt's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.\n0:25\nBut it would slowly affect these atoms.\n0:27\nAnd they would slowly draw close to each other.\n0:30\nIt would slowly condense.\n0:31\nThey'd slowly move towards the center\n0:34\nof mass of all of the atoms.\n0:37\nThey'd slowly move in.\n0:39\nSo if we fast forward, this cloud's\n0:42\ngoing to get denser and denser.\n0:46\nAnd the hydrogen atoms are going to start\n0:48\nbumping into each other and rubbing up against each other\n0:51\nand interacting with each other.\n0:53\nAnd so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.\n0:56\nNow remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.\n0:58\nSo the temperature is going up.\n1:03\nAnd it'll-- they'll keep condensing.\n1:05\nThey'll just keep condensing and condensing\n1:07\nuntil something really interesting happens.\n1:09\nSo let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here\n1:12\nin the center.\n1:16\nAnd there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.\n1:19\nIt's really dense.\n1:20\nI could never draw the actual number of atoms here.\n1:22\nThis is really to give you an idea.\n1:24\nThere's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,\n1:28\nfrom everything that wants to get\n1:29\nto that center of mass of our entire cloud.\n1:32\nThe temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.\n1:38\nAnd at that point, something neat happens.\n1:40\nAnd to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,\n1:43\nlet's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.\n1:46\nA hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just\n1:48\ngoing to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.\n1:49\nSo the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.\n1:50\nIf you want to think about a hydrogen atom,\n1:52\nit also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.\n1:57\nAnd let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.\n1:59\nAnd obviously this distance isn't to scale.\n2:02\nThis distance is also not to scale.\n2:04\nAtoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms\n2:05\nare actually much, much, much, much smaller\n2:07\nthan the actual radius of an atom.\n2:10\nAnd so is the electron.\n2:11\nBut anyway, this just gives you an idea.\n2:13\nSo we know from the Coulomb forces,\n2:14\nfrom electromagnetic forces, that these two positively\n2:17\ncharged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere\n2:20\nnear each other.\n2:22\nBut we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four\n2:25\nforces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,\n2:28\nthat if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures\n2:31\nand huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close\n2:35\nenough to each other, then all of a sudden,\n2:37\nthe strong force will overtake.\n2:39\nIt's much stronger than the Coulomb force.\n2:41\nAnd then these two hydrogens will actually--\n2:43\nthese nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?\n2:48\nWell, anyway, they would actually fuse together.\n2:50\nAnd so that is what actually happens\n2:53\nonce this gets hot and dense enough.\n2:57\nYou now have enough pressure and enough temperature\n2:59\nto overcome the Coulomb force and bring\n3:02\nthese protons close enough to each other for fusion\n3:05\nto occur, for fusion ignition.\n3:12\nAnd the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.\n3:14\nIt's not ignition.\n3:15\nIt's not combustion in the traditional sense.\n3:16\nIt's not like you're burning a carbon molecule\n3:20\nin the presence of oxygen.\n3:22\nIt's not combustion.\n3:23\nIt's ignition.\n3:24\nAnd the reason why it's called ignition\n3:25\nis because when two of these protons,\n3:27\nor two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus\n3:32\nhas a slightly smaller mass.\n3:35\nAnd so in the first stage of this,\n3:36\nyou actually have two protons under enough pressure--\n3:42\nobviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--\n3:44\nwith enough pressure they get close enough.\n3:46\nAnd then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.\n3:51\nOne of these guys degrades into a neutron.\n3:56\nAnd the resulting mass of the combined protons\n3:59\nis lower than the mass of each of the original.\n4:01\nBy a little bit, but that little bit of mass\n4:04\nresults in a lot of energy-- plus energy.\n4:11\nAnd this energy is why we call it ignition.\n4:13\nAnd so what this energy does is it provides\n4:16\na little bit of outward pressure,\n4:17\nso that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.\n4:21\nSo once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.\n4:24\nAnd then that energy provides outward pressure\n4:26\nto balance what is now a star.\n4:30\nSo now we are at where we actually\n4:32\nhave the ignition at the center.\n4:35\nWe have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying\n4:39\nto get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.\n4:43\nNow, what is the hydrogen being fused into?\n4:46\nWell, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just\n4:50\nkind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens\n4:54\nin stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.\n5:00\nI have trouble spelling.\n5:01\nWhich is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.\n5:03\nThis is still hydrogen because it\n5:04\nhas one proton and one neutron now.\n5:07\nIt is not helium yet.\n5:08\nThis does not have two-- it does not have two protons.\n5:12\nBut then the deuterium keeps fusing.\n5:14\nAnd then we eventually end up with helium.\n5:19\nAnd we can even see that on the periodic table.\n5:21\nOh, I lost my periodic table.\n5:22\nWell, I'll show you the next video.\n5:23\nBut we know hydrogen in its atomic state\n5:30\nhas an atomic number of 1.\n5:32\nAnd it also has a mass of 1.\n5:34\nIt only has one nucleon in its nucleus.\n5:38\nBut it's being fused.\n5:39\nIt goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,\n5:42\nwhich is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.\n5:46\nAnd then that eventually gets fused--\n5:48\nand I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--\n5:50\ninto helium.\n5:51\nAnd by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.\n5:56\nSo it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,\n5:58\nin particular, that isotope of helium--\n6:00\nit has an atomic mass of 4.\n6:03\nAnd this process releases a ton of energy.\n6:06\nBecause the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced\n6:09\nis slightly lower than four times the atomic mass\n6:15\nof each of the constituent hydrogens.\n6:17\nSo all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it\n6:21\nneeds super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--\n6:24\nkeeps the star from collapsing.\n6:28\nAnd once a star is in this stage,\n6:31\nonce it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen\n6:35\nin its core, where the pressure and the temperature\n6:37\nis the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.\n6:41\nThis is now a main sequence star.\n6:48\nAnd that's actually where the sun is right now.\n6:50\nNow there's questions of, well, what if there just\n6:53\nwasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?\n6:56\nAnd there actually are things that\n6:57\nnever get to quite that threshold\n6:59\nto fuse all the way into helium.\n7:00\nThere are a few things that don't quite\n7:02\nmake the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.\n7:05\nSo they are generating some of their heat.\n7:06\nOr there are even smaller objects\n7:08\nthat just get to the point there's\n7:10\na huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually\n7:13\noccurring inside of the core.\n7:15\nAnd something like Jupiter would be an example.\n7:17\nAnd you could go several masses above Jupiter\n7:20\nwhere you get something like that.\n7:21\nSo you have to reach a certain threshold\n7:23\nwhere the mass, where the pressure and the temperature\n7:25\ndue to the heavy mass, get so large that you\n7:27\nstart this fusion.\n7:28\nAnd-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,\n7:31\nthe slower the fusion will occur.\n7:33\nBut if you're super massive, the fusion\n7:35\nwill occur really, really fast.\n7:37\nSo that's the general idea of just how stars get formed\n7:40\nand why they don't collapse on themselves\n7:43\nand why they are these kind of balls\n7:45\nof fusion reactions existing in the universe.\n7:48\nIn the next few videos, we'll talk\n7:50\nabout what happens once that hydrogen fuel in the core\n7:54\nstarts to run out.",

    "source_material": "On July 26, 1943,\nLos Angeles was blanketed by a thick\ngas that stung people's eyes\nand blocked out the Sun.\nPanicked residents believed their city\nhad been attacked using chemical warfare.\nBut the cloud wasn't an act of war.\nIt was smog.\nA portmanteau \nof smoke and fog,\nthe word smog was coined at the beginning\nof the 20th century\nto describe the thick gray \nhaze that covered cities\nsuch as London,\nGlasgow,\nand Edinburgh.\nThis industrial smog was known to form\nwhen smoke from coal-burning \nhome stoves and factories\ncombined with moisture in the air.\nBut the smog behind \nthe LA panic was different.\nIt was yellowish with a chemical odor.\nSince the city didn't burn much coal,\nits cause would remain a mystery\nuntil a chemist named Arie Haagen-Smit\nidentified two culprits,\nvolatile organic compounds, or VOCs,\nand nitrous oxides.\nVOCs are compounds that easily\nbecome vapors\nand may contain elements, such as carbon,\noxygen,\nhydrogen,\nchlorine,\nand sulfur.\nSome are naturally produced \nby plants and animals,\nbut others come from manmade sources,\nlike solvents,\npaints,\nglues,\nand petroleum.\nMeanwhile, the incomplete combustion\nof gas in motor vehicles\nreleases nitrous oxide.\nThat's what gives this type of smog\nits yellowish color.\nVOCs and nitrous oxide react with sunlight\nto produce secondary pollutants called\nPANs and tropospheric,\nor ground level, ozone.\nPANs and ozone cause eye irritation\nand damage lung tissue.\nBoth are key ingredients \nin photochemical smog,\nwhich is what had been plaguing LA.\nSo why does smog affect some cities\nbut not others?\nBoth industrial and photochemical smog\ncombine manmade pollution\nwith local weather and geography.\nLondon's high humidity made it a prime\nlocation for industrial smog.\nPhotochemical smog is strongest in\nurban areas with calm winds\nand dry, warm, sunny weather.\nThe ultraviolet radiation from sunlight\nprovides the energy necessary\nto breakdown molecules that contribute\nto smog formation.\nCities surrounded by mountains, like LA,\nor lying in a basin, like Beijing,\nare also especially vulnerable to smog\nsince there's nowhere for it to dissipate.\nThat's also partially due to a phenomenon\nknown as temperature inversion,\nwhere instead of warm air \ncontinuously rising upward,\na pollution-filled layer of air remains \ntrapped near the Earth's surface\nby a slightly warmer layer above.\nSmog isn't just an aesthetic eyesore.\nBoth forms of smog irritate the eyes,\nnose,\nand throat,\nexacerbate conditions like asthma\nand emphysema,\nand increase the risk \nof respiratory infections like bronchitis.\nSmog can be especially harmful \nto young children and older people\nand exposure in pregnant women has been\nlinked to low birth weight\nand potential birth defects.\nSecondary pollutants found \nin photochemical smog\ncan damage and weaken crops\nand decrease yield,\nmaking them more susceptible to insects.\nYet for decades, smog was seen\nas the inevitable price of civilization.\nLondoners had become accustomed to \nthe notorious pea soup fog\nswirling over their streets until 1952,\nwhen the Great Smog of London shut down\nall transportation in the city for days\nand caused more \nthan 4,000 respiratory deaths.\nAs a result, the Clean Air Act of 1956\nbanned burning coal in \ncertain areas of the city,\nleading to a massive reduction in smog.\nSimilarly, regulations on vehicle \nemissions and gas content in the US\nreduced the volatile compounds in the air\nand smog levels along with them.\nSmog remains a major problem\naround the world.\nCountries like China and Poland that\ndepend on coal for energy\nexperience high levels of industrial smog.\nPhotochemical smog and airborne particles\nfrom vehicle emissions\naffect many rapidly developing cities,\nfrom Mexico City and Santiago\nto New Delhi and Tehran.\nGovernments have tried many methods\nto tackle it,\nsuch as banning cars from driving\nfor days at a time.\nAs more than half of the world's \npopulation crowds into cities,\nconsidering a shift to mass transit\nand away from fossil fuels\nmay allow us to breathe easier.\n",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nRight now, based on what we know so far, if we wanted to\n0:03\nname this molecule, we would say, well, what's the longest\n0:07\ncarbon chain here?\n0:08\nWell, we have a two-carbon chain, and there's all single\n0:12\nbonds, so we're dealing with an ethane.\n0:16\nActually, I'll write it all at once.\n0:18\nAnd then we have on the one carbon, we can call this the\n0:21\none carbon, and call this the two carbon, we have a bromine\n0:25\nand a fluorine.\n0:26\nSo we could call this 1-bromo, and we're putting the bromo\n0:34\ninstead of the fluoro because B comes before F\n0:36\nalphabetically.\n0:37\n1-bromo-1-fluoro, and then we're dealing with an ethane.\n0:46\nWe have a two-carbon chain, all single bonds,\n0:49\nfluoroethane.\n0:51\nThat's the name of that molecule there, just a review\n0:54\nof some of the earlier organic nomenclature\n0:56\nvideos we had done.\n0:57\nNow, we know immediately, based on the last few videos,\n1:00\nthat this is also a chiral carbon, and if we were to take\n1:03\nits mirror image, we would get another enantiomer of this\n1:10\nsame molecule, or that they are enantiomers of each other.\n1:13\nSo what is the mirror image of this\n1:16\n1-bromo-1-fluoroethane look like?\n1:19\nWell, you'd have the carbon right here.\n1:23\nI want to get all the colors right.\n1:24\nYou would still have the bromine up above.\n1:28\nYou would have this methyl group that's attached to the\n1:31\ncarbon now pointing in the left direction, CH3.\n1:35\nThe fluorine would now still be behind the carbon, and now\n1:42\nthe hydrogen would still pop out of the page, but it would\n1:44\nnow pop out and to the right.\n1:51\nThat is the hydrogen.\n1:53\nNow, based on our naming so far, we would name this\n1:56\n1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, and we would also name this\n2:01\n1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, but these are fundamentally two\n2:08\ndifferent molecules.\n2:09\nEven though they have the same molecules in them; they have\n2:12\nthe same molecular formula; they have the same\n2:15\nconstitution in that this carbon is connected to a\n2:19\nhydrogen, a fluorine, and a bromine; this carbon is\n2:21\nconnected to the same things; this carbon is connected to a\n2:24\ncarbon, three hydrogens; so is this one; these are\n2:28\nstereoisomers.\n2:29\nThese are stereoisomers, and they're mirror images of each\n2:32\nother, so they're enantiomers.\n2:37\nAnd actually, they will, one, polarize light differently,\n2:40\nand they actually can often have very different chemical\n2:45\nproperties, either in a chemical or biological system.\n2:47\nSo it seems not good that we have the same\n2:52\nnames for both of these.\n2:53\nSo what we're going to focus on in this video is how do you\n2:55\ndifferentiate between the two?\n3:01\nSo how do we differentiate between the two?\n3:04\nSo the naming system we're going to use right here is\n3:07\ncalled the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, but it's a different\n3:12\nCahn, it's not me.\n3:13\nIt's C-A-H-N instead of K-H-A-N.\n3:17\nCahn-Ingold-Prelog system, and it's a way of differentiating\n3:26\nbetween this enantiomer, which right now we would call\n3:29\n1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, and this enantiomer,\n3:32\n1-bromo-1-fluoroethane.\n3:34\nIt's a pretty straightforward thing.\n3:36\nReally, the hardest part is to just visualize rotating the\n3:39\nmolecules in the right way and figuring out in which\n3:41\ndirection it's kind of-- whether it's kind of a\n3:43\nleft-handed or right-handed molecule.\n3:45\nWe're going to take it step by step.\n3:46\nSo the first thing you do in the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system\n3:50\nis to, one, identify your chiral molecule.\n3:56\nHere, it's pretty obvious.\n3:57\nIt's this carbon right here.\n4:00\nWe'll just focus on this left one, the one we started with\n4:03\nfirst. It's bonded to three different groups.\n4:06\nAnd then what you want to do is you want to rank the groups\n4:09\nby atomic number.\n4:11\nSo if you go up here, out of bromine, hydrogen, fluorine,\n4:18\nand a carbon, this is what is bonded directly to this\n4:21\ncarbon, which has the highest atomic number?\n4:23\nBromine is over here-- let me do this in a darker color.\n4:27\nWe have bromine at 35, we have fluorine at 9, we have carbon\n4:32\nat 6, and then we have hydrogen at 1.\n4:37\nSo of all these, bromine is the largest. We'll just call\n4:40\nthis number one.\n4:42\nThen after that, we have fluorine.\n4:44\nThat is the number two.\n4:46\nNumber three is the carbon.\n4:49\nAnd then hydrogen is the smallest, so\n4:51\nthat is number four.\n4:55\nSo now that we've numbered them, the next step is to\n4:58\norient this molecule so that the smallest atomic number\n5:01\ngroup is sitting into the page.\n5:04\nIt's sitting behind the molecule.\n5:08\nRight now, this hydrogen is the smallest of all of them.\n5:11\nBromine's the largest, hydrogen is the smallest, so\n5:13\nwe want to orient it behind the molecule.\n5:15\nThe way it's drawn right now, it's oriented in\n5:17\nfront of the molecule.\n5:18\nSo to orient it behind the molecule, and this really is\n5:21\nthe hardest part is just to visualize it properly.\n5:23\nRemember, this fluorine is behind; this is right in the\n5:25\nplane of the paper; this is popping out of the paper.\n5:30\nWe would want to rotate.\n5:31\nYou could imagine we'd be rotating the molecule in this\n5:36\ndirection so that-- let me redraw it.\n5:44\nWe have the carbon here.\n5:46\nAnd now since we've rotated it like this, we've rotated it\n5:49\nroughly 1/3 around the circle, so it's about 120 degrees.\n5:54\nNow, this hydrogen is where the fluorine was.\n6:01\nSo that's where the hydrogen is.\n6:02\nThe fluorine is now where this methyl group is.\n6:10\nThese dotted lines show that we're behind now.\n6:11\nThis shows that we're in the plane.\n6:13\nAnd the methyl group is now where the hydrogen is.\n6:15\nIt's now popping out of the page.\n6:16\nIt's going to the left and out.\n6:18\nSo this methyl group is now popping out of the page, out\n6:24\nand to the left.\n6:25\nThat's where our methyl group is.\n6:27\nSo all we've done is we've just rotated this around about\n6:29\n120 degrees.\n6:30\nWe've just gotten this to go behind, and that's kind of the\n6:33\nfirst step after we've identified the chiral carbon\n6:36\nand ranked them by atomic number.\n6:38\nAnd.\n6:38\nOf course.\n6:38\nThe bromine is still going to be on top.\n6:43\nNow, once you put the smallest atomic number molecule in the\n6:47\nback, then you want to look at the rankings\n6:49\nof one through three.\n6:50\nAnd we have four molecules here.\n6:52\nWe look at the largest, which is bromine, number one.\n6:57\nThen number two is fluorine, number two, and then number\n7:00\nthree is this methyl group.\n7:01\nThat's the carbon that's bonded to this carbon, so it's\n7:04\nnumber three right there.\n7:06\nAnd in the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, we literally just\n7:10\nthink about what would it take to go from number one to\n7:12\nnumber two to number three?\n7:13\nAnd in this case, we would go in this direction.\n7:16\nTo go from number one to number two to number three, we\n7:19\nwould go in the clockwise direction.\n7:21\nWe're just ignoring the hydrogen right now.\n7:22\nThat's just sitting behind it.\n7:24\nThat was the first step, to orient it so it's sitting in\n7:26\nthe back, the smallest molecule.\n7:28\nAnd then the three largest ones, you just say what\n7:30\ndirection do we have to go to go from number one to number\n7:32\ntwo to number three?\n7:33\nIn this case, we have to go clockwise.\n7:37\nAnd if we go clockwise now, then we call this a\n7:42\nright-handed molecule, or we use the Latin word for right,\n7:46\nwhich is rectus.\n7:49\nAnd so we would call this molecule right here not just\n7:54\n1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, this is R, R for rectus.\n8:00\nOr you could even think right, although we'll see left is\n8:03\nused as S, which is sinister, so the Latin is really where\n8:05\nthe R comes from.\n8:07\nBut this is (R)-1-bromo-1-fluoroethane\n8:18\nThat's this one right here.\n8:19\nSo you might guess, well, this must be the opposite, this\n8:21\nmust be the counterclockwise version.\n8:23\nWe can do it really fast.\n8:24\nSo same idea.\n8:26\nWe know the largest one.\n8:28\nBromine is number one.\n8:29\nThat's the largest in terms of atomic number.\n8:32\nFluorine is number two.\n8:34\nCarbon is number three.\n8:36\nHydrogen is number four.\n8:38\nWhat we want to do is put hydrogen in the back, so what\n8:40\nwe're going to have to do is rotate it to the back to where\n8:43\nfluorine is right now.\n8:45\nSo if we had to redraw this molecule right here, you'd\n8:48\nhave your carbon still.\n8:49\nYou still have your bromine sitting on top.\n8:52\nBut we're going to put the hydrogen now to the back, so\n8:55\nthe hydrogen is now where the fluorine used to be.\n8:59\nThe hydrogen's there.\n9:05\nThis methyl group, this carbon with the three hydrogens, is\n9:08\ngoing to be rotated to where the hydrogen used to be.\n9:12\nIt's now going to pop out of the page, because we're\n9:15\nrotating it in that direction, so this is our methyl group\n9:18\nright there.\n9:19\nAnd then this fluorine is going to be moved where the\n9:21\nmethyl group was, so this fluorine will go right here.\n9:26\nAnd now, using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system,\n9:30\nthis is our number one, this is our number two, just by\n9:33\natomic number, this is number three.\n9:35\nYou go from number one through number two to number three.\n9:38\nYou go in this direction.\n9:40\nYou're going counterclockwise.\n9:45\nOr we are going to the left, or we use the Latin word for\n9:48\nit, which is sinister.\n9:51\nAnd the word sinister comes from the Latin word for left,\n9:54\nso I guess right is good, and people thought either\n9:57\nleft-handed people were bad, or if you're not going to the\n9:59\nright, it's bad.\n9:59\nI don't know why sinister took on its sinister meaning now in\n10:04\ncommon language.\n10:05\nBut it's now the sinister version of the molecule.\n10:09\nSo we would call this version, this enantiomer of\n10:12\n1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, we would call this S, S for\n10:19\nsinister, or for left, or for counterclockwise:\n10:22\n(S)-1-bromo-1-fluoroethane.\n10:31\nSo now we can differentiate the names.\n10:33\nWe know that these are two different configurations.\n10:38\nAnd that's what the S and the R tell us, that if you have to\n10:40\ngo from this to this, you would literally have to detach\n10:43\nand reattach different groups.\n10:45\nYou'd actually have to break bonds.\n10:46\nYou actually have to swap two of these groups in some way in\n10:50\norder to get from this enantiomer to this enantiomer.\n10:53\nThey're different configurations, really\n10:55\nfundamentally different molecules, stereoisomers,\n10:58\nenantiomers, however you want to--",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nConsidering that I have a cold right now, I can't imagine a\n0:03\nmore appropriate topic to make a video on than a virus.\n0:08\nAnd I didn't want to make it that thick.\n0:09\nA virus, or viruses.\n0:14\nAnd in my opinion, viruses are, on some level, the most\n0:19\nfascinating thing in all of biology.\n0:21\nBecause they really blur the boundary between what is an\n0:25\ninanimate object and what is life?\n0:30\nI mean if we look at ourselves, or life as one of\n0:33\nthose things that you know it when you see it.\n0:35\nIf you see something that, it's born, it grows, it's\n0:39\nconstantly changing.\n0:40\nMaybe it moves around.\n0:41\nMaybe it doesn't.\n0:42\nBut it's metabolizing things around itself.\n0:44\nIt reproduces and then it dies.\n0:46\nYou say, hey, that's probably life.\n0:48\nAnd in this, we throw most things that we see-- or we\n0:50\nthrow in, us.\n0:52\nWe throw in bacteria.\n0:55\nWe throw in plants.\n0:57\nI mean, I could-- I'm kind of butchering the taxonomy system\n1:00\nhere, but we tend to know life when we see it.\n1:03\nBut all viruses are, they're just a bunch of genetic\n1:07\ninformation inside of a protein.\n1:09\nInside of a protein capsule.\n1:11\nSo let me draw.\n1:13\nAnd the genetic information can come in any form.\n1:16\nSo it can be an RNA, it could be DNA, it could be\n1:22\nsingle-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA.\n1:24\nSometimes for single stranded they'll write these two little\n1:27\nS's in front of it.\n1:29\nLet's say they are talking about double stranded DNA,\n1:30\nthey'll put a ds in front of it.\n1:32\nBut the general idea-- and viruses can come in all of\n1:35\nthese forms-- is that they have some genetic information,\n1:38\nsome chain of nucleic acids.\n1:40\nEither as single or double stranded RNA or single or\n1:43\ndouble stranded DNA.\n1:44\nAnd it's just contained inside some type of protein\n1:47\nstructure, which is called the capsid.\n1:49\nAnd kind of the classic drawing is kind of an\n1:53\nicosahedron type looking thing.\n1:56\nLet me see if I can do justice to it.\n1:58\nIt looks something like this.\n2:00\nAnd not all viruses have to look exactly like this.\n2:02\nThere's thousands of types of viruses.\n2:05\nAnd we're really just scratching the surface and\n2:06\nunderstanding even what viruses are out there and all\n2:09\nof the different ways that they can essentially replicate\n2:14\nthemselves.\n2:15\nWe'll talk more about that in the future.\n2:16\nAnd I would suspect that pretty much any possible way\n2:19\nof replication probably does somehow exist\n2:21\nin the virus world.\n2:22\nBut they really are just these proteins, these protein\n2:25\ncapsids, are just made up of a bunch of little\n2:27\nproteins put together.\n2:29\nAnd inside they have some genetic material, which might\n2:31\nbe DNA or it might be RNA.\n2:33\nSo let me draw their genetic material.\n2:35\nThe protein is not necessarily transparent, but if it was,\n2:38\nyou would see some genetic material inside of there.\n2:42\nSo the question is, is this thing life?\n2:48\nIt seems pretty inanimate.\n2:49\nIt doesn't grow.\n2:50\nIt doesn't change.\n2:51\nIt doesn't metabolize things.\n2:53\nThis thing, left to its own devices, is just\n2:55\ngoing to sit there.\n2:55\nIt's just going to sit there the way a book on a table just\n2:59\nsits there.\n3:00\nIt won't change anything.\n3:02\nBut what happens is, the debate arises.\n3:06\nI mean you might say, hey Sal, when you define it that way,\n3:08\njust looks like a bunch of molecules put together.\n3:10\nThat isn't life.\n3:11\nBut it starts to seem like life all of a sudden when it\n3:14\ncomes in contact with the things that we normally\n3:17\nconsider life.\n3:18\nSo what viruses do, the classic example is, a virus\n3:22\nwill attach itself to a cell.\n3:24\nSo let me draw this thing a little bit smaller.\n3:28\nSo let's say that this is my virus.\n3:30\nI'll draw it as a little hexagon.\n3:32\nAnd what it does is, it'll attach itself to a cell.\n3:34\nAnd it could be any type of cell.\n3:35\nIt could be a bacteria cell, it could be a plant cell, it\n3:39\ncould be a human cell.\n3:41\nLet me draw the cell here.\n3:43\nCells are usually far larger than the virus.\n3:48\nIn the case of cells that have soft membranes, the virus\n3:51\nfigures out some way to enter it.\n3:53\nSometimes it can essentially fuse-- I don't want to\n3:58\ncomplicate the issue-- but sometimes viruses have their\n4:01\nown little membranes.\n4:02\nAnd we'll talk about in a second where\n4:03\nit gets their membranes.\n4:04\nSo a virus might have its own membrane like that.\n4:08\nThat's around its capsid.\n4:10\nAnd then these membranes will fuse.\n4:13\nAnd then the virus will be able to enter into the cell.\n4:16\nNow, that's one method.\n4:18\nAnd another method, and they're seldom\n4:19\nall the same way.\n4:20\nBut let's say another method would be, the virus\n4:24\nconvinces-- just based on some protein receptors on it, or\n4:26\nprotein receptors on the cells-- and obviously this has\n4:29\nto be kind of a Trojan horse type of thing.\n4:31\nThe cell doesn't want viruses.\n4:33\nSo the virus has to somehow convince the cell that it's a\n4:36\nnon-foreign particle.\n4:38\nWe could do hundreds of videos on how viruses work and it's a\n4:41\ncontinuing field of research.\n4:43\nBut sometimes you might have a virus that just gets consumed\n4:47\nby the cell.\n4:48\nMaybe the cell just thinks it's something that it needs\n4:49\nto consume.\n4:50\nSo the cell wraps around it like this.\n4:56\nAnd these sides will eventually merge.\n4:58\nAnd then the cell and the virus will go into it.\n5:01\nThis is called endocytosis.\n5:03\nI'll just talk about that.\n5:04\nIt just brings it into its cytoplasm.\n5:06\nIt doesn't happen just to viruses.\n5:11\nBut this is one mechanism that can enter.\n5:12\nAnd then in cases where the cell in question-- for example\n5:17\nin the situation with bacteria-- if the cell has a\n5:20\nvery hard shell-- let me do it in a good color.\n5:25\nSo let's say that this is a bacteria right here.\n5:29\nAnd it has a hard shell.\n5:30\nThe viruses don't even enter the cell.\n5:32\nThey just hang out outside of the cell like this.\n5:36\nNot drawing to scale.\n5:37\nAnd they actually inject their genetic material.\n5:40\nSo there's obviously a huge-- there's a wide variety of ways\n5:43\nof how the viruses get into cells.\n5:45\nBut that's beside the point.\n5:46\nThe interesting thing is that they do get into the cell.\n5:49\nAnd once they do get into the cell, they release their\n5:52\ngenetic material into the cell.\n5:54\nSo their genetic material will float around.\n5:56\nIf their genetic material is already in the form of RNA--\n6:01\nand I could imagine almost every possibility of different\n6:05\nways for viruses to work probably do exist in nature.\n6:08\nWe just haven't found them.\n6:09\nBut the ones that we've already found really do kind\n6:11\nof do it in every possible way.\n6:13\nSo if they have RNA, this RNA can immediately start being\n6:20\nused to essentially-- let's say this is the\n6:23\nnucleus of the cell.\n6:25\nThat's the nucleus of the cell and it normally has the DNA in\n6:28\nit like that.\n6:29\nMaybe I'll do the DNA in a different color.\n6:30\nBut DNA gets transcribed into RNA, normally.\n6:37\nSo normally, the cell, this a normal working cell, the RNA\n6:39\nexits the nucleus, it goes to the ribosomes, and then you\n6:43\nhave the RNA in conjunction with the tRNA and it produces\n6:46\nthese proteins.\n6:49\nThe RNA codes for different proteins.\n6:51\nAnd I talk about that in a different video.\n6:53\nSo these proteins get formed and eventually, they can form\n6:57\nthe different structures in a cell.\n6:58\nBut what a virus does is it hijacks this process here.\n7:03\nHijacks this mechanism.\n7:04\nThis RNA will essentially go and do what the cell's own RNA\n7:08\nwould have done.\n7:09\nAnd it starts coding for its own proteins.\n7:11\nObviously it's not going to code for\n7:12\nthe same things there.\n7:13\nAnd actually some of the first proteins it codes for often\n7:15\nstart killing the DNA and the RNA that might otherwise\n7:19\ncompete with it.\n7:20\nSo it codes its own proteins.\n7:22\nAnd then those proteins start making more viral shells.\n7:26\nSo those proteins just start constructing more and more\n7:31\nviral shells.\n7:33\nAt the same time, this RNA is replicating.\n7:36\nIt's using the cell's own mechanisms. Left to its own\n7:39\ndevices it would just sit there.\n7:40\nBut once it enters into a cell it can use all of the nice\n7:43\nmachinery that a cell has around to replicate itself.\n7:47\nAnd it's kind of amazing, just the biochemistry of it.\n7:51\nThat these RNA molecules then find themselves\n7:54\nback in these capsids.\n7:57\nAnd then once there's enough of these and the cell has\n8:00\nessentially all of its resources have been depleted,\n8:05\nthe viruses, these individual new viruses that have\n8:09\nreplicated themselves using all of the cell's mechanisms,\n8:15\nwill find some way to exit the cell.\n8:17\nThe most-- I don't want to say, typical, because we\n8:20\nhaven't even discovered all the different types of viruses\n8:23\nthere are-- but one that's, I guess, talked about the most,\n8:26\nis when there's enough of these, they'll release\n8:28\nproteins or they'll construct proteins.\n8:30\nBecause they don't make their own.\n8:32\nThat essentially cause the cell to either kill itself or\n8:35\nits membrane to dissolve.\n8:37\nSo the membrane dissolves.\n8:39\nAnd essentially the cell lyses.\n8:41\nLet me write that down.\n8:42\nThe cell lyses.\n8:43\nAnd lyses just means that the cell's membrane just\n8:46\ndisappears.\n8:46\nAnd then all of these guys can emerge for themselves.\n8:50\nNow I talked about before that have some of these guys, that\n8:53\nthey have their own membrane.\n8:54\nSo how did they get there, these\n8:56\nkind of bilipid membranes?\n8:58\nWell some of them, what they do is, once they replicate\n9:00\ninside of a cell, they exit maybe not even killing-- they\n9:07\ndon't have to lyse.\n9:08\nEverything I talk about, these are specific ways that a virus\n9:11\nmight work.\n9:12\nBut viruses really kind of explore-- well different types\n9:15\nof viruses do almost every different combination you\n9:17\ncould imagine of replicating and coding for proteins and\n9:22\nescaping from cells.\n9:23\nSome of them just bud.\n9:24\nAnd when they bud, they essentially, you can kind of\n9:26\nimagine that they push against the cell\n9:28\nwall, or the membrane.\n9:29\nI shouldn't say cell wall.\n9:30\nThe cell's outer membrane.\n9:32\nAnd then when they push against it, they take some of\n9:36\nthe membrane with them.\n9:38\nUntil eventually the cell will-- when this goes up\n9:41\nenough, this'll pop together and it'll take some of the\n9:43\nmembrane with it.\n9:44\nAnd you could imagine why that would be useful thing\n9:47\nto have with you.\n9:49\nBecause now that you have this membrane, you kind of look\n9:51\nlike this cell.\n9:52\nSo when you want to go infect another cell like this, you're\n9:55\nnot going to necessarily look like a foreign particle.\n9:58\nSo it's a very useful way to look like something that\n10:02\nyou're not.\n10:03\nAnd if you don't think that this is creepy-crawly enough,\n10:06\nthat you're hijacking the DNA of an organism, viruses can\n10:10\nactually change the DNA an organism.\n10:14\nAnd actually one of the most common examples is HIV virus.\n10:18\nLet me write that down.\n10:21\nHIV, which is a type of retrovirus, which is\n10:27\nfascinating.\n10:28\nBecause what they do is, so they have RNA in them.\n10:35\nAnd when they enter into a cell, let's say that they got\n10:38\ninto the cell.\n10:39\nSo it's inside of the cell like this.\n10:42\nThey actually bring along with them a protein.\n10:46\nAnd every time you say, where do they get this protein?\n10:49\nAll of this stuff came from a different cell.\n10:51\nThey use some other cell's amino acids and ribosomes and\n10:54\nnucleic acids and everything to build themselves.\n10:56\nSo any proteins that they have in them came\n10:58\nfrom another cell.\n11:00\nBut they bring with them, this protein reverse transcriptase.\n11:04\nAnd the reverse transcriptase takes their RNA and\n11:07\ncodes it into DNA.\n11:11\nSo its RNA to DNA.\n11:14\nWhich when it was first discovered was, kind of,\n11:16\npeople always thought that you always went from DNA to RNA,\n11:19\nbut this kind of broke that paradigm.\n11:22\nBut it codes from RNA to DNA.\n11:23\nAnd if that's not bad enough, it'll incorporate that DNA\n11:29\ninto the DNA of the host cell.\n11:31\nSo that DNA will incorporate itself into the\n11:34\nDNA of the host cell.\n11:35\nLet's say the yellow is the DNA of the host cell.\n11:37\nAnd this is its nucleus.\n11:41\nSo it actually messes with the genetic makeup\n11:44\nof what it's infecting.\n11:46\nAnd when I made the videos on bacteria I said, hey for every\n11:51\none human cell we have twenty bacteria cells.\n11:53\nAnd they live with us and they're useful and they're\n11:56\npart of us and they're 10% of our dry mass and all of that.\n12:00\nBut bacteria are kind of along for the ride.\n12:02\nThey don't change who we are.\n12:03\nBut these retroviruses, they're actually changing our\n12:07\ngenetic makeup.\n12:07\nI mean, my genes, I take very personally.\n12:10\nThey define who I am.\n12:12\nBut these guys will actually go in and\n12:14\nchange my genetic makeup.\n12:16\nAnd then once they're part of the DNA, then just the natural\n12:19\nDNA to RNA to protein process will code\n12:25\ntheir actual proteins.\n12:27\nOr their-- what they need to-- so sometimes they'll lay\n12:30\ndormant and do nothing.\n12:31\nAnd sometimes-- let's say sometimes in some type of\n12:33\nenvironmental trigger, they'll start coding\n12:35\nfor themselves again.\n12:37\nAnd they'll start producing more.\n12:38\nBut they're producing it directly from the organism's\n12:41\ncell's DNA.\n12:43\nThey become part of the organism.\n12:45\nI mean I can't imagine a more intimate way to become part of\n12:49\nan organism than to become part of its DNA.\n12:51\nI can't imagine any other way to\n12:52\nactually define an organism.\n12:55\nAnd if this by itself is not eerie enough, and just so you\n13:00\nknow, this notion right here, when a virus becomes part of\n13:06\nan organism's DNA, this is called a provirus.\n13:13\nBut if this isn't eerie enough, they estimate-- so if\n13:16\nthis infects a cell in my nose or in my arm, as this cell\n13:23\nexperiences mitosis, all of its offspring-- but its\n13:27\noffspring are genetically identical-- are going to have\n13:29\nthis viral DNA.\n13:30\nAnd that might be fine, but at least my\n13:32\nchildren won't get it.\n13:33\nYou know, at least it won't become part of my species.\n13:35\nBut it doesn't have to just infect somatic cells, it could\n13:38\ninfect a germ cell.\n13:41\nSo it could go into a germ cell.\n13:44\nAnd the germ cells, we've learned already, these are the\n13:46\nones that produce gametes.\n13:49\nFor men, that's sperm and for women it's eggs.\n13:52\nBut you could imagine, once you've infected a germ cell,\n13:55\nonce you become part of a germ cell's DNA, then I'm passing\n13:59\non that viral DNA to my son or my daughter.\n14:02\nAnd they are going to pass it on to their children.\n14:05\nAnd just that idea by itself is, at least to my mind.\n14:10\nvaguely creepy.\n14:12\nAnd people estimate that 5-8%-- and this kind of really\n14:16\nblurs, it makes you think about what we as humans really\n14:19\nare-- but the estimate is 5-8% of the human genome-- so when\n14:26\nI talked about bacteria I just talked about things that were\n14:29\nalong for the ride.\n14:30\nBut the current estimate, and I looked up this a lot.\n14:33\nI found 8% someplace, 5% someplace.\n14:35\nIt's all a guess.\n14:35\nI mean people are doing it based on just looking at the\n14:37\nDNA and how similar it is to DNA in other organisms. But\n14:40\nthe estimate is 5-8% of the human genome is from viruses,\n14:47\nis from ancient retroviruses that incorporated themselves\n14:51\ninto the human germ line.\n14:53\nSo into the human DNA.\n14:55\nSo these are called endogenous retroviruses.\n15:04\nWhich is mind blowing to me, because it's not just saying\n15:07\nthese things are along for the ride or that they might help\n15:09\nus or hurt us.\n15:10\nIt's saying that we are-- 5-8% of our DNA\n15:14\nactually comes from viruses.\n15:16\nAnd this is another thing that speaks to\n15:17\njust genetic variation.\n15:19\nBecause viruses do something-- I mean this is called\n15:24\nhorizontal transfer of DNA.\n15:27\nAnd you could imagine, as a virus goes from one species to\n15:30\nthe next, as it goes from Species A to B, if it mutates\n15:37\nto be able to infiltrate these cells, it might take some--\n15:41\nit'll take the DNA that it already has, that\n15:43\nmakes it, it with it.\n15:45\nBut sometimes, when it starts coding for some of these other\n15:48\nguys, so let's say that this is a provirus right here.\n15:52\nWhere the blue part is the original virus.\n15:55\nThe yellow is the organism's historic DNA.\n16:00\nSometimes when it codes, it takes up little sections of\n16:04\nthe other organism's DNA.\n16:07\nSo maybe most of it was the viral DNA, but it might have,\n16:11\nwhen it transcribed and translated itself, it might\n16:14\nhave taken a little bit-- or at least when it translated or\n16:16\nreplicated itself-- it might take a little bit of the\n16:18\norganism's previous DNA.\n16:20\nSo it's actually cutting parts of DNA from one organism and\n16:23\nbringing it to another organism.\n16:24\nTaking it from one member of a species to another member of\n16:27\nthe species.\n16:27\nBut it can definitely go cross-species.\n16:29\nSo you have this idea all of a sudden that DNA can jump\n16:32\nbetween species.\n16:34\nIt really kind of-- I don't know, for me it makes me\n16:36\nappreciate how interconnected-- as a species,\n16:39\nwe kind of imagine that we're by ourselves and can only\n16:41\nreproduce with each other and have genetic variation within\n16:45\na population.\n16:45\nBut viruses introduce this notion of horizontal transfer\n16:50\nvia transduction.\n16:53\nHorizontal transduction is just the idea of, look when I\n16:57\nreplicate this virus, I might take a little bit of the\n17:00\norganism that I'm freeloading off of, I might take a little\n17:04\nbit of their DNA with me.\n17:06\nAnd infect that DNA into the next organism.\n17:09\nSo you actually have this DNA, this jumping,\n17:11\nfrom organism to organism.\n17:13\nSo it kind of unifies all DNA-based life.\n17:17\nWhich is all the life that we know on the planet.\n17:20\nAnd if all of this isn't creepy enough-- and actually\n17:24\nmaybe I'll save the creepiest part for the end.\n17:28\nBut there's a whole-- we could talk all about the different\n17:30\nclasses of viruses.\n17:31\nBut just so you're familiar with some of the terminology,\n17:33\nwhen a virus attacks bacteria, which they often do.\n17:37\nAnd we study these the most because this might be a good\n17:41\nalternative to antibiotics.\n17:42\nBecause viruses that attack bacteria might-- sometimes the\n17:45\nbacteria is far worse for the virus-- but these are called\n17:47\nbacteriaphages.\n17:52\nAnd I've already talked to you about how they have their DNA.\n17:55\nBut since bacteria have hard walls, they will just inject\n17:57\nthe DNA inside of the bacteria.\n18:00\nAnd when you talk about DNA, this idea of a provirus.\n18:06\nSo when a virus lyses it like this, this is\n18:09\ncalled the lytic cycle.\n18:11\nThis is just some terminology that's good to know if you're\n18:13\ngoing to take a biology exam about this stuff.\n18:16\nAnd when the virus incorporates it into the DNA\n18:18\nand lays dormant, incorporates into the DNA of the host\n18:22\norganism and lays dormant for awhile, this is called the\n18:25\nlysogenic cycle.\n18:28\nAnd normally, a provirus is essentially experiencing a\n18:32\nlysogenic cycle in eurkaryotes, in organisms that\n18:35\nhave a nuclear membrane.\n18:38\nNormally when people talk about the lysogenic cycle,\n18:40\nthey're talking about viral DNA laying dormant in the DNA\n18:44\nof bacteria.\n18:45\nOr bacteriophage DNA laying dormant\n18:48\nin the DNA of bacteria.\n18:51\nBut just to kind of give you an idea of what this, quote\n18:53\nunquote, looks like, right here.\n18:59\nI got these two pictures from Wikipedia.\n19:01\nOne is from the CDC.\n19:11\nThese little green dots you see right here all over the\n19:14\nsurface, this big thing you see here, this is a white\n19:17\nblood cell.\n19:20\nPart of the human immune system.\n19:21\nThis is a white blood cell.\n19:27\nAnd what you see emerging from the surface, essentially\n19:31\nbudding from the surface of this white blood cell-- and\n19:34\nthis gives you a sense of scale too--\n19:36\nthese are HIV-1 viruses.\n19:39\nAnd so you're familiar with the terminology, the HIV is a\n19:46\nvirus that infects white blood cells.\n19:51\nAIDS is the syndrome you get once your immune system is\n19:54\nweakened to the point.\n19:55\nAnd then many people suffer infections that people with a\n19:58\nstrong immune system normally won't suffer from.\n20:01\nBut this is creepy.\n20:03\nThese things went inside this huge cell, they used the\n20:06\ncell's own mechanism to reproduce its own DNA or its\n20:11\nown RNA and these protein capsids.\n20:14\nAnd then they bud from the cell and take a little bit of\n20:16\nthe membrane with it.\n20:17\nAnd they can even leave some of their DNA behind in this\n20:20\ncell's own DNA.\n20:22\nSo they really change what the cell is all about.\n20:25\nThis is another creepy picture.\n20:26\nThese are bacteriaphages.\n20:34\nAnd these show you what I said before.\n20:36\nThis is a bacteria right here.\n20:38\nThis is its cell wall.\n20:41\nAnd it's hard.\n20:42\nSo it's hard to just emerge into it.\n20:45\nOr you can't just merge, fuse membranes with it.\n20:47\nSo they hang out on the outside of this bacteria.\n20:52\nAnd they are essentially injecting their genetic\n20:55\nmaterial into the bacteria itself.\n20:58\nAnd you could imagine, just looking at the\n20:59\nsize of these things.\n21:01\nI mean, this is a cell.\n21:02\nAnd it looks like a whole planet or something.\n21:04\nOr this is a bacteria and these\n21:05\nthings are so much smaller.\n21:06\nRoughly 1/100 of a bacteria.\n21:08\nAnd these are much less than 1/100 of this cell we're\n21:10\ntalking about.\n21:11\nAnd they're extremely hard to filter for.\n21:15\nTo kind of keep out.\n21:16\nBecause they are such, such small particles.\n21:20\nIf you think that these are exotic things that exist for\n21:23\nthings like HIV or Ebola , which they do cause, or SARS,\n21:31\nyou're right.\n21:32\nBut they're also common things.\n21:33\nI mean, I said at the beginning of this video that I\n21:35\nhave a cold.\n21:36\nAnd I have a cold because some viruses have infected the\n21:40\ntissue in my nasal passage.\n21:42\nAnd they're causing me to have a runny nose and whatnot.\n21:46\nAnd viruses also cause the chicken pox.\n21:48\nThey cause the herpes simplex virus.\n21:50\nCauses cold sores.\n21:51\nSo they're with us all around.\n21:53\nI can almost guarantee you have some virus\n21:56\nwith you as you speak.\n21:57\nThey're all around you.\n21:58\nBut it's a very\n22:04\nphilosophically puzzling question.\n22:06\nBecause I started with, at the beginning, are these life?\n22:09\nAnd at first when I just showed it to you, look they\n22:11\nare just this protein with some nucleic\n22:13\nacid molecule in it.\n22:15\nAnd it's not doing anything.\n22:16\nAnd that doesn't look like life to me.\n22:17\nIt's not moving around.\n22:18\nIt doesn't have a metabolism.\n22:19\nIt's not eating.\n22:20\nIt's not reproducing.\n22:21\nBut then all of a sudden, when you think about what it's\n22:23\ndoing to cells and how it uses cells to kind of reproduce.\n22:27\nIt kind of like-- in business terms it's asset light.\n22:29\nIt doesn't need all of the machinery because it can use\n22:31\nother people's machinery to replicate itself.\n22:35\nYou almost kind of want to view it as a\n22:38\nsmarter form of life.\n22:39\nBecause it doesn't go through all of the trouble of what\n22:42\nevery other form of life has.\n22:44\nIt makes you question what life is, or even what we are.\n22:47\nAre we these things that contain DNA or are we just\n22:51\ntransport mechanisms for the DNA?\n22:54\nAnd these are kind of the more important things.\n22:56\nAnd these viral infections are just battles between different\n22:59\nforms of DNA and RNA and whatnot.\n23:02\nAnyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.\n23:04\nBut hopefully this gives you a good idea of what viruses are\n23:08\nand why they really are, in my mind, the most fascinating\n23:12\npseudo organism in all of biology.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nIn the video on electronegativity,\n0:03\nwe learned how to determine whether a covalent\n0:06\nbond is polar or nonpolar.\n0:07\nIn this video, we're going to see how we figure out\n0:10\nwhether molecules are polar or nonpolar\n0:12\nand also how to apply that polarity to what\n0:15\nwe call intermolecular forces.\n0:17\nIntermolecular forces are the forces\n0:20\nthat are between molecules.\n0:22\nAnd so that's different from an intramolecular force, which\n0:25\nis the force within a molecule.\n0:27\nSo a force within a molecule would\n0:29\nbe something like the covalent bond.\n0:31\nAnd an intermolecular force would\n0:33\nbe the force that are between molecules.\n0:36\nAnd so let's look at the first intermolecular force.\n0:38\nIt's called a dipole-dipole interaction.\n0:41\nAnd let's analyze why it has that name.\n0:43\nIf I look at one of these molecules of acetone here\n0:46\nand I focus in on the carbon that's double\n0:48\nbonded to the oxygen, I know that oxygen\n0:51\nis more electronegative than carbon.\n0:53\nAnd so we have four electrons in this double bond\n0:56\nbetween the carbon and the oxygen.\n0:58\nSo I'll try to highlight them right here.\n1:00\nAnd since oxygen is more electronegative,\n1:03\noxygen is going to pull those electrons closer to it,\n1:06\ntherefore giving oxygen a partial negative charge.\n1:09\nThose electrons in yellow are moving away from this carbon.\n1:12\nSo the carbon's losing a little bit of electron density,\n1:15\nand this carbon is becoming partially positive like that.\n1:19\nAnd so for this molecule, we're going\n1:22\nto get a separation of charge, a positive and a negative charge.\n1:25\nSo we have a polarized double bond situation here.\n1:27\nWe also have a polarized molecule.\n1:29\nAnd so there's two different poles, a negative\n1:32\nand a positive pole here.\n1:34\nAnd so we say that this is a polar molecule.\n1:36\nSo acetone is a relatively polar molecule.\n1:41\nThe same thing happens to this acetone molecule down here.\n1:43\nSo we get a partial negative, and we get a partial positive.\n1:46\nSo this is a polar molecule as well.\n1:49\nIt has two poles.\n1:50\nSo we call this a dipole.\n1:52\nSo each molecule has a dipole moment.\n1:55\nAnd because each molecule is polar\n1:57\nand has a separation of positive and negative charge,\n2:01\nin organic chemistry we know that opposite charges attract,\n2:04\nright?\n2:04\nSo this negatively charged oxygen\n2:06\nis going to be attracted to this positively charged carbon.\n2:09\nAnd so there's going to be an electrostatic attraction\n2:13\nbetween those two molecules.\n2:15\nAnd that's what's going to hold these two molecules together.\n2:18\nAnd you would therefore need energy\n2:20\nif you were to try to pull them apart.\n2:22\nAnd so the boiling point of acetone\n2:25\nturns out to be approximately 56 degrees Celsius.\n2:30\nAnd since room temperature is between 20 and 25,\n2:33\nat room temperature we have not reached\n2:34\nthe boiling point of acetone.\n2:36\nAnd therefore, acetone is still a liquid.\n2:38\nSo at room temperature and pressure, acetone is a liquid.\n2:42\nAnd it has to do with the intermolecular\n2:44\nforce of dipole-dipole interactions\n2:46\nholding those molecules together.\n2:49\nAnd the intermolecular force, in turn,\n2:51\ndepends on the electronegativity.\n2:54\nLet's look at another intermolecular force,\n2:56\nand this one's called hydrogen bonding.\n2:58\nSo here we have two water molecules.\n3:01\nAnd once again, if I think about these electrons\n3:05\nhere, which are between the oxygen and the hydrogen,\n3:08\nI know oxygen's more electronegative than hydrogen.\n3:11\nSo oxygen's going to pull those electrons closer to it,\n3:14\ngiving the oxygen a partial negative charge like that.\n3:18\nThe hydrogen is losing a little bit of electron density,\n3:20\ntherefore becoming partially positive.\n3:22\nThe same situation exists in the water molecule down here.\n3:26\nSo we have a partial negative, and we have a partial positive.\n3:29\nAnd so like the last example, we can\n3:31\nsee there's going to be some sort\n3:32\nof electrostatic attraction between those opposite charges,\n3:35\nbetween the negatively partially charged oxygen,\n3:38\nand the partially positive hydrogen like that.\n3:40\nAnd so this is a polar molecule.\n3:42\nOf course, water is a polar molecule.\n3:43\nAnd so you would think that this would\n3:45\nbe an example of dipole-dipole interaction.\n3:48\nAnd it is, except in this case it's\n3:51\nan even stronger version of dipole-dipole interaction\n3:54\nthat we call hydrogen bonding.\n3:56\nSo at one time it was thought that it\n3:59\nwas possible for hydrogen to form an extra bond.\n4:03\nAnd that's where the term originally comes from.\n4:06\nBut of course, it's not an actual intramolecular force.\n4:10\nWe're talking about an intermolecular force.\n4:13\nBut it is the strongest intermolecular force.\n4:16\nThe way to recognize when hydrogen bonding is present as\n4:19\nopposed to just dipole-dipole is to see\n4:22\nwhat the hydrogen is bonded to.\n4:24\nAnd so in this case, we have a very electronegative atom,\n4:28\nhydrogen, bonded-- oxygen, I should say-- bonded\n4:31\nto hydrogen.\n4:32\nAnd then that hydrogen is interacting\n4:34\nwith another electronegative atom like that.\n4:37\nSo we have a partial negative, and we have a partial positive,\n4:40\nand then we have another partial negative over here.\n4:43\nAnd this is the situation that you\n4:44\nneed to have when you have hydrogen bonding.\n4:46\nHere's your hydrogen showing intermolecular force here.\n4:50\nAnd what some students forget is that this hydrogen actually\n4:53\nhas to be bonded to another electronegative atom in order\n4:57\nfor there to be a big enough difference in electronegativity\n5:00\nfor there to be a little bit extra attraction.\n5:03\nAnd so the three electronegative elements\n5:05\nthat you should remember for hydrogen bonding\n5:08\nare fluorine, oxygen, and nitrogen.\n5:11\nAnd so the mnemonics that students use is FON.\n5:14\nSo if you remember FON as the electronegative atoms that\n5:17\ncan participate in hydrogen bonding,\n5:19\nyou should be able to remember this intermolecular force.\n5:22\nThe boiling point of water is, of course, about 100 degrees\n5:26\nCelsius, so higher than what we saw for acetone.\n5:31\nAnd this just is due to the fact that hydrogen bonding\n5:33\nis a stronger version of dipole-dipole interaction,\n5:38\nand therefore, it takes more energy or more heat\n5:40\nto pull these water molecules apart\n5:42\nin order to turn them into a gas.\n5:44\nAnd so, of course, water is a liquid at room temperature.\n5:48\nAll right.\n5:48\nLet's look at another intermolecular force.\n5:51\nAnd this one is called London dispersion forces.\n5:54\nSo these are the weakest intermolecular forces,\n5:58\nand they have to do with the electrons that are always\n6:01\nmoving around in orbitals.\n6:03\nAnd even though the methane molecule here,\n6:06\nif we look at it, we have a carbon\n6:08\nsurrounded by four hydrogens for methane.\n6:10\nAnd it's hard to tell in how I've drawn the structure here,\n6:13\nbut if you go back and you look at the video\n6:15\nfor the tetrahedral bond angle proof,\n6:17\nyou can see that in three dimensions,\n6:20\nthese hydrogens are coming off of the carbon,\n6:22\nand they're equivalent in all directions.\n6:24\nAnd there's a very small difference\n6:25\nin electronegativity between the carbon and the hydrogen.\n6:28\nAnd that small difference is canceled out\n6:30\nin three dimensions.\n6:31\nSo the methane molecule becomes nonpolar as a result of that.\n6:35\nSo this one's nonpolar, and, of course, this one's nonpolar.\n6:38\nAnd so there's no dipole-dipole interaction.\n6:40\nThere's no hydrogen bonding.\n6:42\nThe only intermolecular force that's\n6:44\nholding two methane molecules together\n6:46\nwould be London dispersion forces.\n6:48\nAnd so once again, you could think about the electrons that\n6:50\nare in these bonds moving in those orbitals.\n6:54\nAnd let's say for the molecule on the left,\n6:58\nif for a brief transient moment in time\n7:00\nyou get a little bit of negative charge\n7:01\non this side of the molecule, so it might turn out\n7:04\nto be those electrons have a net negative charge on this side.\n7:07\nAnd then for this molecule, the electrons\n7:11\ncould be moving the opposite direction,\n7:13\ngiving this a partial positive.\n7:14\nAnd so there could be a very, very small bit\n7:17\nof attraction between these two methane molecules.\n7:19\nIt's very weak, which is why London dispersion forces are\n7:23\nthe weakest intermolecular forces.\n7:24\nBut it is there.\n7:26\nAnd that's the only thing that's holding together these methane\n7:28\nmolecules.\n7:30\nAnd since it's weak, we would expect the boiling point\n7:33\nfor methane to be extremely low.\n7:35\nAnd, of course, it is.\n7:36\nSo the boiling point for methane is somewhere around negative\n7:39\n164 degrees Celsius.\n7:42\nAnd so since room temperature is somewhere around 20 to 25,\n7:46\nobviously methane has already boiled,\n7:48\nif you will, and turned into a gas.\n7:50\nSo methane is obviously a gas at room temperature and pressure.\n7:56\nNow, if you increase the number of carbons,\n7:58\nyou're going to increase the number of attractive forces\n8:03\nthat are possible.\n8:04\nAnd if you do that, you can actually\n8:07\nincrease the boiling point of other hydrocarbons\n8:10\ndramatically.\n8:11\nAnd so even though London dispersion forces\n8:13\nare the weakest, if you have larger molecules\n8:16\nand you sum up all those extra forces,\n8:18\nit can actually turn out to be rather significant when you're\n8:21\nworking with larger molecules.\n8:23\nAnd so this is just a quick summary\n8:26\nof some of the intermolecular forces\n8:28\nto show you the application of electronegativity\n8:32\nand how important it is.",

It could be\n4:21\njust this change in energy over time.\n4:23\nBut we'll learn, especially when we do quantum mechanics,\n4:25\nthat it all gets jumbled up as we start approaching the\n4:29\nscales or the size of an atom.\n4:31\nAnyway, I said this was an incorrect way of doing it.\n4:34\nWhat's the correct way?\n4:37\nSo it turns out-- this is a picture, not a picture really,\n4:40\nthis is also a depiction.\n4:42\nSo it's an interesting question, what I just said.\n4:44\nHow can you have a picture of an atom?\n4:47\nBecause is actually turns out that most wavelengths of\n4:49\nlight, especially the visible wavelengths of light, are much\n4:52\nlarger than the size of an atom.\n4:56\nEverything else we quote-unquote, observe in\n4:58\nlife, it's by reflected light.\n5:00\nBut all of a sudden when you're dealing with an atom,\n5:02\nreflected light you could almost view it as too big, or\n5:06\ntoo blunt of an instrument with which to observe an atom.\n5:09\nAnyway, this is a depiction of a helium atom.\n5:14\nA helium atom has two protons and two neutrons.\n5:18\nOr at least this helium atom has two\n5:19\nprotons and two neutrons.\n5:21\nAnd the way they depict it here in the nucleus, right\n5:24\nthere, maybe these are the two-- I'm assuming they're\n5:26\nusing red for proton and purple for neutron.\n5:32\nPurple seems like more of a neutral color.\n5:34\nAnd they're sitting at the center of this atom.\n5:39\nAnd then this whole haze around there, those are the\n5:42\ntwo electrons that helium has, or that at least\n5:45\nthis helium atom has.\n5:47\nMaybe you could gain or lose an electron.\n5:49\nBut these are the two electrons.\n5:50\nAnd you say, hey, Sal, how can two electrons be this blur\n5:55\nthat's kind of smeared around this atom.\n5:58\nAnd that's where it gets philosophically interesting.\n6:01\nSo you cannot describe an electron's path around a\n6:09\nnucleus with the traditional orbit idea that we've\n6:12\nencountered when we look at planets or if we just imagine\n6:16\nthings at kind of a larger scale.\n6:18\nIt turns out that an electron, you cannot know exactly its\n6:24\nmomentum and location at any given point in time.\n6:28\nAll you can know is a probability distribution of\n6:31\nwhere it is likely to be.\n6:33\nAnd the way they depicted this, black is a higher\n6:36\nprobability, so you're much more likely to find the\n6:39\nelectron here than you are here.\n6:42\nBut the electron really could be anywhere.\n6:43\nIt could even to be here, even though it's completely white\n6:46\nthere, with some very, very, very, very, very low\n6:49\nprobability.\n6:50\nAnd so this function of where an electron is, this is called\n6:55\nan orbital.\n6:56\nOrbital.\n6:57\nNot to be confused with orbit.\n7:00\nOrbital.\n7:02\nRemember, an orbit was something like this.\n7:05\nIt's like Venus going around the Sun.\n7:08\nSo it's very physically easy for us to imagine.\n7:12\nWhile an orbital is actually a mathematical probability\n7:16\nfunction that tells us where we're\n7:17\nlikely to find an electron.\n7:18\nWe'll deal a lot more with that when we cover quantum\n7:21\nmechanics, but that's not going to be in the scope of\n7:23\nthis kind of introductory set of chemistry lectures.\n7:26\nBut it's interesting, right?\n7:28\nAn electron's behavior is so bizarre at that scale that you\n7:32\ncan't-- I mean, to call it a particle is almost misleading.\n7:35\nIt is called a particle, but it's not a particle in the\n7:38\nsense that we're used to in our everyday life.\n7:40\nIt's this thing that you can't even say exactly where it is.\n7:45\nIt can be anywhere in this haze.\n7:47\nAnd we'll learn later that there are different shapes of\n7:49\nthe hazes is as we add more and more electrons to an atom.\n7:53\nBut to me, it starts to address philosophical issues\n7:57\nof what matter even is, or do the things we look at, how\n8:01\nreal are they?\n8:02\nOr how real are they, at least as we've defined reality?\n8:04\nAnyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.\n8:07\nBut the whole notion of electrons, protons, they're\n8:12\nall kind of predicated on this notion of charge.\n8:15\nAnd we've talked about it before when we learned about\n8:17\nCoulomb's law.\n8:18\nYou could review Coulomb's laws videos in the physics\n8:22\nplaylist. But the idea is that an electron\n8:27\nhas a negative charge.\n8:29\nA proton, sometimes written like that,\n8:31\nhas a positive charge.\n8:33\nAnd a neutron has no charge.\n8:37\nAnd so that's what was tempting about the original\n8:39\nmodel of an electron.\n8:42\nIf they say, OK, if this thing has positive charges, right?\n8:45\nSo let's say this is two neutrons and two protons.\n8:47\nLet's say it's a helium atom.\n8:48\nThen we'll have some positive charges here.\n8:51\nWe have some negative charges out here.\n8:54\nOpposite charges attract.\n8:56\nAnd so if these things had some velocity, enough\n9:03\nvelocity, they would orbit around this, just the way a\n9:08\nplanet will orbit around the Sun.\n9:10\nBut now we learn, even though this is partially true, that\n9:15\nthe further away an electron is from the nucleus, it does\n9:23\nhave more, it's true, potential energy.\n9:27\nIn that it will want to move towards the nucleus, but\n9:31\nbecause of all the mechanics at the quantum level, it won't\n9:34\njust do something simple like move in a path like that, like\n9:37\na comet would do around the Sun, it actually has this kind\n9:41\nof wave-like behavior, where it just has this probability\n9:43\nfunction that describes it.\n9:45\nBut the further away an orbital, it\n9:48\ndoes have more potential.\n9:50\nWe're going to go a lot more into that in future videos.\n9:53\nBut anyway, how do you recognize what an element is?\n9:56\nI've talked a lot about the philosophy and all of that,\n9:58\nbut how do I know that this is helium?\n10:00\nIs it by the number of neutrons it has?\n10:03\nIs it by the number of protons it has?\n10:05\nIs it by the number of electrons?\n10:07\nWell the answer is, it's by the number of protons.\n10:09\nSo if you know the number of protons in an element, you\n10:13\nknow what that element is.\n10:14\nAnd the number of protons, this is defined\n10:21\nas the atomic number.\n10:26\nNow, so let's say I said something has four protons.\n10:33\nHow do we know what it is?\n10:34\nWell if we haven't memorized it, we could look it up on the\n10:37\nperiodic table of elements, which we'll be dealing with a\n10:39\nlot in this playlist. And you'd say, oh, four protons,\n10:43\nthat is beryllium.\n10:45\nRight there.\n10:46\nAnd the atomic number is the number that you see up there.\n10:50\nAnd that' s literally the number of protons.\n10:52\nAnd that is what differentiates\n10:55\none atom from another.\n10:56\nIf you have fifteen protons, you're dealing with\n10:59\nphosphorus.\n11:00\nAnd all of a sudden, if you have seven protons, you're\n11:06\ndealing with nitrogen.\n11:07\nIf you have eight, you're dealing with oxygen.\n11:09\nThat is what defines the element.\n11:11\nNow, we'll talk in the future about what happens with charge\n11:15\nand all of that.\n11:17\nOr what happens when you gain or lose electrons.\n11:19\nBut that does not change what element you're dealing with.\n11:21\nAnd likewise, when you change the number of neutrons, that\n11:26\nalso does not change the element you're dealing with.\n11:30\nBut that leads to an obvious question of, well, how many\n11:32\nneutrons and electrons do you have?\n11:35\nWell, if an atom is charge-neutral, that means it\n11:43\nhas the same number of electrons.\n11:46\nSo let's say that I have carbon.\n11:52\nIts atomic number is six.\n11:53\nAnd let's say its mass number is twelve.\n12:00\nNow what does this mean?\n12:01\nAnd let me say further that this is a neutral particle.\n12:05\nThis is a neutral atom.\n12:07\nSo the atomic number for carbon is six.\n12:10\nThat tells us exactly how many protons it has.\n12:13\nSo if I were to draw a little model here, and this is in no\n12:16\nway an accurate model.\n12:17\nI'll draw six-- two, three, four, five, six\n12:21\nprotons in the center.\n12:23\nAnd the weight of these protons, each proton is one\n12:26\natomic mass unit, and we'll talk more about how that\n12:28\nrelates to kilograms. It's a very small\n12:31\nfraction of a kilogram.\n12:32\nRoughly I think it's 1.6 times 10 to the\n12:36\nminus 27th of a kilogram.\n12:38\nSo let's say each of these are one atomic mass unit, and\n12:45\nthat's approximately equal to, I think, 1.67 times 10 to the\n12:48\nminus 27 kilograms. This is a very small number.\n12:53\nIt's actually almost impossible to visualize.\n12:57\nAt least it is for me.\n12:58\nThis tells me the mass of the entire carbon atom, of this\n13:03\nparticular carbon atom.\n13:04\nAnd this can actually change from carbon\n13:05\natom to carbon atom.\n13:07\nAnd this is essentially the mass of all of the protons\n13:10\nplus all of the neutrons.\n13:12\nAnd each proton has an atomic mass of one, in atomic mass\n13:17\nunits, and each neutron has an atomic mass of\n13:20\none atomic mass unit.\n13:22\nSo this is really the number of protons plus\n13:28\nthe number of neutrons.\n13:33\nSo in this case we have six protons, so we must also have\n13:37\nsix neutrons.\n13:39\nSix neutrons plus six protons.\n13:42\nNow, where are the electrons?\n13:44\nWell, I said it's neutral, so the proton has an equal\n13:49\npositive charge as the electron's negative charge.\n13:51\nSo this is a neutral atom, and it has six protons, so it also\n13:55\nhas six electrons.\n13:56\nLet me draw that.\n13:57\nSo we said it has six neutrons in here.\n13:59\nOne, two, three, four, five, six.\n14:01\nSo that's the nucleus right there.\n14:04\nAnd then if we were to draw the electons-- well, I could\n14:09\ndraw it as a smear, but if we want to kind of visualize it a\n14:12\nlittle better, we could say, OK, there's going to be six\n14:13\nelectrons orbiting.\n14:15\nOne, two, three, four, five, six.\n14:18\nAnd they're going to be moving around in this unpredictable\n14:21\nway that we would have to describe with\n14:22\na probability function.\n14:24\nAnd so the interesting thing about it is, most of the mass\n14:30\nof an atom is sitting right in here.\n14:32\nI mean, you might notice that when people care about the\n14:34\nmass, when they care about the atomic mass number of an atom,\n14:40\nthey ignore the electrons.\n14:41\nAnd that's because the mass of a proton, one proton\n14:47\nmass-wise, is equal to 1,836 electons.\n14:52\nSo for thinking about the mass of an atom, for all basic\n14:58\npurposes, you can ignore the mass of an electron.\n15:01\nIt's really the mass of the nucleus that counts as the\n15:08\nmass of the atom.\n15:10\nNow, you might see this periodic table here, and you\n15:12\nsay, OK, they gave us the atomic number up there.\n15:15\nThe atomic number of oxygen is eight.\n15:18\nIt means it has eight protons.\n15:20\nThe atomic number of silicon is 14.\n15:22\nIt has 14 protons.\n15:24\nNow what is this right here?\n15:27\nLet's see, in carbon.\n15:28\nIn carbon they have this 12.0107.\n15:34\nThat is the atomic weight of carbon.\n15:36\nLet me write this.\n15:41\nAtomic weight of carbon.\n15:47\nThe atomic weight of carbon is 12.0107.\n15:56\nNow, what does that mean?\n15:57\nDoes that mean that carbon has six protons and then the\n16:03\nremainder, the remaining 6.0107 neutrons, it has kind\n16:09\nof this fraction of a neutron?\n16:11\nNo.\n16:12\nIt means if you were to average all the different\n16:16\nversions of carbon you find on the planet and you were to\n16:19\naverage the number of neutrons based on the quantity of the\n16:25\ndifferent types of carbon, this is the\n16:27\naverage you would get.\n16:28\nSo it turns out that carbon, the two major forms, the main\n16:32\none you'll find is carbon-12.\n16:35\nSo that's like this.\n16:36\nSo that has six protons and six neutrons.\n16:39\nAnd then another isotope of carbon.\n16:42\nNow an isotope is the same element with a different\n16:45\nnumber of neutrons.\n16:46\nAnother isotope of carbon is carbon-14, which is much more\n16:50\nscarce on the planet.\n16:52\nWe don't know how much in the universe, but on the planet.\n16:55\nNow, if you were to average these, not just a straight-up\n16:58\naverage, then you would get carbon-13 and then the atomic\n17:01\nweight would be 13, but you weight this one much higher\n17:04\nbecause this exists in much larger quantities on Earth.\n17:07\nI mean, this is pretty much all of the\n17:08\ncarbon that you see.\n17:09\nBut there's a little bit of this.\n17:10\nSo if you weight them appropriately, the average\n17:13\nbecomes this.\n17:14\nSo most of the carbon you'll find-- if you just found\n17:17\ncarbon someplace, on average its weight in atomic mass\n17:22\nunits is going to be 12.0107.\n17:27\nBut that idea of an isotope is an interesting one.\n17:29\nRemember, when you change the neutrons, you're not changing\n17:32\nthe actual, fundamental element.\n17:33\nYou're just getting a different isotope, a different\n17:36\nversion, of the element.\n17:37\nSo these two versions of carbon are both isotopes.\n17:41\nNow, I want to leave this video with what I think is\n17:43\nkind of the neatest idea behind atoms. And it's the\n17:46\nmost philosophically interesting things about them.\n17:49\nIt's that the relative size-- so, we have these electrons,\n17:54\nwhich represent very little of the mass of an atom.\n17:58\nIt's 1/2000 of the mass of an atom are the electrons.\n18:01\nAnd even those, it's hard to even describe them as\n18:04\nparticles, because you can't even tell me exactly where and\n18:08\nhow fast one of these particles is moving.\n18:11\nThey just have a probability function.\n18:12\nSo most of the atom is sitting inside the nucleus.\n18:16\nAnd this is the interesting thing.\n18:17\nIf you look at an atom on average, if you\n18:21\nsay this is my atom.\n18:23\nLet's say I had two atoms that are bonded to each other.\n18:26\nAnd I were to say, how much of this is actual stuff?\n18:29\nAnd when I say stuff, that's a very abstract concept, because\n18:32\nwe're talking about the nucleus, right?\n18:33\nBecause the nucleus is where all the\n18:34\nmass is, all the stuff.\n18:36\nIt turns out that it's actually an infinitesimally\n18:39\nsmall fraction of the volume of the atom where-- the volume\n18:44\nof the atom is hard to define, because the electron can\n18:45\npretty much be anywhere, but if you view the volume as\n18:48\nwhere you're most likely to find the electron, or with 90%\n18:52\nprobability you're likely to find the electron, then the\n18:55\nnucleus is, in a lot of cases and the way I think about it,\n18:59\nit's about 1/10,000 of the volume.\n19:01\nSo if you think about it, when you look at something, if you\n19:03\nlook at your hand or if you look at the wall or if you\n19:06\nlook at your computer, 99.999% of it is free space.\n19:14\nIt's nothing.\n19:15\nIt's vacuum.\n19:18\nIf you had ultra-small-- I guess we could call them\n19:20\nparticles or something-- most of them would pass straight\n19:23\nthrough whatever you look at.\n19:24\nSo it already starts to kind of\n19:26\nquestion our hold on reality.\n19:28\nWhat is there when, if-- and this is fact, this isn't\n19:32\ntheory right here-- that if you take anything down to the\n19:35\nbuilding blocks, down to the atomic level, most of the\n19:39\nspace of that kind of, quote-unquote object, is free\n19:43\nvacuum space.\n19:44\nYou could go straight through it if you could get down to\n19:46\nthat scale.\n19:47\nThis image of a helium atom, they say right here this is\n19:50\none femtometer.\n19:52\nRight?\n19:52\nOne femtometer.\n19:57\nThis is the scale of the nucleus of a\n20:00\nhelium atom, right?\n20:01\nOne femtometer.\n20:03\nThis is one angstrom, right?\n20:04\nAnd they say that equals 100,000 femtometers.\n20:06\nAnd just to get a sense of scale, one angstrom is 1 times\n20:10\n10 to the negative 10 meters, right?\n20:13\nSo the atom is roughly on the scale of an angstrom.\n20:15\nIn the case of helium, the nucleus is\n20:17\neven a smaller fraction.\n20:18\nIt's 1/100,000.\n20:20\nSo if you had-- let's say you had liquid helium, which you'd\n20:23\nhave to get very cold to get.\n20:25\nIf you're looking at that, most of it is free space.\n20:27\nIf you're looking at an iron bar, the great, great, great,\n20:30\ngreat, great, great majority of it is free space.\n20:33\nAnd we're not even talking about, maybe there's some free\n20:35\nspace inside the nucleus that we could talk\n20:37\nabout in the future.\n20:38\nBut to me, that just blows my mind that most things we look\n20:41\nat are not really solid.\n20:44\nThey're really just empty space, but they look solid\n20:47\nbecause of the way light reflects on them or the forces\n20:50\nthat repel us.\n20:51\nBut there really isn't something to touch there.\n20:55\nThat most of this right here is all free space.\n20:57\nI think I've said the word free space now, and I think\n21:00\nI'll leave further\n21:02\nmind-blowing to the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nMy goal in this video and the next video\n0:02\nis to start giving a sense of the scale\n0:06\nof the earth and the solar system.\n0:08\nAnd as we see, as we start getting\n0:09\ninto to the galaxy and the universe,\n0:11\nit just becomes almost impossible to imagine.\n0:13\nBut we'll at least give our best shot.\n0:16\nSo I think most of us watching this video\n0:18\nknow that this right here is earth.\n0:22\nAnd just to get a sense of scale here,\n0:24\nI think probably the largest distance\n0:27\nthat we can somehow relate to is about 100 miles.\n0:29\nYou can get into a car for an hour, hour and a half,\n0:32\nand go about 100 miles.\n0:33\nAnd on the earth that would be about this far.\n0:36\nIt would be a speck that would look something like that.\n0:40\nThat is 100 miles.\n0:42\nAnd also to get us a bit of scale,\n0:44\nlet's think about a speed that at least we\n0:46\ncan kind of comprehend.\n0:47\nAnd that would be, maybe, the speed of a bullet.\n0:56\nMaybe we can't comprehend it, but I'll\n0:58\nsay this is the fastest thing that we could maybe comprehend.\n1:01\nIt goes about-- and there are different types of bullets\n1:05\ndepending on the type of gun and all of that-- about 280 meters\n1:09\nper second, which is about 1,000 kilometers per hour.\n1:18\nAnd this is also roughly the speed of a jet.\n1:27\nSo just to give a sense of scale here,\n1:29\nthe earth's circumference-- so if you\n1:33\nwere to go around the planet-- is about 40,000 kilometers.\n1:47\nSo if you were to travel at the speed of a bullet\n1:51\nor the speed of a jetliner, at 1,000 kilometers an hour,\n1:55\nit would take you 40 hours to circumnavigate the earth.\n2:06\nAnd I think none of this information is too surprising.\n2:09\nYou might have taken a 12- or 15-hour flight that\n2:12\ngets you-- not all the way around the earth--\n2:14\nbut gets you pretty far.\n2:15\nSan Francisco to Australia, or something like that.\n2:18\nSo right now these aren't scales that are too crazy.\n2:21\nAlthough, even for me, the earth itself\n2:24\nis a pretty mind-blowingly large object.\n2:27\nNow, with that out of the way let's think about the sun.\n2:30\nBecause the sun starts to approach something far huger.\n2:34\nSo this obviously here is the sun.\n2:36\nAnd I think most people appreciate\n2:38\nthat the sun is much larger than the earth,\n2:42\nand that it's pretty far away from the earth.\n2:44\nBut I don't think most people, including myself,\n2:47\nfully appreciate how large the sun is\n2:50\nor how far it is away from the earth.\n2:53\nSo just to give you a sense, the sun\n2:58\nis 109 times the circumference of the earth.\n3:10\nSo if we do that same thought exercise there--\n3:13\nif we said, OK, if I'm traveling at the speed of a bullet\n3:16\nor the speed of a jetliner, it would take me 40 hours\n3:19\nto go around the earth.\n3:20\nWell, how long would it take to go around the sun?\n3:23\nSo if you were to get on a jet plane\n3:26\nand try to go around the sun, or if you\n3:27\nwere to somehow ride a bullet and try to go around\n3:30\nthe sun-- do a complete circumnavigation of the sun--\n3:34\nit's going to take you 109 times as long\n3:36\nas it would have taken you to do the earth.\n3:38\nSo it would be 100 times-- I could do 109,\n3:42\nbut just for approximate-- it's roughly 100\n3:44\ntimes the circumference of the earth.\n3:46\nSo 109 times 40 is equal to 4,000 hours.\n3:53\nAnd just to get a sense of what 4,000 is-- actually,\n3:56\nsince I have the calculator out, let's do the exact calculation.\n3:59\nIt's 109 times the circumference of the earth times 40 hours.\n4:06\nThat's what it would take to do the circumference of the Earth.\n4:09\nSo it's 4,360 hours to circumnavigate the sun, going\n4:15\nat the speed of a bullet or a jetliner.\n4:17\nAnd so that is-- 24 hours in the day-- that is 181 days.\n4:23\nIt would take you roughly half a year\n4:27\nto go around the sun at the speed of a jetliner.\n4:30\nLet me write this down.\n4:31\nHalf a year.\n4:37\nThe sun is huge.\n4:41\nNow, that by itself may or may not be surprising--and actually\n4:44\nlet me give you a sense of scale here,\n4:45\nbecause I have this other diagram of a sun.\n4:49\nAnd we'll talk more about the rest\n4:51\nof the solar system in the next video.\n4:52\nBut over here, at this scale, the sun,\n4:56\nat least on my screen-- if I were to complete it,\n4:58\nit would probably be about 20 inches in diameter.\n5:01\nThe earth is just this little thing over here, smaller\n5:04\nthan a raindrop.\n5:09\nIf I were to draw it on this scale, where the sun is even\n5:11\nsmaller, the earth would be about that big.\n5:17\nNow, what isn't obvious, because we've all done our science\n5:21\nprojects in third and fourth grade--or we always see these\n5:24\ndiagrams of the solar system that look something like this--\n5:27\nis that these planets are way further away.\n5:29\nEven though these are depicted to scale,\n5:33\nthey're way further away from the sun\n5:35\nthan this makes it look.\n5:38\nSo the earth is 150 million kilometers from the sun.\n5:48\nSo if this is the sun right here, at this scale\n5:55\nyou wouldn't even be able to see the earth.\n5:57\nIt wouldn't even be a pixel.\n5:59\nBut it would be 150 million kilometers from the earth.\n6:13\nAnd this distance right here is called an astronomical unit--\n6:15\nand we'll be using that term in the next few videos\n6:18\njust because it's an easier way to think about distance--\n6:21\nsometimes abbreviated AU, astronomical unit.\n6:30\nAnd just to give a sense of how far this is, light, which\n6:34\nis something that we think is almost infinitely fast\n6:36\nand that is something that looks instantaneous,\n6:38\nthat takes eight minutes to travel from the sun\n6:41\nto the earth.\n6:42\nIf the sun were to disappear, it would take eight minutes for us\n6:47\nto know that it disappeared on earth.\n6:49\nOr another way, just to put it in the sense of this jet\n6:53\nairplane-- let's get the calculator back out.\n6:56\nSo we're talking about 150 million kilometers.\n7:07\nSo if we're going at 1,000 kilometers an hour,\n7:11\nit would take us 150,000 hours at the speed of a bullet\n7:15\nor at the speed of a jet plane to get to the sun.\n7:18\nAnd just to put that in perspective,\n7:20\nif we want it in days, there's 24 hours per day.\n7:25\nSo this would be 6,250 days.\n7:28\nOr, if we divided by 365, roughly 17 years.\n7:33\nIf you were to shoot a bullet straight at the sun\n7:35\nit would take 17 years to get there,\n7:38\nif it could maintain its velocity somehow.\n7:40\nSo this would take a bullet or a jet plane\n7:42\n17 years to get to the sun.\n7:49\nOr another way to visualize it-- this sun right over here,\n7:52\non my screen it has about a five- or six-inch diameter.\n7:56\nIf I were to actually do it at scale, this little dot\n7:59\nright here, which is the earth, this\n8:02\nspeck-- I would have to put this back about 50 feet\n8:09\naway from the sun.\n8:10\n50 or 60 feet away from the sun.\n8:12\nIf you were to look at the solar system--\n8:14\nand obviously there's other things in the solar system,\n8:16\nand we'll talk more about them in the next video--\n8:18\nyou wouldn't even notice this speck.\n8:19\nThis is a little dust thing flying around this sun.\n8:23\nAnd as we go further and further out of this solar system,\n8:25\nyou're going to see even this distance starts\n8:27\nto become ridiculously small.\n8:29\nOr another way to think about it--\n8:31\nif the sun was about this size, then the earth at this scale\n8:39\nwould be about 200 feet away from it.\n8:42\nSo you could imagine, if you had a football field-- let\n8:47\nme draw a football field.\n8:49\nThese are the end zones-- one end zone, another end zone.\n8:52\nAnd if you were to stick something--\n8:53\nmaybe the size of a medicine ball,\n8:55\na little bit bigger than a basketball, at one end zone--\n8:58\nthis little speck would be about 60 yards away,\n9:03\nroughly 60 meters away.\n9:04\nSo it's this little speck.\n9:05\nYou wouldn't even notice it on the scale of a football\n9:07\nfield, something this size.\n9:09\nAnyway, I'm going to leave you there.\n9:10\nHopefully that just starts to blow your mind\n9:13\nwhen you think about the scale of the sun, the earth,\n9:17\nand how far the earth is away from the sun.\n9:19\nAnd then we're going to see even those distances, even\n9:22\nthose scales, are super small when you start thinking\n9:24\nabout the rest of the solar system.\n9:27\nAnd especially when we start going beyond the solar system.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nRight now, the prevailing theory of how the universe came about\n0:04\nis commonly called the Big Bang theory.\n0:11\nAnd really is just this idea that the universe started\n0:14\nas kind of this infinitely small point, this infinitely\n0:17\nsmall singularity.\n0:19\nAnd then it just had a big bang or it just expanded\n0:23\nfrom that state to the universe that we know right now.\n0:26\nAnd when I first imagined this-- and I\n0:28\nthink if it's also a byproduct of how it's named-- Big Bang,\n0:31\nyou kind of imagine this type of explosion,\n0:37\nthat everything was infinitely packed in together\n0:40\nand then it exploded.\n0:42\nAnd then it exploded outward.\n0:44\nAnd then as all of the matter exploded outward,\n0:47\nit started to condense.\n0:48\nAnd then you have these little galaxies\n0:51\nand super clusters of galaxies.\n0:53\nAnd they started to condense.\n0:54\nAnd then within them, planets condensed and stars condensed.\n0:58\nAnd then we have the type of universe\n1:00\nthat we have right now.\n1:01\nBut this model for visualizing the Big Bang\n1:05\nhas a couple of problems.\n1:06\nOne is when we talk about the Big Bang,\n1:08\nwe're not talking about the matter, just the mass or just\n1:12\nthe matter in the universe being in one point.\n1:14\nWe're talking about actual space expanding.\n1:18\nSo we're not just talking about something inside of space,\n1:21\nlike the physical mass, the physical matter expanding.\n1:23\nWe're talking about space itself.\n1:25\nAnd so when you have this type of model,\n1:27\nyou have all of this stuff expanding.\n1:29\nBut you're like, whoa, look, isn't it\n1:30\nexpanding into something else?\n1:32\nMaybe if the furthest out parts of this matter\n1:36\nis right over here, what's this stuff over here?\n1:40\nAnd so you say, well, wouldn't that be space?\n1:43\nSo how can you say space itself is expanding?\n1:46\nAnd another idea that a Big Bang also\n1:49\nimplies is if this is the furthest stuff out there,\n1:51\nwould this be the edge of the universe?\n1:55\nDoes the universe have an edge?\n1:58\nAnd the answer to either of those questions,\n2:00\nand that's what we're going to try to tackle in this,\n2:02\nis that, one, the universe does not have an edge.\n2:05\nAnd two, there is no outside space.\n2:09\nWe are not expanding into another space.\n2:11\nAnd I'm going to explain that.\n2:12\nHopefully, we'll see why that is the case right now.\n2:15\nSo the best way to view it-- and we're\n2:16\ngoing to view it by analogy.\n2:19\nIf I were tell you that I have a two-dimensional space that\n2:31\nhas a finite area, so it has a finite area--\n2:37\nso it's not infinite.\n2:38\nAnd it also has no edge.\n2:43\nThis once again, when you first look at it, seems difficult.\n2:47\nHow do I just construct something\n2:49\nthat has a finite area, but still has no edge?\n2:51\nEvery time I try to draw an area,\n2:53\nit looks like I have to have some edges.\n2:55\nAnd then you might remember, what\n2:57\nif that two-dimensional space is curved, what happens?\n3:00\nAnd I think the easiest example of that\n3:02\nis the surface of a sphere.\n3:06\nLet me draw a sphere over here.\n3:09\nSo this right here is a sphere.\n3:11\nLet me draw some longitude and latitudinal\n3:16\nlines on this sphere.\n3:18\nOn this sphere, all of a sudden-- and I'll\n3:20\nshade it in a little bit, make it\n3:21\nlook nice-- this type of a sphere, you have a finite area.\n3:25\nYou could imagine the surface of a balloon,\n3:27\nor the surface of a bubble, or the surface of the Earth.\n3:30\nYou have a finite area, but you have no edge.\n3:33\nIf you keep going forever in one direction,\n3:39\nyou're going to go all the way around and come back\n3:42\nto the other side.\n3:44\nNow, to imagine a three-dimensional space\n3:47\nthat has these same properties, a finite area\n3:50\nand-- and I don't want to say finite area anymore,\n3:52\nbecause we're not talking about a three-dimensional space.\n3:55\nLet me draw it over here.\n3:56\nSo let's think about a three-dimensional space, so\n4:00\na three-dimensional space.\n4:07\nInstead of area, since we're in three dimensions now,\n4:10\nI want to talk about a finite volume and no edge.\n4:20\nHow do I do that?\n4:21\nAnd when you think about it superficially,\n4:23\nwell, look, if I have a finite volume,\n4:25\nmaybe it'll be contained in some type of a cube.\n4:29\nAnd then we clearly have edges in those situations.\n4:32\nOr you could even think about a finite volume\n4:34\nas being the inside of a sphere.\n4:36\nAnd that clearly has an edge, this entire surface over there.\n4:39\nSo how do you construct a three-dimensional space\n4:41\nthat has a finite volume and no edge?\n4:43\nAnd that I'm going to tell you right now,\n4:45\nit's very hard for us to visualize it.\n4:48\nBut in order to visualize it, I'm\n4:49\nessentially going to draw the same thing\n4:51\nas I drew right here.\n4:52\nWhat you have to imagine, and you almost\n4:54\nhave to imagine it by analogy, unless you\n4:56\nhave some type of a profound brain wired\n4:59\nfor more than three spatial dimensions, is a sphere.\n5:06\nSo let me make it clear.\n5:08\nThis is a two-dimensional surface.\n5:15\nOn the surface of the sphere, you\n5:17\ncan only move into directions, two perpendicular directions.\n5:20\nYou could move like that or you could move like that.\n5:23\nYou could move left and right or you could move up and down.\n5:25\nSo it's a two-dimensional surface\n5:29\nof a three-dimensional sphere.\n5:35\nSo if we take it by analogy, let's imagine,\n5:38\nand it's hard to imagine, a three-dimensional surface.\n5:45\nAnd you can do it mathematically.\n5:46\nThe math here is actually not that difficult.\n5:48\nIt's a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere.\n6:00\nAnd I'm going to draw it the same way.\n6:02\nSo if we kind of view those three dimensions\n6:04\nare just these two dimensions of the surface, the same thing.\n6:07\nIt's the same thing.\n6:09\nAnd if you imagine that-- I'm not\n6:10\nsaying that this is actually the shape of the universe.\n6:12\nWe don't know the actual shape.\n6:15\nBut we do know that it does have a slight curvature.\n6:17\nWe don't know the actual shape, but a sphere is the simplest.\n6:20\nThere's other ones we could do.\n6:22\nA toroid would also fit the bill of having a finite volume\n6:25\nwith no edge.\n6:26\nAnd another thing, I want to make it clear,\n6:28\nwe actually don't even know whether it\n6:29\nhas just a finite volume.\n6:31\nThat's still an open question.\n6:32\nBut what I want to do is show you\n6:34\nthat it can have a finite volume and also have no edge.\n6:38\nAnd most people believe-- and I want to say \"believe\" here\n6:43\nbecause we can just go based on evidence and all\n6:45\nthat-- that we are talking about something with a finite volume,\n6:49\nespecially when you talk about the Big Bang theory.\n6:52\nThat kind of, on some dimension, implies a finite volume,\n6:56\nalthough it could be a super large, unfathomably large\n6:59\nvolume, it is finite.\n7:01\nNow, if you have this, let's imagine this sphere.\n7:05\nLet's imagine this sphere.\n7:06\nOnce again, if you're on this surface\n7:09\nof this four-dimensional sphere--\n7:11\nI obviously can not draw a four-dimensional sphere.\n7:14\nBut if you're on the surface of this four-dimensional sphere,\n7:17\nif you go in any direction, you'll come back out\n7:20\nand come back to where you started.\n7:22\nIf you go that way, you'll come back around here.\n7:25\nNow, the universe is super huge.\n7:26\nSo even light, maybe light itself\n7:29\nwill take an unbelievable amount of time to traverse it.\n7:32\nAnd if this sphere itself is expanding,\n7:35\nit might be expanding so fast that light might not ever\n7:39\nbe able to come back around it.\n7:40\nBut in theory, if something were fast enough,\n7:42\nif something were to keep going around,\n7:44\nit could eventually go back to this point.\n7:47\nNow, when we talk about a three-dimensional surface--\n7:50\nit's a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere--\n7:53\nthat means that any of the three dimensions-- over here,\n7:56\non the surface, I can only draw two.\n7:57\nBut that means if this is true, if the universe is\n8:01\na three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere, that\n8:06\nmeans that if you go up and you just keep going up,\n8:09\nyou'll eventually come back from the bottom.\n8:12\nSo if you keep going all the way up,\n8:16\nyou'll eventually come back to the point that you were.\n8:18\nIt might be an unbelievably large distance,\n8:20\nbut you'll eventually get back where you were.\n8:23\nIf you go to the right, you'll eventually\n8:25\ncome back all the way around to the point where you were.\n8:28\nAnd if you were to go into the page--\n8:29\nso if you were to go into the page--\n8:31\nlet me draw it that way-- if you go into the page,\n8:33\nyou would eventually come back from above the page\n8:36\nand come back to the point that you are.\n8:38\nSo that's what this implication would be.\n8:41\nThat you would eventually get back to where you are.\n8:43\nSo let's go back to the question of an expanding universe,\n8:46\na expanding universe that's not expanding into any other space.\n8:50\nThat is all of the space, but it's still expanding.\n8:53\nWell, this is the model.\n8:54\nSo you could imagine shortly after the Big Bang,\n8:57\nour four-dimensional sphere looked like this.\n9:01\nMaybe it was a little small four-dimensional sphere.\n9:05\nMaybe right at the Big Bang, it was\n9:07\nlike this little unbelievably small sphere.\n9:09\nThen a little bit later, it's this larger sphere.\n9:12\nLet me just shade it in to show you\n9:15\nthat it's kind of popping out of the page, that's it's a sphere.\n9:18\nAnd then at a later time, the sphere might look like this.\n9:21\nThe sphere might look like this.\n9:25\nNow, your temptation might be to say, wait,\n9:28\nSal, isn't this stuff outside of this sphere,\n9:31\nisn't that some type of a space that it's expanding into?\n9:34\nIsn't that somehow part of the universe?\n9:37\nAnd I would say if you're talking in three dimensions,\n9:40\nno, it's not.\n9:41\nThe entire universe is this surface.\n9:44\nIt is this surface of this four-dimensional sphere.\n9:47\nIf you start talking about more dimensions,\n9:49\nthen, yes, you could talk about maybe things outside\n9:52\nof our three-dimensional universe.\n9:56\nSo as this expands in space/time--\n9:59\nso one way to view the fourth dimension\n10:01\nis it is time itself-- things are just\n10:03\ngetting further and further apart.\n10:05\nAnd I'll talk about more evidence in future videos\n10:07\nfor why the Big Bang is the best theory we have out there right\n10:11\nnow.\n10:12\nBut as you could imagine, if you have\n10:14\ntwo points on this sphere that are that far apart,\n10:17\nas this sphere expands, this four-dimensional sphere, as\n10:20\nthis bubble blows up or this balloon blows up,\n10:23\nthose two points are just-- let me draw three points.\n10:25\nLet's say those are three points.\n10:26\nThose three points are just going\n10:28\nto get further and further apart.\n10:30\nAnd that's actually one of the main points that-- or one\n10:35\nof the first reasons why it made sense to believe the Big Bang--\n10:37\nis that everything is expanding, not from some central point.\n10:40\nBut everything is expanding from everything.\n10:43\nThat if you go in any direction from any point in the universe,\n10:46\neverything else is expanding away.\n10:47\nAnd the further away you go, it looks\n10:48\nlike the faster it's expanding away from you.\n10:52\nSo I'll leave you there, something for you\n10:53\nto kind of think about a little bit.\n10:55\nAnd then we'll build on some of this\n10:57\nto think about what it means to kind of observe\n11:00\nthe observable universe.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nNow that we've touched on all of the major players in the\n0:02\nspecific immune system, what I thought I would do in this\n0:05\nvideo is do a summary so it all fits\n0:08\ntogether a little bit.\n0:09\nSo the first person or character we got exposed to\n0:12\nwas the B cell, which I always do in blue.\n0:18\nAnd what made that interesting is that every B cell has its\n0:22\nown specific-- or they have membrane bound antibodies, but\n0:28\nfor each B cell, the membrane bound antibodies on each\n0:33\nspecific B cell had its own variable portion.\n0:36\nSo this B cell-- it'll be variable right like that.\n0:41\nAnd if I were to draw another B cell right here, I would\n0:45\ndraw the variable portion a little bit different.\n0:47\nThis is why different actual B cells will respond to\n0:51\ndifferent antigens or different pathogens that have\n0:54\nentered our system.\n0:55\nAnd a B cell gets activated-- let's talk about what happens\n1:05\nwhen it gets activated or what needs to happen.\n1:10\nIt needs binding of the pathogen onto one of these\n1:15\nmembrane bound antibodies.\n1:28\nBut that's not all.\n1:29\nI mean, sometimes that's all you need, but usually you also\n1:33\nneed to be stimulated by a T cell.\n1:41\nAnd you might say, where's the helper T cell\n1:44\nstimulate this guy?\n1:46\nWell, B cells were also antigen presenting cells so\n1:49\nhe'll suck this guy in, break him out, and present him on an\n1:53\nMHC II complex.\n2:00\nLet's say this is an MHC II complex.\n2:03\nThis guy gets cut up, part of him gets presented right here,\n2:06\nand then an activated helper T cell whose variable portion of\n2:12\ntheir T cell receptor is specific to this could come\n2:15\nalong and activate this character.\n2:20\nI'm not drawing that receptor well, but that right there is\n2:24\na helper T cell and that is the B cell.\n2:28\nNow, once it's activated, it starts differentiating-- and\n2:33\nit starts cloning itself and it can either turn into\n2:35\neffector cells-- and this true of B cells or T cells.\n2:41\nOnce they get activated, they keep cloning or they either\n2:43\nturn into effector cells or memory cells.\n2:46\nMemory cells stick around a lot longer so that in the\n2:49\nfuture you're going to have many more of this\n2:51\nversion of B cells.\n2:52\nSo if you get the same antigen or pathogen in the future, the\n2:56\nlikelihood of it bumping into this type of B cell is going\n2:59\nto be higher so the response will occur faster.\n3:02\nThe effector B cells produce-- they essentially turn into\n3:10\nantibody making machines.\n3:12\nSo they'll say, gee, this antibody bonds to this antigen\n3:16\nthat we have in the system now.\n3:18\nLet me just produce a ton of them.\n3:20\nSo it starts building up all of the cellular machinery and\n3:23\nit starts producing antibodies like crazy.\n3:26\nI want to point out one thing that my wife pointed out to me\n3:29\nwhen I was-- she overheard me making the last video and\n3:32\nshe's a fellow in hematology and a lot of hematology is\n3:35\nimmunology.\n3:36\nSo I definitely have to defer to her.\n3:38\nShe is the expert on this.\n3:41\nIn the last video, I kind of very hand-wavingly said, B\n3:45\ncells, once they get activated, if they're the\n3:47\neffector B cells, they produce antibodies.\n3:49\nI want to be very clear.\n3:50\nIt is only the effector B cells that produce the\n3:52\nantibodies and the common term for them-- if someone were to\n3:57\nwalk up to you and say, what cells in the body are\n4:01\nproducing antibodies?\n4:02\nYou wouldn't be wrong if you said effector B cells, but the\n4:05\ncommon term that people expect to hear are plasma cells.\n4:12\nPlasma cells and effector B cells are the same thing, but\n4:16\nnormally when they say, what happens to a B cell when it\n4:18\nstarts producing antibodies?\n4:20\nThey then call it a plasma cell.\n4:21\nThey don't call it a B cell anymore and I want to make\n4:23\nthat very clear because my wife's like, well, I have\n4:24\nattendings that if they asked me, what cell in the body\n4:28\nproduces antibodies?\n4:29\nAnd if you said, B cell, they would say, no, wrong.\n4:32\nIt's a plasma cell-- or if you said effector B cell, they\n4:34\nwouldn't be happy.\n4:35\nThey wanted to hear plasma cell.\n4:36\nThis is the common term used in immunology and apparently\n4:44\nrheumatology circles.\n4:45\nDid I just say my wife is a hematologist?\n4:47\nNo, no.\n4:47\nShe's studying rheumatology.\n4:48\nI get confused with all the tologies sometimes.\n4:51\nAnyway, that's what the B cells do.\n4:52\nAnd these antibodies can then go attach things and mess up\n4:55\nviruses and antigen-- well, viruses or instances of\n4:58\nantigens and bacteria-- and tag them for pick up by\n5:02\nmacrophages or other types of phagocytes.\n5:04\nThose were the B cells.\n5:06\nThen you have your T cells.\n5:09\nAnd here I'm going to talk about T cells a little bit\n5:11\ndifferently than I had in the last few videos.\n5:14\nJust to give a little bit more of a nuance-- so there's two\n5:18\ntypes of T cells.\n5:19\nYou'll say, hey, they are helper T cells and cytotoxic T\n5:21\ncells-- and you're not wrong, but what I'm going to do is do\n5:24\na slightly different differentiation just so that\n5:28\nyou are familiar with these terms. So there's\n5:30\ntwo types of T cells.\n5:33\nAll T cells have T cell receptors.\n5:44\nBut they also have these other proteins on them and some of\n5:50\nthem have these proteins called-- CD4 proteins and some\n5:58\nof them have what's called CD8.\n6:09\nSo this one right here would be called a\n6:11\nCD8 positive T cell.\n6:15\nIt has the CD8 proteins on it.\n6:18\nAnd this would be called a CD4 positive T cell.\n6:23\nI've never used these words before.\n6:25\nYou're like, gee, where are these coming from?\n6:27\nNow, the CD4 receptor is the thing that wants to bind--\n6:32\nthis is the thing that helps to go to the MHC II complexes.\n6:38\nSo most CD4 T cells are helper T cells.\n6:45\nMost of the time-- and I want to make it very clear--\n6:47\nimmunology is a very-- I mean, this field, people are\n6:49\ndiscovering things on a regular basis.\n6:51\nSo people are still understanding these things and\n6:53\nthere's all sorts of special cases, but usually when people\n6:57\ntalk about CD4 positive T cells, they're talking about\n7:00\nhelper T cells.\n7:02\nSo this is normally going to be a helper T cell-- or you\n7:07\ncould call it T helper, just like that.\n7:10\nLikewise, the CD8 proteins, these are attracted\n7:13\nto the MHC I complex.\n7:21\nThis is what brings them to the cells that have the\n7:24\ncancer, that have expressed antigens\n7:26\non their MHC I complex.\n7:28\nSo most of the time CD8\n7:30\npositive T cells are cytotoxic.\n7:39\nAnd oftentimes, before a cell gets activated, they just\n7:42\ndescribe it as a CD4 T cell or a CD8 cell and after it\n7:45\nbecomes activated and starts wanting to kill things, then\n7:53\nmaybe you call it cytotoxic.\n7:54\nBut this is all wordplay.\n7:56\nI think you get the general idea.\n7:58\nBut just to remember what they do, this guy-- we just said he\n8:04\nwants to bond to the MHC complex, so you have MHC\n8:08\ncomplex plus presenting some antigen.\n8:13\nThis is MHC I right here.\n8:15\nWe learned in the last video, every nucleated cell in the\n8:19\nbody expresses an MHC I complex.\n8:22\nSo this is the case where something wacky is happening\n8:25\ninside this cell.\n8:26\nMaybe a virus has infected it.\n8:28\nMaybe it's cancerous.\n8:30\nIt needs to die, otherwise it's going to keep producing\n8:34\nviruses if it's infected by a virus, or otherwise it's going\n8:37\nto keep dividing if it's a cancer and infect\n8:39\nthe rest of the body.\n8:40\nSo the CD8 kills infected cells.\n8:45\nI'll just say bad cells because I don't if you can--\n8:48\ncancer really isn't an infection.\n8:50\nKills bad cells-- cells that are-- if you don't kill them,\n8:53\nthey're going to keep producing viruses or keep\n8:54\nsplitting and spreading the cancer, while T cells--\n9:00\nthey're attracted to professional antigen\n9:03\npresenting cells.\n9:04\nAnd I always do a dendritic cell right here because those\n9:06\nare the best antigen presenting cells.\n9:09\nAnd they have MHC II complexes and it's digested some antigen\n9:16\nand it presents it right there and then that activates the\n9:21\nhelper T cell.\n9:22\nAnd then when the helper T cell-- all of these guys, once\n9:26\nthey're activated, they all go into effector-- they all start\n9:31\ndifferentiating into effector and memory cells.\n9:35\nAn effector helper T cell does a couple of things.\n9:40\nSo if we're talking about a helper T cell, it can activate\n9:46\nB cells and it also releases cytokines.\n9:51\nLet's say this guy gets activated.\n9:53\nHe'll also start releasing these chemicals, which are\n9:56\nreally those alarm bells that tell other people to really\n10:00\nget in gear-- maybe B cells and cytotoxic T cells start\n10:03\nproliferating more rigorously.\n10:05\nActually, part of the cytotoxic T cell activation\n10:10\ncan be assisted or kind of given a boost by these\n10:14\ncytokines-- of so by these alarm bells.\n10:17\nSo this guy's the alarm ringer, while the CD8 cells or\n10:24\nthe cytotoxic T cells-- in their effector\n10:27\nmode, they kill cells.\n10:31\nAnd of course in the memory mode, there's just a bunch of\n10:33\ncopies of these originals around that are ready and more\n10:36\nthan they were originally were, so that in the future if\n10:39\nsomething like this or something like this occurs,\n10:41\nthey're going to be activated faster because they're going\n10:43\nto be bumped into faster.\n10:45\nSo hopefully that clears up a little bit and I introduced a\n10:47\nlittle bit more tough terminology, but I really want\n10:48\nto stress my wife's point because she said, hey, you\n10:50\ndon't want people out there saying B cells produce\n10:53\nantibodies even though it is effector B cells-- activated B\n10:57\ncells that have differentiated into effector B cells.\n10:59\nThose are what are producing antibodies-- because when they\n11:01\ngo to medical school, people are going to want to hear\n11:03\nplasma cell.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nRight now, the best estimate of when the Big Bang occurred--\n0:05\nand once again, I don't like the term that much because it\n0:08\nkind of implies some type of explosion.\n0:10\nBut what it really is is kind of an expansion\n0:12\nof space, when space started to really start\n0:14\nto expand from a singularity.\n0:16\nBut our best estimate of when this occurred\n0:18\nis 13.7 billion years ago.\n0:24\nAnd even though we're used to dealing with numbers\n0:26\nin the billions, especially when we\n0:28\ntalk about large amounts of money and what not,\n0:30\nthis is an unbelievable amount of time.\n0:32\nIt seems like something that is tractable, but it really isn't.\n0:35\nAnd in future videos, I'm actually\n0:37\ngoing to talk about the time scale.\n0:39\nSo we can really appreciate how long,\n0:41\nor even start to appreciate, or appreciate\n0:43\nthat we can't appreciate how long 13.7 billion years is.\n0:47\nAnd I also want to emphasize that this is the current best\n0:51\nestimate.\n0:52\nEven in my lifetime, even in my lifetime that I actually\n0:54\nknew about the Big Bang and that I would pay attention\n0:57\nto what the best estimate was, this number's\n0:59\nbeen moving around.\n1:00\nSo I suspect that in the future, this number\n1:02\nmight become more accurate or might move around some.\n1:04\nBut this is our best guess.\n1:06\nNow with that said, I want to think about what this tells us\n1:08\nabout the size of the observable universe.\n1:17\nSo if all of the expansion started 13.7 billion years ago,\n1:22\nthat 13.7 billion years ago, everything\n1:25\nwe know in our three-dimensional universe\n1:28\nwas in a single point, the longest\n1:31\nthat any photon of light could be traveling that's reaching us\n1:34\nright now-- so let's say that that is my eye right over here.\n1:39\nThat's my eyelashes, just like that-- so some photon of light\n1:45\nis just to getting to my eye or maybe it's\n1:47\njust getting to the lens of a telescope.\n1:50\nThe longest that that could have been traveling\n1:52\nis 13.7 billion years.\n1:55\nSo it could be traveling 13.7 billion years.\n2:07\nSo when we looked at that depiction--\n2:09\nthis I think was two or three videos ago,\n2:11\nof the observable universe-- I drew, it was this circle.\n2:18\nAnd when we see light coming from these remote objects--\n2:21\nthat light is getting to us right here.\n2:23\nThis is where we are.\n2:24\nThis is where I guess in the depiction\n2:27\nthe remote object was.\n2:28\nBut the light from that remote object\n2:30\nis just now getting to us.\n2:32\nAnd that light took 13.7 billion years to get to us.\n2:43\nNow, what I'm going to hesitate to do,\n2:45\nbecause we're talking over such large distances\n2:48\nand we're talking on such large time scales and time scales\n2:51\nover which space itself is expanding--\n2:55\nwe're going to see in this video that you cannot say that this\n2:59\nobject over here, this is not necessarily, this is NOT,\n3:03\nI'll put it in caps, this is NOT 13.7 billion light years away.\n3:13\nIf we were talking about smaller time scales\n3:15\nor I guess smaller distances, you\n3:18\ncould say approximately that.\n3:20\nThe expansion of the universe itself would not make as much\n3:23\nof a difference.\n3:24\nAnd let me make it even more clear.\n3:26\nI'm talking about an object over there.\n3:28\nBut we could even talk about that coordinate in space.\n3:33\nAnd actually, I should say that coordinate in space-time,\n3:35\nbecause we're viewing it at a certain instant as well.\n3:37\nBut that coordinate is not 13.7 billion light years away\n3:43\nfrom our current coordinate.\n3:44\nAnd there's a couple of reasons to think about it.\n3:46\nFirst of all, think about it, that light\n3:48\nwas emitted 13.7 billion years ago.\n3:51\nWhen that light was emitted, we were\n3:53\nmuch closer to that coordinate.\n3:55\nThis coordinate was much closer to that.\n3:57\nWhere we are in the universe right now\n3:59\nwas much closer to that point in the universe.\n4:01\nThe other thing to think about is\n4:04\nas this-- let me actually draw it.\n4:06\nSo let's go 300,000 years after that initial expansion\n4:16\nof that singularity.\n4:17\nSo we're just 300,000 years into the universe's history\n4:21\nright now.\n4:22\nSo this is roughly 300,000 years into the universe's life.\n4:30\nI guess we could view it that way.\n4:33\nAnd first of all, at that point things haven't differentiated\n4:37\nin a meaningful way yet right now.\n4:39\nAnd we'll talk more about this when\n4:40\nwe talk about the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n4:43\nBut at this point in the universe,\n4:45\nit was kind of this almost uniform white-hot plasma\n4:49\nof hydrogen.\n4:50\nAnd then we're going to talk about it.\n4:51\nIt was emitting microwave radiation.\n4:53\nAnd we'll talk more about that in a future video.\n4:55\nBut let's just think about two points in this early universe.\n5:01\nSo in this early universe, let's say you have that point.\n5:03\nAnd let's say you have the coordinate where we are right\n5:05\nnow.\n5:06\nYou have the coordinate where we are right now.\n5:10\nAnd in fact, I'll just make that roughly-- I won't make it\n5:12\nthe center just because I think it makes it easier\n5:14\nto visualize if it's not the center.\n5:15\nAnd let's say at that very early stage in the universe,\n5:19\nif you were able to just take some rulers instantaneously\n5:22\nand measure that, you would measure this distance\n5:26\nto be 30 million light years.\n5:36\nAnd let's just say right at that point,\n5:38\nthis object over here-- I'll do it in magenta--\n5:40\nthis object over here emits a photon, maybe\n5:43\nin the microwave frequency range.\n5:45\nAnd we'll see that that was the range that it was emitting in.\n5:48\nBut it emits a photon.\n5:50\nAnd that photon is traveling at the speed of light.\n5:52\nIt is light.\n5:53\nAnd so that photon, says, you know what, I only\n5:55\ngot 30 million light years to travel.\n5:56\nThat's not too bad.\n5:57\nI'm going to get there in 30 million years.\n6:00\nAnd I'm going to do it discrete.\n6:01\nThe math is more complicated than what I'm doing here.\n6:04\nBut I really just want to give you\n6:05\nthe idea of what's going on here.\n6:07\nSo let's just say, well, that photon\n6:09\nsays in about 10 million years, in roughly 10 million years,\n6:13\nI should be right about at that coordinate.\n6:18\nI should be about one third of the distance.\n6:20\nBut what happens over the course of those 10 million years?\n6:26\nWell, over the course of those 10 million years,\n6:28\nthe universe has expanded some.\n6:30\nThe universe has expanded maybe a good deal.\n6:32\nSo let me draw the expanded universe.\n6:35\nSo after 10 million years, the universe might look like this.\n6:40\nActually it might even be bigger than that.\n6:42\nLet me draw it like this.\n6:44\nAfter 10 million years, the universe\n6:47\nmight have expanded a good bit.\n6:49\nSo this is 10 million years into the future.\n6:53\nStill on a cosmological time scale, still almost at kind\n6:58\nof the infancy of the universe because we're\n7:00\ntalking about 13.7 billion years.\n7:02\nSo let's say 10 million years.\n7:04\n10 million years go by.\n7:07\nThe universe has expanded.\n7:09\nThis coordinate, where we're sitting today\n7:10\nat the present time, is now all the way over here.\n7:15\nThat coordinate where the photon was originally emitted\n7:19\nis now going to be sitting right over here.\n7:24\nAnd that photon, it said, OK, after 10 million light years,\n7:26\nI'm going to get over there.\n7:28\nAnd I'm approximating.\n7:29\nI'm doing it in a very discrete way.\n7:30\nBut I really just want to give you the idea.\n7:32\nSo that coordinate, where the photon roughly\n7:35\ngets in 10 million light years, is about right over here.\n7:38\nThe whole universe has expanded.\n7:39\nAll the coordinates have gotten further away from each other.\n7:42\nNow, what just happened here?\n7:44\nThe universe has expanded.\n7:45\nThis distance that was 30 million light years now--\n7:49\nand I'm just making rough numbers here.\n7:52\nI don't know the actual numbers here.\n7:53\nNow, it is actually-- this is really just\n7:55\nfor the sake of giving you the idea of why-- well, giving you\n8:01\nthe intuition of what's going on.\n8:03\nThis distance now is no longer 30 million light years.\n8:08\nMaybe it's 100 million.\n8:10\nSo this is now 100 million light years away from each other.\n8:16\nThe universe is expanding.\n8:17\nThese coordinates, the space is actually spreading out.\n8:20\nYou could imagine it's kind of a trampoline\n8:22\nor the surface of a balloon.\n8:23\nIt's getting stretched thin.\n8:25\nAnd so this coordinate where the light happens\n8:27\nto be after 10 million years, it has\n8:29\nbeen traveling for 10 million years,\n8:32\nbut it's gone a much larger distance.\n8:37\nThat distance now might be on the order of-- maybe\n8:40\nit's on the order of 30 million light years.\n8:42\nAnd the math isn't exact here.\n8:44\nI haven't done the math to figure it out.\n8:47\nSo it's done 30 million light years.\n8:50\nAnd actually I shouldn't even make it the same proportion.\n8:53\nBecause the distance it's gone and the distance it has to go,\n8:56\nbecause of the stretching, it's not\n8:58\ngoing to be completely linear.\n8:59\nAt least when I'm thinking about it in my head, it shouldn't be,\n9:02\nI think.\n9:02\nBut I'm going to make a hard statement about that.\n9:06\nBut the distance that it reversed, maybe this distance\n9:10\nright here is now 20 million light years\n9:15\nbecause it got there.\n9:16\nEvery time it moved some distance, the space that it\n9:20\nhad traversed is now stretched.\n9:23\nSo even though its traveled for 10 million years,\n9:27\nthe space that it traversed is no longer\n9:29\njust 10 million light years.\n9:31\nIt's now stretched to 20 million light years.\n9:34\nAnd the space that it has left to traverse\n9:35\nis no longer only 20 million light years.\n9:38\nIt might now be 80 million light years.\n9:41\nIt is now 80 million light years.\n9:44\nAnd so this photon might be getting frustrated.\n9:47\nThere's an optimistic way of viewing it.\n9:48\nIt is like, wow, I was able to cover\n9:50\n20 million light years in only 10 million years.\n9:53\nIt looks like I'm moving faster than the speed of light.\n9:55\nThe reality is it's not because the space coordinates\n9:58\nthemselves are spreading out.\n10:00\nThose are getting thin.\n10:01\nSo the photon is just moving at the speed of light.\n10:04\nBut the distance that it actually\n10:05\ntraversed in 10 million years is more than 10 million\n10:10\nlight years.\n10:10\nIt's 20 million light years.\n10:12\nSo you can't just multiply a rate times time\n10:15\non these cosmological scales, especially when the coordinates\n10:19\nthemselves, the distance coordinates are actually\n10:23\nmoving away from each other.\n10:24\nBut I think you see, or maybe you might see,\n10:27\nwhere this is going.\n10:29\nOK, this photon says, oh, in another-- let me write this.\n10:33\nThis is 80 million light years-- in another 40 million\n10:35\nlight years, maybe I'm going to get over here.\n10:40\nBut the reality is over that next 40 million light years--\n10:43\nsorry, in 40 million years, I might get right over here,\n10:47\nbecause this is 80 million light years.\n10:49\nBut the reality is after 40 million years--\n10:52\nso another 40 million years go by-- now, all of a sudden,\n10:56\nthe universe has expanded even more.\n10:59\nI won't even draw the whole bubble.\n11:01\nBut the place where the photon was emitted from\n11:04\nmight be over here.\n11:07\nAnd now our current position is over here.\n11:11\nWhere the light got after 10 million years is now over here.\n11:18\nAnd now, where the light is after 40 million years,\n11:24\nmaybe it's over here.\n11:27\nSo now this distance, the distance\n11:29\nbetween these two points, when we started,\n11:32\nit was 10 million light years.\n11:33\nThen it became 20 million light years.\n11:36\nMaybe now, it's on the order of-- I don't know-- maybe it's\n11:39\na billion light years.\n11:41\nMaybe now it's a billion light years.\n11:43\nAnd maybe this distance over here-- and I'm\n11:45\njust making up these numbers.\n11:46\nIn fact, that's probably be too big for that point-- maybe this\n11:49\nis now 100 million light years.\n11:52\nThis is now 100 million light years.\n11:55\nAnd now, maybe this distance right\n11:59\nhere is-- I don't know-- 500 million light years.\n12:01\nAnd maybe now the total distance between the two points\n12:04\nis a billion light years.\n12:05\nSo as you can see, the photon might getting frustrated.\n12:08\nAs it covers more and more distance,\n12:10\nit looks back and says, wow, in only 50 million years,\n12:13\nI've been able to cover 600 million light years.\n12:16\nThat's pretty good.\n12:16\nBut it's frustrated because what it thought\n12:18\nwas it only had to cover 30 million light years\n12:22\nin distance.\n12:23\nThat keeps stretching out because space\n12:25\nitself is stretching.\n12:26\nSo the reality, just going to the original idea,\n12:32\nthis photon that is just reaching us,\n12:36\nthat's been traveling for-- let's say\n12:38\nit's been traveling for 13.4 billion years.\n12:41\nSo it's reaching us is just now.\n12:43\nSo let me just fast forward 13.4 billion years\n12:46\nfrom this point now to get to the present day.\n12:49\nSo if I draw the whole visible universe right over here,\n12:54\nthis point right over here is going\n12:56\nto be-- where it was emitted from is right over there.\n13:00\nWe are sitting right over there.\n13:04\nAnd actually, let me make something clear.\n13:06\nIf I'm drawing the whole observable universe,\n13:08\nthe center actually should be where we are.\n13:10\nBecause we can observe an equal distance.\n13:12\nIf things aren't really strange, we\n13:14\ncan observe an equal distance in any direction.\n13:16\nSo actually maybe we should put us at the center.\n13:19\nSo if this was the entire observable universe,\n13:21\nand the photon was emitted from here 13.4 billion years ago--\n13:26\nso 300,000 years after that initial Big Bang,\n13:29\nand it's just getting to us, it is true\n13:35\nthat the photon has been traveling\n13:41\nfor 13.7 billion years.\n13:47\nBut what's kind of nutty about it is this object, since we've\n13:50\nbeen expanding away from each other, this object is now,\n13:53\nin our best estimates, this object\n13:56\nis going to be about 46 billion light years away from us.\n14:08\nAnd I want to make it very clear.\n14:10\nThis object is now 46 billion light years away from us.\n14:13\nWhen we just use light to observe it, it looks like,\n14:16\njust based on light years, hey, this light\n14:18\nhas been traveling 13.7 billion years to reach us.\n14:21\nThat's our only way of kind with light\n14:22\nto kind of think about the distance.\n14:24\nSo maybe it's 13.4 or whatever-- I\n14:27\nkeep changing the decimal-- but 13.4 billion light years away.\n14:31\nBut the reality is if you had a ruler today, light year rulers,\n14:36\nthis space here has stretched so much\n14:38\nthat this is now 46 billion light years.\n14:41\nAnd just to give you a hint of when\n14:43\nwe talk about the cosmic microwave background\n14:45\nradiation, what will this point in space\n14:47\nlook like, this thing that's actually\n14:49\n46 billion light years away, but the photon only\n14:52\ntook 13.7 billion years to reach us?\n14:54\nWhat will this look like?\n14:56\nWell, when we say look like, it's\n14:59\nbased on the photons that are reaching us right now.\n15:02\nThose photons left 13.4 billion years ago.\n15:05\nSo those photons are the photons being\n15:07\nemitted from this primitive structure,\n15:10\nfrom this white-hot haze of hydrogen plasma.\n15:16\nSo what we're going to see is this white-hot haze.\n15:19\nSo we're going to see this kind of white-hot plasma, white hot,\n15:26\nundifferentiated not differentiated\n15:28\ninto proper stable atoms, much less stars and galaxies,\n15:32\nbut white hot.\n15:33\nWe're going to see this white-hot plasma.\n15:36\nThe reality today is that point in space\n15:38\nthat's 46 billion years from now,\n15:40\nit's probably differentiated into stable atoms, and stars,\n15:45\nand planets, and galaxies.\n15:46\nAnd frankly, if that person, that person,\n15:49\nif there is a civilization there right now\n15:51\nand if they're sitting right there, and they're observing\n15:52\nphotons being emitted from our coordinate,\n15:54\nfrom our point in space right now,\n15:56\nthey're not going to see us.\n15:57\nThey're going to see us 13.4 billion years ago.\n16:01\nThey're going to see the super primitive state\n16:05\nof our region of space when it really\n16:07\nwas just a white-hot plasma.\n16:09\nAnd we're going to talk more about this in the next video.\n16:11\nBut think about it.\n16:12\nAny photon that's coming from that period in time,\n16:15\nso from any direction, that's been traveling\n16:17\nfor 13.4 billion years from any direction,\n16:21\nit's going to come from that primitive state\n16:23\nor it would have been emitted when the universe was\n16:27\nin that primitive state, when it was just\n16:29\nthat white-hot plasma, this undifferentiated mass.\n16:32\nAnd hopefully, that will give you\n16:33\na sense of where the cosmic microwave background\n16:36\nradiation comes from.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nVoiceover: The purpose of the immune system\n0:03\nis to fight things.\n0:05\nTo fight bacteria and viruses and other things\n0:07\nthat you don't want in your body.\n0:10\nThat's what it does.\n0:11\nThe question we can ask is\n0:12\nhow does the immune system know not\n0:14\nto attack your own body,\n0:16\nand that might seem like a strange question\n0:18\nor an obvious question\n0:19\nbut it's actually not obvious the answer to it.\n0:23\nIn this video we're gonna go into why it's not obvious\n0:26\nand then how the body actually\n0:28\ndoes prevent its immune system from attacking itself.\n0:31\nAnother way of saying is this\n0:33\nhow does the body distinguish self versus non-self?\n0:39\nBy that we mean how does it tell the difference\n0:41\nbetween your own body, your own proteins,\n0:44\nyour own cells\n0:45\nand foreign proteins or cells\n0:48\nor things that shouldn't be in your body.\n0:50\nHow does it know to attack these\n0:52\nand not to attack this.\n0:54\nTo find out why the question itself is not obvious\n0:57\nlet's go back to B cells and talk about B cells.\n1:01\nHere we have a B cell\n1:02\nand here is its nucleus with some DNA\n1:04\nand the most important part of the B cell\n1:07\nthat we care most about is its B cell receptor\n1:11\nwhich later if it becomes active\n1:13\ncan be released as an antibody.\n1:17\nNow this B cell receptor is what's gonna bind\n1:19\nto foreign, pieces of foreign bacteria or viruses\n1:23\nand these antibodies are gonna bind to those things\n1:25\nand help your body get rid of them.\n1:28\nThe important thing to remember about B cells\n1:30\nis that these antibodies\n1:31\nor these B cell receptors are coded\n1:33\nin the DNA of the B cell,\n1:35\nbut that they're different for every B cell.\n1:38\nEvery B cell has a unique set of antibodies\n1:42\nand B cell receptors that it makes.\n1:45\nWe'll give them slightly different colors\n1:47\nto make that obvious.\n1:48\nHere's one with slightly different DNA\n1:50\nand a slightly different B cell receptor.\n1:53\nThe really critical point to remember\n1:54\nis that these B cell receptors that will become antibodies\n1:58\nare generated at random.\n2:00\nYour body kind of shuffles the DNA here\n2:03\nand creates a unique B cell receptor\n2:05\nand antibody for each B cell.\n2:08\nIt's precisely that fact\n2:10\nwhich is that they're created at random\n2:12\nwhich means that your body is in danger of creating\n2:15\nB cell receptors and antibodies\n2:17\nthat can react to your own body\n2:19\nbecause while this guy might be good,\n2:21\nwhile he might react to let's say\n2:23\na bacteria out here that you want to get rid of,\n2:26\nwhile that's good.\n2:28\nThis guy might easily create a B cell receptor\n2:31\nand later an antibody that can react\n2:33\nto something you don't want it to react to.\n2:35\nFor example, let's say this is\n2:37\nan important protein in your body\n2:39\nmaybe it's insulin.\n2:41\nYou would not want a B cell to be created\n2:43\nwhich will react to insulin\n2:45\nbecause then maybe it will start creating antibodies\n2:47\nthat bind all the insulin in your blood\n2:50\nand if you don't know what insulin does\n2:51\ndon't worry about it but by binding to insulin\n2:53\nit will prevent insulin from doing its function\n2:55\nwhich is very important.\n2:58\nHow can you keep your body from making B cells\n3:00\nthat would react to yourself?\n3:04\nIn fact there's no way to do it\n3:06\nbecause as I said,\n3:07\nthis process of creating different\n3:10\nB cell receptors and antibodies is totally random.\n3:12\nThere's no way to keep your body\n3:14\nfrom making B cell receptors\n3:16\nor B cells that will react to yourself.\n3:19\nWhat does that mean?\n3:20\nThat means that you're gonna make them\n3:21\nbut you need to find a way to figure out\n3:23\nwhich ones are reacting to you\n3:25\nand to get rid of them.\n3:26\nYou need to figure out a way\n3:27\nto kill the ones you don't want.\n3:30\nBy the way we're talking about B cells here.\n3:33\nB cells.\n3:34\nEverything we're saying is equally applicable to T cells.\n3:38\nLet me draw one here.\n3:40\nT cells it's equally applicable\n3:42\nbecause T cells also have a T cell receptor\n3:45\nthat's generated at random\n3:46\nand you only want that T cell receptor\n3:48\nto react to foreign things.\n3:50\nTo non-self things and not to self things.\n3:55\nThe processes we're gonna talk about are\n3:56\nequally true, maybe even in some cases\n3:58\nmore so true for T cells and B cells.\n4:01\nLet's go to the bone marrow\n4:03\nto figure out how this process works,\n4:05\nand we're going to the bone marrow\n4:07\nbecause that's where B cells come from.\n4:09\nIt's where they get their unique antibody,\n4:12\nyour B cell receptor.\n4:14\nThey get that by changing their DNA\n4:16\na tiny little bit by shuffling pieces around.\n4:18\nLet's look at a couple of these B cells\n4:20\nwhich are still young.\n4:22\nThey haven't yet been allowed out of the bone marrow.\n4:24\nThey haven't been vetted\n4:25\nto see if they should be allowed out.\n4:28\nEach one has its unique receptor.\n4:31\nLet's draw a few of those receptors here.\n4:34\nLet's say that one of these guys reacts to self.\n4:39\nOne of them reacts to some protein in your own body\n4:42\nthat you don't want it to.\n4:44\nAgain, that just happened at random\n4:46\nbecause you're creating these receptors\n4:47\nreally at random.\n4:49\nLet's say that the guy\n4:51\nthat we're gonna want to get rid of this one\n4:53\nbecause he reacts to let's say it's insulin again\n4:55\nlike up there.\n4:56\nReally we should have drawn insulin in yellow\n4:59\nto show that it goes with this receptor.\n5:02\nLet's say this guy reacts to insulin.\n5:04\nHow can you figure out that this guy reacts to self?\n5:08\nThe answer is actually quite simple.\n5:09\nThe answer is that you just need to keep around\n5:11\nthe various proteins that your body uses.\n5:15\nYou need to keep them around in the bone marrow\n5:16\nwhile these B cells are being vetted.\n5:20\nFor example here you'll have a little insulin.\n5:23\nVery small amount but it will be there.\n5:26\nYou'll have a little bit of some other protein.\n5:29\nLet's say maybe hemoglobin.\n5:32\nYou'll have some other protein here.\n5:35\nYou'll have yet another protein over here.\n5:39\nAll these proteins will be around.\n5:42\nWhat your body does at this stage and development\n5:45\nis it says whatever B cell binds to something,\n5:49\nwherever B cell binds to something\n5:50\nwith its B cell receptor\n5:52\nin the bone marrow will be killed.\n5:57\nThis B cell right here\n5:59\nthat recognizes this insulin protein\n6:03\nthe fact that it recognizes it,\n6:04\nit means that it will bind\n6:05\nand that will cause a little bit of a chemical change\n6:08\nin the B cell or something,\n6:09\nand one thing will lead to another\n6:11\nand the whole system will be programmed\n6:12\nso that as a result this guy will die.\n6:16\nEvery B cell that recognizes self\n6:20\nif it sees that self molecule in the bone marrow\n6:24\nit will be killed.\n6:27\nThis works because your bone marrow\n6:28\nwill have most of the abundant proteins in your body.\n6:32\nThey'll be present there so that you can make sure\n6:35\nthat you weed out all the B cells that react to self.\n6:39\nNow what happens after this step is that\n6:41\nthese guys who have been vetted\n6:43\nthey can proceed onwards to maybe a lymph node.\n6:47\nSomewhere where they can begin to actually be active\n6:50\nnow that they've sort of gone through\n6:53\nbasic training here in the bone marrow.\n6:56\nYou might ask yourself, well, what about here?\n6:58\nWhat about here when one of these B cells\n7:01\nthat doesn't react to self,\n7:02\nwhat about when it interacts with a bacteria\n7:05\nthat you actually want it to fight?\n7:08\nIs the same thing gonna happen?\n7:09\nIs it going to die just because it recognizes\n7:12\nthe molecule that its made to bind to?\n7:17\nThe answer is obviously not.\n7:18\nYou don't want this guy to die because you need him.\n7:21\nBecause you want to fight this bacteria.\n7:23\nThe reason why he doesn't die is because\n7:25\nwell, we're in a different environment.\n7:27\nThere are different rules,\n7:28\nthere are different other cells around\n7:29\nand this B cell has matured and become different.\n7:33\nThe rules are different\n7:34\nand he's not going to die.\n7:35\nThis weeding out of B cells\n7:37\nthat react to self proteins is\n7:41\nsort of the first of two mechanisms\n7:44\nthat I'd like to talk about that the body uses\n7:47\nto not react to self.\n7:49\nActually the same thing exact thing happens for T cells\n7:53\nexcept it doesn't happen in the bone marrow,\n7:55\nit happens in the thymus\n7:56\nbecause that's where T cells mature.\n8:00\nIn the thymus we have really the identical process\n8:03\nwhere T cells differentiate\n8:05\nand each one has a unique receptor\n8:07\nand the ones that reacts to self in the thymus\n8:10\ntoo strongly are killed.\n8:13\nIt's not a foolproof method\n8:14\nor else we wouldn't need step two.\n8:16\nEvery once in a while a B cell will get out there.\n8:20\nA B cell will escape which reacts to self.\n8:25\nIt's just because every process has its mistakes\n8:28\nand maybe you don't have\n8:29\nevery single protein here in the bone marrow\n8:32\nand enough abundance to find the B cells\n8:35\nthat reacts to a protein of your own body.\n8:38\nLet's say this is a B cell that escaped the bone marrow\n8:40\neven though it reacts to self.\n8:42\nWhat's gonna happen now?\n8:44\nIt's gonna find that protein\n8:47\nthat it was sort of made at random to react with.\n8:50\nIt's gonna find that protein\n8:51\nthat your body makes and that your body needs\n8:53\nand it's going to bind to it.\n8:55\nWhat's it gonna do now?\n8:56\nIf you remember it's now going to take that protein\n9:00\ningest it, break it up into little pieces\n9:03\nand then present it on an MHC II molecule.\n9:12\nIf you recall it will just present\n9:13\na small piece of that protein on the MHC II molecule.\n9:16\nMaybe it will present a different piece of protein\n9:18\non a different MHC II molecule over here,\n9:21\nsomething like that.\n9:22\nThe reason it does this is\n9:25\nbecause it needs a T cell to come along.\n9:28\nHere's a T cell.\n9:30\nIt needs a T cell to come along\n9:31\nthat will recognize that same piece\n9:35\nthat is put there on its surface.\n9:38\nIt needs that in order to activate it.\n9:40\nIt's going to sit there\n9:40\nand wait for this T cell to come along\n9:42\nwho has the perfect receptor.\n9:45\nHere's that T cell.\n9:47\nThey're going to interact\n9:49\nand they're gonna have some kind of\n9:51\nintracellular kiss\n9:53\nthat's going to finally allow this B cell to activate.\n9:57\nUsually without the T cell coming\n10:00\nand recognizing the antigen that the B cell reacts to\n10:04\nthe B cell cannot activate.\n10:06\nIt needs this T cell to recognize it.\n10:08\nThis is exactly the second mechanism of defense\n10:12\nthat I'd like to bring to your attention\n10:15\nwhich is that even if a B cell escapes\n10:18\nthat reacts to self.\n10:20\nAlmost always it's also going to need a T cell\n10:23\nthat reacts to self to come and activate it.\n10:26\nYou need both the B cell to escape\n10:28\nthe weeding out in the bone marrow\n10:31\nand the T cell to escape the weeding out in the thymus\n10:35\nfor you to get an active B cell\n10:37\nthat's now going to start putting out antibodies\n10:40\nthat react to self.\n10:43\nBy the way, this cellular kiss here\n10:46\nis usually going on in the lymph node.\n10:49\nLooking at this whole process\n10:51\nyou might have a few complaints.\n10:53\nI encourage you think about how it might go wrong.\n10:57\nOne way you might think it could go wrong is\n10:59\nwhat if bacteria got into the bone marrow\n11:02\nand certainly that's very, very possible\n11:04\nbecause when you get infections\n11:05\nthe thing that's infecting you\n11:06\ncan move around your body.\n11:08\nIf this bacterium gets into your bone marrow\n11:11\ndoes that mean that now this B cell\n11:13\nis going to bind to it\n11:15\nand therefore it's going to be killed?\n11:17\nBecause at this stage whenever the B cells\n11:18\nbind to something they're killed.\n11:20\nThe answer is yes.\n11:21\nThis is exactly what happens.\n11:23\nThe reason why it's not too much of a problem is that\n11:26\neven if you have this bacterium here in the bone marrow\n11:29\nfor a week or two or maybe a month,\n11:33\nafter that once this bacterium goes away or it's killed\n11:36\nthen it won't be there anymore\n11:37\nand you can start producing these B cells\n11:39\nthat react to that bacterium again.\n11:42\nHopefully you already had a bunch of these B cells\n11:44\nthat could react to this bacterium\n11:46\nthat you had made previously\n11:48\nand that were already out in the lymph nodes.\n11:51\nThose guys will be there to fight the infection\n11:54\nwhile maybe the infection might be in your bone marrow\n11:56\npreventing you from making more of those B cells\n11:59\nto kill it.\n12:00\nYou already have some of those B cells\n12:01\nout there in the lymph nodes\n12:03\nand they can proliferate out there\n12:04\nand sort of lead the battle from there.\n12:07\nNow even though your body has these mechanisms\n12:09\nto keep your immune system\n12:11\nfrom reacting to yourself\n12:12\nit still happens sometimes.\n12:15\nThe process still goes wrong sometimes\n12:16\nand the result is autoimmune disease.\n12:23\nIt's called autoimmune because you're immune to yourself.\n12:27\nYour immune system basically starts attacking your own body\n12:30\nand some pretty terrible disease can result.\n12:33\nTo kind of bring it to life\n12:34\nwhere I'd like to tell you about one example of this.\n12:38\nThis is a muscle fiber\n12:40\nand the way your muscle fibers are activated\n12:45\nbecause you don't want to be flexing\n12:46\nall of your muscles all the time\n12:48\nthe way that they're activated is that\n12:49\nthey have a little receptor which I'll draw here.\n12:53\nThis receptor is ready to receive\n12:57\nlittle molecules from a neuron, part of a nerve.\n13:03\nIt receives little molecules from this neuron\n13:05\nthat activate this receptor\n13:07\nand therefore activate the muscle fiber.\n13:10\nIf you want to tighten this muscle fiber\n13:12\nyou just need to send the signal down a neuron\n13:15\nand they'll release the little molecules\n13:16\nwhich will activate the muscle fiber.\n13:19\nIn one example of autoimmune disease\n13:21\nyou get antibodies against this receptor here on the muscle.\n13:27\nThey bind to it\n13:29\nand that either stops it from functioning.\n13:31\nIt makes it impossible for it to react to the neuron signals\n13:35\nor causes that receptor to be destroyed.\n13:38\nThose are two mechanisms that have been seen.\n13:42\nIn this autoimmune disease what do you think will happen?\n13:45\nWhat happens is that\n13:47\nyour body can no longer\n13:49\nactivate muscle fibers as easily.\n13:51\nThe disease is called myasthenia gravis\n13:58\nand the etymology of that is \"my\" it means muscle\n14:03\nand \"asthenia\" means weakness.\n14:06\nMuscle weakness and gravis just means it's serious\n14:09\nbecause it gets serious over time.\n14:11\nIf you can't activate the muscle fibers in your body\n14:13\nyou slowly become paralyzed.\n14:16\nYou don't need to remember this exact mechanism.\n14:20\nThat's not really important\n14:21\nbut I just wanted to give an example of\n14:23\none kind of autoimmune disease and how it works.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's talk about a concept that probably\n0:03\nconfuses chemistry students the most on some level.\n0:06\nBut on some level it's also one of the simplest concepts.\n0:09\nAnd that's the idea of a mole,\n0:12\nwhich in chemistry is different\n0:13\nthat the thing digging up your backyard,\n0:15\nor the thing you want to get removed from your left eye.\n0:19\nA mole in chemistry is just a number.\n0:21\nIt's just a number,\n0:23\nand the number is 6.02 times 10 to the 23.\n0:28\nSo it's a very huge number.\n0:29\nAnd this is also called Avogadro's number.\n0:31\nMaybe I will do a video on Avogadro.\n0:35\nAvogadro's number\n0:39\nBut that's all you need to know.\n0:41\nA mole is just a number.\n0:43\nThere are kind of more Byzantine definitions of a mole.\n0:47\nThis actually is not\n0:49\n-- actually, let me copy and paste it from Wikipedia.\n0:51\nThis is Wikipedia's definition of a mole.\n0:55\nAnd you hopefully at the end of this video\n0:58\nyou'll see that they're equivalent.\n0:59\nBut if you're just getting exposed to the concept,\n1:01\nthis to me, it's just not an easy concept.\n1:07\nBasically, \"a mole is defined as the amount of substance\n1:10\nof a system that contains as many elemental entities\n1:16\nas there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon 12.\"\n1:19\nWell, I just told you that a mole is 6.02 times 10 to the 23.\n1:24\nSo if you just take the last part,\n1:26\natoms in 12 grams of carbon 12.\n1:30\nSo that means that there are 1 mole of carbon 12\n1:39\n-- let me write it like that -- carbon 12.\n1:42\nThere are 1 mole of carbon 12 atoms in 12 grams of carbon.\n1:57\nAnd so that's why a mole is useful.\n1:59\nSo I could have just instead of writing 1 mole,\n2:02\nI could have replaced this as there's 6.02 times 10\n2:06\nto the 23 carbon atoms, carbon 12 atoms in 12 grams of carbon.\n2:12\nHow do you figure that out?\n2:13\nOr I guess, what else does this mean?\n2:15\nI mean, we just added in carbon,\n2:17\nthey said it's the amount of substance of any molecule,\n2:19\nif you convert between atomic mass units and grams.\n2:22\nThis I find very confusing.\n2:24\nHow can we apply this in other places?\n2:26\nSo the first thing to realize is a mole is just a way\n2:29\nof translating between grams and atomic mass units.\n2:32\nOne carbon 12 atom is what?\n2:35\nWhat's its mass number?\n2:37\nIt's 12.\n2:39\nThat's why it's called carbon 12 instead of carbon 14.\n2:41\nSo its mass is 12 atomic mass units.\n2:46\nSo if you have something that has a mass of 12 atomic mass units\n2:50\nand you have a mole of them,\n2:52\nor you have 6.02 times 10 to the 23 of them,\n2:55\nall of those atoms combined will have a mass of 12 grams.\n3:01\nSo another way to think about it is\n3:04\n1 gram is equal to 1 mole of atomic mass units.\n3:13\nI'll write amu's like that.\n3:16\nOr you can write 1 gram is equal to 6.02\n3:22\ntimes 10 to the 23 atomic mass units.\n3:26\nAnd the reason why this is useful\n3:28\n-- and it's kind of addressed in this Wikipedia definition there\n3:30\n-- is it helps us translate between the atomic world\n3:33\n-- where we deal with atomic mass units and we deal with,\n3:36\noh, we've got an extra neutron now,\n3:37\nlet's add one to our atomic mass number\n3:41\n-- and translating between that atomic world\n3:43\nand our everyday world where we deal in grams.\n3:45\nAnd just so you know, a gram is still\n3:47\na pretty small amount of mass.\n3:50\nIt's 1/1,000 of a kilogram.\n3:52\nA kilogram is about 2 pounds.\n3:54\nSo this is about 1/500 of a pound.\n3:56\nSo this is not much.\n3:58\nSo there's a ton of atoms in a very small amount of\n4:02\n-- in 1 gram of carbon, or at least in 12 grams of carbon,\n4:06\nyou have a ton of atoms. You have 6.02 times 10 to the 23.\n4:10\nAnd just to hit the point home,\n4:12\nI probably should have talked about this in the atom.\n4:13\nThis is a huge number.\n4:15\nTo maybe visualize it, if you think of -- I was told that\n4:22\nin the diameter of a hair, if this is a hair\n4:25\nand this is diameter of the hair,\n4:27\nif you go this way there 1 million carbon atoms.\n4:32\n1 million carbon atoms that way.\n4:35\nOr if you were to take an apple\n4:41\nand you were to try to figure out what fraction,\n4:45\nif you were to make one of the atoms of an apple\n4:48\n-- and obviously,\n4:50\nan apple has a bunch of different types of atoms in it\n4:52\n-- but if you were to take one of the atoms\n4:53\nand make it the size of the apple,\n4:55\nthen the apple would be the size of the earth.\n4:58\nSo an apple atom is to an apple\n5:00\nas an apple is to the earth.\n5:03\nSo these are obviously-- it's hard for us\n5:06\nto even process things of this size.\n5:08\nWhen you just have one gram of\n5:12\n-- well, let's say you have 1 gram of hydrogen.\n5:14\n1 gram of hydrogen. 1 gram of hydrogen.\n5:22\nIf you have 1 gram of hydrogen,\n5:24\nthat means you have 1 mole of hydrogen.\n5:29\nHow do I know that?\n5:31\nBecause hydrogen's atomic mass number is 1.\n5:34\nSo in general, if you just take any element\n5:39\n-- so what is the mass of,\n5:41\nlet me just pick, 1 mole of aluminum?\n5:45\nSo if I were to take 6.02 times 10 to the 23 aluminum atoms,\n5:54\nwhat is the mass of that collection?\n5:56\nWell, each of them have an atomic mass number of 13.\n6:00\nSo it's 13 amu's-- I don't have to put the s there\n6:08\n-- times six point\n6:11\n-- well, I won't write that way, actually.\n6:14\nThat'll probably just confuse you.\n6:15\nThe easy way to think about is if you have a mole of an atom,\n6:18\nyou take its mass-- I was taking its atomic number,\n6:21\nthat's not good-- you take its mass number.\n6:23\nIn this case let's say it's 27.\n6:26\nSo we're dealing with aluminum 27.\n6:30\nYou take its mass number, and if you have 1 mole of it,\n6:34\nthen the mass of that will be 27 grams.\n6:41\nSo that literally, when you have one mole of an atom\n6:44\nit's a direct translation between its mass number and grams.\n6:48\n1 mole of iron, let's say iron 56--\n6:53\nthere's obviously many isotopes or iron\n6:55\n-- let's say we're dealing with iron 56.\n6:58\nYou normally don't hear it like that,\n6:59\nbut let's say we're dealing with the isotope of iron\n7:02\nthat has a mass number of 56.\n7:04\nSo if I have 1 mole of this, 1 mole of this atom right here,\n7:11\nthat's going to have a mass of\n7:15\n-- the math isn't difficult here\n7:16\n-- 56 grams. Right? And if you think about it,\n7:23\nhow many atomic mass units is this?\n7:24\nWell, this is 56 atomic mass units per atom.\n7:30\nThen you have a mole of those, so you have\n7:32\n6.02 times 10 to the 23 times 56 atomic mass units.\n7:37\nAnd then you divide it\n7:39\nby the number of atomic mass units per gram.\n7:41\nAnd you end up with 56 grams.\n7:43\nBut the easy way to think about it is\n7:44\nyou just take whatever the mass number is.\n7:46\nIf you have silicon, if you have a mole of silicon,\n7:49\na mole of silicon will have a mass\n7:52\n-- I don't want to say weight\n7:53\nbecause this should apply to any planet\n7:54\n-- of 28 grams.\n7:56\nWhat about 2 moles of silicon? 2 moles of silicon.\n8:04\nAnd I'll write its mass number.\n8:05\nLet's say silicon has a mass number of 28.\n8:10\nTwo moles of silicon.\n8:12\nWell, 1 more would have a mass of 28 grams,\n8:15\nso 2 moles is going to have a mass of 56 grams.\n8:23\nIf I were to say, let's say I had 4 moles of oxygen,\n8:29\nwhich has a mass number of 16.\n8:32\nWhat is the mass of that?\n8:34\nThis is a huge number of oxygen atoms\n8:37\n-- what would be the mass of that?\n8:38\nWell, it would be 4 times-- 1 mole of oxygen\n8:44\nwould have a mass of 16 grams,\n8:47\nso 4 moles has 64 grams.\n8:52\nIt's confusing because we're not used to using a word\n8:55\nlike moles as a number, but all it is, is a number.\n8:58\nAnd the easy way to think about is that it lets us\n9:00\ntranslate between this atomic mass unit number and grams.\n9:06\nAnd you say, well, how do I get that many grams?\n9:08\nWell, I have to have 6.02 times 10 to the 23 carbon atoms\n9:12\nfor that collection of carbon to have a mass of 12 grams.\n9:16\nThat's all that mole means.\n9:18\nIt's just a number.\n9:19\nAnd I encourage you to kind of play around\n9:21\nwith a lot of what we talked about.\n9:22\nBecause it's super important\n9:24\nto have the intuition behind moles,\n9:25\notherwise, you'll get confused later on\n9:27\nwhen we start getting into energies\n9:29\nin terms of it requires kilojoules per mole,\n9:31\nand what is the energy of this reaction\n9:34\nand all that type of stuff.\n9:35\nSo just really try to make sure\n9:37\nyou digest this as well as possible.\n9:38\nAnd let me know if you don't\n9:40\nand I'll maybe make another video on this\n9:42\nbecause it's so important.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWhat I want to do in this video is give ourselves\n0:02\na basic introduction to the phenomenon of light.\n0:07\nAnd light is, at least to me, mysterious.\n0:11\nBecause on one level it really defines our reality.\n0:14\nIt's maybe the most defining characteristic of our reality.\n0:17\nEverything we see, how we perceive reality,\n0:20\nis based on light bouncing off of objects\n0:23\nor bending around objects or diffracting around objects,\n0:26\nand then being sensed by our eyes,\n0:29\nand then sending signals into our brain that\n0:32\ncreate models of the world we see around us.\n0:35\nSo it really is, almost, the defining characteristic\n0:37\nof our reality.\n0:38\nBut at the same time, when you really go down to experiment\n0:42\nand observe with light, it starts\n0:44\nto have a bunch of mysterious properties.\n0:47\nAnd to a large degree it is not fully understood yet.\n0:51\nAnd probably the most amazing thing about light--\n0:54\nwell, actually there's tons of amazing things about light--\n0:56\nbut one of the mysterious things is when you really get down\n0:59\nto it-- and this is actually not just true of light,\n1:01\nthis is actually true of almost anything\n1:03\nonce you get onto a small enough quantum mechanical level--\n1:07\nlight behaves as both a wave and a particle.\n1:12\nAnd this is probably not that intuitive to you,\n1:15\nbecause it's not that intuitive to me.\n1:17\nIn my life, I'm used to certain things behaving as waves,\n1:19\nlike sound waves or the waves of an ocean.\n1:22\nAnd I'm used to certain things behaving like particles,\n1:25\nlike basketballs or-- I don't know-- my coffee cup.\n1:29\nI'm not used to things behaving as both.\n1:32\nAnd it really depends on what experiment you run\n1:34\nand how you observe the light.\n1:36\nSo when you observe it as a particle,\n1:38\nand this comes out of Einstein's work\n1:40\nwith the photoelectric effect-- and I won't go into the details\n1:43\nhere, maybe in a future video when\n1:44\nwe start thinking about quantum mechanics--\n1:47\nyou can view light as a train of particles moving\n1:54\nat the speed of light, which I'll talk about in a second.\n1:56\nWe call these particles photons.\n2:00\nIf you view light in other ways-- and you see it\n2:02\neven when you see light being refracted by a prism here--\n2:07\nit looks like it is a wave.\n2:10\nAnd it has the properties of a wave.\n2:12\nIt has a frequency, and it has a wavelength.\n2:16\nAnd like other waves, the velocity of that wave\n2:19\nis the frequency times its wavelength.\n2:23\nNow even if you ignore this particle aspect of light,\n2:28\nif you just look at the wave aspect of the light,\n2:30\nit's still fascinating.\n2:32\nBecause most waves require a medium to travel through.\n2:36\nSo for example, if I think about how sound travels through air--\n2:40\nso let me draw a bunch of air particles.\n2:44\nI'll draw a sound wave traveling through the air particles.\n2:47\nWhat happens in a sound wave is you compress some of the air\n2:52\nparticles and those compress the ones next to them.\n2:54\nAnd so you have points in the air that have higher,\n2:57\nI guess you could say, higher pressure\n2:59\nand points that have lower pressure,\n3:00\nand you could plot that.\n3:02\nSo we have high pressure over here.\n3:03\nHigh pressure, low pressure, high pressure, low pressure.\n3:07\nAnd as these things bump into each other,\n3:08\nand this wave essentially travels to the right--\n3:11\nand if you were to plot that you would see this wave\n3:13\nform traveling to the right.\n3:15\nBut this is all predicated, or this is all\n3:17\nbased on, this energy traveling through a medium.\n3:22\nAnd I'm used to visualizing waves in that way.\n3:26\nBut light needs no medium.\n3:34\nLight will actually travel fastest through nothing,\n3:37\nthrough a vacuum.\n3:39\nAnd it will travel at an unimaginably fast speed--\n3:42\n3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second.\n3:47\nAnd just to give you a sense of this,\n3:49\nthis is 300 million meters per second.\n3:51\nOr another way of thinking about it is it\n3:54\nwould take light less than a seventh of a second\n3:59\nto travel around the earth.\n4:00\nOr it would travel around the earth more than seven times\n4:03\nin one second.\n4:04\nSo unimaginably fast.\n4:06\nAnd not only is this just a super fast speed,\n4:10\nbut once again it tells us that light\n4:12\nis something fundamental to our universe.\n4:14\nBecause it's not just an unimaginable fast speed.\n4:17\nIt is the fastest speed not just known to physics, but possible\n4:21\nin physics.\n4:22\nSo once again something very unintuitive to us\n4:25\nin our everyday realm.\n4:26\nWe always imagine that, OK, if something\n4:29\nis going at some speed, maybe if there was an ant riding on top\n4:31\nof that something and it was moving in the same direction,\n4:34\nit would be going even faster.\n4:35\nBut nothing can go faster than the speed of light.\n4:39\nIt's absolutely impossible based on our current understanding\n4:43\nof physics.\n4:44\nSo it's not just a fast speed, it\n4:46\nis the fastest speed possible.\n4:55\nAnd this right here is an approximation.\n4:57\nIt's actually 2.99 something something times 10\n5:01\nto the eighth meters per second.\n5:02\nBut 3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second\n5:04\nis a pretty good approximation.\n5:07\nNow within the visible light spectrum-- and I'll\n5:10\ntalk about what's beyond the visible light spectrum\n5:13\nin a second-- you're probably familiar with the colors.\n5:15\nMaybe you imagine them as the colors of the rainbow.\n5:18\nAnd rainbows really happen because the light\n5:20\nfrom the sun, the white light, is being refracted\n5:24\nby these little water particles.\n5:27\nAnd you can see that in a clearer way when\n5:29\nyou see light being refracted by a prism right over here.\n5:33\nAnd the different wavelengths of light-- so white light\n5:36\ncontains all of the visible wavelengths--\n5:39\nbut the different wavelengths get refracted differently\n5:42\nby a prism.\n5:44\nSo in this case the higher-frequency wavelengths,\n5:47\nthe violet and the blue, get refracted more.\n5:50\nIts direction gets bent more than the low-frequency\n5:53\nwavelengths, than the reds and the oranges right over here.\n5:59\nAnd if you want to look at the wavelength of visible light,\n6:02\nit's between 400 nanometers and 700 nanometers.\n6:05\nAnd the higher the frequency, the higher the energy of that\n6:09\nlight.\n6:09\nAnd that actually goes into when you\n6:11\nstart talking about the quantum mechanics of it--\n6:13\nthat the higher frequency means that each of these photons\n6:16\nhave higher energy.\n6:17\nThey have a better ability to give kinetic energy\n6:20\nto knock off electrons or whatever else they need to do.\n6:23\nSo higher frequency-- let me write\n6:25\nthat down-- higher frequency means higher energy.\n6:35\nNow I keep referring to this idea of the visible light.\n6:39\nAnd you might say, what is beyond visible light?\n6:41\nAnd what you'll find is that light is just\n6:43\npart of a much broader phenomenon,\n6:46\nand it's just the part that we happen to observe.\n6:49\nAnd if we want to broaden the discussion a little bit,\n6:54\nvisible light is just really part\n6:56\nof the electromagnetic spectrum.\n6:59\nSo light is really just electromagnetic radiation.\n7:09\nAnd everything that I told you about light just now--\n7:11\nit has a wave property and it has particle properties--\n7:15\nthis is not just specific to visible light.\n7:17\nThis is true of all of electromagnetic radiation.\n7:22\nSo at very low frequencies or very long wavelengths--\n7:25\nwe're talking about things like radio waves,\n7:27\nthe things that allow a radio to reach your car;\n7:31\nthe things that allow your cellphone\n7:34\nto communicate with cell towers; microwaves, the things that\n7:38\nstart vibrating water molecules in your food\n7:40\nso that they heat up; infrared, which\n7:43\nis what our body releases, and that's\n7:45\nwhy you can detect people through walls\n7:46\nwith infrared cameras; visible light; ultraviolet light,\n7:50\nthe UV light coming from the sun that'll give you sunburn;\n7:53\nX-rays, the radiation that allows\n7:55\nus to see through the soft material and just visualize\n7:58\nthe bones; gamma rays,\n7:59\nthe super high energy that comes from quasars\n8:03\nand other certain types of physical phenomena-- these\n8:05\nare all examples of the exact same thing.\n8:08\nWe just happen to perceive certain frequencies\n8:11\nof this as visible light.\n8:14\nAnd you might say, hey, Sal, how come we only\n8:15\nperceive certain frequencies of this?\n8:18\nHow can we only see these frequencies?\n8:23\nLiterally we can see those frequencies\n8:25\nwith our unaided eye.\n8:26\nAnd the reason, or at least my best guess\n8:28\nof the reason of that, is that's the frequency where\n8:30\nthe sun dumps out a lot of electromagnetic radiation.\n8:34\nSo it's inundating the Earth.\n8:36\nAnd if, as a species, you wanted to observe things\n8:38\nbased on reflected electromagnetic energy,\n8:42\nit is most useful to be able to perceive the things where there\n8:46\nis the most electromagnetic radiation.\n8:48\nSo it is possible that in other realities or other planets\n8:51\nthere are species that perceive more\n8:53\nin the ultraviolet range or the infrared range.\n8:55\nAnd even on Earth, there are some\n8:57\nthat perform better at either end of the range.\n8:59\nBut we see really well in the part of the spectrum\n9:02\nwhere the sun just happens to dump a lot of radiation on us.\n9:08\nNow I'll leave you there.\n9:09\nI think that's a pretty good overview of light.\n9:11\nAnd if any of this stuff seems kind\n9:14\nof unintuitive or daunting, or really\n9:17\non some level confusing-- this wave-particle duality,\n9:20\nthis idea of a transfer of energy through nothing--\n9:25\nand it seems unintuitive, don't worry.\n9:27\nIt seems unintuitive even for the best of physicists.\n9:30\nSo you're already at the leading edge of physics thinking.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] All right, now we're gonna talk\n0:01\nabout the idea of an electric current.\n0:04\nThe story about currents starts with the idea of charge.\n0:08\nWe've learned that we have two kinds of charges,\n0:11\npositive and negative charge.\n0:13\nWe'll just make up two little charges like that.\n0:17\nAnd we know if they're the opposite sign,\n0:20\nthat there'll be a force of attraction between them.\n0:24\nAnd if they have two like signs,\n0:27\nhere's two charges that are both positive,\n0:31\nand these charges are gonna repel each other.\n0:34\nSo this is the basic electrostatics idea,\n0:37\nand the same thing for two minus charges.\n0:39\nThey also repel.\n0:40\nSo like charges repel, and unlike charges attract.\n0:47\nThat's one idea.\n0:48\nWe have the idea of charge.\n0:49\nAnd now we need a place to get some charge.\n0:52\nOne of the places we like to get charge from\n0:54\nis copper, copper wires.\n0:58\nA copper atom looks like this.\n0:59\nCopper atom has a nucleus\n1:03\nwith some protons in it,\n1:05\nand it also has electrons flying around the outside,\n1:09\nelectrons in orbits around the outside.\n1:11\nSo we'll draw the electrons like this.\n1:13\nThere'll be orbits around this nucleus.\n1:19\nPretty good circles.\n1:22\nAnd there'll be electrons in these.\n1:25\nLittle minus signs.\n1:27\nThere's electrons stacked up in this.\n1:32\nAnd even farther out, there's electrons.\n1:39\nSo there's kind of a interesting looking copper atom.\n1:43\nCopper, the symbol for copper is Cu,\n1:46\nand its atomic number is 29.\n1:51\nThat means there's 29 protons inside here,\n1:53\nand there's 29 electrons outside.\n1:56\nIt turns out, just as a coincidence for copper,\n1:59\nthat the last orbital out here\n2:03\nhas just one electron in it,\n2:05\nthat guy right there.\n2:08\nAnd that's the one\n2:10\nthat is the easiest to pull away from copper\n2:13\nand have it go participate in conduction,\n2:17\nin electric current.\n2:21\nIf I have a chunk of copper,\n2:22\nevery copper atom will have the opportunity\n2:28\nto contribute one, this one lonely electron out here.\n2:33\nIf we look at another element, like for instance silver,\n2:37\nsilver has this same kind of electron configuration,\n2:41\nwhere there's just one out here.\n2:42\nAnd that's why silver and copper\n2:44\nare such good, good conductors.\n2:48\nNow we're gonna build,\n2:49\nlet's build a copper wire.\n2:51\nHere's sort of a copper wire.\n2:55\nIt's just made of solid copper.\n2:57\nIt's all full of copper atoms.\n3:01\nAnd I'm gonna put a voltage across this.\n3:08\nThere's our little battery.\n3:09\nThis is the minus sign, this is the plus side.\n3:12\nAnd we'll hook up a battery to this.\n3:19\nWhat's going on in here?\n3:20\nInside this copper is a whole bunch of electrons\n3:27\nthat are\n3:31\nassociated with atoms.\n3:32\nIt's a neutral piece of metal.\n3:35\nThere's the same number of protons as there is electrons.\n3:38\nBut these electrons are a little bit loose.\n3:40\nSo if I put a plus over there,\n3:43\nthat's this situation right here,\n3:44\nwhere a plus is attracting a minus.\n3:46\nSo an electron is gonna sort of wander\n3:49\nover this way and go like that.\n3:51\nAnd that's gonna leave a net positive charge in this region.\n3:55\nSo these electrons are all gonna\n3:56\nstart moving in this direction.\n4:00\nAnd down at the end,\n4:02\nhere, an electron is gonna come out of this battery,\n4:06\ntravel in here,\n4:08\nand it's gonna go in there and make up the difference.\n4:10\nSo if I had a net positive charge here\n4:13\nfrom the electrons leaving and going to the left,\n4:16\nthis battery would fill those in.\n4:18\nAnd I'm gonna get a net movement of charge,\n4:21\nof negative charge, around in this direction, like this.\n4:26\nThe question is, how do I measure that?\n4:28\nHow do I measure or give a number\n4:29\nto that amount of stuff that's going on?\n4:32\nSo we wanna quantify that, we wanna assign a number\n4:34\nto the amount of current happening here.\n4:37\nWhat we do is, in our heads,\n4:39\nwe put a boundary across here.\n4:40\nSo just make that up in your head.\n4:43\nAnd it cuts all the way through the copper.\n4:45\nAnd what we know, we're gonna stand right here.\n4:50\nWe're gonna keep our eye\n4:52\nright on this boundary down in here.\n4:55\nAs we watch, what we're gonna do is,\n4:57\nwe're gonna count the number of electrons\n5:01\nthat move by here,\n5:04\nand we're gonna have a stop watch\n5:05\nand we're gonna time that.\n5:07\nSo we're gonna get, basically,\n5:08\nthis is charge,\n5:10\nit's negative charge,\n5:12\nand it's moving to the side.\n5:13\nWhat we're gonna do is, at one little spot right here,\n5:15\nwe're just gonna count the number that go by in one second.\n5:18\nSo we're gonna get charge per second.\n5:23\nIt's gonna be a negative charge moving by.\n5:27\nThat's what we call current.\n5:32\nIt's the same as water flowing by in a river.\n5:34\nThat's the same idea.\n5:38\nNow I'm gonna set up a different situation\n5:42\nthat also produces a current.\n5:43\nAnd this time, we're gonna do it with water,\n5:45\nwater and salt.\n5:49\nLet's build a tube of salt, of salt water, like this.\n5:55\nWe're gonna pretend this is some tube\n5:56\nthat's all full of water.\n5:57\nI'm also gonna put a battery here.\n5:59\nLet's put another battery.\n6:07\nAnd we'll stick the wire into there.\n6:10\nWe'll stick the wire into there.\n6:13\nThis is the plus side of the battery,\n6:15\nand this is the minus side of the battery.\n6:18\nWater is H20,\n6:23\nand this does not conduct.\n6:24\nThere's no free electrons available here.\n6:26\nBut what I'm gonna do is,\n6:27\nI'm gonna put some table salt in it.\n6:29\nThis is ordinary salt that you put on your food.\n6:31\nIt's made of sodium, that's the symbol for sodium,\n6:36\nand chloride, Cl is chloride.\n6:39\nSodium chloride is table salt.\n6:41\nIf we sprinkle some table salt into water,\n6:44\nwhat happens is, these dissolve\n6:46\nand we get a net plus charge here\n6:49\nand a net minus charge on the chlorine.\n6:53\nSo out here is floating around Na's with plus signs\n6:58\nand Cl's nearby, really close nearly, with minuses.\n7:13\nLet's keep it even.\n7:18\nNow, when I dip my battery wires into this water,\n7:21\nwhat's gonna happen is,\n7:22\nthis plus charge,\n7:23\nthis plus charge over here from the battery\n7:27\nis gonna attract the minus Cl's.\n7:30\nSo the Cl's gonna move that way a little bit.\n7:34\nAnd over here, the same thing is happening.\n7:35\nThere's a minus sign here.\n7:37\nThere's a minus from the battery.\n7:42\nThat's going to attract this,\n7:45\nand it's also gonna repel Cl minuses.\n7:49\nSo what we get is a net motion\n7:52\nof positive charge, plus q going this way,\n7:59\nand we get minus q going this way.\n8:06\nHow do we measure that current?\n8:08\nHow do we measure that current?\n8:09\nWell, we do it the same way as we did up there with copper.\n8:12\nWe put a boundary through here in our heads.\n8:14\nWe stand here\n8:17\nand we watch the charges moving by.\n8:21\nWhat we're gonna get is some sodiums, Na's,\n8:25\nmoving this way,\n8:28\nand chlorines moving this way.\n8:30\nJust like we showed here.\n8:31\nNa\n8:35\nmoving this way.\n8:36\nSo there's gonna be plus charges moving through the boundary\n8:38\nand minus charges moving through the boundary\n8:41\nin the opposite direction.\n8:42\nIf I take the total sum of that.\n8:45\nFor example, if I see one Na go this way\n8:47\nand one Cl go this way,\n8:50\nthat's equivalent to two charges\n8:52\nmoving through the boundary.\n8:54\nHope that makes sense.\n8:55\nIt's equivalent to two charges,\n8:58\none going this way and one going this way.\n9:00\nBecause they have opposite signs,\n9:02\nthey add together and make two charges.\n9:05\nIn this case, current\n9:12\nis equal, again, to charge per second.",

it's\n4:30\n6.626 times 10 to the negative 34th joule times seconds.\n4:41\n10 to the negative 34th?\n4:42\nThere aren't many other numbers in physics that small.\n4:46\nTimes the frequency -- this is regular frequency.\n4:50\nSo frequency, number of oscillations per second,\n4:53\nmeasured in hertz.\n4:55\nSo now we can try to figure out,\n4:56\nwhy did physicists never discover this before?\n4:59\nAnd the reason is, Planck's constant is so small\n5:03\nthat the energy of these photons are extremely small.\n5:07\nThe graininess of this discrete amount of energy\n5:10\nthat's getting deposited is so small\n5:12\nthat it just looks smooth.\n5:14\nYou can't tell that there's a smallest amount,\n5:16\nor at least it's very hard to tell.\n5:17\nSo instead of just saying 'three units,'\n5:20\nlet's get specific.\n5:21\nFor violet light, what's the energy of one violet photon?\n5:31\nWell, the frequency of violet light is\n5:35\n7.5 times 10 to the 14th hertz.\n5:40\nSo if you take that number times this Planck's constant,\n5:43\n6.626 times 10 to the negative 34th,\n5:47\nyou'll get that the energy of one violet photon\n5:51\nis about five times 10 to the negative 19th joules.\n5:59\nFive times ten to the negative 19th,\n6:01\nthat's extremely small.\n6:03\nThat's hard to see.\n6:04\nThat's hard to notice,\n6:05\nthat energy's coming in this discrete amount.\n6:08\nIt's like water.\n6:09\nI mean, water from your sink.\n6:11\nWater flowing out of your sink looks continuous.\n6:14\nWe know there's really discrete water molecules in there,\n6:17\nand that you can only get one water molecule,\n6:20\nno water molecules, 10 water molecules,\n6:23\ndiscrete amounts of these water molecules,\n6:25\nbut there's so many of them and they're so small,\n6:27\nit's hard to tell that it's not just completely continuous.\n6:31\nThe same is happening with this light.\n6:33\nThis energy's extremely small.\n6:35\nEach violet photon has an extremely small amount of energy\n6:38\nthat it contributes.\n6:39\nIn fact, if you wanted to know how small it is,\n6:42\na baseball, a professional baseball player,\n6:46\nthrowing a ball fast, you know,\n6:47\nit's about 100 joules of energy.\n6:50\nIf you wanted to know how many of these photons,\n6:53\nhow many of these violet photons would it take\n6:55\nto equal the energy of one baseball\n6:58\nthrown at major league speed?\n7:00\nIt would take about two million trillion\n7:08\nof these photons to equal the energy\n7:11\nin a baseball that's thrown.\n7:13\nThat's why we don't see this on a macroscopic scale.\n7:17\nFor all intents and purposes, for all we care,\n7:20\nat a macroscopic level, light's basically continuous.\n7:24\nIt can deposit any energy whatsoever,\n7:27\nbecause the scale's so small here.\n7:29\nBut if you look at it up close,\n7:30\nlight can only deposit discrete amounts.\n7:33\nNow, I don't mean that light can only deposit\n7:36\nsmall amounts.\n7:38\nLight can deposit an enormous amount of energy,\n7:40\nbut it does so in chunks.\n7:42\nSo think about it this way ...\n7:43\nLet's get rid of all this.\n7:45\nThink about it this way:\n7:46\nlet's say you had a detector that's going to register\n7:51\nhow much energy it's absorbing,\n7:52\nand we'll graph it.\n7:54\nWe'll graph what this detector's going to measure,\n7:57\nthe amount of energy per time that it measures.\n8:00\nSo we'll get the amount of energy per time.\n8:04\nNow, you can absorb huge amounts of energy.\n8:07\nAnd on the detector, on a macroscopic scale,\n8:10\nit just might look like this.\n8:11\nYou know, you're getting more and more light energy.\n8:13\nYou're absorbing more and more energy,\n8:15\ncollecting more and more energy.\n8:17\nBut what I'm saying is that, microscopically,\n8:20\nif you look at this,\n8:21\nwhat's happening is, you've absorbed one photon here.\n8:25\nYou absorbed another one,\n8:26\nabsorbed another one,\n8:27\nabsorbed a bunch of them.\n8:28\nYou keep absorbing a bunch of these photons.\n8:30\nYou can build up a bunch of energy.\n8:33\nThat's fine.\n8:34\nIt's just if you looked at it close enough,\n8:36\nyou have this step pattern\n8:39\nthat's absorbing photons at a time,\n8:42\ncertain numbers of them.\n8:43\nMaybe it absorbs three at one moment,\n8:45\nfour at another moment.\n8:47\nBut you can't absorb anything in between.\n8:49\nIt can't be completely continuous.\n8:52\nIt has to be a discrete all-or-nothing moment\n8:57\nof absorption of energy that, on a macroscopic scale,\n9:00\nlooks smooth but on a microscopic scale is highlighted\n9:04\nby the fact that light energy is coming in discrete chunks,\n9:09\ndescribed by this equation\n9:12\nthat gives you the energy of individual photons of light.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nThere's a classic story out there\n0:04\nand it has to do with a character named Jack.\n0:06\nAnd you may have heard this story,\n0:08\nbut I'm sure that there is parts of that story\n0:10\nthat you have not heard.\n0:11\nAnd so I'm actually going to just try to fill in those parts\n0:14\nthat you get a complete idea of what happened.\n0:18\nNow Jack came across, a long time ago, a famous, now famous\n0:24\nbeanstalk.\n0:25\nSo this beanstalk was growing and growing\n0:29\nand had these huge leaves.\n0:31\nAnd actually Jack used these leaves\n0:34\nto make his way up this beanstalk.\n0:36\nAnd so, this is how this beanstalk became very famous.\n0:40\nBecause it basically allowed Jack to use it like a ladder.\n0:44\nNow the part that we don't hear about\n0:46\nis what was going on between Jack and the beanstalk.\n0:48\nHe was exercising, right?\n0:49\nSo he was actually making a lot of carbon dioxide.\n0:54\nHe was making a lot of this gas, this carbon dioxide gas,\n0:58\nas kind of a waste product as he was running,\n1:01\nscampering up the beanstalk.\n1:03\nAnd the beanstalk was helping him physically, but also\n1:07\nwas actually providing him with very precious oxygen.\n1:11\nIn fact, if the beanstalk didn't do that,\n1:13\nhe may not have even made it.\n1:15\nAnd we also, we don't know for sure,\n1:18\nbut we think that perhaps some of this story\n1:20\nmay have taken place during the day.\n1:23\nAnd in fact, we know that sunlight\n1:25\nis quite important for this process.\n1:27\nAnd we think that this process, the name that we give it\n1:31\nfor the beanstalk anyway, is photosynthesis.\n1:35\nAnd so what is really happening-- we're actually\n1:38\ngoing to kind of write it out here-- between Jack\n1:42\nand the beanstalk, and really between all plants and animals?\n1:45\nWhat is this process between them?\n1:47\nWe know that on the one hand, you\n1:48\nhave beanstalks doing photosynthesis,\n1:51\nand on the other hand, you have folks like Jack\n1:54\ndoing cellular respiration.\n1:57\nAnd there's this really kind of interesting symbiosis.\n2:01\nAnd by that I just mean that the two are\n2:03\nkind of relying on each other to really work.\n2:07\nSo you kind of need both of them to work well.\n2:09\nAnd so let's actually take a moment\n2:11\nto write out these processes that\n2:13\nare happening between Jack and the beanstalk.\n2:16\nSo let's start with the process of photosynthesis,\n2:19\nthe beanstalk.\n2:20\nSo on the one hand, you've got what?\n2:23\nYou've got water because, of course,\n2:25\nthe beanstalk needs water, and you've got carbon dioxide.\n2:31\nAnd I'm going to do carbon oxide in orange.\n2:34\nSo it's taking in water and carbon dioxide.\n2:37\nAnd it's going to put out, it's going\n2:41\nto actually take these ingredients\n2:43\nif you want to think of it as kind of cooking,\n2:45\nit's going to take these ingredients\n2:46\nand it's going to put out.\n2:49\nIt's going to put out what?\n2:51\nOxygen and glucose.\n2:54\nSo I'll put glucose up top and oxygen down below.\n2:59\nSo these are the inputs and outputs of photosynthesis.\n3:04\nAnd on the other side, you've got something very similar.\n3:07\nYou've got inputs.\n3:08\nYou've got glucose and oxygen going in.\n3:11\nYou're going to start seeing some serious similarities here.\n3:16\nYou've got glucose and oxygen going in.\n3:18\nSo Jack is taking in those two things.\n3:21\nAnd he is again, of course, processing them.\n3:25\nAnd he's putting out water and carbon dioxide.\n3:31\nSo this looks really, really nice, right?\n3:34\nLooks perfect actually.\n3:35\nBecause everything is nice and balanced.\n3:38\nAnd you can see how it makes perfect sense that,\n3:41\nnot only did Jack need the beanstalk,\n3:42\nbut actually it sounds like the beanstalk needed Jack,\n3:45\nbased on how I've drawn it.\n3:46\nNow remember, none of this would even\n3:48\nhappen if there was no sunlight.\n3:50\nSo we actually need light energy.\n3:52\nIn fact, that's the whole purpose of this, right?\n3:54\nGetting energy.\n3:56\nSo you have to have some light energy.\n3:58\nI'm going to put a big plus sign,\n4:00\nand I might even circle it because it's so important.\n4:02\nI don't want you to lose track of it.\n4:04\nAnd on the other side, of course,\n4:05\nJack is getting something as well.\n4:08\nHe's getting chemical energy.\n4:11\nIn fact, he's using the chemical energy\n4:14\nto help him climb the beanstalk.\n4:16\nAnd so the chemical energy comes in the form\n4:18\nof what we call ATP, which is just a molecule of high energy.\n4:24\nAnd so Jack and the beanstalk are basically\n4:28\ngoing from light energy to chemical energy using these two\n4:33\nequations.\n4:33\nNow here's the part that people don't always appreciate.\n4:36\nAnd I'm actually going to take just a moment to show you\n4:39\nthat this isn't the full story.\n4:41\nThere's actually something else going on as well.\n4:44\nAnd that is that there's actually\n4:47\nsome cellular respiration happening on the plant's side.\n4:51\nSo remember, not only does the human, or the Jack,\n4:55\nneed energy, but so does the plant.\n4:58\nThe plant needs energy as well.\n5:00\nAnd in fact, if it takes in light energy right here,\n5:03\nit needs to find a way to actually,\n5:04\neventually get some chemical energy itself,\n5:07\nso that it can do all the things it needs to do.\n5:10\nIt doesn't need to run because plants don't\n5:12\nmove in that sense, but it might need to make new roots,\n5:15\nand may need to make a flower, and all these things\n5:18\ntake energy.\n5:20\nSo actually, photosynthesis is happening during the day,\n5:26\nbut at all times plants are also capable of doing\n5:31\ncellular respiration, just like humans are.\n5:34\nSo humans and plants have actually more\n5:37\nin common than you might think.\n5:39\nSo, this brings up an obvious question.\n5:41\nWhy in the world would a plant send its glucose and oxygen\n5:48\nthis way, when it needs it itself?\n5:51\nYou know, why would it actually get rid of it?\n5:54\nWell, the truth is, that the glucose ends up oftentimes\n5:57\nin fruits and vegetables that we eat.\n5:59\nBut as far as the oxygen goes, it makes an excess of oxygen.\n6:04\nSo there is actually enough oxygen\n6:06\nto go both to us, or to Jack and to be used by itself.\n6:12\nSo it actually has an excess of oxygen that it's making.\n6:15\nSo this is actually kind of interesting and good to know.\n6:17\nNow if you think about it, if I was to,\n6:19\nlet's say sketch out a planet.\n6:22\nLet's draw a little planet over here, and ask you the question.\n6:27\nIf this was your planet Earth, and you've\n6:29\ngot thousands, instead of just one Jack, let's say now\n6:32\nyou have thousands of Jacks and thousands of beanstalks,\n6:36\nin fact, not even thousands.\n6:37\nLet's say billions, because really, that's what we have.\n6:41\nWe have a planet full of humans, and full of other animals,\n6:44\nand full of plants.\n6:46\nWhat would the atmosphere look like?\n6:48\nThis is the atmosphere.\n6:50\nWhat would the atmosphere look like?\n6:52\nWell you'd guess that the atmosphere is gas.\n6:57\nAnd so what would those gases be?\n6:59\nWell, the way I've drawn things again,\n7:02\nit looks like I've got lots of oxygen and lots\n7:05\nof carbon dioxide.\n7:06\nSo I would say well, I guess there must be, I don't know,\n7:09\nmaybe 50-50 carbon dioxide and oxygen\n7:12\nbased on what we know so far.\n7:15\nAnd the truth is, that's actually not true.\n7:17\nThat if you actually look at air, if you actually break down\n7:21\nthe atmosphere or air-- I'm just going to write \"air\" here--\n7:25\nif you actually break it down, turns out\n7:27\nthat the ratios are actually a little different.\n7:30\nSo for example, oxygen makes up about 21% of our air.\n7:35\nThis is our air breakdown.\n7:40\nAnd carbon dioxide makes up about less than 1%.\n7:44\nSo, that leaves you wondering, what the heck is making up\n7:47\nall that other parts of air?\n7:50\nWhat is it made of?\n7:51\nAnd in truth, it's about 78% nitrogen.\n7:57\nNow you know, you've got nitrogen in your proteins,\n8:00\nwe've got nitrogen in our DNA.\n8:03\nSo nitrogen is part of us and is part of many, many living\n8:07\nthings.\n8:08\nBut nitrogen gas, specifically, is actually N2.\n8:13\nAnd N2, this nitrogen gas, really is not too reactive.\n8:18\nIt kind of just hangs out by itself,\n8:20\ndoes not like to react with things.\n8:22\nSo, looking at our little atmosphere graph,\n8:25\nif you want to now think about it,\n8:26\nknowing that we've got very little carbon dioxide and about\n8:30\n21% oxygen-- you could think of oxygen being,\n8:34\nlet's say, something like that-- well then relative\n8:36\nto that nitrogen would be much more.\n8:40\nYou have much more nitrogen hanging out.\n8:45\nAnd so this is really what our atmosphere looks like.\n8:47\nIt looks more filled with nitrogen than anything else.\n8:52\nAnd in terms of carbon dioxide, it's\n8:54\njust got a little smidge of carbon dioxide.\n8:56\nMaybe right there.\n8:58\nThat could be carbon dioxide, maybe even less than that.\n9:01\nSo this is really what our atmosphere looks like,\n9:03\nvisually.\n9:04\nAnd the nitrogen again, it's making up the majority.\n9:07\nAnd if you actually wonder where all that nitrogen is coming\n9:10\nfrom, because I didn't mention it in any of the equations,\n9:13\nmost of that nitrogen has been around,\n9:15\nscientists think, since the beginning\n9:17\nof when earth even had an atmosphere.\n9:20\nAnd that nitrogen, we're just kind\n9:21\nof carrying with us at all times.\n9:24\nAnd that's why it just remains around 78%,\n9:27\nand will probably remain there for many, many years to come.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] In the last videos, we constructed\n0:01\na little bit of a conundrum for us.\n0:03\nWe had the situation where I'm drifting through space,\n0:07\nand right at time equal zero,\n0:09\none of my friends, she passes me by\n0:13\nin a spaceship going half the speed of light\n0:15\nin the positive x direction, relative to me.\n0:18\nAnd at time equal zero,\n0:20\nis exactly where she is at my position.\n0:23\nAnd then she keeps traveling, and so I draw\n0:26\nthe path that she is taking.\n0:28\nSo after one second, she would be here,\n0:30\nafter two seconds, she would be there,\n0:32\nand we set up our scales\n0:33\nso that on our time axis,\n0:36\none second is the same length\n0:39\nas on our space axis, or on our path axis,\n0:42\nthree times ten to the eighth meters.\n0:44\nAnd we did that so that at least in my frame of reference,\n0:47\nthe speed of light would be at a 45 degree angle,\n0:50\nor would have a slope of one.\n0:52\nBut the conundrum we hit was\n0:54\nis that the speed of light would be perceived,\n0:56\nbased on this model I set up,\n0:57\nwould be perceived differently\n0:59\nbased on which frame of reference you're in.\n1:01\nThe photon that I emit from my flashlight,\n1:04\nright at time equals zero,\n1:05\nwell sure I'm going to see that as moving\n1:08\nat the speed of light in the positive x direction.\n1:10\nBut my friend, since she's already moving\n1:13\nin that positive x direction at half of the speed of light,\n1:16\nif we assumed a Newtonian world,\n1:18\nshe would see that photon going at half the speed of light.\n1:21\nAnd likewise, if she emitted a photon from her flashlight,\n1:26\nto her, it would look like it's going at the speed of light,\n1:28\nbut to me, it would look like it's going faster\n1:31\nthan the speed of light.\n1:33\nAnd the reason why that is a conundrum\n1:35\nis we know from observation of the universe around us,\n1:39\nand this is profound, this is a little mind-blowing,\n1:41\nthis is counterintuitive to our everyday experience,\n1:44\nbut we know from observation\n1:46\nthat the speed of light is absolute,\n1:49\nthat it doesn't matter your inertial frame of reference.\n1:52\nAs long as you're in an inertial frame of reference,\n1:54\nit doesn't matter your relative velocity\n1:56\nrelative to another inertial frame of reference.\n1:59\nYou will always measure the speed of light\n2:01\nat three times ten to the eighth meters per second.\n2:04\nBut that's at a direct contradiction\n2:06\nwith what our model just set up.\n2:08\nSo it really forces us to question all of our assumptions.\n2:12\nSo what are the assumptions that we made\n2:14\nin this Newtonian world?\n2:15\nWell, we assumed that time is absolute.\n2:19\nTime is absolute.\n2:21\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n2:22\nWell, we assumed that one second passing for me\n2:25\nis going to be one second passing for my friend.\n2:28\nThat's just our everyday notion.\n2:30\nIf I'm in a car and you're not in a car,\n2:33\nand we both have watches, and we synchronize our watches,\n2:35\nthey seem to say synchronized.\n2:38\nBut maybe we need to loosen this assumption.\n2:42\nWe also assumed that space is absolute.\n2:45\nSpace is absolute.\n2:49\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n2:50\nWell in our everyday experience,\n2:52\nregardless of what our relative frames of reference are,\n2:55\nwe seem to agree that, well if that meter stick over there,\n2:59\nthat's riding on that train,\n3:01\nthat is a meter stick, whether I'm sitting on the train\n3:03\nor whether I'm not.\n3:04\nBut maybe things start to break down a little bit\n3:07\nas we think about higher velocities.\n3:11\nAnd maybe they break down even at the slower velocities,\n3:13\nbut we just don't notice them\n3:14\nbecause it's a very small error.\n3:15\nAnd maybe there's something even more interesting.\n3:18\nIn our everyday experience,\n3:19\nwe just assume that time is somehow\n3:23\nsomething very different than space,\n3:26\nthat you can move in the time direction\n3:28\nwithout moving in the space direction,\n3:30\nor you can move in the space direction\n3:32\nwithout moving in the time direction,\n3:33\nand that they're independent regardless\n3:35\nof which inertial frame of reference you're in.\n3:38\nBut maybe they aren't separate things.\n3:40\nIn fact, maybe they're all one continuum of spacetime,\n3:45\nand I don't mean space dash time,\n3:47\nI mean spacetime.\n3:48\nI mean the word spacetime,\n3:53\nwhere space and time really aren't different things.\n3:54\nIt's just one continuum, spacetime.\n3:57\nAnd I keep saying it fast like that,\n3:59\nbecause it's not space dash time,\n4:03\nlike thinking about the different dimensions,\n4:05\nor thinking about two different things.\n4:07\nWe're renaming one thing called spacetime.\n4:11\nSo these are the things that we're going to start\n4:13\nto hold into question.\n4:14\nSo what if we loosen these, and we assume the thing\n4:18\nthat we have observed in the universe,\n4:20\nthat the speed of light is absolute,\n4:22\nregardless of your inertial frame of reference.\n4:26\nSo let's word from there, do a little thought experiment,\n4:28\nand then think about what type of a model we can construct,\n4:31\nin which case the speed of light is absolute.\n4:35\nAnd to do that, we're still going to use\n4:36\nour little model here,\n4:38\nand we're going to focus on my friend's frame of reference,\n4:41\nmy friend who's on a spaceship,\n4:42\nwho right at time equal zero, is passing me by\n4:45\nat half the speed of light.\n4:47\nAnd we assumed that she's in this train of spaceships.\n4:50\nSo we assumed already that she's,\n4:52\nthere are these spaceships that are all moving\n4:54\nat half the speed of light in the positive x direction,\n4:56\nrelative to me,\n4:57\nand they're all three times ten to the eighth meters apart.\n5:01\nSo they're like that.\n5:02\nSo let's say, and I did these axes in blue,\n5:05\nbecause we're assuming this is my friend's\n5:07\nframe of reference, so you could say\n5:08\nthis is the S prime frame of reference,\n5:10\nthis is Sally's frame of reference\n5:12\nfrom a couple of videos ago.\n5:14\nLet's say a second before she gets to me,\n5:16\nand I'm also assuming, the way I've drawn these axes,\n5:18\nand we're going to modify them in the future\n5:20\nwhere we're actually going to use the same units\n5:22\nfor space and time.\n5:22\nRight now, I'm still sticking to what we've classically done\n5:25\nwhere we use seconds for time\n5:26\nand meters for our path or our space,\n5:29\nbut in the future, we'll actually use meters for both.\n5:31\nBut we'll get to that, I don't want to do\n5:33\ntoo many things at once.\n5:34\nBut the way I've drawn it\n5:37\nalong my space axis,\n5:39\nthree times ten to the eighth meters\n5:41\nis going to be the exact same length as one second,\n5:44\nand I'm doing that so that the path of light\n5:47\non my diagram\n5:49\ncan be a 45 degree angle.\n5:51\nSo this is three times ten to the eighth meters\n5:55\nright over there.\n5:56\nSo let's say a second before Sally gets to me,\n5:59\nshe releases a photon from her spaceship\n6:03\nin the direction of the spaceship that is in front of her.\n6:06\nHow far is it in front of her?\n6:07\nIt's three times ten to the eighth meters in front of her.\n6:10\nAnd let's say on the back of that spaceship,\n6:12\nthere is a mirror.\n6:14\nSo she's pointing her flashlight at that mirror.\n6:17\nSo what's going to happen from her frame of reference\n6:19\nafter one second?\n6:21\nSo for one second, from her frame of reference,\n6:23\nshe is stationary, so this is Sally still here.\n6:26\nShe is going to be still at x prime equals zero\n6:30\nin her frame of reference,\n6:31\nand that ship is still going to be\n6:34\nthree times ten to the eighth meters in front of her.\n6:36\nThey're all moving, relative to me, at the same velocity,\n6:39\nbut relative to each other, they seem to be stationary.\n6:41\nAnd so what would be the path of that photon?\n6:43\nWell that photon will have gone from Sally's flashlight\n6:47\nfrom her headlamp, or whatever it is,\n6:49\nto that spaceship in front of her\n6:50\nwould've just reached that mirror\n6:52\non the back of that spaceship.\n6:54\nAnd so we can draw the path of light.\n6:56\nIt will be, so let me,\n6:59\nso that path of light\n7:01\nwill look like that on this diagram.\n7:05\nAnd then right at this moment,\n7:07\nright at t prime equals zero seconds,\n7:10\nthe photon will be reflected back to Sally.\n7:13\nWell how long will it take to get back to Sally?\n7:16\nWell Sally's gonna receive the reflection of that photon\n7:19\nafter one second, because that's how long\n7:20\nit's going to take it to go\n7:21\nthree times ten to the eighth meters.\n7:23\nSo the path of that very first photon,\n7:26\nthe path of that very first photon\n7:28\nis going to look like that.\n7:31\nAll right, well hopefully this is pretty\n7:33\nstraightforward here.\n7:35\nThis is what would happen from Sally's frame of reference.\n7:37\nA second before she reaches me,\n7:39\nat t prime equals negative one seconds,\n7:43\nemits a photon at t equals zero seconds,\n7:45\nand gets to the spaceship\n7:47\nthat's three times ten to the eighth meters in front of her,\n7:50\nessentially one light-second in front of her,\n7:53\nand then a second later,\n7:54\nit's reflecting back, a second later,\n7:56\nshe gets the reflection.\n7:58\nAnd so that's what this diagram is describing.\n8:01\nBut now let's draw it projected on top\n8:03\nof my frame of reference.\n8:05\nAnd this is when things are going to get\n8:06\nreally, really, really, really interesting.\n8:09\nSo I've drawn my frame of reference here,\n8:10\nand I've intentionally not marked off the seconds\n8:13\nor the meters on my frame of reference,\n8:14\nbecause once again, I'm not going to assume\n8:16\nthat a second in my frame of reference\n8:18\nis a second in hers, or a meter in my frame of reference\n8:20\nis a meter in hers.\n8:22\nI have drawn her t prime axis at the same angle\n8:25\nas I did before,\n8:27\nbecause for every second\n8:31\nwe move into the future,\n8:34\nshe's going to move half a light-second in distance,\n8:37\nin the positive x direction.\n8:39\nSo this slope right here, one way to think about it,\n8:41\nthe way I've drawn it,\n8:42\nthis is a slope of two.\n8:47\nFor every unit she moves in the x direction,\n8:50\nshe will move two in the time direction.\n8:54\nAnd what we're going to do again\n8:55\nis assume that on her axis,\n8:58\nI haven't drawn the x prime axis.\n8:59\nIn fact, this is an exercise to think about\n9:00\nwhere should the x prime axis be.\n9:03\nShould it be coincident with the x axis\n9:04\nlike we assumed before?\n9:05\nOr is it going to be in a different place?\n9:07\nBut we're going to assume that the lengths I draw\n9:10\nfor one second on, let's say,\n9:12\nin the S prime frame of reference,\n9:15\nis going to be the same as the length I would draw\n9:17\nfor three times ten to the eighth meters.\n9:20\nAnd we're also going to assume\n9:21\nthat the speed of light is absolute,\n9:22\nso it's always going to moving at a 45 degree angle\n9:25\nwith respect to either frame of reference.\n9:29\nSo that's where things are going to get a little bit whacky,\n9:31\nbut let's see what's going to happen.\n9:32\nSo at negative one seconds,\n9:35\nwe still have Sally turning on her flashlight.\n9:38\nShe wants to bounce it off of the spaceship in front of her.\n9:41\nAnd so that photon's going to move with the speed of light\n9:44\nin either frame of reference.\n9:46\nAnd so let me draw that.\n9:48\nLet me draw that,\n9:49\nso it's going to look like this.\n9:53\nI'm drawing at a 45 degree angle.\n9:55\nSo actually, I don't know where it gets reflected.\n9:57\nIt's gonna get reflected where it hits that x prime axis,\n9:59\nbut I don't know where that is.\n10:01\nBut we do know that it then gets reflected,\n10:03\nand then it gets back to Sally at one second in the future.\n10:06\nSo the return path of that photon\n10:09\nis going to look something\n10:11\nis going to look something like this.\n10:13\nAnd that point that it changes direction,\n10:14\nI could have,\n10:16\nlet me,\n10:16\nI could have done it like this,\n10:18\nwhoops,\n10:19\nI could've done it like this.\n10:20\nBut the interesting point is where it changes direction\n10:22\nbecause that's where that spaceship in front of her\n10:25\nmust be at that point in spacetime.\n10:28\nBecause now we're going to start thinking of mixing up\n10:30\nspace and time,\n10:31\nbut I'm not going to get too much involved in that.\n10:33\nNow why is this interesting?\n10:35\nBecause from Sally's point of view,\n10:38\nfrom Sally's point of view,\n10:39\nthis point here where the light changes direction,\n10:44\nfrom Sally's frame of reference,\n10:45\nis happening simultaneously with when she reaches me.\n10:50\nThis is happening at t prime\n10:52\nis equal to zero for Sally.\n10:55\nSo anything that is t prime is equal to zero for Sally\n10:59\nmust be on the x prime axis.\n11:02\nSo this must sit on the x prime axis.\n11:05\nOnce again, why do I know that?\n11:06\nBecause everything on the x prime axis,\n11:08\nany event on the x prime axis,\n11:11\nlet me do it in a different color,\n11:13\nI keep doing black.\n11:15\nAny event on the x prime axis\n11:18\nis going to be at t prime is equal to zero seconds,\n11:22\nand from Sally's frame of reference\n11:24\nis going to be simultaneous with when she passes me up.\n11:27\nSo based on that, we know that this is going to be,\n11:32\nwe know that this point,\n11:34\nwhich is where Sally is,\n11:36\nthat's going to be the origin from her frame of reference.\n11:38\nAnd we know that this point sits on the x prime axis,\n11:43\nso based on that, we can draw the x prime axis.\n11:45\nYou just need two points to define a line,\n11:47\nand so let me try to do it.\n11:50\nSo let me try to draw.\n11:52\nI can do a better job than that.\n11:54\nLet me try to draw\n11:55\nthe x prime axis.\n11:57\nIt's going to look like,\n12:00\nit's going to look like this.\n12:02\nThat right over there is the x prime axis.\n12:04\nNow at this point, you should find this mildly mind-blowing.\n12:07\nActually, even more than mildly mind-blowing.\n12:10\n'Cause it's saying some pretty, pretty crazy things.\n12:12\nFirst of all, let's just make sure we know how to read this.\n12:15\nSo for any event,\n12:17\nand now we're going to start thinking\n12:18\nin terms of spacetime,\n12:20\nalthough I'm still using different units for space and time,\n12:23\nbut we'll address that in the future.\n12:25\nIf I want to read its coordinates in my frame of reference,\n12:27\nwell if I want to read its x coordinate,\n12:29\nI go parallel to the t axis,\n12:31\nand if I wanna read its t coordinate,\n12:33\nI go parallel to the x axis.\n12:35\nBut for Sally's frame of reference,\n12:36\nwell I essentially do the same thing.\n12:38\nIf I want its x prime coordinates,\n12:40\nI go parallel to the t prime axis,\n12:43\nand if I want the t prime coordinates,\n12:46\nI go parallel to the x prime axis.\n12:49\nBut what's really interesting,\n12:51\nand I'll go even deeper into this into the next videos,\n12:55\nthat moment,\n12:56\nthat moment right over here,\n12:58\nthat from Sally's frame of reference,\n13:01\nit looks like it's simultaneous with her passing me up.\n13:04\nIt looks like it's happening at t prime equals zero.\n13:07\nIn fact, it is happening at t prime equals zero.\n13:08\nFrom her frame of reference,\n13:09\nit's happening at t prime equals zero.\n13:12\nFrom our frame of reference,\n13:14\nit is happening after Sally passes us up.\n13:17\nNotice, it is happening at t equals some positive value.\n13:20\nIt's not happening at t equals zero.\n13:23\nSo this is starting to get a little bit whacky.\n13:25\nOne second, and simultaneous, time, and space,\n13:30\nand things being simultaneous,\n13:33\nwe're not going to agree on those,\n13:35\ndepending on which frame of reference we're in.\n13:37\nThe thing we will agree on is the speed of light.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- In the last video, we saw how to draw dot structures\n0:03\nfor molecules with single covalent bonds.\n0:05\nIn this video, we'll talk about multiple covalent bonds,\n0:08\nand so we start the same way we did in the last video.\n0:10\nIf I wanted to draw out a dot structure for C2H4,\n0:13\nI would find carbon over here,\n0:16\nand once again, carbon in is group four,\n0:18\nso it has four valence electrons,\n0:20\nso I'm gonna go ahead and put in once carbon\n0:22\nwith four valence electrons,\n0:24\nand I know I have another carbon in my dot structure.\n0:27\nIt also has four valence electrons, like that,\n0:29\nand so immediately, I can see there's going to be\n0:32\na single covalent bond between my two carbons, like that.\n0:36\nFour hydrogens, and I know that, since hydrogen is\n0:39\nin group one on our periodic table,\n0:43\nhydrogen has one valence electron.\n0:45\nNow, it makes sense to go ahead and put two hydrogens\n0:47\non each carbon, so if I put one hydrogen over here\n0:51\nand then another hydrogen on this carbon,\n0:54\nI have two more hydrogens, and so I can go ahead\n0:56\nand put in those two hydrogens on the carbon on the right.\n0:59\nWhen I connect my dots, I can see that I have a bond\n1:02\nbetween carbon and hydrogen here,\n1:05\nand this is not the correct dot structure,\n1:07\nbecause if you count up the number of electrons\n1:10\naround carbons, let's go ahead and do it.\n1:12\nLet's do the carbon on the left.\n1:14\nI'm going to get two,\n1:16\nfour,\n1:18\nsix,\n1:19\nand then seven electrons,\n1:21\nso with only seven electrons around each carbon,\n1:24\ncarbon does not satisfy the octet rule,\n1:27\nso the only way for carbon to get\n1:29\nan octet of electrons around it would be\n1:32\nif this magenta electron moved in here,\n1:36\nand this electron moves in here\n1:38\nto form a double covalent bond between those two carbons,\n1:42\nand so now, instead of only having one bond\n1:45\nbetween those carbons, now there are going to be two bonds\n1:48\naround it like that,\n1:49\nso I can go ahead and put in my hydrogens,\n1:51\nso two on each carbon,\n1:52\nand that is the correct dot structure\n1:54\nfor ethene or ethylene.\n1:56\nWe can double check by checking the octet rule here,\n2:00\nso if I look at each carbon, there would be two electrons,\n2:03\nfour,\n2:04\nsix,\n2:06\nand then eight,\n2:07\nso each carbon is following the octet rule\n2:09\nfor my dot structure.\n2:11\nLet's do one for CH20,\n2:14\nso if I want to draw the dot structure\n2:17\nfor the molecular formula CH20,\n2:21\nonce again, I start with carbon in the center,\n2:24\nso four valence electrons like that,\n2:27\nand two hydrogens, so I'll just put one hydrogen over here\n2:31\non the left and another hydrogen over here on the right.\n2:34\nOxygen, let's go back to our organic periodic table\n2:37\nto refresh our memory about how many valence electrons\n2:41\noxygen will have, and we can see\n2:44\nit's in group six over here, so six valence electrons,\n2:47\nso I can go ahead and put in my six valence electrons\n2:51\nfor oxygen, and so we'll go one,\n2:54\nand then two,\n2:56\nand then three,\n2:58\nand then four,\n3:00\nand then five,\n3:02\nand then six, like that.\n3:04\nAnd when I start connecting my bonds here,\n3:07\nI know there's a bond between carbon and hydrogen\n3:10\non the left and I know there's a bond\n3:11\nbetween carbon and hydrogen on the right.\n3:12\nI know there's a bond between this carbon and oxygen,\n3:16\nand unfortunately, I still don't have an octet of electrons\n3:19\naround my carbon or around my oxygen, alright?\n3:22\nSo if I go ahead and highlight the electrons around carbon,\n3:24\nonce again, I have two,\n3:26\nfour,\n3:28\nsix,\n3:29\nand then seven,\n3:30\nso I still don't have an octet of electrons around carbon,\n3:33\nand so I need to share an electron with oxygen here,\n3:37\nso carbon is going to contribute an electron,\n3:40\nand oxygen is going to contribute an electron like that,\n3:43\nand so, instead of a single bond between carbon and oxygen,\n3:46\nthere's actually going to be a double bond, like that.\n3:49\nThere's still two lone pairs of electrons\n3:51\naround that oxygen, and then I have my two hydrogens\n3:54\ncoming off of my carbon like that,\n3:57\nso that is the correct dot structure for formaldehyde.\n4:00\nWe can go ahead and double check an octet.\n4:02\nAlright, so if I look at this carbon here,\n4:04\nit's gonna be two,\n4:06\nfour,\n4:07\nsix,\n4:08\nand eight, and obviously, there's also an octet\n4:11\naround that oxygen as well,\n4:12\nso this is the dot structure for formaldehyde.\n4:16\nLet's do one more example\n4:19\nof a molecule with a multiple covalent bond, so C2H2.\n4:24\nSo, once again, carbon with four valence electrons,\n4:27\nand I have two carbons this time,\n4:30\nso I go ahead and put in my second carbon\n4:31\nwith four valence electrons like that.\n4:34\nI can see, immediately, a single covalent bond\n4:37\nbetween my two carbons.\n4:38\nNow I have two hydrogens,\n4:40\nso once again, I'm gonna put one hydrogen\n4:42\non the carbon on the left and connect that\n4:45\nfor a single covalent bond,\n4:46\nand it would make sense to put the other hydrogen\n4:48\nover here on the right and connect that for another bond.\n4:51\nNow, once again, if I look at the valence electrons\n4:54\nfor carbon, I have a total of two,\n4:57\nfour,\n4:58\nfive,\n5:00\nand six, and carbon wants to get to eight.\n5:02\nIt wants an octet, so it needs to share two more electrons,\n5:07\nso each carbon needs to share two more electrons\n5:09\nso each carbon can get to an octet,\n5:11\nso we're gonna go ahead and move this electron in here,\n5:14\nand this electron in here,\n5:16\nand then we'd also have to move these electrons\n5:19\nin here as well,\n5:20\nso we're going to end up with a triple,\n5:22\na triple bond between my two carbon atoms there.\n5:26\nSo, if I go ahead and show now three bonds\n5:29\nbetween my two carbons, and then a hydrogen on either side,\n5:32\nwe can double check the octets on the carbon here,\n5:35\nso I'll get out the magenta again,\n5:37\nso two,\n5:38\nfour,\n5:39\nsix,\n5:40\nand eight, so there is now an octet,\n5:43\nand so this is the correct dot structure\n5:45\nfor ethyne or acetylene,\n5:47\nand so we've seen how to draw molecules\n5:49\nwith single and multiple covalent bonds,\n5:52\nand next we're going to talk about\n5:54\nthe hybridization states of different molecules\n5:57\nthat contain carbon.",

238 protons and neutrons,\nbut roughly one in every 140\nlacks three neutrons,\nand this lighter isotope is less\ntightly bound.\nCompared to its more abundant cousin,\na strike by a neutron easily splits\nthe U-235 nuclei\ninto lighter, radioactive elements\ncalled fission products,\nin addition to two to three neutrons,\ngamma rays,\nand a few neutrinos.\nDuring fission, some nuclear mass\ntransforms into energy.\nA fraction of the newfound energy\npowers the fast-moving neutrons,\nand if some of them strike uranium nuclei,\nfission results in a second \nlarger generation of neutrons.\nIf this second generation of neutrons\nstrike more uranium nuclei,\nmore fission results in an even\nlarger third generation, and so on.\nBut inside a nuclear reactor,\nthis spiraling chain reaction is tamed\nusing control rods\nmade of elements that capture excess \nneutrons and keep their number in check.\nWith a controlled chain reaction,\na reactor draws power steadily\nand stably for years.\nThe neutron-led chain reaction\nis a potent process driving nuclear power,\nbut there's a catch that can result\nin unique demands \non the production of its fuel.\nIt turns out, most of the neutrons emitted\nfrom fission have too much kinetic energy\nto be captured by uranium nuclei.\nThe fission rate is too low\nand the chain reaction fizzles out.\nThe first nuclear reactor built in Chicago\nused graphite as a moderator\nto scatter and slow down \nneutrons just enough\nto increase their capture by uranium\nand raise the rate of fission.\nModern reactors commonly use\npurified water as a moderator,\nbut the scattered neutrons are still\na little too fast.\nTo compensate \nand keep up the chain reaction,\nthe concentration of U-235 is enriched\nto four to seven times \nits natural abundance.\nToday, enrichment is often done by\npassing a gaseous uranium compound\nthrough centrifuges\nto separate lighter U-235 \nfrom heavier U-238.\nBut the same process can be continued\nto highly enrich U-235\nup to 130 times its natural abundance\nand create an explosive chain reaction\nin a bomb.\nMethods like centrifuge processing\nmust be carefully regulated\nto limit the spread of bomb-grade fuel.\nRemember, only a fraction \nof the released fission energy\ngoes into speeding up neutrons.\nMost of the nuclear power goes into the\nkinetic energy of the fission products.\nThose are captured inside the reactor\nas heat by a coolant,\nusually purified water.\nThis heat is eventually used to drive\nan electric turbine generator by steam\njust outside the reactor.\nWater flow is critical \nnot only to create electricity,\nbut also to guard against the most dreaded\ntype of reactor accident,\nthe meltdown.\nIf water flow stops because a pipe\ncarrying it breaks,\nor the pumps that push it fail,\nthe uranium heats up very quickly\nand melts.\nDuring a nuclear meltdown,\nradioactive vapors escape \ninto the reactor,\nand if the reactor fails to hold them,\na steel and concrete containment building\nis the last line of defense.\nBut if the radioactive gas pressure\nis too high,\ncontainment fails and the gasses\nescape into the air,\nspreading as far \nand wide as the wind blows.\nThe radioactive fission products\nin these vapors\neventually decay into stable elements.\nWhile some decay in a few seconds,\nothers take hundreds \nof thousands of years.\nThe greatest challenge \nfor a nuclear reactor\nis to safely contain these products\nand keep them from harming humans\nor the environment.\nContainment doesn't stop mattering\nonce the fuel is used up.\nIn fact, it becomes an even greater\nstorage problem.\nEvery one to two years,\nsome spent fuel is removed from reactors\nand stored in pools of water \nthat cool the waste\nand block its radioactive emissions.\nThe irradiated fuel is a mix of uranium\nthat failed to fission,\nfission products,\nand plutonium, a radioactive material\nnot found in nature.\nThis mix must be isolated from\nthe environment\nuntil it has all safely decayed.\nMany countries propose deep time storage\nin tunnels drilled far underground,\nbut none have been built,\nand there's great uncertainty about\ntheir long-term security.\nHow can a nation that has existed\nfor only a few hundred years\nplan to guard plutonium\nthrough its radioactive half-life\nof 24,000 years?\nToday, many nuclear power plants\nsit on their waste, instead,\nstoring them indefinitely on site.\nApart from radioactivity, there's an\neven greater danger with spent fuel.\nPlutonium can sustain a chain reaction\nand can be mined from the waste\nto make bombs.\nStoring spent fuel is thus not only\na safety risk for the environment,\nbut also a security risk for nations.\nWho should be the watchmen to guard it?\nVisionary scientists from the early years\nof the nuclear age\npioneered how to reliably tap \nthe tremendous amount of energy\ninside an atom -\nas an explosive bomb\nand as a controlled power source\nwith incredible potential.\nBut their successors have learned\nhumbling insights\nabout the technology's not-so-utopian\nindustrial limits.\nMining the subatomic realm makes for\ncomplex, expensive, and risky engineering.\n",

    "source_material": "•\n0:02\nMan: This is an animal.\n0:04\nThis is also an animal.\n0:06\nAnimal.\n0:07\nAnimal.\n0:07\nAnimal carcass.\n0:08\nAnimal.\n0:09\nAnimal carcass again.\n0:10\nAnimal.\n0:11\nThe thing that all of these other things\n0:13\nhave in common is that they're made\n0:14\nout of the same basic building block, the animal cell.\n0:17\n(music)\n0:27\nAnimals are made up of your\n0:28\nrun-of-the-mill eukaryotic cells.\n0:30\nThese are called eukaryotic because they\n0:32\nhave a true kernel in the Greek, a good nucleus.\n0:36\nThat contains the DNA and calls the shots\n0:38\nfor the rest of the cell, also containing\n0:40\na bunch of organelles.\n0:41\nThere's a bunch of different kinds of organelles\n0:43\nand they all have very specific functions.\n0:45\nAll of this is surrounded by the cell membrane.\n0:48\nOf course, plants are eukaryotic cells too,\n0:50\nbut theirs are set up a little bit differently.\n0:51\nOf course, they have oranelles that allow them\n0:53\nto make their own food, which is super nice.\n0:55\nWe don't have those.\n0:56\nAlso, their cell membrane is actually a cell wall\n0:58\nthat's made of cellulose.\n0:59\nIt's rigid which is why plants can't dance.\n1:01\nIf you want to know all about plant cells,\n1:03\nwe did a whole video on it and you can click on it hit here,\n1:06\nif it's online yet; it might not be.\n1:08\nA lot of the stuff in this video is going to apply\n1:10\nto all eukaryotic cells, which includes\n1:12\nplants and fungi and protists.\n1:14\nRigid cell walls, that's cool and all,\n1:16\nbut one of the reasons that animals\n1:17\nhave been so successful is that their\n1:19\nflexible membrane, in addition to allowing\n1:21\nthem the ability to dance, gives animals\n1:23\nthe flexibility to create a bunch of different\n1:24\ncell types and organ types and tissue types\n1:27\nthat could never be possible in a plant.\n1:29\nCell walls that protect plants and give them structure\n1:31\nprevent them from evolving complicated nerve structures\n1:34\nand muscle cells that allow animals to be\n1:37\nsuch a powerful force for eating plants.\n1:40\nAnimals can move around, find shelter and food,\n1:42\nfind things to mate with, all that good stuff.\n1:44\nIn fact, the ability to move oneself around\n1:47\nusing specialized muscle tissue has been\n1:49\n100% trademarked by kindgom animalia.\n1:51\nVoiceover: What about protozoans?\n1:53\nMan: Excellent point.\n1:55\nWhat about protozoans?\n1:56\nThey don't have specialized muscle tissue.\n1:58\nThey move around with cilia and flagella and that kind of thing.\n2:01\nWay back in 1665, British scientist\n2:04\nRobert Hooke discovered cells with his\n2:06\nkind of crude beta version microscope.\n2:08\nHe called them cells because they looked like\n2:10\nbare, spartan Monk's bedrooms with\n2:13\nnot much going on inside.\n2:14\nHooke was a smart guy and everything,\n2:16\nbut he could not have been more wrong\n2:18\nabout what was going on inside of a cell.\n2:19\nThere is a whole lot going on inside of a eukaryotic cell.\n2:22\nIt's more like a city than a Monk's cell.\n2:24\nIn fact, let's go with that.\n2:25\nA cell is like a city.\n2:27\nIt has defined geographical limits,\n2:29\na ruling government, power plants, roads,\n2:31\nwaste treatment plants, a police force,\n2:32\nindustry, all the things a booming metropolis\n2:35\nneeds to run smoothly.\n2:36\nBut, this city does not have one of those\n2:38\nhippy governments where everybody votes on stuff\n2:40\nand talks things out at town hall meetings\n2:42\nand crap like that.\n2:42\nNope.\n2:43\nThink fascist Italy circa 1938.\n2:46\nThink Kim Jong-Il's, I mean Kim Jong-Un's\n2:48\nNorth Korea and you might be getting a closer\n2:50\nidea of how eukaryotic cells do their business.\n2:52\nLet's start out with city limits.\n2:53\nAs you approach the city of Eukaryopolis,\n2:56\nthere's a chance that you will notice something\n2:58\nthat a traditional city never has,\n3:00\nwhich is either cilia or flagella.\n3:01\nSome eukaryotic cells have either one or the other\n3:04\nof these structures; cilia being a bunch\n3:06\nof tiny little arms that wriggle around,\n3:07\nflagella being one long whip-like tail.\n3:10\nSome cells have neither.\n3:11\nSperm cells, for instance, have flagella\n3:13\nand our lungs and throat cells have cilia\n3:15\nthat push mucus up and out of our lungs.\n3:17\nCilia and flagella are made out of long\n3:19\nprotein fibers called microtubules,\n3:21\nand they both have the same basic structure;\n3:22\nnine pairs of microtubules forming a ring\n3:25\naround two central microtubles,\n3:26\nthis is often called the 9+2 structure.\n3:29\nAnyway, that's just so you know when you're\n3:31\napproaching the city, watch out\n3:32\nfor the cilia and flagella.\n3:34\nIf you make it past the cilia, you will encounter\n3:36\nwhat is called a cell membrane, which is\n3:38\na kind of squishy, not rigid plant cell wall,\n3:41\nwhich totally encloses the city and all of its contents.\n3:44\nIt's also in charge of monitoring\n3:46\nwhat comes in and out of the cell,\n3:47\nkind of like the fascist border police.\n3:49\nThe cell membrane has selective pemeability,\n3:51\nmeaning that it can choose what molecules\n3:53\ncome in and out of the cells, for the most part.\n3:56\nI did an entire video on this\n3:58\nwhich you can check out right here.\n4:01\nThe landscape of Eukaryopolis, important to note,\n4:03\nis kind of wet and squishy; it's a bit of a swampland.\n4:07\nEach eukaryotic cell is filled with a solution\n4:09\nof water and nutrients called cytoplasm.\n4:11\nInside of the cytoplasm is a scaffolding\n4:14\ncalled the cytoskeleton.\n4:15\nIt's basically just a bunch of protein strands\n4:17\nthat reinforce the cell.\n4:18\nCentrosomes are a special part of this reinforcement.\n4:21\nThey assemble long microtubules out of proteins\n4:23\nthat act like steel girders that hold\n4:25\nall the cities' building together.\n4:26\nThe cytoplasm provides the infrastructure\n4:28\nnecessary for all the organelles to do all of their\n4:31\nawesome amazing business, with the notable exception\n4:33\nof the nucleus, which has its own kind of cytoplasm\n4:36\ncalled the nucleoplasm, which is a more luxurious, premium\n4:40\nenvironment befitting the cell's beloved leader.\n4:43\nWe'll get to that in a minute.\n4:43\nFirst, let's talk about the cell's highway system.\n4:46\nThe endoplasmic reticulum, or just ER,\n4:48\nare organelles that create a network of membranes\n4:50\nthat carry stuff around the cell.\n4:52\nThese membranes are phospolipid bilayers\n4:53\nsame as in the cell membrane.\n4:54\nThere are two types of ER.\n4:56\nThere's the rough and the smooth;\n4:57\nfairly similar, but slightly different shapes,\n4:59\nslightly different functions.\n5:00\nThe rough ER looks all bumpy because it has\n5:02\nribosomes attached to it and the smooth ER\n5:04\ndoesn't, so it's a smooth network of tubes.\n5:06\nThe smooth ER acts as a kind of factory warehouse\n5:09\nin the cell city.\n5:10\nIt contains enzymes that help with the creation\n5:11\nof important lipids, which you'll recall\n5:13\nfrom our talk about biological molecules,\n5:15\nphospolipids and steroids that turn out to be sex hormones.\n5:19\nOther enzymes in the smooth ER specialize in detoxifying\n5:22\nsubstance like noxious stuff derived from drugs\n5:25\nand alcohol which they do by adding\n5:27\na carboxyl group to them, making them soluble in water.\n5:30\nFinally, the smooth ER also stores ions in solutions\n5:32\nthat the cell may need later on, especially\n5:34\nsodium ions which are used for energy in muscle cells.\n5:37\nThe smooth ER helps makes lipids while the rough ER\n5:40\nhelps in the synthesis and packaging of proteins.\n5:42\nThose proteins are created by another\n5:45\ntype of organelle, the ribosome.\n5:47\nRibosomes can float freely throughout the cytoplasm\n5:49\nor be attached to the nuclear envelope\n5:51\nwhich is where they're spat out from.\n5:53\nTheir job is to assemble amino acids into polypeptides.\n5:57\nAs the ribosome builds an amino acid chain,\n5:59\nthe chain is pushed into the ER.\n6:02\nWhen the protein chain is complete,\n6:03\nthe ER pinches it off and sends it to the golgi apparatus.\n6:07\nIn the city that is the cell, the golgi is the post office,\n6:10\nprocessing proteins and packaging them up\n6:13\nbefore sending them wherever they need to go.\n6:15\nCalling it an apparatus makes it sound like a bit\n6:17\nof complicated machinery, which it kind of is\n6:20\nbecause it's made up of these stacks\n6:22\nof membranous layers that are sometimes called golgi bodies.\n6:25\nThe golgi bodies can cut up large proteins\n6:28\ninto smaller hormones and can combine\n6:30\nproteins with carbohydrates to make various molecules,\n6:32\nlike, for instance, snot.\n6:34\nThe bodies package these little goodies\n6:36\ninto sacks called vassicles which have\n6:37\nphopholipid walls just like the main cell membrane,\n6:40\nthen ship them out either to other parts of the cell\n6:43\nor outside the cell wall.\n6:44\nWe learn more about how vessicles do this\n6:46\nin the next episode of Crash Course.\n6:49\nThe golgi bodies also put the finishing touches\n6:50\non the lysosomes.\n6:52\nLysosomes are basically the waste treatment plants\n6:54\nand recycling centers of the city.\n6:56\nThese organelles are basically sacks full of enzymes\n6:58\nthat break down cellular waste and debris\n7:01\nfrom outside of the cell and turn it into\n7:03\nsimple compounds which are transferred into\n7:05\nthe cytoplasm as new cell building materials.\n7:07\nNow, finally, let us talk about the nucleus,\n7:10\nthe beloved leader.\n7:11\nThe nucleus is a highly specialized organelle\n7:14\nthat lives in its own double-membraned,\n7:16\nhigh security compound with its buddy the nucleolus.\n7:19\nWithin the cell, the nucleus is in charge\n7:21\nin a major way, because it stores the cell's DNA.\n7:24\nIt has all the information the cell needs to do its job.\n7:27\nThe nucleus makes all the laws for the city\n7:30\nand orders all the other organelles around\n7:32\ntelling them how and when to grow,\n7:33\nwhat to metabolize,\n7:34\nwhat proteins to synthesize,\n7:36\nhow and when to divide.\n7:37\nThe nucleus does all this by using the information\n7:39\nblueprinted in its DNA to build proteins\n7:41\nthat will facilitate a specific job getting done.\n7:45\nFor instance, on January 1, 2012\n7:48\nlet's say a liver cell needs to help break down\n7:51\nan entire bottle of champagne.\n7:53\nThe nucleus in that liver cell would start\n7:55\ntelling the cell to make alcohol dehydrogenase,\n7:58\nwhich is the enzyme that makes alcohol not alcohol anymore.\n8:01\nThis protein synthesis business is complicated.\n8:04\nLucky for you we will have, or may already have,\n8:08\nan entire video about how it happens.\n8:10\nThe nucleus holds its precious DNA\n8:12\nalong some proteins in a web-like substance\n8:14\ncalled a chromatin.\n8:16\nWhen it comes time for the cell to split,\n8:18\nthe chromatin gathers into rod-shaped chromosomes,\n8:21\neach of which holds DNA molecules.\n8:23\nDifference species of animals\n8:25\nhave different numbers of chromosomes.\n8:26\nWe humans have 46.\n8:28\nFruitflies have eight.\n8:29\nHedgehogs, which are adorable, but less\n8:31\ncomplex than humans, have 90.\n8:33\nThe nucleolus, which lives inside of the nucleus,\n8:36\nis the only organelle not enveloped by its own membrane.\n8:39\nIt's just a gooey splotch of stuff within the nucleus.\n8:43\nIt's main job is creating ribosomal RNA, or rRNA,\n8:46\nwhich it then combines with some proteins\n8:48\nto form the basic units of ribosomes.\n8:50\nOnce these units are done, the nucleolus\n8:52\nspits them out of the nuclear envelope\n8:54\nwhere they are fully assembled into ribosomes.\n8:57\nThe nucleus then sends orders in the form\n8:59\nof messenger RNA, or mRNA, to those ribosomes,\n9:02\nwhich are the henchmen that carry out the orders\n9:05\nin the rest of the cell.\n9:06\nHow exactly the ribosomes do this\n9:08\nis immensely complex and awesome;\n9:11\nso awesome, in fact, that we're going to give it\n9:13\nthe full Crash Course treatment; an entire episode.\n9:16\nNow, for what is, totally, objectively speaking, of course,\n9:19\nthe coolest part of the animal cell,\n9:21\nits power plants, the mitochondria, the smooth\n9:25\noblong organelles where the amazing\n9:28\nand super important process of respiration takes place.\n9:31\nThis is where energy is derived from carbohydrates,\n9:34\nfats and other fuels and is converted into\n9:36\nadenosine triphosphate, or ATP, which is like\n9:39\nthe main currency that drives life in Eukaryopolis.\n9:42\nYou can learn more about ATP and respiration\n9:44\nin an episode that we did on that.\n9:46\nNow, of course, some cells like muscle cells\n9:48\nor neuron cells need a lot more power than\n9:50\nthe average cell in the body, so those cells\n9:52\nhave a lot more mitochondria per cell.\n9:55\nMaybe the coolest thing about mitochondria\n9:57\nis that long ago animal cells didn't have them.\n10:00\nThey existed as their own sort of bacterial cell.\n10:04\nOne day, one of these things ended up inside\n10:07\nof an animal cell, probably because the animal\n10:09\ncell was trying to eat it, but instead of eating it,\n10:11\nit realized that this thing was really super smart\n10:14\nand good at turning food into energy, and it just kept it.\n10:19\nIt stayed around.\n10:20\nTo this day they sort of act like their own\n10:21\nseparate organisms.\n10:23\nThey do their own thing within the cell.\n10:25\nThe replicate themselves.\n10:26\nThey even contain a small amount of DNA.\n10:28\nWhat may be even more awesome, if that's possible,\n10:30\nis that mitochondria are in the egg cell\n10:34\nwhen an egg gets fertilized.\n10:36\nThose mitochondria have DNA.\n10:37\nBecause mitochondria replicate themselves\n10:39\nin a separate fashion, it doesn't get mixed\n10:41\nwith the DNA of the father.\n10:42\nIt's just the mother's mitochondrial DNA.\n10:44\nThat means that your and my mitochondrial DNA\n10:46\nis exactly the same as the mitochondrial DNA of our mothers.\n10:50\nBecause this special DNA is isolated in this way,\n10:53\nscientists can actually track back and back and back\n10:55\nand back to a single mitochondrial Eve\n10:58\nwho lived about 200,000 years ago in Africa.\n11:01\nAll of that complication and mystery and beauty\n11:03\nin one of the cells of your body.\n11:07\nIt's complicated, yes, but worth understanding.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- What I want to do in this video is think about\n0:02\nthe different ways to represent a molecule.\n0:06\nSo the most obvious way is its name.\n0:10\nSo, for example, you could be referring to\n0:13\na molecule of benzene.\n0:16\nBenzene.\n0:17\nBut just the word \"benzene\" tells you very little\n0:20\nabout what actually makes up this molecule.\n0:22\nAnd there's other naming conventions that do\n0:24\ngive more information, but you might say,\n0:26\nwell, I actually want to know more about\n0:28\nthe actual particular elements that make it up.\n0:31\nWell, that might be, in that case,\n0:34\nit might be useful to move up to the empirical formula.\n0:37\nEmpirical, empirical.\n0:41\nEmpirical.\n0:44\nEmpirical formula.\n0:46\nAnd you might be thinking, what does\n0:48\nempirical mean?\n0:50\nIn general, the word \"empirical\" is referring to something\n0:53\nthat comes from observation or comes through experiments.\n0:57\nIf you could say hey, you know, I from empirical evidence\n1:01\nI now believe this, this means that you saw data.\n1:03\nThis means that you have some observations that\n1:06\nmake you think this new thing.\n1:08\nThe reason why we call what I'm about to write down\n1:10\nthe empirical formula, is because early chemists,\n1:14\nthey can't look, they weren't able to look at\n1:16\njust one molecule, but they could at least come up\n1:18\nwith, they could observe the ratios of the different\n1:22\nelements that they had in a molecule.\n1:25\nSo an empirical formula gives you a ratio\n1:27\nof the elements in the molecule.\n1:30\nSo an empirical formula for benzene is ...\n1:34\nIt is ...\n1:37\nOne carbon for\n1:39\nevery, for every hydrogen.\n1:43\nNow you might say, OK, that's nice,\n1:45\nI now know that if I'm dealing with benzene\n1:47\nI have one carbon for every hydrogen\n1:48\nor one hydrogen for every carbon,\n1:50\nbut what does, how many of each of these do you actually\n1:53\nhave in a benzene molecule?\n1:58\nTo answer that question, that's when you would want\n2:00\nto go to the molecular formula.\n2:03\nMolecular.\n2:05\nMolecular formula.\n2:09\nAnd the molecular formula for benzene, which is\n2:11\nnow going to give us more information than\n2:13\nthe empirical formula, tells us that each benzene\n2:16\nmolecule has six hydrogens, and,\n2:21\nsorry, six carbons and six,\n2:24\n(laughs) I'm really having trouble today,\n2:27\nsix hydrogens, (laughs) six carbons, and,\n2:31\nsix hydrogens.\n2:32\nNow, the ratio is still one to one, you get that\n2:34\nright over here, it's very easy to go from\n2:36\na molecular formula to an empirical formula.\n2:39\nYou essentially are losing information.\n2:41\nYou're just saying the ratio, OK, look,\n2:43\nit's a ratio of six to six,\n2:44\nwhich is the same thing as one to one.\n2:46\nIf we wanted to, we could write this as C one\n2:51\nH one just like that to show us that the ratio\n2:53\nfor every carbon we have a hydrogen.\n2:56\nAnd we see that that's actually the case in one molecule,\n2:58\nfor every six carbons you have six hydrogens,\n3:01\nwhich is still a one to one ratio.\n3:03\nThat may not satisfy you, you might say,\n3:05\nwell, OK, but how are these six carbons\n3:07\nand six hydrogens actually structured?\n3:10\nI want more information.\n3:12\nAnd for that, you would wanna go to\n3:15\na structural formula.\n3:17\nStructural formula,\n3:20\nwhich will actually give you the structure,\n3:23\nor start to give you the structure of a benzene molecule.\n3:26\nA benzene molecule would be drawn like...\n3:30\nSo you would have six carbons in a hexagon.\n3:33\nSo one, going to write this way, one, two,\n3:37\nthree, four, five, six\n3:42\ncarbons in a hexagon just like that.\n3:44\nAnd then you have a double bond, every other\n3:47\nof these bonds on the hexagon is a double bond.\n3:51\nEach of these carbons are also attached to a hydrogen,\n3:54\nalso bonded to a hydrogen.\n3:56\nEach of these lines that I'm drawing,\n3:58\nthis is a bond, it's a covalent bond,\n4:01\nwe go into much more depth in other videos on that,\n4:03\nbut it's a sharing of electrons, and that's what keeps\n4:05\nthese carbons near each other and what keeps\n4:07\nthe hydrogens kind of tied to each, or,\n4:09\nthe hydrogens tied to the carbons and the carbons\n4:11\ntied to the hydrogens.\n4:12\nSo let me draw it just like this.\n4:15\nAnd this is only one variant of a structural,\n4:19\nit's hard to see this one I just drew,\n4:22\nso let me see if I can do a little bit...\n4:24\nOh, that's about as good, hopefully you see there's\n4:26\na hydrogen there, and there's a hydrogen right over there.\n4:28\nThis is one variant of a structural formula,\n4:30\nsome structural formulas will actually give you\n4:32\nsome 3D information, will tell you whether a molecule\n4:35\nis kind of popping in or out of the page.\n4:37\nOthers might not be as explicit,\n4:40\nonce you go into organic chemistry\n4:43\nchains of carbons are just done, they're just ...\n4:47\nYou might see something like this for benzene,\n4:50\nwhere the carbons are implicit as the vertex of each,\n4:54\nthere's an implicit carbon at each of these vertices,\n4:57\nand then you say, OK, carbon's gotta have,\n4:59\nnot gotta, but it's typically going to have\n5:01\nfour bonds in its stable state, I only see one, two, three.\n5:05\nWell, if it's not drawn, then it must be a hydrogen.\n5:07\nThat's actually the convention that people\n5:09\nuse in organic chemistry.\n5:10\nSo there's multiple ways to do a structural formula,\n5:13\nbut this is a very typical one right over here.\n5:16\nAs you see, I'm just getting more and more\n5:18\nand more information as I go from empirical\n5:20\nto molecular to structural formula.\n5:23\nNow, I want to make clear, that empirical\n5:25\nformulas and molecular formulas aren't always different\n5:29\nif the ratios are actually, also show the\n5:33\nactual number of each of those elements\n5:36\nthat you have in a molecule.\n5:37\nA good example of that would be water.\n5:41\nLet me do water.\n5:43\nLet me do this in a different color that I,\n5:45\nwell, I've pretty much already used every color.\n5:48\nWater.\n5:50\nSo water we all know, for every two hydrogens,\n5:54\nfor every two hydrogens, and since I\n5:56\nalready decided to use blue for hydrogen let me\n5:58\nuse blue again for hydrogen,\n6:00\nfor every two hydrogens you have an oxygen.\n6:05\nYou have an oxygen.\n6:06\nIt just so happens to be, what I just wrote down\n6:09\nI kind of thought of in terms of empirical formula,\n6:11\nin terms of ratios, but that's actually the case.\n6:14\nA molecule of hydrogen, sorry, a molecule of water\n6:18\nhas exactly two hydrogens and,\n6:21\nand one oxygen.\n6:23\nIf you want to see the structural formula,\n6:25\nyou're probably familiar with it or you\n6:27\nmight be familiar with it.\n6:28\nEach of those oxygens in a water molecule\n6:33\nare bonded to two hydrogens,\n6:36\nare bonded to two hydrogens.\n6:38\nSo hopefully this at least begins to\n6:42\nappreciate different ways of referring to\n6:44\nor representing a molecule.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] I could imagine\n0:00\nthat even the earliest human beings,\n0:02\nor possibly pre-human beings\n0:04\nhad asked themselves the questions,\n0:06\n\"Why am I here? What is the nature of reality?\n0:10\n\"Why is the universe organized the way that it is?\"\n0:13\nAnd these questions are what we attempt to answer\n0:17\nin the field of physics...\n0:21\nIn the field of physics,\n0:22\nwhich you could view\n0:23\nmaybe right after mathematics\n0:24\nas the purest of the sciences.\n0:27\nSo you have math, which is very pure,\n0:30\nand then on that foundation of math\n0:33\nyou have physics.\n0:34\nAnd physics really does try to use that mathematics\n0:39\nalong with some core ideas\n0:41\nto explain the phenomena,\n0:43\nall the phenomena,\n0:44\nof the universe.\n0:45\nAnd physicists will the the first to admit\n0:47\nthat they are just beginning to understand\n0:49\nthe nature of reality,\n0:51\nthe nature of everything around us.\n0:53\nNow a lot of times, we think physics\n0:54\nis only limited to things like cosmological phenomena\n0:59\nor getting rockets into space,\n1:01\nor how waves move or building structures.\n1:04\nBut physics is the foundation for\n1:07\nall of the other sciences.\n1:09\nWhen we think about chemistry,\n1:10\nwhen we think about chemistry,\n1:12\nwhich is at the end of the day\n1:13\ninteractions between atoms,\n1:15\nthose interactions are really physics-based interactions.\n1:18\nSo chemistry, chemistry is actually laid down\n1:22\non a foundation of physics.\n1:25\nAnd then even when we think about ourselves,\n1:28\nour bodies, even our consciousness, our brains,\n1:30\nit really all boils down to chemistry and physics.\n1:35\nIt boils down to interactions between atoms\n1:37\nand even mechanical properties of our bodies.\n1:40\nAnd so even biology,\n1:43\neven what we are,\n1:45\nis built on a foundation of chemistry.\n1:49\nSo this is biology right over here,\n1:53\nwhich is built on a foundation of physics,\n1:54\nwhich is highly dependent on some of the math\n1:57\nthat you've been learning your whole life\n1:59\nand that you will continue to learn.\n2:00\nAnd that fundamental question that you might have said,\n2:03\n\"Well you know, hey, why am I learning this math?\"\n2:04\nWell one, 'cause the math is beautiful,\n2:06\nbut also you will see that it starts to,\n2:08\nin almost the most pure way,\n2:10\ndescribe the structure of the universe.\n2:13\nAnd we're going to see that more and more and more\n2:15\nas we go into physics.\n2:17\nAll of this complex phenomena\n2:19\nthat you see around us,\n2:20\nwhether we're looking at a galaxy\n2:21\nor we're looking at ocean waves,\n2:22\nor we're looking at even biological systems,\n2:25\nwe'll see that a shocking amount of them\n2:28\ncan start to be described using some fairly elegant\n2:31\nmathematics that we can build on\n2:33\nand continue to build on.\n2:34\nSimple or elegant mathematics\n2:36\nlike force is equal to mass times acceleration.\n2:40\nAnd we're gonna talk about force and acceleration\n2:43\nas vector quantities.\n2:45\nWe're gonna think about things like displacement,\n2:48\nand I'll put it as a vector quantity,\n2:50\nand we'll soon learn more about vector\n2:52\nand scalar quantities are.\n2:53\nDisplacement is equal to velocity times time.\n2:58\nWe'll learn things like accelaration\n3:00\nis equal to change in velocity over change in time.\n3:04\nWhat we'll see with even a handful\n3:06\nof very simple ideas like this.\n3:09\nWe'll go into much more depth in future videos.\n3:11\nYou can explain all sorts of complex phenomena.\n3:14\nAnd the one thing that I always loved about physics,\n3:16\nand I don't think it's always fully appreciated,\n3:18\nsometimes as you start to learn physics,\n3:20\nyou'll see all these complicated formula,\n3:21\nall of these kind of complicated problems,\n3:24\nbut it's super valuable to realize\n3:27\nit's all coming from some of these basic ideas.\n3:29\nSome of the things that I just mentioned,\n3:31\nthese ideas, we're gonna explore ideas of energy.\n3:34\nWe're going to explore Newton's laws.\n3:37\nWe're going to explain, we're gonna think about\n3:39\nwhat are the the different types of forces out there,\n3:41\nand why they might, why they might actually exist.\n3:44\nAt its essence, it's all about trying to\n3:48\nexplain the complexity of the universe,\n3:51\npredict what is going to happen\n3:52\nbased on simple ideas.\n3:55\nAnd that's what physics is all about.\n3:58\nNow when we think of physics,\n3:59\nit's been studied by humanity for a very, very long time.\n4:02\nIn fact, I'm sure we don't know\n4:04\nwho the first physicists were.\n4:07\nBut some of the,\n4:08\nI guess you could say foundational thinkers\n4:11\nin physics are these gentlemen that I have here.\n4:14\nAnd this is just a...\n4:15\nYou could kind of say\n4:16\nthis is some of the most prominent thinkers in physics,\n4:19\nbut this is by no means a complete list.\n4:21\nFirst and foremost, we'd wanna include Isaac Newton.\n4:25\nEspecially when you start to study physics,\n4:27\nyou're starting to understand the world\n4:30\nas Newton understood it.\n4:31\nHe understood, \"Hey, you know,\n4:32\n\"things don't fall to the ground\n4:34\n\"just 'cause they always fall to,\n4:35\n\"just 'cause that's the way the universe is.\n4:37\n\"That's a force that's acting on it,\n4:39\n\"and maybe that same force that's causing me\n4:41\n\"to be stuck to my chair right now\n4:44\n\"is what keeps Earth orbiting around the Sun\n4:46\n\"or the moon orbiting around the Earth.\"\n4:50\nHe developed Law of Gravitation,\n4:53\nNewton's Laws, and we're going to study that\n4:54\nas we delve into our basic physics.\n4:57\nAnd what we'll see,\n4:58\neven classical mechanics,\n5:00\nthe physics that Newton established,\n5:03\ncan explain a large range of phenomena\n5:05\nwith amazing precision.\n5:07\nBut as we get into the early 20th century,\n5:10\nphysics starts to get even more wild\n5:12\nas we start to look at the scales\n5:14\nof the super small,\n5:15\nand we have Max Planck giving us quantum mechanics,\n5:18\nand then we have Albert Einstein\n5:20\nas we start thinking about super fast speeds,\n5:23\nthe speed of light, and we realize that's an absolute.\n5:26\nThat nothing can travel faster than the speed of light,\n5:29\nwhich is this mind-boggling thing\n5:31\nthat we have these notions\n5:33\nof general and special relativity,\n5:35\nand we start realizing that the universe\n5:37\nis in some ways more bizarre, and more mysterious,\n5:40\nand more fascinating than we ever could have imagined.\n5:43\nBut all of the work, even to understand the modern physics\n5:46\nof Max Planck and Albert Einstein,\n5:49\nit's based on a lot of the core ideas\n5:52\nthat were given to us by Isaac Newton,\n5:54\neven people before Isaac Newton.\n5:56\nSo as you go into your study of physics,\n5:58\nand I'm kind of a physicist wannabe.\n6:01\nI wanted to be a physicist.\n6:03\nI imagined kind of,\n6:04\n'cause it's all about, we all wonder,\n6:06\nwhy are we here?\n6:07\nWhat is the nature of reality?\n6:09\nWhy do things happen the way they are?\n6:12\nAnd these are the questions that physics\n6:14\nis attempting to answer.\n6:16\nAnd so as you go into your study of physics,\n6:19\nI wanna leave you with some quotes\n6:21\nfrom these three gentlemen.\n6:22\nSo the first two are from Isaac Newton.\n6:25\n\"Truth is ever to be found in simplicity,\n6:29\n\"and not in the multiplicity and the confusion of things.\"\n6:32\nAnd I really wanted to stress this,\n6:34\nbecause a lot of times in your studies,\n6:35\nyou might be finding yourself memorizing formulas\n6:37\nand vocabulary, but that's,\n6:41\nif you're doing that, you're just at the very surface.\n6:43\nBut if you really start to think about it,\n6:45\nreally start to think about where these things come from,\n6:48\nit'll come to simpler and simpler and more intuitive ideas.\n6:51\nAnd then, you are getting closer to the truth.\n6:54\nNow, I love this second quote from Isaac Newton.\n6:57\n\"I do not know what I may appear to...\n7:00\n\"I do not know what I may appear to the world,\n7:03\n\"but to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy\n7:07\n\"playing on the seashore,\n7:08\n\"and diverting myself in now and then\n7:11\n\"finding a smoother pebble\n7:12\n\"or prettier shell than ordinary,\n7:14\n\"whilst the great ocean of truth\n7:17\n\"lay all undiscovered before me.\"\n7:20\nI like to imagine there's so much,\n7:22\nwe, even though we think we know so much,\n7:24\nthat we haven't even learned a small fraction\n7:27\nof how the universe really is.\n7:29\nAnd even a great thinker like Isaac Newton,\n7:31\nhe recognized this.\n7:32\nHe's like, \"Hey, I'm just kind of dabbling\n7:34\n\"into the seashore and picking up a pebble there,\n7:36\n\"but there's this vast ocean\n7:37\n\"that I can't even begin to understand.\"\n7:39\nYou can even imagine alien civilizations\n7:41\nthat are thousands of years ahead of us\n7:43\ntechnologically or scientifically\n7:45\nor even millions of years,\n7:47\nhow they might perceive the reality,\n7:49\nand they might see us as ants\n7:50\nin that we are just beginning\n7:51\nto scrape the surface of how the world works.\n7:55\nThis is from Max Planck.\n7:56\n\"When you change the way you look at things,\n7:59\n\"the things you look at change.\"\n8:01\nAnd I find this to be pretty profound,\n8:03\nbecause it is true.\n8:04\nAs you study physics,\n8:05\nyou will start to see, whoa,\n8:06\nmost of what we consider to be reality,\n8:08\nour current understanding is based\n8:09\non these forces, but what are these forces?\n8:11\nAnd even these things that we think are solid,\n8:14\nwhen we go down to the atomic level,\n8:15\nwe see it's mostly empty space\n8:17\nand it's really just the interaction of forces\n8:18\nthat make us think that something\n8:20\nis solid or there or tangible is some way.\n8:23\nAnd you realize these very tangible things\n8:24\naren't so tangible after all.\n8:27\nAt the end of the day, the whole world\n8:28\nis just a mental model that we have.\n8:31\nIn some ways,\n8:32\nit's an illusion\n8:34\nthat our mind creates so that we can operate inside of it.\n8:37\nBut we're just beginning to understand it.\n8:40\nAnd last but not least,\n8:42\nand there's actually a ton of great quotes\n8:43\nfrom these folks and others,\n8:44\nbut especially Albert Einstein.\n8:46\n\"The most beautiful experience\n8:48\n\"we can have is the mysterious.\n8:50\n\"It is the fundamental emotion that stands\n8:53\n\"at the cradle of true art and true science.\"\n8:56\nAnd I really want you to take this to heart\n8:58\nas you study your physics.\n9:00\nThere will be times where we're going\n9:02\nto be building our tool kits.\n9:03\nWhat's a vector?\n9:04\nWhat's a scalar?\n9:04\nGoing into some mathematics,\n9:06\nproving some formulas.\n9:07\nThose are the tool kits,\n9:09\nbut then we're gonna try to understand\n9:10\nfundamental phenomena.\n9:12\nHow does the universe actually work?\n9:14\nAnd if when we start to think about these,\n9:16\nyou don't get a few chills on your skin,\n9:18\na few goosebumps, and feel that the universe\n9:21\nis more mysterious than you thought,\n9:23\nthen we're not studying physics\n9:25\nthe say that we should be studying physics.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn this video, I want to cover several topics\n0:02\nthat are all related.\n0:03\nAnd on some level, they're really simple, but on a whole\n0:05\nother level, they tend to confuse people a lot.\n0:07\nSo hopefully we can make some headway.\n0:10\nSo a good place to start-- let's just imagine that I have\n0:12\nsome type of container here.\n0:15\nLet's say that's my container and inside of that container,\n0:18\nI have a bunch of water molecules.\n0:21\nIt's just got a bunch of water molecules.\n0:24\nThey're all rubbing against each other.\n0:25\nIt's in its liquid form, this is liquid water.\n0:27\nand inside of the water molecules, I\n0:30\nhave some sugar molecules.\n0:33\nMaybe I'll do sugar in this pink color.\n0:35\nSo I have a bunch of sugar molecules right here.\n0:40\nI have many, many more water molecules though.\n0:43\nI want to make that clear.\n0:49\nNow in this type of situation, we call the thing that there's\n0:55\nmore of, the solvent.\n1:00\nSo in this case, there's more water molecules and you can\n1:03\nliterally just view more as the number of molecules.\n1:07\nI'm not going to go into a whole discussion of moles and\n1:10\nall of that because you may or may not have been exposed to\n1:13\nthat yet, but just imagine whatever there's more of,\n1:15\nthat's what we're going to call the solvent.\n1:17\nSo in this case, water is the solvent.\n1:24\nAnd whatever there is less of-- in this case, that is the\n1:30\nsugar-- that is considered the solute.\n1:36\nIt doesn't have to be sugar.\n1:37\nIt can be any molecule that there's less of, in the water,\n1:40\nin this case.\n1:45\nAnd we say that the sugar has been dissolved into the water.\n2:03\nAnd this whole thing right here, the combination of the\n2:06\nwater and the sugar molecules, we call a solution.\n2:10\nWe call this whole thing a solution.\n2:14\nAnd a solution has the solvent and the solute.\n2:16\nThe solvent is water.\n2:18\nThat's the thing doing the dissolving and the thing that\n2:21\nis dissolved is the sugar.\n2:23\nThat's the solute.\n2:24\nNow all of this may or may not be review for you, but I'm\n2:27\ndoing it for a reason-- because I want to talk about\n2:32\nthe idea of a diffusion.\n2:39\nAnd the idea is actually pretty straightforward.\n2:43\nIf I have, let's say, the same container.\n2:46\nLet me do it in a slightly different container here, just\n2:49\nto talk about diffusion.\n2:50\nWe'll go back to water and sugar--\n2:52\nespecially back to water.\n2:54\nLet's say we have a container here and let's say it just has\n2:58\na bunch of-- let's say it just has some air particles in it.\n3:00\nIt could be anything-- oxygen or carbon dioxide.\n3:03\nSo let me just draw a couple of air molecules here.\n3:07\nSo let's say that that is a gaseous-- just for the sake of\n3:11\nargument-- gaseous oxygen.\n3:12\nSo each of this is an O2-- each of those, right?\n3:14\nAnd let's say that this is the current configuration, that\n3:16\nall of this is a vacuum here and that there's some\n3:19\ntemperatures.\n3:20\nSo these water molecules, they have some\n3:22\ntype of kinetic energy.\n3:25\nThey're moving in some type of random directions right there.\n3:29\nSo my question is, what is going to happen in this type\n3:34\nof container?\n3:35\nWell, any of these guys are going to be randomly bumping\n3:38\ninto each other.\n3:39\nThey're more likely to bump into things in this down-left\n3:43\ndirection than they are in the up-right direction.\n3:45\nSo if this guy was happening to go in this down-left\n3:47\ndirection, he's going to bump into something and then\n3:50\nricochet into the up-right direction.\n3:52\nBut in the up-right direction, there's\n3:53\nnothing to bounce into.\n3:55\nSo in general, everything is moving in random directions,\n3:57\nbut you're more likely to be able to move in\n4:00\nthe rightward direction.\n4:01\nWhen you go to the left, you're more likely to bump\n4:02\ninto something.\n4:04\nSo it's almost common sense.\n4:06\nOver time, if you just let this system come to some type\n4:09\nof equilibrium-- I'm not going to go into detail\n4:11\non what that means.\n4:12\nYou can watch the thermodynamics videos if you'd\n4:14\nlike to see that.\n4:15\nYou'll eventually see the container will look\n4:18\nsomething like this.\n4:19\nI can't guarantee it.\n4:20\nThere's some probability it would actually stay like this,\n4:22\nbut very likely that those five particles are going to\n4:25\nget relatively spread out.\n4:27\nThis is diffusion and so it's really just the spreading of\n4:32\nparticles or molecules from high concentration to low\n4:36\nconcentration areas, right?\n4:39\nIn this case, the molecules are going to spread in that\n4:41\ndirection from a high concentration to a low\n4:43\nconcentration area.\n4:45\nNow you're saying, Sal, what is concentration?\n4:47\nAnd there's many ways to measure concentration and you\n4:51\ncan go into molarity and molality and all of that.\n4:54\nBut the very simple idea is, how much of that particle do\n4:57\nyou have per unit space?\n4:59\nSo here, you have a lot of those particles per unit space\n5:02\nand here you have very few of those\n5:04\nparticles per unit space.\n5:05\nSo this is a high concentration and that's a low\n5:09\nconcentration.\n5:09\nSo you could imagine other experiments like this.\n5:12\nYou could imagine a solution like-- let's do\n5:17\nsomething like this.\n5:21\nLet's say I have two containers.\n5:25\nLet's go back to the solution situation.\n5:27\nThis was a gas, but I started off with that example so let's\n5:29\nstay with that example.\n5:31\nSo let's say that I have a door right there that's larger\n5:35\nthan either the water or the sugar molecules.\n5:38\nOn either side, I have a bunch of water molecules.\n5:52\nSo I have a lot of water molecules.\n5:53\nSo if I just had water molecules here-- they're all\n5:55\nbouncing around in random directions-- and so the odds\n5:58\nof a water molecule going this way, equivalent to odds of a\n6:01\nwater molecule going that way, assuming that both sides have\n6:04\nthe same level of water molecule, otherwise the\n6:06\npressures would be different.\n6:07\nBut let's say that the top of this is the same\n6:10\nas the top of this.\n6:11\nSo there's no more pressure going in one\n6:12\ndirection or another.\n6:13\nSo if for whatever reason, a bunch more water molecules\n6:17\nwere going in the rightward direction, then all of a\n6:18\nsudden this would fill up with more water and we know that\n6:20\nthat isn't likely to occur.\n6:22\nSo this is just two containers of water.\n6:28\nNow let's put some solute in it.\n6:30\nLet's dissolve some solute in it and let's say we do all the\n6:33\ndissolving on the left-hand side.\n6:35\nSo we put some sugar molecules on the left-hand side.\n6:40\nAnd these are small enough to fit through this little pipe.\n6:42\nThat's one assumption that I'm making.\n6:44\nSo what's going to happen?\n6:45\nAll of these things have some type of kinetic energy.\n6:47\nThey're all bouncing around.\n6:52\nWell, over time, the water's going back and forth.\n6:56\nThis water molecule might go that way.\n6:57\nThat water molecule might go that way, but they net each\n7:00\nother out, but over time one of these big sugar molecules\n7:03\nwill be going in just the right direction to go\n7:06\nthrough-- maybe this guy's, instead of going that\n7:08\ndirection, he starts off going in that direction.\n7:10\nHe goes just through this tunnel connecting the two\n7:15\ncontainers and he'll end up there, right?\n7:18\nAnd this guy will still be bouncing around.\n7:20\nThere's some probability he goes back, but there's still\n7:23\nmore sugar particles here than there.\n7:25\nSo there's still more probability that one of these\n7:31\nguys will go to that side than one of these guys\n7:33\nwill go to that side.\n7:34\nSo you can imagine if you're doing this with gazillions of\n7:36\nparticles-- I'm only doing it with four-- over time, the\n7:40\nparticles will have spread out so that their concentrations\n7:43\nare roughly equal.\n7:44\nSo that maybe you'll have two here over time.\n7:46\nBut when you're only dealing with three or four or five\n7:49\nparticles, there's some probability it doesn't happen,\n7:51\nbut when you're doing it with a gazillion and they're super\n7:53\nsmall, it's a very, very, very high likelihood.\n7:56\nBut anyway, this whole process-- we went from a\n7:59\ncontainer of high concentration to a container\n8:02\nof low concentration and the particles would have spread\n8:06\nfrom the low concentration container to the high\n8:08\nconcentration container.\n8:09\nSo they diffused.\n8:11\nThis is diffusion.\n8:16\nAnd just so that we learn some other words that tend to be\n8:18\nused with the idea of diffusion-- when we started\n8:21\noff, this had a higher concentration.\n8:24\nThe left-hand side container had higher concentration.\n8:33\nIt's all relative, right?\n8:34\nIt's higher than this guy.\n8:37\nAnd this right here had a lower concentration.\n8:42\nAnd there are words for these things.\n8:44\nThis solution with a high concentration is called a\n8:47\nhypertonic solution.\n8:50\nLet me write that in yellow.\n8:58\nHyper, in general, meaning having a lot of something,\n9:01\nhaving too much of something.\n9:02\nAnd this lower concentration is hypotonic.\n9:13\nYou might have heard maybe one of your relatives, if they\n9:16\nhaven't had a meal in awhile say, I'm hypoglycemic.\n9:20\nThat means that they have not-- they're feeling\n9:22\nlightheaded.\n9:22\nThere's not enough sugar in their bloodstream and they\n9:24\nwant to pass out so they want a meal.\n9:26\nIf you just had a candy bar, maybe you're hyperglycemic--\n9:29\nor maybe you're just hyper in general.\n9:32\nSo these are just good prefixes to know, but\n9:35\nhypertonic-- you have a lot of the solute.\n9:38\nYou have a high concentration.\n9:40\nAnd then in hypotonic, not too much of the solute so you have\n9:44\na low concentration.\n9:46\nThese are good words to know.\n9:47\nSo in general, diffusion-- if there's no barriers to the\n9:51\ndiffusion like we had here, you will have the solute go\n9:54\nfrom a high concentration or hypertonic solution if they\n9:58\ncan travel to a hypotonic solution, to a hypo, where the\n10:03\nconcentration is lower.\n10:05\nNow let's do an interesting experiment here.\n10:08\nWe've talked about diffusion and so far we've been talking\n10:10\nabout the diffusion of the solute, right?\n10:14\nAnd in general-- and this is not always the case-- if you\n10:17\nwant to be as general as possible, the solute is\n10:19\nwhatever you have less of, the solvent is whatever\n10:22\nyou have more of.\n10:23\nAnd the most common solvent tends to be water, but it\n10:26\ndoesn't have to be water.\n10:27\nIt could be some type of alcohol.\n10:28\nIt could be mercury.\n10:31\nIt could be a whole set of molecules, but water in most\n10:34\nbiological or chemical systems tends to be the\n10:38\nmost typical solvent.\n10:39\nIt's what other things are dissolved into.\n10:41\nBut what happens if we have a tunnel where the solute is too\n10:46\nbig to travel, but water is small enough to travel?\n10:51\nLet's think about that situation.\n10:55\nIn order to think about it, I'm going to do something\n10:57\ninteresting.\n10:58\nLet's say we have a container here.\n11:02\nActually, I won't even draw a container.\n11:03\nLet's just say we have an outside environment that has a\n11:07\nbunch of water.\n11:09\nThis is the outside environment and then you have\n11:12\nsome type of membrane.\n11:19\nWater can go in and out of this membrane.\n11:22\nSo it's semi-permeable.\n11:23\nWell, it's permeable to water, but the solute cannot go\n11:26\nthrough the membrane.\n11:27\nSo let's say that the solute is sugar.\n11:28\nSo we have water on the outside and\n11:33\nalso inside the membrane.\n11:36\nSo these are little small water molecules.\n11:39\nThis is a membrane right here.\n11:43\nAnd let's say that we have some sugar molecules again--\n11:46\nI'm just picking on sugar.\n11:47\nIt could have been anything.\n11:48\nSo we have some sugar molecules here that are just a\n11:51\nlittle bit bigger-- or they could be a lot bigger.\n11:55\nActually, they're a lot bigger than water molecules.\n11:57\nYou have a bunch of-- and I only draw four, but you have a\n11:59\ngazillion of them, right?\n12:01\nYou have that much more water molecules.\n12:03\nI'm just trying to show you have more water molecules than\n12:05\nsugar molecules.\n12:06\nAnd this membrane is semi-permeable.\n12:13\nPermeable means it allows things to pass.\n12:15\nSemi-permeables means it's not completely permeable.\n12:18\nSo semi-permeable-- in this context, I'm saying I allow\n12:20\nwater to pass through the membrane.\n12:22\nSo water can pass, but sugar cannot.\n12:28\nSugar is too large.\n12:35\nSo if we were to zoom in on the actual membrane itself--\n12:39\nmaybe the membrane looks like this.\n12:40\nI'm going to zoom in on this membrane.\n12:44\nSo it has little holes in the membrane, just like that.\n12:48\nAnd maybe the water molecules are about that size.\n12:51\nSo they can go through those holes.\n12:53\nSo the water molecules can go back and forth through the\n12:56\nholes, but the sugar molecules are about that big.\n13:01\nSo they cannot go through that hole.\n13:04\nThey're too big for this opening right here to go back\n13:07\nand forth between them.\n13:08\nNow what do you think is going to happen in this situation?\n13:12\nSo first of all, let's use our terminology.\n13:14\nRemember, sugar is our solute.\n13:15\nWater is our solvent.\n13:17\nSemi-permeable membrane.\n13:18\nWhich side of the membrane has a higher or lower\n13:21\nconcentration of solute?\n13:24\nWell, the inside does.\n13:25\nThe inside is hypertonic.\n13:32\nThe outside has a lower\n13:33\nconcentration so it's hypotonic.\n13:44\nNow, if these openings were big enough, based on what we\n13:47\njust talked about-- these guys are bouncing around, water is\n13:51\ntravelling in either direction, and equal\n13:53\nprobability or-- actually I'm going to talk\n13:56\nabout that in a second.\n13:58\nIf everything was wide open, it would be equal probability,\n14:01\nbut if it was wide open, these guys eventually would bounce\n14:03\ntheir ways over to this side and you'd probably end up with\n14:06\nequal concentrations eventually.\n14:08\nAnd so you would have your traditional diffusion, where\n14:10\nhigh concentration of solute to low\n14:13\nconcentrations of solute.\n14:14\nBut in this case, these guys-- they can't\n14:17\nfit through the hole.\n14:18\nOnly water can go back and forth.\n14:20\nIf these guys were not here, water would have an equal\n14:25\nlikelihood of going in this direction as they would be\n14:28\ngoing in that direction, a completely equal likelihood.\n14:33\nBut because these guys are on the right-hand side of-- or in\n14:40\nthis case, on the inside of our membrane.\n14:42\nThis is our inside of our membrane zoomed up-- it's less\n14:47\nlikely because these guys might be in the approach\n14:50\nposition of the holes-- that's slightly less likely for water\n14:55\nto be in the approach position for the holes so it's actually\n14:58\nmore probable that water could enter than water exit.\n15:02\nAnd I want to make that very clear.\n15:04\nIf these sugar molecules were not here, obviously it's\n15:07\nequally likely for water to go in either direction.\n15:09\nNow that these sugar molecules are there, these sugar\n15:12\nmolecules might be on the right-hand side.\n15:15\nThey might be blocking-- I guess the best way to think\n15:18\nabout it is blocking the approach to the hole.\n15:20\nThey'll never be able to go through the hole themselves\n15:22\nand might not even be blocking the hole, but they're going in\n15:24\nsome random direction.\n15:25\nSo if a water molecule was approaching-- it's all\n15:29\nprobabilistic and we're dealing with gazillions of\n15:31\nmolecules-- it's that much more likely to be blocked to\n15:34\nget outside.\n15:35\nBut the water molecules from the outside-- there's nothing\n15:37\nblocking them to get in so you're going to have a flow of\n15:40\nwater inside.\n15:41\nSo in this situation, with a semi-permeable membrane,\n15:44\nyou're going to have water.\n15:45\nYou're going to have a net inward flow of water.\n15:49\nAnd so this is kind of interesting.\n15:51\nWe have the solvent flowing from a hypotonic situation to\n15:56\na hypertonic solution, but it's only\n15:59\nhypotonic in the solute.\n16:07\nBut water-- if you flip it the other way-- if you've used\n16:11\nsugar as the solvent, then you could say, we're going from a\n16:15\nhigh concentration of water to a low concentration of water.\n16:19\nI don't want to confuse you too much.\n16:20\nThis is what tends to confuse people, but just think about\n16:23\nwhat's going to happen.\n16:24\nNo matter in what situation, the solution is going to do\n16:27\nwhat it can to try to equilibriate the\n16:30\nconcentration.\n16:30\nTo make the concentrations on both\n16:32\nsides as close as possible.\n16:33\nAnd it's not just some magic.\n16:35\nIt's not like the solution knows.\n16:36\nIt's all based on probabilities and these things\n16:38\nbumping around, but in this situation, water is more\n16:41\nlikely to flow into the container.\n16:43\nSo it's actually going to go from the hypotonic side when\n16:46\nwe talk about low concentration of solute to the\n16:50\nside that has high concentrations of solute, of\n16:53\nsugar-- and actually, if this thing is stretchable, more\n16:57\nwater will keep flowing in and this membrane\n17:01\nwill stretch out.\n17:04\nI won't go to too much detail here, but this idea of water--\n17:08\nof the solvent-- if in this case, water is the solvent--\n17:12\nof water as a solvent diffusing through a\n17:15\nsemi-permeable membrane, this is called osmosis.\n17:22\nYou've probably heard learning by osmosis-- if you put a book\n17:25\nagainst your head, maybe it'll just seep into your brain.\n17:27\nSame idea.\n17:28\nThat's where the word comes from.\n17:29\nThis idea of water seeping through membranes to try to\n17:33\nmake concentrations more equal.\n17:35\nSo if you say, well, I have high concentration here, low\n17:38\nconcentration here.\n17:39\nIf there was no membrane here, these big molecules would\n17:43\nexit, but because there's this semi-permeable membrane here,\n17:48\nthey can't.\n17:48\nSo the system just probabilistically-- no magic\n17:52\nhere-- more water will enter to try to equilibriate\n17:56\nconcentration.\n17:57\nEventually-- if maybe there's a few molecules out here-- not\n18:01\nas high concentration here-- eventually if everything was\n18:06\nallowed to happen fully, you'll get to the point where\n18:08\nyou have just as many-- you have just as high\n18:11\nconcentration on this side as you have on the right-hand\n18:13\nside because this right-hand side is going to fill with\n18:16\nwater and also probably become a larger volume.\n18:19\nAnd then, once again, the probabilities of a water\n18:21\nmolecule going to the right and to the left will be the\n18:23\nsame and you'll get to some type of equilibrium.\n18:25\nBut I want to make it very clear-- diffusion is the idea\n18:29\nof any particle going from higher concentration and\n18:33\nspreading into a region that has a lower concentration and\n18:35\njust spreading out.\n18:36\nOsmosis is the diffusion of water.\n18:41\nAnd usually you're talking about the diffusion of water\n18:44\nas a solvent and usually it's in the context of a\n18:47\nsemi-permeable membrane, where the actual solute cannot\n18:51\ntravel through the membrane.\n18:53\nAnyway, hopefully you've found that useful and\n18:55\nnot completely confusing.",

    "source_material": "Cloudy climate change:\nHow clouds affect Earth's temperature.\nEarth's average surface temperature\nhas warmed by .8 Celsius since 1750.\nWhen carbon dioxide concentrations\nin the atmosphere have doubled,\nwhich is expected before the end\nof the 21st century,\nresearchers project global temperatures\nwill have risen by \n1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius.\nIf the increase is near the low end,\n1.5 Celsius,\nthen we're already halfway there,\nand we should be more able to adapt\nwith some regions becoming drier\nand less productive,\nbut others becoming warmer,\nwetter and more productive.\nOn the other hand, a rise of 4.5 degrees\nCelsius would be similar in magnitude\nto the warming that's occurred since\nthe last glacial maximum 22,000 years ago,\nwhen most of North America was under\nan ice sheet two kilometers thick.\nSo that would represent a \ndramatic change of climate.\nSo it's vitally important for scientists\nto predict the change in temperature\nwith as much precision as possible\nso that society can plan for the future.\nThe present range of uncertainty\nis simply too large\nto be confident of how best\nto respond to climate change.\nBut this estimate of 1.5 to 4.5 Celsius\nfor a doubling of carbon dioxide\nhasn't changed in 35 years.\nWhy haven't we been able \nto narrow it down?\nThe answer is that we don't yet understand\naerosols and clouds well enough.\nBut a new experiment at CERN\nis tackling the problem.\nIn order to predict how\nthe temperature will change,\nscientists need to know something\ncalled Earth's climate sensitivity,\nthe temperature change in response\nto a radiative forcing.\nA radiative forcing is \na temporary imbalance\nbetween the energy received from the Sun\nand the energy radiated back out to space,\nlike the imbalance caused by an\nincrease of greenhouse gases.\nTo correct the imbalance,\nEarth warms up or cools down.\nWe can determine Earth's\nclimate sensitivity\nfrom the experiment that we've already\nperformed in the industrial age \nsince 1750\nand then use this number to determine\nhow much more it will warm\nfor various projected radiative forcings\nin the 21st century.\nTo do this, we need to know\ntwo things:\nFirst, the global temperature rise\nsince 1750,\nand second, the radiative forcing\nof the present day climate\nrelative to the pre-industrial climate.\nFor the radiative forcings,\nwe know that human activities\nhave increased greenhouse gases\nin the atmosphere,\nwhich have warmed the planet.\nBut our activities have at the same time\nincreased the amount\nof aerosol particles in clouds,\nwhich have cooled the planet.\nPre-industrial greenhouse gas\nconcentrations are well measured\nfrom bubbles trapped in ice cores\nobtained in Greenland and Antarctica.\nSo the greenhouse gas forcings\nare precisely known.\nBut we have no way of directly measuring\nhow cloudy it was in 1750.\nAnd that's the main source of uncertainty\nin Earth's climate sensitivity.\nTo understand pre-industrial cloudiness,\nwe must use computer models\nthat reliably simulate\nthe processes responsible for \nforming aerosols in clouds.\nNow to most people, aerosols are the thing\nthat make your hair stick,\nbut that's only one type of aerosol.\nAtmospheric aerosols are tiny liquid\nor solid particles suspended in the air.\nThey are either primary,\nfrom dust, sea spray salt\nor burning biomass,\nor secondary, formed by gas to\nparticle conversion in the atmosphere,\nalso known as particle nucleation.\nAerosols are everywhere in the atmosphere,\nand they can block out the sun\nin polluted urban environments,\nor bathe distant mountains in a blue haze.\nMore importantly, a cloud droplet cannot\nform without an aerosol particle seed.\nSo without aerosol particles,\nthere'd be no clouds,\nand without clouds,\nthere'd be no fresh water.\nThe climate would be much hotter,\nand there would be no life.\nSo we owe our existence\nto aerosol particles.\nHowever, despite their importance,\nhow aerosol particles form\nin the atmosphere\nand their effect on clouds \nare poorly understood.\nEven the vapors responsible\nfor aerosol particle formation\nare not well established\nbecause they're present in only\nminute amounts,\nnear one molecule per million million\nmolecules of air.\nThis lack of understanding\nis the main reason\nfor the large uncertainty \nin climate sensitivity,\nand the corresponding wide range\nof future climate projections.\nHowever, an experiment underway at CERN,\nnamed, perhaps unsurprisingly, \"Cloud\"\nhas managed to build a steel vessel\nthat's large enough\nand has a low enough contamination,\nthat aerosol formation can,\nfor the first time, be measured under\ntightly controlled atmospheric conditions\nin the laboratory.\nIn its first five years of operation,\nCloud has identified the vapors\nresponsible for aerosol particle\nformation in the atmosphere,\nwhich include sulfuric acid,\nammonia, amines,\nand biogenic vapors from trees.\nUsing an ionizing particle beam\nfrom the CERN proton synchrotron,\nCloud is also investigating\nif galactic cosmic rays\nenhance the formation of \naerosols in clouds.\nThis has been suggested as a possible\nunaccounted natural climate forcing agent\nsince the flux of cosmic rays raining\ndown on the atmosphere\nvaries with solar activity.\nSo Cloud is addressing two big questions:\nFirstly, how cloudy was the \npre-industrial climate?\nAnd, hence, how much have\nclouds changed due to human activities?\nThat knowledge will help sharpen\nclimate projections in the 21st century.\nAnd secondly, could the puzzling\nobservations of solar climate variability\nin the pre-industrial climate be explained\nby an influence\nof galactic cosmic rays on clouds?\nAmbitious but realistic goals\nwhen your head's in the clouds.\n",

code\n0:57\nthat has future benefit.\n0:58\nSo this is going to be the investment category.\n1:02\nLet me do it in that same color.\n1:04\nSo I, investment, is going to get plus $100,000.\n1:11\nIn general, the spending by firms goes into investment.\n1:15\nNow, let's look at the second scenario.\n1:17\nAccenture, which is another firm, and this\n1:19\nis a for-profit firm, earns $10 million-- or maybe I should say\n1:23\ngets $10 million in revenue, just\n1:28\nto be clear what we're talking about-- by building\n1:33\na new IT system for California.\n1:35\nAnd the important thing to think about, you might say,\n1:38\noh, OK, wait, this is OK, Accenture is a firm,\n1:40\nbut California is clearly the government.\n1:44\nSo how do you account for this?\n1:46\nAnd it's the expenditure view of GDP.\n1:48\nSo in this situation, California is spending $10 million\n1:53\nin the period for a new IT system.\n1:57\nSo this is going to be government.\n1:59\nThe government category is going to be increased by $10 million,\n2:03\nbecause of this expenditure.\n2:06\nNow next one.\n2:07\nMy mother sells her house in New Orleans\n2:09\nto a Swedish woman for $200,000.\n2:11\nOnce again, a house is being sold\n2:14\nfrom someone in the country to someone who was foreign,\n2:17\nwhat do we do?\n2:18\nBut the important thing to realize\n2:20\nis that this is not a new house.\n2:22\nThis is a transfer of an existing house.\n2:24\nNothing was produced here.\n2:26\nSo this has no contribution to GDP.\n2:30\nIt doesn't matter it's a Swedish woman or anything like that.\n2:32\nThe house existed before.\n2:34\nIt just changed hands.\n2:35\nA new house did not get produced.\n2:37\nSo nothing happens to GDP here.\n2:40\nNext one.\n2:41\nI-- and I'm assuming that I am here,\n2:43\nsitting here in Mountain View, California,\n2:45\nAmerican citizen-- I buy a Japanese made\n2:47\nlawn mower for $200.\n2:50\nNow this one is interesting.\n2:53\nBecause if you think about it theoretically,\n2:55\nnothing was produced in the United States,\n2:57\nso nothing should be added to GDP on a net-net basis.\n3:00\nAnd we'll see that that is actually the case.\n3:01\nBut it's going to show up by adding to consumption\n3:04\nand then taking away from net exports.\n3:07\nSo two things are going to happen here.\n3:08\nWe'll say, OK, Sal is an American consumer.\n3:12\nIf we just look at how much more he spent,\n3:14\nhe spent $200 more, so it's going to be added there.\n3:17\nBut then we're going to take it out of net exports.\n3:21\nSo net exports-- let me do it in that same green color-- net\n3:27\nexports.\n3:28\nEverything else is neutral.\n3:30\nSo in this thing right over here,\n3:31\nthere was no foreign purchases.\n3:33\nBut there is me buying a foreign product.\n3:36\nAnd let me subtract that out.\n3:38\nSo I'm going to subtract out $200 right over there.\n3:41\nSo net exports will be lower by $200,\n3:45\nbecause essentially this was a $200 import.\n3:47\nAnd that completely cancels out the $200\n3:49\nincrease in consumption.\n3:51\nAnd so this will have zero net effect on GDP.\n3:54\nThese two terms will cancel out.\n3:57\nNow I buy a new home in California for $500,000.\n4:03\nNow household spending for the most part\n4:05\nis considered C, except when you are buying a new home.\n4:10\nSo even though I am not a firm, because I\n4:14\nam buying a house, a new house, this will go into investment.\n4:19\nSo investment will go up by $500,000.\n4:24\nAnd then finally American Airlines buys a new Airbus jet,\n4:28\nand Airbus jets are made in Europe.\n4:30\nSo what's going to happen here?\n4:32\nSo once again, net-net, nothing was\n4:35\nproduced in the United States.\n4:36\nSo on a net basis, this should not contribute to GDP.\n4:40\nAnd we'll see that on net basis, it will break out,\n4:42\nit will be neutral, but it will be like this situation.\n4:46\nThere's an American firm that made a purchase--\n4:48\nand actually, I didn't put the amount here.\n4:49\nSo let's say it was $100 million.\n4:52\nI think that's actually about what a passenger plane might\n4:54\nactually cost, for $100 million.\n4:57\nSo the way we would account for it,\n4:59\ninvestment would go up by $100 million.\n5:03\nYou have an American firm making a purchase, $100 million.\n5:08\nConceptually, it makes sense.\n5:09\nIt's going to provide future goods and services,\n5:11\ngoing to give transportation to people.\n5:13\nBut it's going to be netted out, because you have a net import.\n5:20\nSo what this is going to do to net exports,\n5:23\non this side of it, you're going to have $100 million,\n5:25\nbecause this was an import.\n5:26\nSo you're going to have negative $100 million,\n5:28\nwhen you think of it from an export point of view.\n5:30\nAnd you had no corresponding positive export.\n5:34\nSo you're going to have net exports-- net exports is\n5:37\ngoing to go down $100 million.\n5:40\nThis was a net import of $100 million,\n5:42\nso it makes sense that net exports would go down.\n5:44\nIt would be negative net exports.\n5:46\nAnd these two, once again, are going\n5:48\nto cancel out with each other, so that you\n5:50\nhave no net GDP, which makes sense,\n5:53\nbecause this plane was not produced in the United States.",

So this is diploid, and it's a zygote,\n1:25\nwhich is just a fancy way of saying the fertilized egg.\n1:30\nAnd it's now ready to essentially\n1:31\nturn into an organism.\n1:33\nSo immediately after fertilization, this zygote\n1:36\nstarts experiencing cleavage.\n1:39\nIt's experiencing mitosis, that's the mechanism, but it\n1:42\ndoesn't increase a lot in size.\n1:44\nSo this one right here will then turn into-- it'll just\n1:48\nsplit up via mitosis into two like that.\n1:52\nAnd, of course, these are each 2N, and then those are going\n1:55\nto split into four like that.\n2:01\nAnd each of these have the same exact genetic complement\n2:05\nas that first zygote, and it keeps splitting.\n2:08\nAnd this mass of cells, we can start calling it, this right\n2:14\nhere, this is referred to as the morula.\n2:20\nAnd actually, it comes from the word for mulberry because\n2:22\nit looks like a mulberry.\n2:24\nSo actually, let me just kind of simplify things a little\n2:26\nbit because we don't have to start here.\n2:28\nSo we start with a zygote.\n2:32\nThis is a fertilized egg.\n2:33\nIt just starts duplicating via mitosis, and you end up with a\n2:38\nball of cells.\n2:40\nIt's often going to be a power of two, because these cells,\n2:43\nat least in the initial stages are all duplicating all at\n2:46\nonce, and then you have this morula.\n2:51\nNow, once the morula gets to about 16 cells or so-- and\n2:54\nwe're talking about four or five days.\n2:56\nThis isn't an exact process-- they started differentiating a\n3:01\nlittle bit, where the outer cells-- and this kind of turns\n3:04\ninto a sphere.\n3:05\nLet me make it a little bit more sphere like.\n3:08\nSo it starts differentiating between-- let me make some\n3:12\nouter cells.\n3:13\nThis would be a cross-section of it.\n3:15\nIt's really going to look more like a sphere.\n3:18\nThat's the outer cells and then you have your inner cells\n3:22\non the inside.\n3:24\nThese outer cells are called the trophoblasts.\n3:32\nLet me do it in a different color.\n3:40\nLet me scroll over.\n3:42\nI don't want to go there.\n3:43\nAnd then the inner cells, and this is kind of the crux of\n3:46\nwhat this video is all about-- let me scroll\n3:48\ndown a little bit.\n3:49\nThe inner cells-- pick a suitable color.\n3:54\nThe inner cells right there are called the embryoblast.\n4:01\nAnd then what's going to happen is some fluid's going\n4:03\nto start filling in some of this gap between the\n4:06\nembryoblast and the trophoblast, so you're going\n4:08\nto start having some fluid that comes in there, and so\n4:14\nthe morula will eventually look like this, where the\n4:18\ntrophoblast, or the outer membrane, is kind of this huge\n4:21\nsphere of cells.\n4:22\nAnd this is all happening as they keep replicating.\n4:25\nMitosis is the mechanism, so now my trophoblast is going to\n4:29\nlook like that, and then my embryoblast is going\n4:34\nto look like this.\n4:36\nSometimes the embryoblast-- so this is the embryoblast.\n4:46\nSometimes it's also called the inner cell mass, so let me\n4:51\nwrite that.\n4:56\nAnd this is what's going to turn into the organism.\n4:58\nAnd so, just so you know a couple of the labels that are\n5:01\ninvolved here, if we're dealing with a mammalian\n5:03\norganism, and we are mammals, we call this thing that the\n5:07\nmorula turned into is a zygote, then a morula, then\n5:10\nthe cells of the morula started to differentiate into\n5:13\nthe trophoblast, or kind of the outside cells, and then\n5:16\nthe embryoblast. And then you have this space that forms\n5:22\nhere, and this is just fluid, and it's called the\n5:26\nblastocoel.\n5:32\nA very non-intuitive spelling of the coel part of\n5:35\nblastocoel.\n5:37\nBut once this is formed, this is called a blastocyst. That's\n5:40\nthe entire thing right here.\n5:41\nLet me scroll down a little bit.\n5:44\nThis whole thing is called the blastocyst, and this is the\n5:49\ncase in humans.\n5:54\nNow, it can be a very confusing topic, because a lot\n5:57\nof times in a lot of books on biology, you'll say, hey, you\n5:59\ngo from the morula to the blastula or the\n6:02\nblastosphere stage.\n6:04\nLet me write those words down.\n6:06\nSo sometimes you'll say morula,\n6:10\nand you go to blastula.\n6:14\nSometimes it's called the blastosphere.\n6:20\nAnd I want to make it very clear that these are\n6:22\nessentially the same stages in development.\n6:25\nThese are just for-- you know, in a lot of books, they'll\n6:28\nstart talking about frogs or tadpoles or things like that,\n6:32\nand this applies to them.\n6:33\nWhile we're talking about mammals, especially the ones\n6:35\nthat are closely related to us, the stage is the\n6:38\nblastocyst stage, and the real differentiator is when people\n6:41\ntalk about just blastula and blastospheres.\n6:44\nThere isn't necessarily this differentiation between these\n6:47\noutermost cells and these embryonic, or this\n6:51\nembryoblast, or this inner cell mass here.\n6:54\nBut since the focus of this video is humans, and really\n6:57\nthat's where I wanted to start from, because that's what we\n6:59\nare and that's what's interesting, we're going to\n7:01\nfocus on the blastocyst.\n7:03\nNow, everything I've talked about in this video, it was\n7:06\nreally to get to this point, because what we have here,\n7:10\nthese little green cells that I drew right here in the\n7:14\nblastocysts, this inner cell mass, this is what will turn\n7:18\ninto the organism.\n7:19\nAnd you say, OK, Sal, if that's the organism, what's\n7:21\nall of these purple cells out here?\n7:24\nThis trophoblast out there?\n7:27\nThat is going to turn into the placenta, and I'll do a future\n7:30\nvideo where in a human, it'll turn into a placenta.\n7:34\nSo let me write that down.\n7:35\nIt'll turn into the placenta.\n7:38\nAnd I'll do a whole future video about I guess how babies\n7:41\nare born, and I actually learned a ton about that this\n7:44\npast year because a baby was born in our house.\n7:47\nBut the placenta is really kind of what the embryo\n7:51\ndevelops inside of, and it's the interface, especially in\n7:54\nhumans and in mammals, between the developing fetus and its\n7:59\nmother, so it kind of is the exchange mechanism that\n8:02\nseparates their two systems, but allows the necessary\n8:05\nfunctions to go on between them.\n8:06\nBut that's not the focus of this video.\n8:08\nThe focus of this video is the fact that these cells, which\n8:12\nat this point are-- they've differentiated themselves away\n8:15\nfrom the placenta cells, but they still haven't decided\n8:18\nwhat they're going to become.\n8:20\nMaybe this cell and its descendants eventually start\n8:24\nbecoming part of the nervous system, while these cells\n8:27\nright here might become muscle tissue, while these cells\n8:31\nright here might become the liver.\n8:36\nThese cells right here are called embryonic stem cells,\n8:40\nand probably the first time in this video you're hearing a\n8:43\nterm that you might recognize.\n8:45\nSo if I were to just take one of these cells, and actually,\n8:48\njust to introduce you to another term, you know, we\n8:52\nhave this zygote.\n8:54\nAs soon as it starts dividing, each of these cells are called\n8:59\na blastomere.\n9:00\nAnd you're probably wondering, Sal, why does this word blast\n9:04\nkeep appearing in this kind of embryology video, these\n9:08\ndevelopment videos?\n9:09\nAnd that comes from the Greek for spore: blastos.\n9:13\nSo the organism is beginning to spore out or grow.\n9:19\nI won't go into the word origins of it, but that's\n9:21\nwhere it comes from and that's why everything has\n9:23\nthis blast in it.\n9:23\nSo these are blastomeres.\n9:25\nSo when I talk what embryonic stem cells, I'm talking about\n9:28\nthe individual blastomeres inside of this embryoblast or\n9:34\ninside of this inner cell mass.\n9:36\nThese words are actually unusually fun to say.\n9:39\nSo each of these is an embryonic stem cell.\n9:43\nLet me write this down in a vibrant color.\n9:47\nSo each of these right here are embryonic stem cells, and\n9:52\nI wanted to get to this.\n9:56\nAnd the reason why these are interesting, and I think you\n9:58\nalready know, is that there's a huge debate around these.\n10:00\nOne, these have the potential to turn into anything, that\n10:03\nthey have this plasticity.\n10:05\nThat's another word that you might hear.\n10:07\nLet me write that down, too: plasticity.\n10:12\nAnd the word essentially comes from, you know, like a plastic\n10:14\ncan turn into anything else.\n10:17\nWhen we say that something has plasticity, we're talking\n10:19\nabout its potential to turn into a lot\n10:21\nof different things.\n10:22\nSo the theory is, and there's already some trials that seem\n10:26\nto substantiate this, especially in some lower\n10:28\norganisms, that, look, if you have some damage at some point\n10:31\nin your body-- let me draw a nerve cell.\n10:36\nLet me say I have a-- I won't go into the actual mechanics\n10:40\nof a nerve cell, but let's say that we have some damage at\n10:43\nsome point on a nerve cell right there, and because of\n10:46\nthat, someone is paralyzed or there's some nerve\n10:50\ndysfunction.\n10:51\nWe're dealing with multiple sclerosis or who knows what.\n10:54\nThe idea is, look, we have these cell here that could\n10:57\nturn into anything, and we're just really understanding how\n11:02\nit knows what to turn into.\n11:04\nIt really has to look at its environment and say, hey, what\n11:06\nare the guys around me doing, and maybe that's what helps\n11:08\ndictate what it does.\n11:10\nBut the idea is you take these things that could turn to\n11:12\nanything and you put them where the damage is, you layer\n11:16\nthem where the damage is, and then they can turn into the\n11:19\ncell that they need to turn into.\n11:21\nSo in this case, they would turn into nerve cells.\n11:24\nThey would turn to nerve cells and repair the damage and\n11:29\nmaybe cure the paralysis for that individual.\n11:32\nSo it's a huge, exciting area of research, and you could\n11:35\neven, in theory, grow new organs.\n11:37\nIf someone needs a kidney transplant or a heart\n11:39\ntransplant, maybe in the future, we could take a colony\n11:43\nof these embryonic stem cells.\n11:44\nMaybe we can put them in some type of other creature, or who\n11:48\nknows what, and we can turn it into a replacement heart or a\n11:52\nreplacement kidney.\n11:52\nSo there's a huge amount of excitement about\n11:56\nwhat these can do.\n11:57\nI mean, they could cure a lot of formerly uncurable diseases\n12:01\nor provide hope for a lot of patients who\n12:03\nmight otherwise die.\n12:05\nBut obviously, there's a debate here.\n12:07\nAnd the debate all revolves around the issue of if you\n12:10\nwere to go in here and try to extract one of these cells,\n12:15\nyou're going to kill this embryo.\n12:17\nYou're going to kill this developing embryo, and that\n12:21\ndeveloping embryo had the potential to\n12:23\nbecome a human being.\n12:27\nIt's a potential that obviously has to be in the\n12:28\nright environment, and it has to have a willing mother and\n12:33\nall of the rest, but it does have the potential.\n12:35\nAnd so for those, especially, I think, in the pro-life camp,\n12:40\nwho say, hey, anything that has a potential to be a human\n12:44\nbeing, that is life and it should not be killed.\n12:47\nSo people on that side of the camp, they're against the\n12:52\ndestroying of this embryo.\n12:54\nI'm not making this video to take either side to that\n12:57\nargument, but it's a potential to turn to a human being.\n13:01\nIt's a potential, right?\n13:04\nSo obviously, there's a huge amount of debate, but now, now\n13:07\nyou know in this video what people are talking about when\n13:10\nthey say embryonic stem cells.\n13:12\nAnd obviously, the next question is, hey, well, why\n13:14\ndon't they just call them stem cells as opposed to embryonic\n13:16\nstem cells?\n13:17\nAnd that's because in all of our bodies, you do have what\n13:20\nare called somatic stem cells.\n13:22\nLet me write that down.\n13:24\nSomatic or adults stem cells.\n13:29\nAnd we all have them.\n13:30\nThey're in our bone marrow to help produce red blood cells,\n13:32\nother parts of our body, but the problem with somatic stem\n13:36\ncells is they're not as plastic, which means that they\n13:41\ncan't form any type of cell in the human body.\n13:44\nThere's an area of research where people are actually\n13:46\nmaybe trying to make them more plastic, and if they are able\n13:50\nto take these somatic stem cells and make them more\n13:52\nplastic, it might maybe kill the need to have these\n13:56\nembryonic stem cells, although maybe if they do this too\n13:58\ngood, maybe these will have the potential to turn into\n14:01\nhuman beings as well, so that could\n14:03\nbecome a debatable issue.\n14:04\nBut right now, this isn't an area of debate because, left\n14:08\nto their own devices, a somatic stem cell or an adult\n14:12\nstem cell won't turn into a human being, while an\n14:15\nembryonic one, if it is implanted in a willing mother,\n14:19\nthen, of course, it will turn into a human being.\n14:21\nAnd I want to make one side note here, because I don't\n14:24\nwant to take any sides on the debate of-- well, I mean,\n14:30\nfacts are facts.\n14:31\nThis does have the potential to turn into a human being,\n14:33\nbut it also has the potential to save millions of lives.\n14:36\nBoth of those statements are facts, and then you can decide\n14:39\non your own which side of that argument you'd like to or what\n14:42\nside of that balance you would like to kind of\n14:45\nput your own opinion.\n14:47\nBut there's one thing I want to talk about that in the\n14:50\npublic debate is never brought up.\n14:51\nSo you have this notion of when you-- to get an embryonic\n14:55\nstem cell line, and when I say a stem cell line, I mean you\n14:58\ntake a couple of stem cells, or let's say you take one stem\n15:00\ncell, and then you put it in a Petri dish, and then you allow\n15:04\nit to just duplicate.\n15:06\nSo this one turns into two, those two turn to four.\n15:09\nThen someone could take one of these and then put it in their\n15:12\nown Petri dish.\n15:13\nThese are a stem cell line.\n15:15\nThey all came from one unique embryonic stem cell or what\n15:20\ninitially was a blastomere.\n15:21\nSo that's what they call a stem cell line.\n15:24\nSo the debate obviously is when you start an embryonic\n15:28\nstem cell line, you are destroying an embryo.\n15:31\nBut I want to make the point here that embryos are being\n15:33\ndestroyed in other processes, and namely, in-vitro\n15:37\nfertilization.\n15:40\nAnd maybe this'll be my next video: fertilization.\n15:44\nAnd this is just the notion that they take a set of eggs\n15:48\nout of a mother.\n15:49\nIt's usually a couple that's having trouble having a child,\n15:52\nand they take a bunch of eggs out of the mother.\n15:54\nSo let's say they take maybe 10 to 30\n15:56\neggs out of the mother.\n15:59\nThey actually perform a surgery, take them out of the\n16:02\novaries of the mother, and then they fertilize them with\n16:06\nsemen, either it might come from the father or a sperm\n16:09\ndonor, so then all of these becomes zygotes once they're\n16:13\nfertilized with semen.\n16:15\nSo these all become zygotes, and then they allow them to\n16:17\ndevelop, and they usually allow them to develop to the\n16:19\nblastocyst stage.\n16:21\nSo eventually all of these turn into blastocysts.\n16:25\nThey have a blastocoel in the center, which is\n16:30\nthis area of fluid.\n16:32\nThey have, of course, the embryo, the inner cell mass in\n16:37\nthem, and what they do is they look at the ones that they\n16:41\ndeem are healthier or maybe the ones that are at least\n16:44\njust not unhealthy, and they'll take a couple of these\n16:47\nand they'll implant these into the mother, so all of this is\n16:50\noccurring in a Petri dish.\n16:52\nSo maybe these four look good, so they're going to take these\n16:55\nfour, and they're going to implant these into a mother,\n16:57\nand if all goes well, maybe one of these will turn into--\n17:01\nwill give the couple a child.\n17:02\nSo this one will develop and maybe the other ones won't.\n17:05\nBut if you've seen John & Kate Plus 8, you know that many\n17:09\ntimes they implant a lot of them in there, just to\n17:12\nincrease the probability that you get at least one child.\n17:14\nBut every now and then, they implant seven or eight, and\n17:17\nthen you end up with eight kids.\n17:18\nAnd that's why in-vitro fertilization often results in\n17:21\nkind of these multiple births, or reality\n17:25\ntelevision shows on cable.\n17:27\nBut what do they do with all of these other perfectly--\n17:30\nwell, I won't say perfectly viable, but these are embryos.\n17:33\nThey may or may not be perfectly viable, but you have\n17:36\nthese embryos that have the potential, just like this one\n17:41\nright here.\n17:42\nThese all have the potential to turn into a human being.\n17:46\nBut most fertility clinics, roughly half of them, they\n17:50\neither throw these away, they destroy them, they\n17:52\nallow them to die.\n17:54\nA lot of these are frozen, but just the process of freezing\n17:56\nthem kills them and then bonding them kills them again,\n17:59\nso most of these, the process of in-vitro fertilization, for\n18:04\nevery one child that has the potential to develop into a\n18:08\nfull-fledged human being, you're actually destroying\n18:10\ntens of very viable embryos.\n18:14\nSo at least my take on it is if you're against-- and I\n18:18\ngenerally don't want to take a side on this, but if you are\n18:21\nagainst research that involves embryonic stem cells because\n18:33\nof the destruction of embryos, on that same, I guess,\n18:36\nphilosophical ground, you should also be against\n18:40\nin-vitro fertilization because both of these involve the\n18:47\ndestruction of zygotes.\n18:49\nI think-- well, I won't talk more about this, because I\n18:52\nreally don't want to take sides, but I want to show that\n18:54\nthere is kind of an equivalence here that's\n18:56\ncompletely lost in this debate on whether embryonic stem\n19:00\ncells should be used because they have a destruction of\n19:02\nembryos, because you're destroying just as many\n19:04\nembryos in this-- well, I won't say just as many, but\n19:08\nyou are destroying embryos.\n19:09\nThere's hundreds of thousands of embryos that get destroyed\n19:12\nand get frozen and obviously destroyed in that process as\n19:16\nwell through this in-vitro fertilization process.\n19:19\nSo anyway, now hopefully you have the tools to kind of\n19:22\nengage in the debate around stem cells, and you see that\n19:25\nit all comes from what we learned about meiosis.\n19:29\nThey produce these gametes.\n19:33\nThe male gamete fertilizes a female gamete.\n19:35\nThe zygote happens or gets created and starts splitting\n19:39\nup the morula, and then it keeps splitting and it\n19:42\ndifferentiates into the blastocyst, and then this is\n19:45\nwhere the stem cells are.\n19:47\nSo you already know enough science to engage in kind of a\n19:50\nvery heated debate.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWhat I want to do with this video is talk about\n0:02\nnucleophilicity.\n0:14\nThis is really just how good of a nucleophile something is.\n0:17\nOr I'll just make up a definition right now: the\n0:20\nability for an atom slash ion slash molecule to act as a\n0:35\nnucleophile, or to give away extra electrons and bond with\n0:51\na nucleus or with something else.\n0:53\nI'll say with a nucleus.\n1:01\nI want to say with a nucleus, because that's what\n1:03\nnucleophilicity is saying.\n1:04\nIt loves nucleuses, especially positive ones, that it can\n1:07\ngive its extra electrons to it.\n1:09\nNow, as a first cut, if you want to identify a good\n1:13\nnucleophile, it should have extra electrons to give away.\n1:32\nThe best things that have extra electrons to give away\n1:35\nare negative ions or anions, so just at a very high level,\n1:40\nsomething like the fluoride anion.\n1:44\nNormally, fluorine has seven valence electrons: one, two,\n1:48\nthree, four, five, six, seven, but it's so electronegative,\n1:53\nit might be able swipe off another electron from\n1:55\nsomething else and then it becomes the fluoride anion.\n1:59\nThen it becomes the fluoride anion with a negative charge.\n2:03\nYou can do that for all of the halides.\n2:05\nYou could do that for chlorine.\n2:06\nIt can become chloride.\n2:07\nBromine can be bromide.\n2:09\nIodine could be iodide.\n2:11\nLet me do iodine, too.\n2:13\nIodine, once again, it's a halide.\n2:15\nIt has seven valence electrons.\n2:16\nIt has many, many more electrons than fluorine, but\n2:19\nif you just look at its valence shell,\n2:21\nit has seven electrons.\n2:23\nAnd then it is also reasonably electronegative, not as\n2:26\nelectronegative as fluorine.\n2:28\nRemember, the trend goes like this from the bottom left to\n2:32\nthe top right.\n2:32\nSo fluorine is extremely electronegative, but iodine is\n2:36\nstill pretty electronegative.\n2:39\nIt is a halogen so it also might be able to swipe off an\n2:43\nelectron from someone else and become iodide.\n2:48\nIn general, things with extra electrons, lone pairs of\n2:52\nelectrons, and especially a negative charge, are going to\n2:54\nbe pretty good nucleophiles.\n2:59\nAnother example that's not a halide is the\n3:01\nhydroxide anion, so OH.\n3:05\nThis is an example of something that is a molecule.\n3:09\nMaybe traditionally water would look like this.\n3:12\nTraditionally, this is just neutral water, and oxygen has\n3:17\ntwo lone pairs like that, but oxygen is pretty\n3:19\nelectronegative.\n3:20\nIt is already kind of taking the electrons away from one of\n3:23\nthe hydrogens, and at some point, it might just take it\n3:26\naltogether and then you have the hydroxide anion.\n3:31\nThis would look like this.\n3:33\nYou have your original two lone pairs, just like that,\n3:36\nand then you have this pair that's going to be taken.\n3:39\nIt already had that electron.\n3:40\nIt takes that electron from the hydrogen, so now it has\n3:42\ntwo more electrons.\n3:44\nLet me color code it so you see what it took.\n3:45\nIt took this electron from the hydrogen and now this also has\n3:49\na negative charge.\n3:50\nThat's also a reasonably good nucleophile.\n3:55\nAnd, of course, you have your hydrogen now.\n3:56\nIt lost its one electron.\n3:58\nIt only has a proton in its nucleus.\n4:01\nWhenever you see H plus, this is really just a proton.\n4:03\nThere's nothing else to that hydrogen.\n4:05\nSo that's hydroxide.\n4:06\nThese are all reasonably good nucleophiles in that they have\n4:11\nsomething to give away.\n4:12\nThey have extra charge.\n4:14\nNow, what I want to do is think about between these, how\n4:17\ndo you think about what's going to be a stronger or\n4:19\nweaker nucleophile?\n4:21\nAnd here, it becomes a little bit more nuanced.\n4:25\nWhat we're going to do is differentiate what happens in\n4:27\na protic solvent versus what happens in an aprotic solvent.\n4:31\nLet me write down.\n4:33\nLet me start with a protic solvent.\n4:40\nI'll make two columns here, protic solvent and then we'll\n4:43\ndo aprotic solvent right over here.\n4:54\nOnce again, these are fancy words, but they mean something\n4:56\npretty simple.\n4:57\nProtic solvent is something that has hydrogens that can be\n5:01\ntaken away or might have free protons floating around.\n5:04\nAn example of a protic solvent is water\n5:07\nor really any alcohol.\n5:08\nWater is the simplest example or maybe the most common.\n5:12\nThe reason why you might have protons floating around is\n5:15\nexactly this reaction I showed right here.\n5:18\nMaybe every now and then a hydroxide anion forms. Even\n5:21\nmore likely, maybe a water takes a hydrogen from one of\n5:26\nthe other waters.\n5:27\nOne of the water molecules takes hydrogen from one of the\n5:29\nother water molecules and becomes a hydronium, where\n5:33\nit's not a proton necessarily, but it's an oxygen.\n5:41\nLet's say if you start with water and one of these\n5:44\nelectrons were to be given to some proton floating around,\n5:48\nit would look like this.\n5:50\nAnd it has a positive charge and then this\n5:53\nproton is very available.\n5:56\nYou can almost imagine it's almost floating around because\n5:58\nthat oxygen really wants to take back that electron.\n6:01\nSo protic solvent is water.\n6:03\nIn water, you might see a little bit of hydroxide, a\n6:05\nlittle bit of proton, a little bit a hydronium.\n6:07\nYou see all of it in there, but the bottom line is that\n6:09\nthere are protons that can react with other things.\n6:15\nLet me clear this away so that I have some real estate.\n6:19\nLet me just write down water.\n6:21\nWater is a protic solvent.\n6:24\nNow, wait.\n6:25\nIs that always the case?\n6:27\nIt seems like hydrogens are everywhere.\n6:28\nWell, no, it's not always the case.\n6:29\nLet me show you an aprotic solvent.\n6:32\nDiethyl ether looks like this.\n6:41\nAnd just so you know the naming, it's an ether because\n6:43\nit has oxygen, and it's diethyl because it has two\n6:46\nethyl groups.\n6:47\nThat's one ethyl group right there and that is the second.\n6:50\nSo it's diethyl ether.\n6:53\nNow, you might say, hey, this guy's got hydrogens lying\n6:56\naround as well.\n6:56\nMaybe those can get released.\n6:58\nBut, no, these hydrogens are bonded to the carbon and\n7:01\ncarbon is not anywhere near as electronegative as oxygen.\n7:06\nCarbon is unlikely to steal these hydrogens' electrons and\n7:10\nthese hydrogens to be loose.\n7:12\nIf they were bonded to the oxygen, that would have been a\n7:14\npossibility.\n7:16\nWith water, you have obviously H-O-H.\n7:20\nIn alcohols, you have some maybe carbon chain bonded to\n7:27\nan oxygen, which is then bonded to a hydrogen.\n7:29\nSo in either of these cases, in either water or alcohol,\n7:32\nyou have these hydrogens where the electron might be taken by\n7:36\nthe oxygen because it's so electronegative and then the\n7:38\nhydrogen floats around.\n7:39\nAnyway, that's a review of protic versus aprotic.\n7:42\nIn a protic solvent-- and this is actually a general rule of\n7:45\nthumb-- if a nucleophile is likely to react with its\n7:51\nsolvent, it will be bad at being a nucleophile.\n7:54\nThink about it.\n7:54\nIf it's reacting with the solvent, it's not going to be\n7:57\nable to do this.\n7:58\nIt's not going to be able to give its electrons away to\n8:01\nwhat it needs to give it away, to maybe what we saw in an\n8:04\nSn2-type reaction.\n8:07\nIn a protic solvent, what happens is that the things\n8:09\nthat are really electronegative and really\n8:11\nsmall, like a fluoride anion-- let me draw a fluoride anion.\n8:19\nIn a protic solvent, what's going to happen is it's going\n8:26\nto be blocked by hydrogen bonds.\n8:29\nIt's very negative, right?\n8:30\nIt has a negative charge.\n8:31\nAnd it's also tightly packed.\n8:33\nAs you can see right here, its electrons are\n8:36\nvery close, tied in.\n8:38\nIt's a much smaller atom or ion, in this case.\n8:42\nIf we looked at iodide, iodide has 53\n8:45\nelectrons, many orbitals.\n8:48\nActually, iodide would have 54.\n8:49\nIt would have the same as iodine plus one.\n8:52\nFluoride will have 10 electrons, nine from fluorine\n8:55\nplus it gains another one, so it's a much smaller atom.\n9:00\nSo when you have water hanging around it, let's say you have\n9:03\nsomething like water.\n9:04\nThat has a negative charge.\n9:06\nWater is polar.\n9:11\nActually, both of these are polar, so I should write down\n9:14\npolar for both of these.\n9:15\nThis is a polar protic solvent.\n9:18\nThis is a polar aprotic solvent.\n9:21\nIn this case, water is still more electronegative than the\n9:23\ncarbon, so it still has a partial negative charge.\n9:26\nThese parts still have a partial negative.\n9:27\nWater still has a partial negative charge.\n9:30\nThe hydrogen has a partial positive charge so it is going\n9:33\nto be attracted to the fluorine.\n9:35\nThis is going to happen all around the fluorine.\n9:38\nAnd if these waters are attracted to the fluorine in\n9:40\nkind of forming a tight shell around it, it makes it hard\n9:44\nfor fluorine to react.\n9:52\nSo it's a worse nucleophile than, say, iodide or hydroxide\n9:58\nin a polar protic solvent.\n10:00\nHydroxide has the same issue.\n10:02\nIt's still forming hydrogen bonds, but if you wanted to\n10:05\ncompare them, iodide is much bigger.\n10:10\nMaybe I'll draw it like this.\n10:12\nI'll draw its valence shell like this.\n10:14\nIt's a much bigger ion.\n10:20\nIt has all these electrons in here.\n10:22\nAnd so, it still will form hydrogen bonds with the water.\n10:26\nIt still will form hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen end of\n10:29\nthe water because they're partially positive, but it's\n10:31\ngoing to be less tightly packed.\n10:34\nAnd on top of that, iodide is more polarizable, which means\n10:47\nthat its electron cloud is so big and the valence electrons\n10:50\nare so far away from the nucleus that they can be\n10:53\ninfluenced by things and then be more likely to react.\n10:56\nSo let's say this iodide is getting close to a carbon that\n11:00\nhas a partial positive charge.\n11:02\nSo let's say carbon is attached to a bromine and then\n11:09\nit's attached to three hydrogens.\n11:12\nWe've seen that this will have a partial negative charge.\n11:14\nIt's more electronegative than the carbon, which will have a\n11:17\npartial positive charge.\n11:19\nWhen this guy, this big guy with the electrons really far\n11:22\naway, gets close to this, more of the electron cloud is going\n11:28\nto be attracted to the partial positive charge.\n11:30\nIt'll get distorted a little bit and so it is more likely\n11:33\nto react in a polar protic solvent.\n11:37\nFluoride, on the other hand, is very tightly packed,\n11:40\nblocked by the hydrogen bonds.\n11:43\nIt's less likely to react.\n11:45\nIf you were to look at the Periodic Table, if you look at\n11:49\njust the halogens in a polar protic solvent, the halides--\n11:57\nthis would be the ion version of the halogens-- the halide's\n12:00\niodide will be the best nucleophile.\n12:03\nFluoride will be the worst. So in a polar protic solvent--\n12:07\nlet me write this down-- we have a situation where the\n12:21\niodide is the best nucleophile, followed by\n12:25\nbromide, followed by chloride, and then last\n12:30\nof all is the fluoride.\n12:33\nThe exact opposite is true in an aprotic solvent.\n12:38\nIn an aprotic solvent, the fluoride, which is-- fluorine\n12:42\nis far more electronegative.\n12:44\nFluoride is more basic.\n12:48\nIt will be more stable if it is able to form a bond with\n12:52\nsomething than iodide.\n12:54\nIodide is pretty stable.\n12:56\nIf you look at a hydrogen iodide, it's actually a highly\n13:01\nacidic molecule.\n13:02\nSo iodide itself, the conjugate base of hydrogen\n13:05\niodide, is going to be a very bad base.\n13:09\nWhen you're dealing with an aprotic solvent, you go in the\n13:12\ndirection of basicity.\n13:14\nWe're going to learn in the next video that actually\n13:15\nbasicity and nucleophilicity are related, but they aren't\n13:19\nthe same concept.\n13:20\nWe're going to talk about that in a little bit.\n13:23\nIf you're in an aprotic solvent, you're not reacting\n13:27\nwith the solvent as much.\n13:28\nAnd then in this situation, fluoride is actually the best\n13:32\nnucleophile, followed by chloride, followed by bromide,\n13:37\nfollowed by iodide.\n13:39\nSo here, you're going in the direction of basicity.\n13:42\nThis is the best. This is the worse in an aprotic solvent.\n13:47\nIf it was in a protic solvent, this is flipped around.\n13:50\nThis becomes the best and this becomes the worst.",

molecule of ethane,\n0:15\nand it is reacting.\n0:16\nIt's ethane gas, it is reacting with molecular oxygen\n0:19\nin gaseous form and they combust to\n0:22\nform carbon dioxide gas and liquid water,\n0:26\nand like we've seen in previous examples,\n0:28\nthis chemical equation is not balanced.\n0:31\nHow can we tell?\n0:32\nWell here on the left hand side we have two carbons.\n0:35\nHere on the right hand side we have one carbon.\n0:37\nHere on the left hand side we have six hydrogens.\n0:38\nHere on the right hand side we only have two hydrogens.\n0:42\nHere on the left hand side we have two oxygens.\n0:46\nOn the right hand side we have two plus, three oxygens,\n0:49\nso none of the elements here are balanced.\n0:53\nBut like we did in the example of ethylene,\n0:56\nwhenever you see this where you have several\n0:58\nsomewhat complex molecules involved,\n1:01\nit's good to save the element that\n1:05\nis in a molecule by itself for last,\n1:08\nbecause you can just tweak this\n1:10\nto change the number of oxygens\n1:11\nwithout it having any other side effects\n1:13\non the number of carbons or hydrogens.\n1:15\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm going to first balance,\n1:17\nlike we've done before,\n1:18\nthe carbons and the hydrogens,\n1:20\nwhich are going to have implications on the oxygens\n1:22\nbecause if I change the number here,\n1:23\nit's going to change the number of oxygens.\n1:25\nIf I change the number here it's going to\n1:26\nchange the number of oxygens.\n1:28\nBut lucky for me I have this dioxygen molecule\n1:30\non the left hand side that I can just tweak at the end\n1:33\nto balance the entire chemical equation.\n1:36\nSo let's start with, you know last time\n1:38\nwe started with carbon, let's start with hydrogen this time.\n1:40\nJust for kicks.\n1:42\nSo over here I have six hydrogens\n1:44\non the left hand side, of the entire left hand side\n1:46\nI only have six hydrogen atoms.\n1:48\nOn the right hand side I only have two right now,\n1:50\nso if I want to have six I would multiply these two by three\n1:55\nso now I have three water molecules,\n1:57\neach of them have two hydrogen atoms,\n1:59\nso I'm going to have six, six hydrogen atoms\n2:03\non the right hand side.\n2:04\nFair enough.\n2:06\nNow let's go to the carbon.\n2:07\nRemember I'm saving oxygen for last.\n2:09\nCarbon on the left hand side I have two carbons.\n2:12\nHow many carbons do I have on the right hand side?\n2:14\nWell right now I only have one,\n2:16\nbut I can change that very easily.\n2:18\nInstead of having one molecule of carbon dioxide,\n2:20\nI can have two molecules of carbon dioxide.\n2:23\nAnd so now my carbons are balanced,\n2:24\ntwo carbons, two carbons.\n2:26\nAnd now let's go to the oxygens.\n2:29\nSo right now, right now on, I'll do this in a mauve color,\n2:34\nright now on the left hand side I have two oxygens,\n2:38\nbut on the right hand side what do I have?\n2:40\nLet's see, I have two times two,\n2:42\nso this right over here is four oxygens,\n2:45\nand then I have three water molecules,\n2:47\neach of them have one oxygen atom,\n2:49\nso three times one, so this is going to be three\n2:52\nright over here.\n2:54\nSo on the entire right hand side I have seven oxygen atoms\n2:58\nand on the left I only have two.\n3:00\nSo what can I do here?\n3:01\nWhat can multiply by two to get to seven?\n3:05\nTwo times what is equal to seven?\n3:07\nWell two times three-and-a-half is equal to seven.\n3:11\nSo two times three-and-a-half is equal to seven.\n3:14\nRemember I have two here, I'm saying two times\n3:17\nsomething is equal to seven.\n3:19\nI want to get to the four plus the three.\n3:22\nWell I multiply it by three point five,\n3:25\nand now I have seven, seven oxygen atoms\n3:29\non both sides of my chemical equation.\n3:32\nBut like we've seen in previous videos,\n3:34\nit is not standard to just leave a three-and-a-half here,\n3:37\nit's kind of this weird notion of\n3:38\nthree-and-a-half molecules,\n3:40\nwe like to have whole numbers here.\n3:42\nSo how do we make sure we have all whole number\n3:45\ncoefficients in front of our molecules?\n3:48\nWell we could just multiply everything by two,\n3:50\nthen this thing is going to become a seven,\n3:52\nthis thing is going to become a two,\n3:53\nthis is going to become a four,\n3:55\nthis is going to become a six,\n3:57\nso let's just do that.\n3:58\nI'll write the whole reaction over again.\n4:00\nSo I have my ethane, and I won't write\n4:03\nactually what state it's in just to save some time,\n4:06\nplus some molecular oxygen.\n4:09\nThey combust, they yield,\n4:11\nso these are the reactants,\n4:12\nthe products are carbon dioxide gas\n4:15\nand liquid water, and liquid water.\n4:19\nSo let's see, you multiply, if you say that there\n4:22\nwas a one out here before,\n4:24\nwe're going to multiply that by two to get two.\n4:26\nWe had a three point five here, multiply that by two,\n4:30\nyou get a seven here.\n4:32\nWe had a two right over here, multiply that by two\n4:36\nyou get a four.\n4:38\nOnce again I'm just multiplying all the coefficients\n4:40\nby two just like you did in algebraic equations\n4:41\nin your algebra classes.\n4:43\nAnd then finally three times two is six.\n4:47\nAnd we're all balanced.\n4:48\nWe were balanced here but we didn't\n4:50\nhave whole number coefficients.\n4:51\nMultiplying everything by two gave us\n4:53\nthe whole number coefficients and we are much happier.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWe've talked a little bit about the law of demand which\n0:02\ntells us all else equal, if we raise the price of a product,\n0:08\nthen the quantity demanded for that product will go down.\n0:11\nCommon sense.\n0:12\nIf we lower the price, than the quantity demanded will go up,\n0:14\nand we'll see a few special cases for this.\n0:16\nBut what I want to do in this video is focus\n0:18\non these other things that we've been holding equal,\n0:21\nthe things that allow us to make this statement, that\n0:23\nallow us to move along this curve,\n0:25\nand think about if we were to change one of those things,\n0:27\nthat we were otherwise considering\n0:29\nequal, how does that change the actual curve?\n0:32\nHow does that actually change the whole quantity\n0:34\ndemanded price relationship?\n0:37\nAnd so the first of these that I will focus on,\n0:40\nthe first is the price of competing products.\n0:50\nSo if you assume that the price of-- actually I\n0:53\nshouldn't say competing products,\n0:54\nI'll say the price of related products,\n0:56\nbecause we'll see that they're not competing.\n0:59\nThe price of related products is one of the things\n1:04\nthat we're assuming is constant when we, it's beheld equal when\n1:08\nwe show this relationship.\n1:10\nWe're assuming that these other things aren't changing.\n1:13\nNow, what would happen if these things changed?\n1:16\nWell, imagine we have, say, other ebooks-- books\n1:28\nis price-- price goes up.\n1:32\nThe price of other ebooks go up.\n1:35\nSo what will that do to our price\n1:37\nquantity demanded relationship?\n1:40\nIf other ebooks prices go up, now all of a sudden, my ebook,\n1:44\nregardless of what price point we're at,\n1:47\nat any of the price points, my ebook\n1:49\nis going to look more desirable.\n1:51\nAt $2, it's more likely that people will want it,\n1:55\nbecause the other stuff's more expensive.\n1:57\nAt $4 more people will want it, at $6 more people will want it,\n2:00\n$8 more people will want it, at $10 more people will want it.\n2:03\nSo if this were to happen, that would actually\n2:05\nshift the entire demand curve to the right.\n2:09\nSo it would start to look something like this.\n2:17\nThat is scenario one.\n2:18\nAnd these other ebooks, we can call them\n2:20\nsubstitutes for my product.\n2:23\nSo this right over here, these other ebooks,\n2:25\nthese are substitutes.\n2:31\nPeople might say, oh, you know, that other book looks\n2:33\nkind of comparable, if one is more expensive\n2:35\nor one is cheaper, maybe I'll read one or the other.\n2:38\nSo in order to make this statement, in order\n2:40\nto stay along this curve, we have\n2:42\nto assume that this thing is constant.\n2:44\nIf this thing changes, this is going to move the curve.\n2:47\nIf other ebooks prices go up, it'll\n2:49\nprobably shift our curve to the right.\n2:50\nIf other ebooks prices go down, that\n2:53\nwill shift our entire curve to the left.\n2:55\nSo this is actually changing our demand.\n2:58\nIt's changing our whole relationship.\n3:00\nSo it's shifting demand to the right.\n3:02\nSo let me write that.\n3:03\nSo this is going to shift demand.\n3:08\nSo the entire relationship, demand, to the right.\n3:12\nI really want to make sure that you have this point clear.\n3:15\nWhen we hold everything else equal,\n3:17\nwe're moving along a given demand curve.\n3:20\nWe're essentially saying the demand, the price\n3:23\nquantity demanded relationship, is held constant,\n3:26\nand we can pick a price and we'll\n3:27\nget a certain quantity demanded.\n3:29\nWe're moving along the curve.\n3:32\nIf we change one of those things,\n3:33\nwe might actually shift the curve.\n3:36\nWe'll actually change this demand schedule,\n3:38\nwhich will change this curve.\n3:40\nNow, there other related products,\n3:43\nthey don't just have to be substitutes.\n3:45\nSo, for example, let's think about scenario two.\n3:49\nOr maybe the price of a Kindle goes up.\n3:59\nLet me write this this way.\n4:02\nKindle's price goes up.\n4:06\nNow, the Kindle is not a substitute.\n4:07\nPeople don't either buy an ebook or they won't either\n4:11\nbuy my ebook or a Kindle.\n4:13\nKindle is a compliment.\n4:14\nYou actually need a Kindle or an iPad or something like it\n4:17\nin order to consume my ebook.\n4:20\nSo this right over here is a complement.\n4:25\nSo if a complement's price becomes more expensive,\n4:28\nand this is one of the things people\n4:30\nmight use to buy my book, then it would actually,\n4:32\nfor any given price, lower the quantity demanded.\n4:36\nSo in this situation, if my book is\n4:37\n$2, since fewer people are going to have Kindles,\n4:40\nor since maybe they used some of their money\n4:42\nalready to buy the Kindle, they're\n4:43\ngoing to have less to buy my book or just fewer\n4:45\npeople will have the Kindle, for any given price is going\n4:48\nto lower the quantity demanded.\n4:53\nAnd so it'll essentially will shift,\n4:54\nit'll change the entire demand curve will shift the demand\n4:57\ncurve to the left.\n4:59\nSo this right over here is scenario two.\n5:01\nAnd you could imagine the other way,\n5:03\nif the Kindle's price went down, then\n5:05\nthat would shift my demand curve to the right.\n5:07\nIf the price of substitutes went down,\n5:10\nthen that would shift my entire curve to the left.\n5:13\nSo you can think about all the scenarios,\n5:14\nand actually I encourage you to.\n5:15\nThink about drawing yourself, think about for products,\n5:17\nthat could be an ebook or could be some other type of product,\n5:20\nand think about what would happen.\n5:22\nWell, one, think about what the related products are,\n5:24\nthe substitutes and potentially complements, and then\n5:26\nthink about what happen as those prices change.\n5:29\nAnd always keep in mind the difference between demand,\n5:32\nwhich is this entire relationship, the entire curve\n5:35\nthat we can move along if we hold everything else equal\n5:38\nand only change price, and quantity demanded,\n5:41\nwhich is a particular quantity for our particular price\n5:44\nholding everything else equal.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWe now know how to find the area of rectangles.\n0:03\nWhat I want to do in this video,\n0:04\nis think about how we can find the areas of triangles.\n0:07\nSo, we're starting here with a right triangle,\n0:11\nhas a 90 degree angle right over here.\n0:13\nRight triangle ABC.\n0:14\nAnd let's think about how we can find this area.\n0:17\nWell, maybe we can construct a rectangle out of triangle ABC.\n0:21\nAnd if we can construct a rectangle out if it, and then, maybe we can\n0:24\nsomehow find our area of part of that rectangle.\n0:26\nAnd the best way to construct a rectangle is to really duplicate ABC,\n0:30\nand then flip it over and put it right on top of this.\n0:33\nAnd just to verify, that definitely will be a rectangle.\n0:36\nSo we know that this is 90 degrees right over here.\n0:38\nLet's say that this is x degrees right over there.\n0:41\nWe have x + 90 + this thing have to be equal to 180.\n0:45\nSo, this thing and this thing have to add up to 90.\n0:48\nLet's just call this 90-x.\n0:51\nNow, let's flip this thing and rotate it around,\n0:54\nso that it will look like this.\n0:56\nSo, then you would have another triangle\n0:58\nthat would look just like this.\n1:00\nWhere now, this right angle,\n1:03\non the flipped version is that right angle right over there.\n1:06\nThis angle right over here, this x,\n1:08\nis now this angle right over there.\n1:10\nAnd this 90-x is now this angle, right over there.\n1:14\nAnd you can see x + 90-x, that'll give you a right angle.\n1:18\nAnd then you have x + 90-x, that gives you a right angle.\n1:22\nAnd you have four sides and four right angles,\n1:25\nyou're definitely dealing with a rectangle.\n1:27\nAnd this rectangle has two of our original triangles in it.\n1:31\nSo, we can write, we can write that the area of triangle ABC,\n1:37\nthe area of triangle ABC, that's what the brackets mean,\n1:40\narea of triangle ABC,\n1:42\nis going to be equal to ? * the area of our entire rectangle.\n1:47\nAnd our entire rectangle, let me add another point here.\n1:49\nLet me call this D, is going to be ? the area of rectangle ABCD.\n1:55\nAnd we know how to find the area of rectangle ABCD.\n2:00\nIt's going to be equal to,\n2:02\nit's going to be equal to the base of the rectangle.\n2:05\nSo, this is going to be equal to ? * and so this part right over here.\n2:10\nLet me just use a different color.\n2:11\nThe area of ABCD is equal to the base or the width of the rectangle.\n2:16\nSo, that's just the length of BC.\n2:19\nI'm just putting this in parentheses, it doesn't mean！I just,\n2:23\nBC is just the length of this segment right over here\n2:25\nI'm just putting in the parentheses\n2:26\nso that we don't get the letters jumbled up.\n2:28\nSo it's going to be this width or this base right here\n2:30\ntimes the height of the rectangle.\n2:33\nSo, times AD.\n2:35\nTimes！sorry, times AB.\n2:38\nSo, it's this base * this height\n2:41\ngives us the area of the entire rectangle.\n2:42\nAnd the area of a right triangle is half of that.\n2:45\nSo, there we have it.\n2:46\nIt's ? * this base * this height.\n2:52\nIt's the area of a right triangle.\n2:54\nSo, in general if you ever have a right triangle,\n2:56\nif you ever have a right triangle,\n2:57\nand this is a right angle right over there which is,\n3:01\nyou need one right angle in order for it to be a right triangle.\n3:04\nAnd this base has length B, and this side over here has length H.\n3:08\nYou know that the area,\n3:10\nthe area is going to be equal to ? * the base of the triangle.\n3:19\nThat's the base of the triangle BC * the height of the triangle.\n3:23\nSo you can view it this way, if you look at the actual letter points.\n3:27\nAnd if you just use these measures as a base * height,\n3:29\nit's just ? base * height.\n3:30\nAnd we only that this works right now for a right triangle.\n3:34\nNow, let's think about it for other types of triangles\n3:36\nthat aren't necessarily right triangles.\n3:38\nSo, here I have a kind of an arbitrary triangle ABC.\n3:42\nAnd to approach figuring out its area,\n3:45\nwhat I wanna do is just split this up into two right triangles.\n3:48\nSo what I'm gonna do is draw a perpendicular from B,\n3:52\nso I'm just gonna really, if this was, if this was an actual structure,\n3:55\nyou'll just literally drop something straight down from here,\n3:57\nand that line is going to be perpendicular\n3:58\nto this base right over here, to AC.\n4:01\nAnd let me call that point, let me call that point D.\n4:05\nAnd what's useful here is now we've constructed,\n4:07\nwe've turned that one triangle into two right triangles.\n4:11\nSo we can say that the area, let me write it this way,\n4:15\nwe can say the area of triangle ABC,\n4:18\nthat's what we wanna figure out.\n4:20\nIt's equal to the area of this character right here.\n4:24\nSo it's equal to the area of triangle ABD + the area of triangle,\n4:35\n+ the area of this magenta triangle.\n4:38\nSo, plus the area of BCD, of BCD.\n4:45\nAnd this is useful\n4:46\nbecause we know how to find the area of right triangles.\n4:48\nNow, obviously this is 90 degrees\n4:49\nand this is also going to be 90 degrees.\n4:51\nThe area of ABD is ? base * height.\n4:54\nSo it's going to be ? * the base, which is the length AD.\n4:59\nSo ? * AD, * the height, which is the length of BD right over here,\n5:05\nassuming that we can figure that out.\n5:07\nSo this * that length, so, BD.\n5:11\nSo that's the area of the blue triangle,\n5:13\nand I'll find the area of the magenta triangle.\n5:14\nWell, once again it's a right triangle.\n5:16\nIt's gonna be ?, let me do that in magenta.\n5:19\nLet me do that in magenta.\n5:20\nSo it's going to be ? * the length of this base right over here,\n5:25\nwhich is DC, the length of segment DC * the length of BD again.\n5:30\nNow, you can factor out a ?, we can factor out a ? BD\n5:39\nfrom both of these terms, ? BD.\n5:42\nSo you get ? BD * AD, we're left with AD,\n5:50\nand that's not the same shade of blue.\n5:53\nWe're left with AD + DC.\n6:02\nWe close the parenthesis.\n6:04\nAnd what is AD + DC?\n6:06\nAD is the length, that length.\n6:08\nAnd then DC is this length.\n6:10\nSo if you will add those two lengths, you get the length of AC.\n6:13\nSo this whole thing, this whole thing is the length AC.\n6:18\nSo, we're left with the area of ABC is equal to,\n6:22\nI'll use in a new color, it's equal to ?,\n6:26\nand I'll just switch the orders right over here.\n6:27\n? *, which I'm gonna write in that same color, * AC * BD.\n6:34\nNow, what is this again?\n6:38\nWell, this is now ? * the base, which is this AC, * the height,\n6:43\nwhich is BD.\n6:44\nSo that's pretty cool.\n6:45\nIt worked for right triangles, and it actually,\n6:46\nif we know the height of a triangle.\n6:48\nNow, this isn't one of the sides now.\n6:49\nFor a right triangle, it was one of the sides.\n6:51\nNow, for this arbitrary triangle, it isn't.\n6:53\nBut if we know it, the area of this triangle\n6:56\nis still ? * the base * the height.\n6:59\nNow, what about a triangle like this?\n7:02\nHow can we figure out its area?\n7:04\nWell, let's try doing the same thing.\n7:06\nLet's see if we can somehow,\n7:07\neither construct this out of right triangles,\n7:10\nor maybe out a right triangle of this\n7:12\nto make it into another right triangle.\n7:14\nAnd the easiest way to do that is,\n7:15\nwe could kind of just drop a rock from right over there.\n7:18\nAnd then this, and then where it kind of hits the ground\n7:21\nwould form a right angle.\n7:22\nAnd let's call this point D.\n7:24\nAnd what we care about, what we wanna find in this,\n7:27\nwhat we wanna find the area of,\n7:29\nwe wanna find the area of triangle ABC.\n7:32\nSo that's what we care about.\n7:34\nTriangle ABC is what we wanna find the area.\n7:36\nBut the area of triangle ABC is gonna be the area\n7:40\nof this larger right triangle that we've set up.\n7:42\nThat's gonna be this larger triangle.\n7:53\nMinus the area of this smaller one right over here.\n7:57\nSo, minus the area of ADC, of ADC.\n8:03\nSo I just, this blue one ADB, this is just the whole thing.\n8:07\nThis is the whole thing, just so we're clear of what we're talking about.\n8:11\nNow, what is the area of ADB.\n8:13\nWell, we know how to find the area of right triangles.\n8:16\nADB, the area of ADB is going to be, is going to be ? * our base,\n8:24\nwhich is DB, the length of segment DB * our height,\n8:30\nwhich is the length of AD.\n8:31\nTimes AD.\n8:34\nAnd then from that we wanna subtract the area of the smaller triangle.\n8:37\nSo that's gonne be ? * our base, which is DC,\n8:42\nthat's the length of our base, DC, * the length of our height,\n8:46\nwhich is AD, AD.\n8:49\nSo, here we can factor out a ?, and we can factor an AD.\n8:53\nA ?, and an AD, so let's do that.\n8:56\nSo we factor out a ? * AD.\n8:59\nAnd what's left inside is a DB - a DC.\n9:11\nLet me put the parenthesis in a white again.\n9:16\nWell, if you take the length, DB is the length of this whole thing.\n9:20\nYou subtract from that the length DC, you're gonna be left with CB.\n9:25\nSo this character right over here, this is C, this is CB.\n9:31\nAnd so the area of ABC is going to be equal to ? * CB,\n9:38\nI'm just switching the order of multiplication, with a yellow color.\n9:42\n? * CB * AD\n9:46\nNow, what is this?\n9:49\nOnce again, it's ? * our base * our height.\n9:54\nAnd once again the height in this case,\n9:56\n'cause it's not a right triangle, it's not one of the sides.\n10:00\nSomeone would have to give you that information.\n10:02\nYou'd have to figure out what this actual height is.\n10:05\nBut what's needed is,\n10:06\nin any form of triangle the area is ? base * height.\n10:09\nThe height is, kind of, if you have the sides of a right triangle,\n10:12\nit's easy to figure out.\n10:14\nFor these others, if it's not given,\n10:16\nyou might have to do it in some tricky way,\n10:18\nfigure out the height somehow.\n10:20\nBut anyway, I hope that you find that useful.",

    "question_type": "MCQ",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWe're told to plot these values on a number line.\n0:04\nAnd you see every one of these values have an\n0:06\nabsolute value sign.\n0:08\nSo let's take a little bit of a review of what absolute\n0:11\nvalue even is.\n0:18\nThe way I think about it, there's two ways\n0:19\nto think about it.\n0:21\nThe first way to think about it is, how far is\n0:23\nsomething from 0?\n0:25\nSo let me plot this negative 3 here.\n0:28\nSo let me do a number line.\n0:29\nThis isn't the number line for our actual answer, or to this\n0:33\ncommand-- plot these values on a number line.\n0:36\nI'm just first going to plot the numbers inside the\n0:38\nabsolute value sign, and then we're going to take the\n0:40\nabsolute value and plot those, just like they're\n0:42\nasking us to do.\n0:44\nSo on this number line, if this is 0, if we go to the\n0:47\nnegative, we're going to go to the left of 0.\n0:49\nSo this is negative 1, negative 2, negative 3.\n0:55\nNegative 3 sits right over there, so this is negative 3\n0:58\nright there.\n1:01\nThe absolute value of negative 3 is essentially saying, how\n1:04\nfar are you away from 0?\n1:07\nHow far is negative 3 from 0?\n1:10\nAnd you say, well, it's 1, 2, 3 away from 0.\n1:15\nSo you'd say that the absolute value of negative 3 is equal\n1:19\nto positive 3.\n1:22\nNow that's really the conceptual way to imagine\n1:25\nabsolute value.\n1:26\nHow far are you away from 0?\n1:31\nBut the easy way to calculate absolute value signs, if you\n1:34\ndon't care too much about the concept, is whether it's\n1:37\nnegative or positive, the absolute value of it's always\n1:40\ngoing to be positive.\n1:41\nAbsolute value of negative 3 is positive 3.\n1:44\nAbsolute value of positive 3 is still positive 3.\n1:47\nSo you're always going to get the positive version of the\n1:49\nnumber, so to speak.\n1:50\nBut conceptualy, you're just saying how far away\n1:53\nare you from 0.\n1:55\nSo let's do what they asked.\n1:56\nSo that first value, on this number line, so all of these\n2:01\nare absolute values.\n2:02\nSo they're all going to be positive values.\n2:03\nSo they're all going to be greater than 0.\n2:05\nSo let me draw my number line, like this.\n2:08\nI can do a straighter number line than that.\n2:10\nLet's see.\n2:11\nWell, that's a little bit straighter.\n2:14\nAnd let's say, if this is 0, this would be negative 1, then\n2:18\nyou'd have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n2:25\nI think that'll do the trick.\n2:26\nSo this first quantity here-- I'll do it in orange --the\n2:30\nabsolute value of negative 3, we just figured out, that is\n2:33\npositive 3.\n2:34\nSo I'll plot it right over there, positive 3.\n2:38\nThen this next value, right here, the absolute value of 7.\n2:43\nIf we look over here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n2:48\n7 is how far away from 0?\n2:50\nIt is 7 away from 0.\n2:53\nSo the absolute value of 7 is equal to 7.\n2:58\nSo you already see the pattern there.\n3:00\nIf it's negative, it just becomes positive.\n3:01\nIf it's already positive, it just equals itself.\n3:05\nSo plotting this value, I'll just place\n3:07\nit right over there.\n3:10\nSo the absolute value of 7 is 7.\n3:12\nAbsolute value of negative 3 is positive 3.\n3:16\nLet me mark out the 0 a little bit better, so you see\n3:20\nrelative to 0.\n3:22\nNow we have the absolute value of 8 minus 12.\n3:29\nWell, first of all, let's figure out what 8 minus 12 is.\n3:32\nSo if you take 12 away from 8, you're at negative 4.\n3:37\n12 less than 8 is negative 4.\n3:39\nAnd you can do that on a number line if you don't quite\n3:44\nremember how to do this.\n3:45\nBut if you, you know, if you take 8 away from 8, you're at\n3:49\n0, and then you take another one, you're at negative 1,\n3:51\nnegative 2, negative 3, all the way to negative 4.\n3:55\nSo this is equal to the absolute value of negative 4.\n3:59\nIf we just plot negative 4, we go 1, 2, 3, negative 4 is\n4:05\nright over there.\n4:06\nBut if we're taking its absolute value, we're saying\n4:09\nhow far is negative 4 from 0?\n4:11\nWell it's 4 away from 0.\n4:13\n1, 2, 3, 4.\n4:16\nSo this is equal to positive 4.\n4:18\nSo we'll plot it right here.\n4:20\nThis number line is the answer to this command up here.\n4:23\nSo the absolute value of 8 minus 12, which is negative 4,\n4:29\nis positive 4.\n4:31\nThen we have the absolute value of 0.\n4:37\nSo how far is 0 from 0?\n4:40\nWell, it's 0 away from 0.\n4:42\nThe absolute value of 0 is 0, so you can just plot it right\n4:47\nover there.\n4:48\nAnd we have one left.\n4:49\nLet me pick a suitable color here.\n4:53\nThe absolute value of 7 minus 2.\n4:59\nWell, 7 minus 2 is 5, so this is the same thing as the\n5:02\nabsolute value of 5.\n5:04\nHow far is 5 away from 0?\n5:06\nWell, it's just 5 away.\n5:08\nIt's almost, you know, too easy.\n5:10\nThat's what makes it confusing.\n5:11\nIf I were to plot 5, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n5:15\nIt is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 spaces from 0.\n5:18\nSo the absolute value of 5 is 5.\n5:21\nSo you plot it just like that.\n5:24\nSo conceptually, it's how far you are away from 0.\n5:27\nBut if you think about it in kind of just very simple\n5:29\nterms, if it's a negative number, it becomes a positive\n5:32\nversion of it.\n5:33\nIf it's a positive number already, it just equals itself\n5:35\nwhen you take the absolute value.",

probably following a loose sort of rule\n0:07\nthat goes something like this.\n0:09\nAdd new petals where there's gaps between old petals.\n0:12\nYou can try doing this precisely.\n0:14\nStart with some number of petals, say five,\n0:16\nthen add another layer in between.\n0:18\nBut the next layer, you have to add 10, then the next has 20.\n0:21\nThe inconvenient part of this is that you\n0:23\nhave to finish a layer before everything is even.\n0:25\nIdeally, you'd have a rule that just\n0:27\nlets you add petals until you get bored.\n0:29\nNow imagine you're a plant, and you\n0:31\nwant to grow in a way that spreads out\n0:32\nyour leaves to catch the most possible sunlight.\n0:35\nUnfortunately, and I hope I'm not\n0:37\npresuming too much in thinking that, as a plant,\n0:39\nyou're not very smart.\n0:41\nYou don't know how to add number to create a series,\n0:43\nyou don't know geometry and proportions,\n0:45\nand can't draw spirals, or rectangles, or slug cats.\n0:48\nBut maybe you could follow one simple rule.\n0:51\nBotanists have noticed that plants\n0:53\nseem to be fairly consistent when\n0:54\nit comes to the angle between one leaf and the next.\n0:57\nSo let's see what you could do with that.\n0:59\nSo you grow your first leaf, and if you didn't change angle\n1:01\nat all, then the next leaf you grow\n1:02\nwould be directly above it.\n1:04\nSo that's no good, because it blocks\n1:05\nall the light or something.\n1:06\nYou can go 180 degrees, to have the next leaf directly\n1:09\nopposite, which seems ideal.\n1:10\nOnly once you go 180 again, the third leaf\n1:12\nis right over the first.\n1:14\nIn fact, any fraction of a circle\n1:16\nwith a whole number as a base is going\n1:17\nto have complete overlap after that number of turns.\n1:20\nAnd unlike when you're doodling, as a plant\n1:22\nyou're not smart enough to see you've gone all the way around\n1:25\nand now should switch to adding things in between.\n1:27\nIf you try and postpone the overlap\n1:29\nby making the fraction really small,\n1:31\nyou just get a ton of overlap in the beginning,\n1:33\nand waste all this space, which is completely disastrous.\n1:36\nOr maybe other fractions are good.\n1:37\nThe kind that position leaves in a star like pattern.\n1:40\nIt will be a while before it overlaps,\n1:41\nand the leaves will be more evenly spaced in the meantime.\n1:45\nBut what if there were a fraction that\n1:46\nnever completely overlapped?\n1:48\nFor any rational fraction, eventually the star will close.\n1:51\nBut what if you used an irrational number?\n1:53\nThe kind of number that can't be expressed as a whole number\n1:56\nratio.\n1:56\nWhat if you used the most irrational number?\n1:59\nIf you think it sounds weird to say one irrational number is\n2:02\nmore irrational than another, well, you\n2:03\nmight want to become a number theorist.\n2:05\nIf you are a number theorist, you\n2:06\nmight tell us that phi is the most irrational number.\n2:09\nOr you might say, that's like saying, of all the integers,\n2:12\n1 is the integer-iest.\n2:13\nOr you might disagree completely.\n2:14\nBut anyway, phi.\n2:16\nIt's more than 1, but less than 2, more than 3/2,\n2:19\nless than 5/3.\n2:20\nGreater than 8/5, but 13/8 is too big.\n2:24\n21/13 is just a little too small,\n2:26\nand 34/21 is even closer, but too big, and so on.\n2:30\nEach pair of adjacent Fibonacci numbers\n2:33\ncreates a ratio that gets closer and closer\n2:35\nto Phi as the numbers increase.\n2:37\nThose are the same numbers on the sides of these squares.\n2:40\nNow stop being a number theorist,\n2:42\nand start being a plant again.\n2:44\nYou put your first leaf somewhere, and the second leaf\n2:46\nat an angle, which is one Phi-th of a circle.\n2:49\nWhich depending on whether you're\n2:50\ngoing one way or the other, could be about 222.5 degrees,\n2:54\nor about 137.5.\n2:56\nGreat, your second leaf is pretty far from the first,\n2:59\ngets lots of space in the sun.\n3:00\nAnd now let's add the next one a Phi-th of the circle away.\n3:03\nAnd again, and again.\n3:05\nYou can see how new leaves tend to pop up\n3:07\nin the spaces left between old leaves,\n3:09\nbut it never quite fills things evenly.\n3:11\nSo there's always room for one more leaf,\n3:13\nwithout having to do a whole new layer.\n3:15\nIt's very practical and as a plant you probably like this.\n3:18\nIt would also be a good way to give lots of room\n3:20\nto seed pods and petals and stuff.\n3:22\nAs a plant that follows this scheme,\n3:24\nyou'd be at an advantage.\n3:26\nWhere do spirals come in?\n3:28\nLet's doodle a pinecone using this same method.\n3:30\nBy the way, you can make your own phi angle-a-tron\n3:32\nby dog-earing a corner of your notebook.\n3:34\nIf you folded it so the edges of the line--\n3:36\nYou have 45 degrees plus 90, which is 135.\n3:40\nPretty close to 137.5.\n3:43\nIf you're careful, you can slip in a couple more degrees.\n3:45\nDetach your angle-a-tron and you're good to go.\n3:48\nAdd each new pine cone-y thing a phi angle around,\n3:50\nand make them a little farther out each time.\n3:53\nWhich you can keep track of by marking\n3:54\nthe distance on your angle-a-tron.\n3:56\nCheck it out!\n3:56\nThe spirals form by themselves.\n3:59\nAnd if we count the number of arms, look it's five and eight.\n4:02\nIf you're wondering why spirals would form,\n4:04\nand why always with Fibonacci numbers,\n4:06\nyou could morph back into a number theorist, or a geometer\n4:09\nor something.\n4:09\nBut here's just a little bit of intuition.\n4:11\nOne simple way to do a flower is to start\n4:13\nwith a certain number of petals, say five.\n4:15\nAnd when you go back around, add the next layer\n4:17\nclose to the first, but bigger.\n4:18\nEach layer adds five new petals and the five arms spiral out.\n4:22\nLooks pretty spiral-ey to me.\n4:23\nNow go back to phi.\n4:24\nYou put out three petals before you go back around.\n4:27\nAnd if I make them really wide, the next lap\n4:29\nadds three petals that overlap a bunch with the first,\n4:32\nand so on.\n4:33\nIf I started with skinnier petals though,\n4:35\nthe second time you go around it doesn't quite overlap so much.\n4:38\nAnd it takes eight petals before it goes around twice\n4:41\nand they overlap enough for you to see the spirals.\n4:43\nSo this time I get 8 and 13.\n4:45\nI mean none of the spirals are actually physically there\n4:48\non any of these plants, it's just the plant bits\n4:50\nare close enough that you can see the pattern.\n4:52\nSo all the plant needs to do to get awesome Fibonacci\n4:54\nnumbers of spirals, is add new bits at 137.5 degree angles.\n5:00\nThe rest takes care of itself.\n5:02\nThat the Fibonacci series is in so many things\n5:05\nreally says less about those things,\n5:07\nand more about mathematics.\n5:08\nI mean that's what mathematics is all about.\n5:10\nSimple rules, complex consequences.\n5:12\nA process so easy that even a plant can do it,\n5:14\ncan turn into these amazing structures all around us.\n5:18\nJust like a few simple postulates\n5:19\ncan give us an incredibly powerful geometry.\n5:22\nI mean that's all assuming that a plant can do it.\n5:24\nBut measuring the angles between plant bits,\n5:26\nyou can see they obviously do do it, somehow.\n5:28\nI mean, it's not like they have angle-trons,\n5:30\nbut plants have been around a long time,\n5:32\nand have had a lot of practice, so that probably\n5:34\nexplains everything.\n5:36\nAnd so we always get spirals of 5 and 8 on this flower, 5 and 8\n5:39\non this artichoke, 5 and 8 on this pine cone,\n5:41\neven this cauliflower has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-- um, anyway,\n5:47\nwe always get 1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-- Huh.\n5:51\nAnd 1, 2, 3, 4?\n5:54\nIt's easy to dismiss these as mutant anomalies,\n5:56\nbut just because they're different and unusual,\n5:58\ndoesn't mean we should ignore them.\n6:00\n4?\n6:00\n7?\n6:01\n11?\n6:02\nWhat could these numbers mean?\n6:04\nMaybe things aren't as simple as I thought.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nSo I've got this crazy discontinuous function here,\n0:03\nwhich we'll call f of x.\n0:05\nAnd my goal is to try to draw its derivative right over here.\n0:11\nSo what I'm going to need to think about\n0:13\nis the slope of the tangent line,\n0:15\nor the slope at each point in this curve,\n0:17\nand then try my best to draw that slope.\n0:21\nSo let's try to tackle it.\n0:23\nSo right over here at this point, the slope is positive.\n0:28\nAnd actually, it's a good bit positive.\n0:32\nAnd then as we get larger and larger x's, the slope\n0:34\nis still positive, but it's less positive-- and all the way up\n0:39\nto this point right over here, where it becomes 0.\n0:44\nSo let's see how I could draw that over here.\n0:46\nSo over here we know that the slope\n0:48\nmust be equal to 0-- right over here.\n0:50\nRemember over here, I'm going to try\n0:52\nto draw y is equal to f prime of x.\n0:58\nAnd I'm going to assume that this\n1:00\nis some type of a parabola.\n1:02\nAnd you'll learn shortly why I had to make that assumption.\n1:05\nBut let's say that, so let's see, here\n1:08\nthe slope is quite positive.\n1:10\nSo let's say the slope is right over here.\n1:13\nAnd then it gets less and less and less positive.\n1:15\nAnd I'll assume it does it in a linear fashion.\n1:17\nThat's why I had to assume that it's some type of a parabola.\n1:20\nSo it gets less and less and less positive.\n1:21\nNotice here, for example, the slope is still positive.\n1:26\nAnd so when you look at the derivative,\n1:29\nthe slope is still a positive value.\n1:31\nBut as we get larger and larger x's up to this point,\n1:34\nthe slope is getting less and less positive,\n1:36\nall the way to 0.\n1:37\nAnd then the slope is getting more and more negative.\n1:41\nAnd at this point, it seems like the slope is just as negative\n1:46\nas it was positive there.\n1:47\nSo at this point right over here,\n1:49\nthe slope is just as negative as it\n1:52\nwas positive right over there.\n1:54\nSo it seems like this would be a reasonable view\n1:58\nof the slope of the tangent line over this interval.\n2:04\nNow let's think about as we get to this point.\n2:07\nHere the slope seems constant.\n2:10\nOur slope is a constant positive value.\n2:13\nSo once again, our slope here is a constant positive line.\n2:17\nLet me be careful here because at this point,\n2:20\nour slope won't really be defined, because our slope,\n2:23\nyou could draw multiple tangent lines\n2:26\nat this little pointy point.\n2:28\nSo let me just draw a circle right over there.\n2:33\nBut then as we get right over here,\n2:34\nthe slope seems to be positive.\n2:40\nSo let's draw that.\n2:41\nThe slope seems to be positive, although it's\n2:45\nnot as positive as it was there.\n2:47\nSo the slope looks like it is-- I'm just trying to eyeball it--\n2:53\nso the slope is a constant positive this entire time.\n2:56\nWe have a line with a constant positive slope.\n2:59\nSo it might look something like this.\n3:02\nAnd let me make it clear what interval I am talking about.\n3:08\nI want these things to match up.\n3:11\nSo let me do my best.\n3:13\nSo this matches up to that.\n3:17\nThis matches up over here.\n3:21\nAnd we just said we have a constant positive slope.\n3:25\nSo let's say it looks something like that over this interval.\n3:30\nAnd then we look at this point right over here.\n3:32\nSo right at this point, our slope is going to be undefined.\n3:34\nThere's no way that you could find the slope over--\n3:36\nor this point of discontinuity.\n3:38\nBut then when we go over here, even\n3:39\nthough the value of our function has gone down,\n3:41\nwe still have a constant positive slope.\n3:43\nIn fact, the slope of this line looks\n3:45\nidentical to the slope of this line.\n3:47\nLet me do that in a different color.\n3:49\nThe slope of this line looks identical.\n3:51\nSo we're going to continue at that same slope.\n3:53\nIt was undefined at that point, but we're\n3:55\ngoing to continue at that same slope.\n3:59\nAnd once again, it's undefined here\n4:01\nat this point of discontinuity.\n4:03\nSo the slope will look something like that.\n4:06\nAnd then we go up here.\n4:07\nThe value of the function goes up,\n4:09\nbut now the function is flat.\n4:11\nSo the slope over that interval is 0.\n4:13\nThe slope over this interval, right over here, is 0.\n4:17\nSo we could say-- let me make it clear\n4:21\nwhat interval I'm talking about-- the slope\n4:24\nover this interval is 0.\n4:27\nAnd then finally, in this last section--\n4:32\nlet me do this in orange-- the slope becomes negative.\n4:37\nBut it's a constant negative.\n4:40\nAnd it seems actually a little bit more negative\n4:42\nthan these were positive.\n4:43\nSo I would draw it right over there.\n4:48\nSo it's a weird looking function.\n4:50\nBut the whole point of this video\n4:51\nis to give you an intuition for thinking about what\n4:53\nthe slope of this function might look like at any point.\n4:57\nAnd by doing so, we have essentially\n4:59\ndrawn the derivative over that interval.",

It could be\n4:21\njust this change in energy over time.\n4:23\nBut we'll learn, especially when we do quantum mechanics,\n4:25\nthat it all gets jumbled up as we start approaching the\n4:29\nscales or the size of an atom.\n4:31\nAnyway, I said this was an incorrect way of doing it.\n4:34\nWhat's the correct way?\n4:37\nSo it turns out-- this is a picture, not a picture really,\n4:40\nthis is also a depiction.\n4:42\nSo it's an interesting question, what I just said.\n4:44\nHow can you have a picture of an atom?\n4:47\nBecause is actually turns out that most wavelengths of\n4:49\nlight, especially the visible wavelengths of light, are much\n4:52\nlarger than the size of an atom.\n4:56\nEverything else we quote-unquote, observe in\n4:58\nlife, it's by reflected light.\n5:00\nBut all of a sudden when you're dealing with an atom,\n5:02\nreflected light you could almost view it as too big, or\n5:06\ntoo blunt of an instrument with which to observe an atom.\n5:09\nAnyway, this is a depiction of a helium atom.\n5:14\nA helium atom has two protons and two neutrons.\n5:18\nOr at least this helium atom has two\n5:19\nprotons and two neutrons.\n5:21\nAnd the way they depict it here in the nucleus, right\n5:24\nthere, maybe these are the two-- I'm assuming they're\n5:26\nusing red for proton and purple for neutron.\n5:32\nPurple seems like more of a neutral color.\n5:34\nAnd they're sitting at the center of this atom.\n5:39\nAnd then this whole haze around there, those are the\n5:42\ntwo electrons that helium has, or that at least\n5:45\nthis helium atom has.\n5:47\nMaybe you could gain or lose an electron.\n5:49\nBut these are the two electrons.\n5:50\nAnd you say, hey, Sal, how can two electrons be this blur\n5:55\nthat's kind of smeared around this atom.\n5:58\nAnd that's where it gets philosophically interesting.\n6:01\nSo you cannot describe an electron's path around a\n6:09\nnucleus with the traditional orbit idea that we've\n6:12\nencountered when we look at planets or if we just imagine\n6:16\nthings at kind of a larger scale.\n6:18\nIt turns out that an electron, you cannot know exactly its\n6:24\nmomentum and location at any given point in time.\n6:28\nAll you can know is a probability distribution of\n6:31\nwhere it is likely to be.\n6:33\nAnd the way they depicted this, black is a higher\n6:36\nprobability, so you're much more likely to find the\n6:39\nelectron here than you are here.\n6:42\nBut the electron really could be anywhere.\n6:43\nIt could even to be here, even though it's completely white\n6:46\nthere, with some very, very, very, very, very low\n6:49\nprobability.\n6:50\nAnd so this function of where an electron is, this is called\n6:55\nan orbital.\n6:56\nOrbital.\n6:57\nNot to be confused with orbit.\n7:00\nOrbital.\n7:02\nRemember, an orbit was something like this.\n7:05\nIt's like Venus going around the Sun.\n7:08\nSo it's very physically easy for us to imagine.\n7:12\nWhile an orbital is actually a mathematical probability\n7:16\nfunction that tells us where we're\n7:17\nlikely to find an electron.\n7:18\nWe'll deal a lot more with that when we cover quantum\n7:21\nmechanics, but that's not going to be in the scope of\n7:23\nthis kind of introductory set of chemistry lectures.\n7:26\nBut it's interesting, right?\n7:28\nAn electron's behavior is so bizarre at that scale that you\n7:32\ncan't-- I mean, to call it a particle is almost misleading.\n7:35\nIt is called a particle, but it's not a particle in the\n7:38\nsense that we're used to in our everyday life.\n7:40\nIt's this thing that you can't even say exactly where it is.\n7:45\nIt can be anywhere in this haze.\n7:47\nAnd we'll learn later that there are different shapes of\n7:49\nthe hazes is as we add more and more electrons to an atom.\n7:53\nBut to me, it starts to address philosophical issues\n7:57\nof what matter even is, or do the things we look at, how\n8:01\nreal are they?\n8:02\nOr how real are they, at least as we've defined reality?\n8:04\nAnyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.\n8:07\nBut the whole notion of electrons, protons, they're\n8:12\nall kind of predicated on this notion of charge.\n8:15\nAnd we've talked about it before when we learned about\n8:17\nCoulomb's law.\n8:18\nYou could review Coulomb's laws videos in the physics\n8:22\nplaylist. But the idea is that an electron\n8:27\nhas a negative charge.\n8:29\nA proton, sometimes written like that,\n8:31\nhas a positive charge.\n8:33\nAnd a neutron has no charge.\n8:37\nAnd so that's what was tempting about the original\n8:39\nmodel of an electron.\n8:42\nIf they say, OK, if this thing has positive charges, right?\n8:45\nSo let's say this is two neutrons and two protons.\n8:47\nLet's say it's a helium atom.\n8:48\nThen we'll have some positive charges here.\n8:51\nWe have some negative charges out here.\n8:54\nOpposite charges attract.\n8:56\nAnd so if these things had some velocity, enough\n9:03\nvelocity, they would orbit around this, just the way a\n9:08\nplanet will orbit around the Sun.\n9:10\nBut now we learn, even though this is partially true, that\n9:15\nthe further away an electron is from the nucleus, it does\n9:23\nhave more, it's true, potential energy.\n9:27\nIn that it will want to move towards the nucleus, but\n9:31\nbecause of all the mechanics at the quantum level, it won't\n9:34\njust do something simple like move in a path like that, like\n9:37\na comet would do around the Sun, it actually has this kind\n9:41\nof wave-like behavior, where it just has this probability\n9:43\nfunction that describes it.\n9:45\nBut the further away an orbital, it\n9:48\ndoes have more potential.\n9:50\nWe're going to go a lot more into that in future videos.\n9:53\nBut anyway, how do you recognize what an element is?\n9:56\nI've talked a lot about the philosophy and all of that,\n9:58\nbut how do I know that this is helium?\n10:00\nIs it by the number of neutrons it has?\n10:03\nIs it by the number of protons it has?\n10:05\nIs it by the number of electrons?\n10:07\nWell the answer is, it's by the number of protons.\n10:09\nSo if you know the number of protons in an element, you\n10:13\nknow what that element is.\n10:14\nAnd the number of protons, this is defined\n10:21\nas the atomic number.\n10:26\nNow, so let's say I said something has four protons.\n10:33\nHow do we know what it is?\n10:34\nWell if we haven't memorized it, we could look it up on the\n10:37\nperiodic table of elements, which we'll be dealing with a\n10:39\nlot in this playlist. And you'd say, oh, four protons,\n10:43\nthat is beryllium.\n10:45\nRight there.\n10:46\nAnd the atomic number is the number that you see up there.\n10:50\nAnd that' s literally the number of protons.\n10:52\nAnd that is what differentiates\n10:55\none atom from another.\n10:56\nIf you have fifteen protons, you're dealing with\n10:59\nphosphorus.\n11:00\nAnd all of a sudden, if you have seven protons, you're\n11:06\ndealing with nitrogen.\n11:07\nIf you have eight, you're dealing with oxygen.\n11:09\nThat is what defines the element.\n11:11\nNow, we'll talk in the future about what happens with charge\n11:15\nand all of that.\n11:17\nOr what happens when you gain or lose electrons.\n11:19\nBut that does not change what element you're dealing with.\n11:21\nAnd likewise, when you change the number of neutrons, that\n11:26\nalso does not change the element you're dealing with.\n11:30\nBut that leads to an obvious question of, well, how many\n11:32\nneutrons and electrons do you have?\n11:35\nWell, if an atom is charge-neutral, that means it\n11:43\nhas the same number of electrons.\n11:46\nSo let's say that I have carbon.\n11:52\nIts atomic number is six.\n11:53\nAnd let's say its mass number is twelve.\n12:00\nNow what does this mean?\n12:01\nAnd let me say further that this is a neutral particle.\n12:05\nThis is a neutral atom.\n12:07\nSo the atomic number for carbon is six.\n12:10\nThat tells us exactly how many protons it has.\n12:13\nSo if I were to draw a little model here, and this is in no\n12:16\nway an accurate model.\n12:17\nI'll draw six-- two, three, four, five, six\n12:21\nprotons in the center.\n12:23\nAnd the weight of these protons, each proton is one\n12:26\natomic mass unit, and we'll talk more about how that\n12:28\nrelates to kilograms. It's a very small\n12:31\nfraction of a kilogram.\n12:32\nRoughly I think it's 1.6 times 10 to the\n12:36\nminus 27th of a kilogram.\n12:38\nSo let's say each of these are one atomic mass unit, and\n12:45\nthat's approximately equal to, I think, 1.67 times 10 to the\n12:48\nminus 27 kilograms. This is a very small number.\n12:53\nIt's actually almost impossible to visualize.\n12:57\nAt least it is for me.\n12:58\nThis tells me the mass of the entire carbon atom, of this\n13:03\nparticular carbon atom.\n13:04\nAnd this can actually change from carbon\n13:05\natom to carbon atom.\n13:07\nAnd this is essentially the mass of all of the protons\n13:10\nplus all of the neutrons.\n13:12\nAnd each proton has an atomic mass of one, in atomic mass\n13:17\nunits, and each neutron has an atomic mass of\n13:20\none atomic mass unit.\n13:22\nSo this is really the number of protons plus\n13:28\nthe number of neutrons.\n13:33\nSo in this case we have six protons, so we must also have\n13:37\nsix neutrons.\n13:39\nSix neutrons plus six protons.\n13:42\nNow, where are the electrons?\n13:44\nWell, I said it's neutral, so the proton has an equal\n13:49\npositive charge as the electron's negative charge.\n13:51\nSo this is a neutral atom, and it has six protons, so it also\n13:55\nhas six electrons.\n13:56\nLet me draw that.\n13:57\nSo we said it has six neutrons in here.\n13:59\nOne, two, three, four, five, six.\n14:01\nSo that's the nucleus right there.\n14:04\nAnd then if we were to draw the electons-- well, I could\n14:09\ndraw it as a smear, but if we want to kind of visualize it a\n14:12\nlittle better, we could say, OK, there's going to be six\n14:13\nelectrons orbiting.\n14:15\nOne, two, three, four, five, six.\n14:18\nAnd they're going to be moving around in this unpredictable\n14:21\nway that we would have to describe with\n14:22\na probability function.\n14:24\nAnd so the interesting thing about it is, most of the mass\n14:30\nof an atom is sitting right in here.\n14:32\nI mean, you might notice that when people care about the\n14:34\nmass, when they care about the atomic mass number of an atom,\n14:40\nthey ignore the electrons.\n14:41\nAnd that's because the mass of a proton, one proton\n14:47\nmass-wise, is equal to 1,836 electons.\n14:52\nSo for thinking about the mass of an atom, for all basic\n14:58\npurposes, you can ignore the mass of an electron.\n15:01\nIt's really the mass of the nucleus that counts as the\n15:08\nmass of the atom.\n15:10\nNow, you might see this periodic table here, and you\n15:12\nsay, OK, they gave us the atomic number up there.\n15:15\nThe atomic number of oxygen is eight.\n15:18\nIt means it has eight protons.\n15:20\nThe atomic number of silicon is 14.\n15:22\nIt has 14 protons.\n15:24\nNow what is this right here?\n15:27\nLet's see, in carbon.\n15:28\nIn carbon they have this 12.0107.\n15:34\nThat is the atomic weight of carbon.\n15:36\nLet me write this.\n15:41\nAtomic weight of carbon.\n15:47\nThe atomic weight of carbon is 12.0107.\n15:56\nNow, what does that mean?\n15:57\nDoes that mean that carbon has six protons and then the\n16:03\nremainder, the remaining 6.0107 neutrons, it has kind\n16:09\nof this fraction of a neutron?\n16:11\nNo.\n16:12\nIt means if you were to average all the different\n16:16\nversions of carbon you find on the planet and you were to\n16:19\naverage the number of neutrons based on the quantity of the\n16:25\ndifferent types of carbon, this is the\n16:27\naverage you would get.\n16:28\nSo it turns out that carbon, the two major forms, the main\n16:32\none you'll find is carbon-12.\n16:35\nSo that's like this.\n16:36\nSo that has six protons and six neutrons.\n16:39\nAnd then another isotope of carbon.\n16:42\nNow an isotope is the same element with a different\n16:45\nnumber of neutrons.\n16:46\nAnother isotope of carbon is carbon-14, which is much more\n16:50\nscarce on the planet.\n16:52\nWe don't know how much in the universe, but on the planet.\n16:55\nNow, if you were to average these, not just a straight-up\n16:58\naverage, then you would get carbon-13 and then the atomic\n17:01\nweight would be 13, but you weight this one much higher\n17:04\nbecause this exists in much larger quantities on Earth.\n17:07\nI mean, this is pretty much all of the\n17:08\ncarbon that you see.\n17:09\nBut there's a little bit of this.\n17:10\nSo if you weight them appropriately, the average\n17:13\nbecomes this.\n17:14\nSo most of the carbon you'll find-- if you just found\n17:17\ncarbon someplace, on average its weight in atomic mass\n17:22\nunits is going to be 12.0107.\n17:27\nBut that idea of an isotope is an interesting one.\n17:29\nRemember, when you change the neutrons, you're not changing\n17:32\nthe actual, fundamental element.\n17:33\nYou're just getting a different isotope, a different\n17:36\nversion, of the element.\n17:37\nSo these two versions of carbon are both isotopes.\n17:41\nNow, I want to leave this video with what I think is\n17:43\nkind of the neatest idea behind atoms. And it's the\n17:46\nmost philosophically interesting things about them.\n17:49\nIt's that the relative size-- so, we have these electrons,\n17:54\nwhich represent very little of the mass of an atom.\n17:58\nIt's 1/2000 of the mass of an atom are the electrons.\n18:01\nAnd even those, it's hard to even describe them as\n18:04\nparticles, because you can't even tell me exactly where and\n18:08\nhow fast one of these particles is moving.\n18:11\nThey just have a probability function.\n18:12\nSo most of the atom is sitting inside the nucleus.\n18:16\nAnd this is the interesting thing.\n18:17\nIf you look at an atom on average, if you\n18:21\nsay this is my atom.\n18:23\nLet's say I had two atoms that are bonded to each other.\n18:26\nAnd I were to say, how much of this is actual stuff?\n18:29\nAnd when I say stuff, that's a very abstract concept, because\n18:32\nwe're talking about the nucleus, right?\n18:33\nBecause the nucleus is where all the\n18:34\nmass is, all the stuff.\n18:36\nIt turns out that it's actually an infinitesimally\n18:39\nsmall fraction of the volume of the atom where-- the volume\n18:44\nof the atom is hard to define, because the electron can\n18:45\npretty much be anywhere, but if you view the volume as\n18:48\nwhere you're most likely to find the electron, or with 90%\n18:52\nprobability you're likely to find the electron, then the\n18:55\nnucleus is, in a lot of cases and the way I think about it,\n18:59\nit's about 1/10,000 of the volume.\n19:01\nSo if you think about it, when you look at something, if you\n19:03\nlook at your hand or if you look at the wall or if you\n19:06\nlook at your computer, 99.999% of it is free space.\n19:14\nIt's nothing.\n19:15\nIt's vacuum.\n19:18\nIf you had ultra-small-- I guess we could call them\n19:20\nparticles or something-- most of them would pass straight\n19:23\nthrough whatever you look at.\n19:24\nSo it already starts to kind of\n19:26\nquestion our hold on reality.\n19:28\nWhat is there when, if-- and this is fact, this isn't\n19:32\ntheory right here-- that if you take anything down to the\n19:35\nbuilding blocks, down to the atomic level, most of the\n19:39\nspace of that kind of, quote-unquote object, is free\n19:43\nvacuum space.\n19:44\nYou could go straight through it if you could get down to\n19:46\nthat scale.\n19:47\nThis image of a helium atom, they say right here this is\n19:50\none femtometer.\n19:52\nRight?\n19:52\nOne femtometer.\n19:57\nThis is the scale of the nucleus of a\n20:00\nhelium atom, right?\n20:01\nOne femtometer.\n20:03\nThis is one angstrom, right?\n20:04\nAnd they say that equals 100,000 femtometers.\n20:06\nAnd just to get a sense of scale, one angstrom is 1 times\n20:10\n10 to the negative 10 meters, right?\n20:13\nSo the atom is roughly on the scale of an angstrom.\n20:15\nIn the case of helium, the nucleus is\n20:17\neven a smaller fraction.\n20:18\nIt's 1/100,000.\n20:20\nSo if you had-- let's say you had liquid helium, which you'd\n20:23\nhave to get very cold to get.\n20:25\nIf you're looking at that, most of it is free space.\n20:27\nIf you're looking at an iron bar, the great, great, great,\n20:30\ngreat, great, great majority of it is free space.\n20:33\nAnd we're not even talking about, maybe there's some free\n20:35\nspace inside the nucleus that we could talk\n20:37\nabout in the future.\n20:38\nBut to me, that just blows my mind that most things we look\n20:41\nat are not really solid.\n20:44\nThey're really just empty space, but they look solid\n20:47\nbecause of the way light reflects on them or the forces\n20:50\nthat repel us.\n20:51\nBut there really isn't something to touch there.\n20:55\nThat most of this right here is all free space.\n20:57\nI think I've said the word free space now, and I think\n21:00\nI'll leave further\n21:02\nmind-blowing to the next video.",

its-- I guess you\n0:08\ncould call it its smallest functional level and that's\n0:10\nthe nephron.\n0:11\nSo we're going to talk about the kidney and the nephron.\n0:16\nAnd I think you might already know the kidney.\n0:18\nWe have two of them.\n0:19\nThey're the organ that, I guess, is most famous for\n0:23\nproducing or allowing us to excrete waste.\n0:27\nBut part of that process, it also helps us maintain our\n0:32\nwater, the correct level, and actually the amount of salts\n0:36\nor electrolytes we have and our blood pressure, but I'll\n0:39\njust say maintain water.\n0:40\nAnd it also produces hormones and things, and I'm not going\n0:42\nto go into a lot of detail on that right now.\n0:45\nI really just want to focus on these first two to kind of\n0:48\njust understand the overview function of the kidney.\n0:52\nAnd most of us have two of these.\n0:54\nThey're kind of closer to our back on either sides of our\n0:57\nspine behind our liver.\n0:59\nAnd this is a zoomed-in version of it.\n1:02\nIf you're watching this in full screen, it's not going to\n1:04\nbe as big as this picture is, but we've sliced it so we can\n1:07\nsee what's going on inside the kidney.\n1:10\nJust to understand the different parts here, just\n1:15\nbecause it will actually be significant when we start\n1:17\ntalking about the functional units or the nephron within\n1:20\nthe kidney, this area right here from here to here, this\n1:24\nis called the renal cortex.\n1:28\nWhenever we talk about something with the kidney, if\n1:31\nyou see a renal anything, that's actually referring to\n1:34\nthe kidney.\n1:34\nSo this right here is a renal cortex, that\n1:36\nouter part right there.\n1:38\nAnd then this area right here, this is the renal medulla.\n1:44\nAnd medulla comes from middle.\n1:46\nSo you can almost view it as the middle of the kidney.\n1:52\nBesides just understanding these words, we're going to\n1:55\nsee that they actually play a very important role in this\n1:58\nactual filtration or this excretion of waste and this\n2:01\nability to not dump too much water or excrete too much\n2:05\nwater when we're trying to filter out our blood.\n2:09\nSo I've said before, and you might have heard it already\n2:11\nfrom other lectures or from other teachers, that the\n2:14\nfunctional unit of the kidney is the nephron.\n2:22\nAnd the reason why it's called a functional unit-- I'll put\n2:25\nit in quotes-- is because that's the level at which\n2:28\nthese two things are happening.\n2:30\nThe two major functions of the kidney: the waste excretion\n2:32\nand the maintenance of the water level\n2:36\nin our blood system.\n2:37\nSo just to get an idea of how a nephron fits in within this\n2:41\npicture of a kidney-- I got this picture from Wikipedia.\n2:45\nThe artist tried to draw a couple of nephrons over here.\n2:48\nSo a nephron will look something like this, and it\n2:50\ndips down into the medulla, and then it goes back into the\n2:53\ncortex, and then it dumps into collecting ducts, and\n2:56\nessentially the fluid will end up in the ureters right here\n2:59\nand end up in our urinary bladder that we can later\n3:02\nexcrete when we find a suitable time.\n3:05\nBut that's about-- I guess you can imagine\n3:07\nthe length of a nephron.\n3:10\nThis is where it starts and then it dips down again.\n3:13\nSo multiple nephrons are going to keep doing that, but\n3:14\nthey're super thin.\n3:15\nThese tubes or these tubules, maybe I should\n3:18\nsay, are super thin.\n3:20\nYour average kidney will contain on the order of one\n3:26\nmillion nephrons.\n3:31\nYou can't really say, my nephrons are microscopic.\n3:34\nThey kind of have a-- at least their length when they dip\n3:39\ndown, you can say, I can see that distance.\n3:41\nYou can still jam a lot of them inside of one kidney.\n3:45\nWith that said, let's actually figure out how a nephron\n3:49\nfilters the blood and actually makes sure that not too much\n3:52\nwater or not too much of the good stuff in our blood ends\n3:56\nup the urine.\n3:58\nSo let me draw here a nephron.\n4:04\nSo I'm going to start like this.\n4:07\nWe'll start with the blood flow.\n4:08\nSo the blood's going to come in an arterial-- that's an\n4:13\narterial capillary, you could say.\n4:15\nSo it's going to come in like that.\n4:17\nThis is actually called the afferent arterial.\n4:21\nYou don't have to know the names, but you\n4:23\nmight see that sometime.\n4:26\nBlood is coming in.\n4:28\nThen it goes into this big windy place.\n4:32\nIt really winds around like that.\n4:34\nThis is called the glomerulus.\n4:43\nAnd then it leaves via the efferent arterial.\n4:57\nEfferent just means away from the center.\n4:58\nAfferent towards, efferent away from the center.\n5:02\nAnd I'll talk about it more in the future, but it's\n5:04\ninteresting that we're still dealing with an\n5:05\nartery at this point.\n5:07\nIt's still oxygenated blood.\n5:08\nNormally, when we leave a capillary system like the\n5:12\nglomerulus right there, we're normally dealing with the\n5:14\nvenous system, but here we're still an arterial system.\n5:18\nAnd it's probably because arterial systems have higher\n5:21\nblood pressure, and what we need to do is we need to\n5:22\nsqueeze fluid and stuff that's dissolved in the fluid out of\n5:28\nthe blood and in the glomerulus right here.\n5:30\nSo this glomerulus is very porous and it's surrounded by\n5:35\nother cells.\n5:37\nThis is kind of a cross-section.\n5:44\nIt's surrounded like that by this structure, and these are\n5:49\ncells here so you can imagine these are all cells over here.\n5:53\nAnd, of course, the actual capillaries have cells that\n5:56\nline them so there are cells here.\n5:58\nSo when I draw these lines, these lines are actually made\n6:01\nup of little cells.\n6:03\nWhat happens is the blood comes in\n6:04\nat really high pressure.\n6:05\nThis is very porous.\n6:06\nThese cells out here, they're called podocytes.\n6:10\nThey're a little bit more selective in what gets\n6:11\nfiltered out, and essentially about a fifth of the fluid\n6:14\nthat's coming in ends up going into this space right here\n6:20\nthat's called the Bowman's space.\n6:22\nWell, actually, this whole thing is called\n6:23\nthe Bowman's capsule.\n6:28\nIt's a sphere with an opening in here that the capillary can\n6:30\nkind of wind around in, and the space right here, this is\n6:34\nthe Bowman's space.\n6:36\nIt's the space inside the Bowman's capsule, and the\n6:41\nwhole thing has cells.\n6:42\nAll these structures are obviously made-- or maybe not\n6:44\nso obviously-- they're made up of cells.\n6:46\nAnd so we end up having filtrate in it.\n6:48\nFiltrate is just the stuff that gets squeezed out.\n6:53\nWe can't call it urine just yet because there's a lot of\n6:56\nsteps that have to occur for it to earn the name urine.\n7:01\nSo it's only filtrate right now, and essentially what get\n7:04\nsqueezed out, I said it's about a fifth of the fluid,\n7:07\nand things that are easily dissolved in fluid, so small\n7:10\nions, sodium, maybe some small molecules like glucose, maybe\n7:16\nsome amino acids.\n7:19\nThere are tons of stuff in here, but this is\n7:21\njust to give an idea.\n7:22\nThe things that do not get filtered are things like red\n7:25\nblood cells or larger molecules, larger proteins.\n7:31\nThey will not get filtered.\n7:32\nIt's mainly the micromolecules that'll get filtered, that'll\n7:36\nbe part of this filtrate that shows up here\n7:40\nin the Bowman space.\n7:42\nNow, the rest of what the nephron does, the Bowman's\n7:45\ncapsule is kind of the beginning of the nephron, and\n7:46\njust to get an idea of our big picture of our kidney, let's\n7:51\nsay we're near an arterial.\n7:54\nThis is a Bowman's capsule right here.\n7:56\nIt looks something like that, and the whole nephron is going\n7:59\nto be convoluted like this.\n8:00\nIt's going to dip down into the medulla, and then come\n8:03\nback, and then it's going to eventually dump into a\n8:06\ncollecting duct, and I'll talk more about that.\n8:07\nSo what I've drawn just here, this is a zoomed-in version of\n8:12\nthat part right there.\n8:14\nNow what I want to do is zoom out a little bit because I'm\n8:16\ngoing to run out of space.\n8:17\nSo let me zoom out.\n8:19\nSo we had our arterial go in.\n8:23\nIt gets all bunched in the glomerulus, and then most of\n8:26\nthe blood leaves, but one-fifth of it gets\n8:30\nessentially filtered in to the Bowman's capsule.\n8:33\nThat's the Bowman's capsule right there.\n8:34\nI've just zoomed out a little bit.\n8:36\nSo we have our filtrate here.\n8:39\nMaybe I'll make it a little bit yellow.\n8:44\nThe filtrate that just comes out at this point, sometimes\n8:46\nit's called the glomerular filtrate because it's been\n8:49\nfiltered by the glomerulus, but it's also been filtered by\n8:52\nthose podocyte cells on the inside of\n8:55\nthe Bowman's capsule.\n8:56\nBut now it's ready to go to the proximal tubule.\n9:03\nLet me draw something like this.\n9:06\nAnd obviously, this is not exactly what it looks like,\n9:08\nbut it gives you the sense.\n9:09\nThis right here, this is the proximal tubule.\n9:17\nAnd it sounds like a very fancy word, but proximal just\n9:20\nmeans near and tubule, you can imagine, is just a small tube.\n9:23\nSo it's a small tube that's near the beginning.\n9:25\nThat's why it's called a proximal tubule.\n9:27\nAnd it has two parts.\n9:29\nThe whole thing is often called a\n9:31\nproximal convoluted tubule.\n9:35\nThat's because it's all convoluted.\n9:37\nThe way I've drawn it is all curvy.\n9:38\nAnd I just drew it curvy in two dimensions.\n9:40\nIt's actually curvy in three dimensions.\n9:43\nBut the reality is there's a curvy part and then there's a\n9:45\nstraight part near the end of the proximal tubule.\n9:48\nSo we'll call this whole thing the proximal tubule.\n9:50\nThis is the convoluted part.\n9:52\nThat's the straight part, but we don't\n9:53\nhave to get too picky.\n9:55\nBut the whole point of this part of the nephron-- and just\n9:59\nto remember where we are, we're now at this point of the\n10:02\nnephron right there-- the whole point is to start\n10:05\nreabsorbing some of the stuff that is in the filtrate that\n10:09\nwe don't want to lose.\n10:10\nWe don't want to lose glucose.\n10:11\nThat's hard-earned stuff that we ate that\n10:13\nwas good for energy.\n10:15\nWe don't want to lose necessarily as much sodium.\n10:18\nWe've seen in multiple videos that that's a useful ion to\n10:24\nhave around.\n10:24\nWe don't want to lose amino acids.\n10:26\nThose are useful for building up proteins and other things.\n10:30\nSo these are things we don't want to lose so we start\n10:32\nabsorbing them back.\n10:33\nI'll do a whole video on exactly how that happens, but\n10:35\nit's done actively.\n10:37\nSince we're using ATP, and just as a bit of a summary,\n10:40\nyou're using ATP to actually pump out the sodium and then\n10:43\nthat actually helps bring in the other things.\n10:45\nThat's just kind of a tidbit on what's happening.\n10:48\nSo we're reabsorbing, so just imagine what's happening.\n10:52\nYou have cells lining the proximal tubule right now.\n10:56\nAnd actually, they have little things that jut out.\n10:58\nI'll do a whole video on that because it's actually\n10:59\ninteresting.\n11:00\nSo you have cells out here.\n11:01\nOn the other side of the cells, you have an arterial\n11:04\nsystem, or a capillary system, I should say, actually.\n11:08\nSo let's say you have a capillary system here that is\n11:12\nvery close to the cells lining the proximal tubule, and so\n11:16\nthis stuff actually gets actively pumped, especially\n11:19\nthe sodium, but all of it, using energy, gets pumped back\n11:23\ninto the blood selectively, and maybe a\n11:24\nlittle bit of our water.\n11:25\nSo we're pumping back some sodium, some glucose, and\n11:32\nwe'll start pumping a little bit of the water back in\n11:34\nbecause we don't want to lose all of that water.\n11:36\nIf all of the water that was originally in the filtrate we\n11:38\nwere just leaving in our urine, we'd be excreting\n11:41\ngallons and gallons of water every day, which we do not\n11:44\nwant to do.\n11:45\nSo that's the whole point.\n11:46\nWe're starting the absorption process.\n11:49\nAnd then we'll enter the loop of Henle, and actually, this\n11:51\nis, in my mind, the most\n11:52\ninteresting part of the nephron.\n11:55\nSo we're entering the loop of Henle, and it dips down, and\n11:59\nthen comes back up.\n12:03\nAnd so most of the length of the nephron\n12:05\nis the loop of Henle.\n12:07\nAnd if I go back to this diagram right here, if I'm\n12:10\ntalking about the loop of Henle, I'm talking about this\n12:13\nwhole thing right there.\n12:15\nAnd you can see something interesting here.\n12:17\nIt crosses the border between the cortex, this light brown\n12:21\npart, and the renal medulla, this kind of reddish or orange\n12:24\npart right there, and it does that for a very good reason.\n12:27\nI'm going to draw it here.\n12:28\nSo let's say this is the dividing line right here.\n12:32\nThis right here was the cortex.\n12:35\nThis right here is the medulla.\n12:39\nSo the whole point-- well, there's two points\n12:42\nof the loop of Henle.\n12:48\nOne point is to make the renal medulla salty, and it does\n12:57\nthis by actively pumping out salts.\n13:00\nSo it actively pumps out salts, and it does that in the\n13:03\nascending part of the loop of Henle.\n13:06\nSo it actively pumps out salts: sodium, potassium,\n13:12\nchloride, or chlorine, I should say.\n13:14\nChlorine ions.\n13:17\nIt actively pumps out these salts right here to make the\n13:21\nentire medulla salty, or if we think about it in terms of\n13:27\nkind of osmosis, make it hypertonic.\n13:29\nYou have more solute out here than you have in the filtrate\n13:33\nthat's going through the tubules.\n13:36\nAnd it uses ATP to do this.\n13:37\nAll of this stuff requires ATP to actively pump against a\n13:39\nconcentration gradient.\n13:41\nSo this is salty and it's salty for a reason.\n13:46\nIt's not just to take back these salts from the filtrate,\n13:50\nalthough that's part of the reason, but by making this\n13:53\nsalty, the ascending part is only permeable to these salts\n13:57\nand these ions.\n13:59\nIt's not permeable to water.\n14:06\nThe descending part of the loop of Henle is only\n14:09\npermeable to water.\n14:13\nSo what's going to happen?\n14:14\nIf this is all salty because the ascending part is actively\n14:17\npumping out salt, what's going to happen to water as it goes\n14:21\ndown the descending loop?\n14:23\nWell, it's hypertonic out here.\n14:24\nWater will naturally want to go and kind of try to make the\n14:28\nconcentrations balance out.\n14:30\nI've done a whole video on that.\n14:31\nIt doesn't happen by magic.\n14:33\nAnd so the water will-- because this is hypertonic,\n14:36\nit's more salty, and this is only permeable to water, the\n14:39\nwater will leave the membrane on the descending part of the\n14:42\nloop of Henle right now.\n14:44\nAnd this is a major part of water reabsorption.\n14:48\nI've thought a lot about why don't we use ATP somehow to\n14:52\nactively pump water?\n14:54\nAnd the answer there is, there's no\n14:55\neasy way to do that.\n14:56\nBiological systems are good at using ATP to pump out ions,\n15:01\nbut it can't actively pump out water.\n15:03\nWater's kind of a hard thing for proteins to operate on.\n15:06\nSo the solution is to make it salty out here by pumping out\n15:09\nions and then water, if you make this porous only to\n15:12\nwater, water will naturally flow out.\n15:14\nSo this is a major mechanism of gaining back a lot of the\n15:18\nwater that gets filtered out up here.\n15:20\nAnd the reason why this is so long is to give time for this\n15:23\nwater to secrete out, and that's why it dips nice and\n15:27\npretty far down into this salty portion.\n15:31\nSo then we'll leave the loop of Henle and then we're almost\n15:34\ndone with the nephron.\n15:36\nThen we're in another convoluted tubule, and you\n15:38\nmight even guess the name of this convoluted tubule.\n15:41\nIf this was the proximal one, this is the distal one.\n15:44\nAnd actually, just to make my drawing correct, it actually\n15:47\npasses very close to the Bowman's capsule, so let me do\n15:51\nit in a different color.\n15:57\nThe distal convoluted tubule actually goes pretty close to\n16:01\nthe Bowman's capsule.\n16:03\nAnd once again, I've made it all convoluted in two\n16:06\ndimensions, but it's actually convoluted in three.\n16:07\nAnd it's not that long, but I just had to get over here and\n16:09\nI wanted to get over that point right there.\n16:11\nIt's called distal.\n16:12\nDistal is further away.\n16:14\nIt's convoluted and it's a tubule.\n16:16\nSo this right here is the distal convoluted tubule, and\n16:24\nhere we have more reabsorption: calcium, more\n16:27\nsodium reabsorption.\n16:28\nWe're just reabsorbing more things that we didn't want to\n16:31\nlose in the first place.\n16:32\nThere's a lot of things we could talk about what get\n16:34\nreabsorbed, but this is just the overview.\n16:36\nAnd we're also reabsorbing a little bit of more water.\n16:39\nBut then at the end right here, our\n16:41\nfiltrate has been processed.\n16:42\nA lot of the water's been taken out.\n16:44\nIt's a lot more concentrated.\n16:45\nWe've reabsorbed a lot of the salts,\n16:47\nelectrolytes that we want.\n16:49\nWe've reabsorbed the glucose and a lot of the amino acids.\n16:52\nEverything that we want, we've taken back.\n16:53\nWe've reabsorbed.\n16:55\nAnd so this is mainly waste products and water that we\n16:59\ndon't need anymore and then this gets dumped into\n17:01\ncollecting ducts.\n17:05\nAnd you can kind of view this as the trash chute of the\n17:07\nkidney, where multiple nephrons are going\n17:12\nto dump into this.\n17:13\nSo that might be the distal tubule of another nephron\n17:16\nright here and this is a collecting duct, which is just\n17:22\na tube that's collecting all the\n17:23\nbyproducts of the nephrons.\n17:27\nAnd the interesting thing is that the collecting duct\n17:28\nfurther goes into the medulla again.\n17:31\nIt goes into the medulla again to the salty part again.\n17:34\nSo if we're talking about the collecting duct, maybe the\n17:36\ncollecting duct's coming back into the medulla, collecting\n17:40\nall of the filtrate from the different nephrons.\n17:43\nAnd because it goes back through that super salty spot\n17:46\nin the medulla, we actually have four hormones called\n17:50\nanti-diarrhetic hormone that can dictate how porous this\n17:54\ncollecting tube is, and if it makes it very porous, it\n18:00\nallows more water to leave as we go to the medulla, because\n18:04\nthis is very salty, so the water will\n18:06\nleave if this is porous.\n18:07\nAnd when we do that, what that does is it makes the\n18:10\nfiltrate-- and we can maybe start calling it urine now--\n18:13\neven more concentrated so we lose even less water, and it\n18:17\nkeeps collecting, collecting, collecting until we end up\n18:19\nhere, and it leaves the kidney and goes via our ureters to\n18:23\nthe urinary bladder.\n18:25\nSo hopefully, you found that helpful.\n18:27\nI think the neatest thing here is just how we actively\n18:29\nreabsorb the water and how we-- well, actually, in my\n18:33\nmind, that is the neatest part in the loop of Henle.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nBut what I think about now is the if we're given some triangle,\n0:05\nand here we have triangle ABC\n0:06\nWhat are the medians of the triangle\n0:08\nand how do they relate to each other\n0:10\nand do they have some interesting properties,\n0:12\nand you might guess that they do\n0:13\nSo the median is, if we start at one of the vertices\n0:16\nso let's start at this one right over here\n0:18\nAnd then we bisect the opposite sides\n0:21\nSo this right here would be a median\n0:23\nAnd so it started there, and it bisects this side right over here\n0:26\nSo the length from B to let's call this D\n0:29\nis equal to the length from D to C\n0:32\nNow, let's do that with every side\n0:33\nI can draw a median over here, like that\n0:36\nSo, let's call this point E\n0:39\nSo the length from A to E\n0:40\nis going to be equal to the length from E to C\n0:44\nAlthough it's kind of a little lopsided,\n0:45\nbut that gets it pretty close\n0:47\nAnd then we're gonna draw another median\n0:48\nAnd I'm not gonna prove it in this video,\n0:50\nbut all the medians, and this is another neat thing, that, you know,\n0:53\nwhen you have three lines that will always intersect at one point,\n0:56\nthat all the medians do intersect at one point\n0:59\nThey all are concurrent\n1:00\nThey all hit one common point in the center\n1:03\nSo, let's draw it that way\n1:05\nI'm not gonna prove it in this video, so this length,\n1:07\nlet's call this point right over here F\n1:09\nSo this length right over here,\n1:11\nthis length right over there is equal to that length over there\n1:15\nAnd the point at which these medians intersect\n1:18\nis called the centroid, the centroid\n1:22\nAnd when you start studying physics,\n1:23\nif you're actually and this was a uniform triangle\n1:25\nand you were to throw it,\n1:26\nit would rotate around the centroid right over here\n1:30\nBut we'll study it geometrically for now\n1:32\nSo let's call this ten centroid well, we've already gone up to F\n1:35\nSo let's call this centroid G right over there\n1:38\nNow, what I wanna that by itself is neat that you have a centroid,\n1:42\nthat if you were to throw it, if it was a uniform mass,\n1:44\nit would rotate around the centroid\n1:45\nBut what's even neater about this,\n1:47\nis that we can see that we've divided this triangle\n1:49\ninto six smaller triangles\n1:51\nWhat's really cool,\n1:53\neven though these aren't congruent triangles necessarily,\n1:56\nbut they do have the same area\n1:58\nAnd that's what we're going to prove in this video\n2:01\nThat these six triangles all have the same area\n2:04\nNow, to start off, I'm just going to look at two\n2:07\nI'm gonna look at different pairs of triangles\n2:09\nSo let's look at let's look at these two triangles right over here\n2:12\nLet's look at those two triangles over here\n2:14\nAnd to show that those two have the same area,\n2:16\nwe're just going to invoke a very simple principle\n2:20\nSo, imagine rotating, just those two triangles over\n2:23\nSo just rotating, just those two triangles over\n2:26\nIt would look something like this\n2:28\nIt would look something like this\n2:30\nLet me try my best to draw it\n2:32\nWhere this would be point G I'll even try to color code it the same\n2:35\nthat is point G\n2:37\nThat is that side right over there\n2:39\nThis is point C\n2:41\nThis is point B, that is point B\n2:44\nAnd then this right over here\n2:46\nwould be the second part of that median right over there\n2:49\nThat over there would be point D\n2:51\nNow, we know and I didn't draw it I should, at nicely over here\n2:54\nWe know that this length is equal to this length right over here\n2:58\nAnd these two triangles, if we're starting to think about the area,\n3:00\nthey have the same base\n3:02\nAnd we know area\n3:04\nArea is equal to ? base * height\n3:07\nSo, they definitely have the same base\n3:09\nWhat about their heights?\n3:11\nWell, they also have the same heights\n3:12\nBoth of their heights, both of their height is exactly that tall\n3:17\nThey both have the same height\n3:19\nSo both of them have the same base\n3:20\nThey both have the same height\n3:22\nOn an ob on an obtuse triangle right here, the altitude sits outside of it\n3:26\nSo that might be a little kind *unclear 00:03:26 7*\n3:28\nSo if you have an obtuse triangle like that\n3:29\nI say obtuse cause this is more than 90 degrees\n3:32\nYour altitude, your height *unclear 00:03:33 4*\n3:34\nsit outside of the triangle, but that's okay\n3:36\nBoth of these triangles have the same base, and the same height,\n3:39\nso they must have the same area\n3:41\nSo if this one right here has area x,\n3:44\nthis one right here will have area x as well\n3:47\nAnd you can use the exact same logic to say, well, look\n3:50\nThis guy and this guy, they have the same base,\n3:53\nand they both have the same height\n3:56\nSo if this one right over here is of area y,\n3:59\nthen this one over here is also going to be of area y\n4:02\nThey will have the same area\n4:04\nAnd then finally,\n4:05\nwe could do the same thing for these two characters up here\n4:07\nThey both have the same base\n4:09\nThis was BF is equal to FA, and they both have the same height\n4:13\nWe drop an altitude like that\n4:15\nAnd so if we call this area, if we call this area right over here Z,\n4:19\nyou could call that area Z, as well\n4:21\nSo, so far, we've shown that we can divide this\n4:24\ninto three pairs of triangles that have the same area\n4:27\nBut we wanna now show that they all have the same area\n4:29\nAnd to do that, we can invoke this same principle,\n4:32\nbut we'll do it with different sets of triangles\n4:35\nSo now, let's look at triangle let's look at triangle BAE\n4:40\nLook at triangle BAE, triangle BAE\n4:45\nSo the area of triangle BAE,\n4:47\narea of BAE, is going to be equal to z + z + y\n4:54\nz + z + y\n4:56\nAnd let's look at the area of triangle BEC, BEC right over there\n5:03\nThat's going to be,\n5:04\nthis triangle right over here, is going to be x + x + y\n5:08\nSo the area of BEC is going to be x + x + y, but the same principle\n5:16\nThey both have the same base, and they both have the same height\n5:20\nWe could drop an altitude like this\n5:21\nThis one is obtuse, so that the altitude sits outside of it,\n5:24\nbut they have the exact same height\n5:26\nSo these two areas need to be equal to each other\n5:29\nSo you have Z, well, let me just add that up\n5:32\nNow you have 2z + y is going to be equal to,\n5:37\nis going to be equal to 2x + y\n5:42\n2x + y\n5:43\nSubtract y from both sides\n5:45\nYou get 2z is equal to 2x\n5:47\nDivide both sides by 2\n5:49\nYou get z is equal to x\n5:52\nAnd so we could say, we could write an x here, and an x there\n5:56\nSo we know that all of these will have the same area,\n5:58\nbut we still have to worry about these y's here\n6:00\nAnd to do that,\n6:01\nwe just have to kind of rotate the way that we look at it\n6:04\nAnd now look at triangle ADC\n6:08\nLet me do that in a different color\n6:10\nTriangle ADC, which I'm highlighting right over here\n6:14\nTriangle ADC, whose area, so the area of ADC is going to be 2y + x,\n6:22\nis equal to 2y + x\n6:25\nAnd then look at triangle let's see, what color have I not used yet\n6:29\nLet me use this green\n6:31\nTriangle ADB, triangle ADB\n6:37\nTriangle ADB is going to be equal to,\n6:41\nwell, you could say it's 2z + x,\n6:44\nbut we know that the z's are equal to x\n6:45\nIt's really just x + x + x\n6:47\nIt's really equal to ADB is equal to 3x\n6:50\nAnd we have the same idea here\n6:52\nADB has this base, which is the same as ADC's base,\n6:57\nand they both have the same height\n6:59\nWe can draw up an altitude like this,\n7:01\nwe can draw up an altitude like that\n7:02\nThey have the same height\n7:03\nWe're just invoking this principle over and over and over again\n7:06\nSo these things have to equal each other\n7:08\nSo we get 2y + x is equal to 3x, is equal to 3x\n7:15\nSubtract x from both sides\n7:17\nYou get 2y is equal to 2x, or, or y is equal to x\n7:25\nSo that's a really neat result\n7:26\nYou go from each of the vertices of a triangle to the opposite side,\n7:30\nand you bisect that opposite side, and you do that three times,\n7:33\nyou have three medians\n7:34\nThese lines are called medians, where they intersect as a centroid\n7:38\nYou know what's really cool is,\n7:39\nit divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nVoiceover: So let's talk a little bit about\n0:02\nhow we all came into being.\n0:04\nWhat we see right over here, this is a picture\n0:08\nof a sperm cell fusing with an egg cell.\n0:14\nSo that's a sperm cell and this is an egg cell\n0:17\nor we could call this an ovum.\n0:21\nAnd even this scene depicted right over here,\n0:23\nthis is the end of an epic competition because\n0:28\nthis sperm cell is one of one of two to three\n0:30\nhundred million that is vying for this ovum.\n0:36\nSo there's two to three hundred million of these characters\n0:38\nand they're all vying for this ovum and the one\n0:43\nthat you see that's about to fuse for it,\n0:45\nthis is the winner of this incredibly -\n0:47\nremember two to three hundred,\n0:49\n200 million to 300 million sperm are trying to get here\n0:54\nso this is a major victory and to some degree\n0:57\nwe should all feel pretty good about ourselves\n1:00\nbecause we are all the by-product of that\n1:03\none in 200 to 300 million sperm cells\n1:07\nthat won this race getting to our mother's ovum.\n1:11\nSo the sperm cell came from our father and the egg cell,\n1:15\nthis is all happening inside of our mothers,\n1:18\nthe egg cell is from our mother.\n1:21\nNow, once this happens,\n1:22\nlet's talk a little bit about the terminology.\n1:24\nSo once these two fuse, or the process of them fusing,\n1:29\nwe call that fertilization.\n1:33\nFertilization.\n1:39\nAnd it produces a cell that then differentiates\n1:42\ninto all of the cells of our body,\n1:45\nso you can imagine that this is an important process.\n1:47\nSo let's make sure that we understand the different\n1:49\nterminology, the different words for the different things\n1:53\nthat are acting in this process.\n1:56\nSo each of these sex cells, I guess we could say,\n2:01\nthe sperm cell and the ovum, these are each called gametes.\n2:05\nSo this right over here is a gamete\n2:11\nand the ovum is a gamete,\n2:13\nthe egg cell is also a gamete.\n2:17\nAnd as we'll see, each gamete has half the number\n2:21\nof chromosomes as your body cells or most of\n2:26\nthe somatic cells of your body so outside of your sex cells\n2:30\nthat might be in your ovaries or your testes,\n2:35\ndepending on whether you're male or female,\n2:38\nthese have half the number\n2:40\nso let's dig a little bit deeper into what I mean there.\n2:43\nSo let's just do a blow up\n2:46\nof this sperm cell right over here,\n2:51\nso a blow up of a sperm cell and I'm not\n2:54\ngoing to draw it to scale, you see the sperm cell\n2:56\nis much smaller than the egg cell but just\n2:58\nto get a sense, so let me draw the nucleus\n3:01\nof this sperm cell, so just like that.\n3:05\nIf we're talking about a human being, and I'm assuming\n3:08\nyou are a human being, so that might be\n3:10\nof interest to you, this will have 23\n3:13\nchromosomes from your father so let's do them.\n3:16\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,\n3:18\n10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,\n3:22\n16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22\n3:25\nand for the 23rd one, that's going to be\n3:29\nyour sex-determining chromosome\n3:31\nso if your father contributes an x,\n3:34\nyou are going to be female,\n3:36\nif your father contributes a y,\n3:39\nyou are going to be male.\n3:42\nSo these are the chromosomes in\n3:44\nthe male gamete or I guess I should say the gamete\n3:47\nthat your father's contributing, the sperm.\n3:50\nSo this is a gamete right over here and that's going to\n3:53\nfuse with the egg, the ovum that your mother is contributing\n3:57\nand once again, I'm not drawing that to scale.\n4:00\nSo this is the egg, and let me draw it's nucleus.\n4:06\nSo that's it's nucleus, once again\n4:07\nnone of this is drawn to scale.\n4:09\nAnd your mother is also going to contribute 23 chromosomes.\n4:12\nSo one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,\n4:15\n10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,\n4:17\n16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22\n4:21\nand then she will contribute an x chromosome\n4:25\nfor the sex determining so your sex determining\n4:28\nchromosomes are going to be xy, you're going to be male,\n4:30\nif this was xx, you're going to be female\n4:33\nso this is also a gamete here.\n4:36\nSo a gamete is the general term for either a sperm or an egg.\n4:41\nNow once these two things are fused, what do we have?\n4:49\nOnce they're fused, then we're going to have\n4:53\nyou could say a fertilized egg\n4:55\nbut we are going to call that a zygote\n4:57\nso let me draw that.\n4:58\nI'm going to do this in a new color,\n5:00\nand I'm running out of space and I want this all to fit\n5:02\non the same screen so I'll draw it not quite at scale\n5:09\nand so let me draw the nucleus of the zygote,\n5:11\nI'm going to make the nucleus fairly large so that we can\n5:13\nfocus on the chromosomes in it,\n5:15\nonce again none of this is drawn to scale.\n5:17\nSo you're going to have the 23 chromosomes\n5:19\nfrom your father, so let me do that.\n5:22\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,\n5:28\n10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,\n5:31\n16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23,\n5:38\nand then the 23 chromosomes from your mother.\n5:40\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,\n5:48\n10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,\n5:53\n16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23\n6:02\nso you got that x chromosome from your mother.\n6:05\nAnd as you might have notice, I've drawn them in pairs\n6:08\nso you now have a total, let me make it clear,\n6:10\nyou have 23 chromosomes here,\n6:13\n23 chromosomes in the sperm,\n6:18\nyou have 23 chromosomes in the egg\n6:25\nand now you have 46 chromosomes in the fertilized egg,\n6:30\n46 chromosomes, and now that we have\n6:33\na full contingent of chromosomes\n6:36\nand then this cell can now keep replicating,\n6:39\nkeep splitting and differentiating into all of what\n6:41\nmakes you, you, we call this right over here,\n6:44\nwe call this a zygote.\n6:49\nSo one way to think about it, the gametes are the sex cells\n6:53\nthat have half the number of chromosomes\n6:55\nand the zygote is the cell that's now ready to differentiate\n6:58\ninto an actual organism that has double the number\n7:01\nor that has a full contingency of chromosomes,\n7:04\nthat has 46 chromosomes, and you see that\n7:07\nI've made them in pairs and these pairs,\n7:09\nwe call these homologous pairs\n7:11\nand in each of these pairs,\n7:12\nthis is a pair of homologous chromosomes.\n7:25\nSo what does that mean?\n7:26\nWell that means that in general, these two chromosomes,\n7:29\nyou got one from your father, one from your mother,\n7:32\nthey code for the same things, they code for the same\n7:36\nproteins but there are different variants of how they code\n7:39\nfor those proteins, those traits that you have\n7:43\nso gross oversimplification is,\n7:46\nlet's say that there is a gene on,\n7:52\nthat one from your father that helps code for hair color\n7:56\nwell there would be a similar,\n7:57\nthere would be another variant of that gene\n8:00\non the chromosome from your mother\n8:02\nthat helps code for hair color as well.\n8:05\nSo these are homologous chromosomes,\n8:06\nthese two chromosomes code, in general,\n8:10\nfor the same things and so the zygote now has,\n8:13\nyou could say it has 46 chromosomes or you could say\n8:16\nit has 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes.\n8:20\nAnd this is, once again, this is the case for human beings.\n8:23\nIf we're talking about some other species, instead of\n8:25\n23 pairs of homologous chromosomes or 46 chromosomes\n8:29\nin total, you might be talking about 10 pairs of\n8:31\nhomologous chromosomes with 20 chromosomes in general.\n8:36\nNow to help biologists, to help clarify when they're\n8:41\ntalking about the number of chromosomes for\n8:43\na given species, they introduce two words,\n8:46\nhaploid and diploid.\n8:49\nAnd haploid is referring to when you have half\n8:52\nthe full contingency of chromosomes.\n8:56\nSo for human beings, the haploid number is 23.\n9:01\nSo, this is the haploid number, it is 23.\n9:11\nFor another species it would be something else\n9:14\nand haploid is based on the prefix \"hapl\",\n9:18\nthat's the prefix for single, so you have a single member\n9:24\nI guess you could think of it,\n9:25\nof each of the pairs and now you have both\n9:29\nof each pair, you have both chromosomes in each\n9:32\npair or you have the full contingency and this 46 chromosomes,\n9:37\nthis is called the diploid number for humans.\n9:45\nThe diploid number right over here.\n9:47\nAnd when people talk in general, and we will speak in general\n9:49\nwhen we start talking about mitosis and meiosis\n9:52\nfor a given species they will refer to the haploid number,\n9:55\nthey will refer to the haploid number as n chromosomes\n9:59\nand they will refer to the diploid number as just twice that,\n10:01\nas two n chromosomes.\n10:04\nSo hopefully this gets you familiar with some of the vocabulary\n10:08\naround fertilization and haploid and diploid\n10:11\nand zygotes and gametes and also makes you feel\n10:14\na little bit better about yourself that, just to exist,\n10:17\nat least half of your chromosomes had to win\n10:20\nan incredibly competitive race.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] So in the last video,\n0:00\nI talked about 3-dimensional vector fields.\n0:03\nAnd I finished things off\n0:04\nwith a sort of identity function example\n0:06\nwhere at an input point x, y, z\n0:09\nthe output vector is also x, y, z.\n0:12\nAnd here, I want to go through\n0:13\na slightly more intricate example.\n0:16\nSo I'll go ahead and get rid of this vector field\n0:19\nand in this example,\n0:21\nthe x component of the output will be y times z.\n0:26\nThe y component of the output will be x times z.\n0:30\nAnd the z component of the output will be x times y.\n0:34\nSo I'll just show this vector field\n0:36\nand then we can start to get a feel for\n0:38\nhow the function that I just wrote\n0:40\nrelates to the vectors that you're seeing.\n0:42\nSo you see some of the vectors\n0:43\nare kind of pointing away from the origin.\n0:45\nSome are pointing in towards the origin.\n0:50\nSo how can we understand this vector field\n0:52\nin terms of the function itself?\n0:54\nAnd a good step is to just zero in\n0:55\non one of the components.\n0:57\nSo in this case, I'll choose the z component\n0:59\nof the output\n1:00\nwhich is made up of x times y\n1:03\nand kind of start to understand\n1:03\nwhat that should be.\n1:04\nThe z component will represent\n1:06\nhow much the vector's pointing up or down.\n1:08\nThis is the z axis\n1:10\nand the x-y plane here\n1:11\nso I'll point the z axis straight at our face.\n1:13\nThis is the x axis, this is the y axis.\n1:16\nThe values of x and y are going to completely determine\n1:18\nthat z component.\n1:20\nSo I'm going to go off to the side here\n1:21\nand just draw myself a little x-y plane for reference.\n1:25\nSo this is my x value,\n1:28\nthis is my y value.\n1:30\nAnd I want to understand the meaning\n1:31\nof the term \"x times y.\"\n1:35\nSo when both x and y are positive,\n1:37\nthe product is positive.\n1:39\nAnd when both of them are negative,\n1:40\nthe product is also positive.\n1:43\nIf x is negative and y is positive,\n1:45\nthe product is negative,\n1:46\nbut if x is positive and y is negative,\n1:48\nthe product is also negative.\n1:50\nSo what this should mean,\n1:51\nin terms of our vector field,\n1:52\nis that when we're in this first quadrant,\n1:54\nvectors tend to point up in the z direction,\n1:56\nsame over here in the third quadrant.\n1:59\nBut over in the other two\n1:59\nthey should tend to point down.\n2:01\nSo let's focus in on that first quadrant\n2:02\nand try to look at what's going on.\n2:04\nSo, you see like this vector here applies, this vector.\n2:07\nAnd all of them generally point upwards,\n2:09\nthey have a positive z component.\n2:11\nSo that seems in line with what we were predicting.\n2:13\nWhereas over here,\n2:13\nwhich corresponds to the fourth quadrant\n2:15\nof the x-y plane,\n2:16\nthe z component of each vector tends to be down.\n2:19\nAnd they're doing other things\n2:22\nin terms of the x and y components,\n2:23\nit's not just z component action,\n2:24\nbut right now we're just focusing on up and down.\n2:26\nAnd if you look over in the third quadrant,\n2:29\nthey tend to be pointing up,\n2:31\nand that corresponds to the fact\n2:32\nthat x times y will be positive.\n2:34\nAnd when you look at it,\n2:35\nit all starts to align that way.\n2:36\nAnd because I chose a rather symmetric function\n2:38\nyou could imagine doing this where you,\n2:40\nyou analyze also the y component here,\n2:43\nyou analyze the x component in terms of y and z,\n2:46\nand it's actually going to look very similar\n2:47\nfor understanding when the x component of a vector\n2:50\ntends to be positive,\n2:51\nlike up here,\n2:51\nor when it turns out to be negative,\n2:53\nlike over here,\n2:54\nand same with when the y component of the vector\n2:55\ntends to be negative,\n2:56\nor if the y component tends to be positive.\n2:58\nAnd overall, it's a very complicated image to look at,\n3:02\nbut you can slowly piece by piece get a feel for it.\n3:05\nAnd just like with 2-dimensional vector fields,\n3:07\nthe kind of neat thing to do\n3:08\nis imagine that this represents a fluid flow.\n3:11\nSo you imagine like maybe air around you,\n3:12\nflowing in towards the origin here,\n3:14\nflowing out away from the origin there,\n3:17\nit would kind of be rotating around here,\n3:19\nand later on in multi-variable calculus,\n3:21\nyou'll learn about various ways you can study\n3:23\njust the function itself and just the variables\n3:25\nand get a feel for how that fluid itself would behave,\n3:28\neven though it's a very complicated thing to think about,\n3:30\nit's even complicated to draw\n3:31\nor use graphic software with,\n3:33\nbut just with analytic tools,\n3:35\nyou can get very powerful results.\n3:38\nAnd these kind of things come up in physics all the time\n3:40\nbecause you're thinking in 3-dimensional space\n3:42\nand it doesn't just have to be fluid flow,\n3:44\nit could be a force field like an electric force field\n3:47\nor gravitational force field,\n3:48\nwhere each vector tells you\n3:49\nhow a particle tends to get pushed.\n3:52\nAnd as we continue on with multi-variable calculus,\n3:54\nyou'll get to see lots more examples.\n3:56\nBut hopefully this helps give a small feel\n3:57\nfor how you can go piece by piece\n3:59\nand understand something\n4:00\nthat's kind of a complicated expression.",

    "question_text": "Do the electrons in the 2s orbital ever have any probability of being in the 1st orbital?",
    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the last few videos we learned that\n0:02\nthe configuration of electrons in an atom\n0:05\naren't in a simple, classical,\n0:08\nNewtonian orbit configuration.\n0:10\nAnd that's the Bohr model of the electron.\n0:12\nAnd I'll keep reviewing it,\n0:13\njust because I think it's an important point.\n0:14\nIf that's the nucleus, remember,\n0:16\nit's just a tiny, tiny, tiny dot\n0:17\nif you think about the entire volume of the actual atom.\n0:21\nAnd instead of the electron being in orbits around it,\n0:24\nwhich would be how a planet orbits the sun.\n0:29\nInstead of being in orbits around it,\n0:31\nit's described by orbitals,\n0:33\nwhich are these probability density functions.\n0:36\nSo an orbital-- let's say that's the nucleus\n0:39\nit would describe,\n0:42\nif you took any point in space around the nucleus,\n0:45\nthe probability of finding the electron.\n0:48\nSo actually, in any volume of space around the nucleus,\n0:53\nit would tell you the probability\n0:54\nof finding the electron within that volume.\n0:56\nAnd so if you were to just take\n0:58\na bunch of snapshots of electrons\n1:00\n-- let's say in the 1s orbital.\n1:03\nAnd that's what the 1s orbital looks like.\n1:05\nYou can barely see it there,\n1:08\nbut it's a sphere around the nucleus,\n1:10\nand that's the lowest energy state that an electron can be in.\n1:14\nIf you were to just take a number of snapshots of electrons.\n1:16\nLet's say you were to take a number of snapshots of helium,\n1:21\nwhich has two electrons.\n1:22\nBoth of them are in the 1s orbital.\n1:25\nIt would look like this.\n1:26\nIf you took one snapshot, maybe it'll be there,\n1:28\nthe next snapshot, maybe the electron is there.\n1:30\nThen the electron is there.\n1:32\nThen the electron is there. Then it's there.\n1:34\nAnd if you kept doing the snapshots,\n1:35\nyou would have a bunch of them really close.\n1:37\nAnd then it gets a little bit sparser as you get out,\n1:40\nas you get further and further out away from the electron.\n1:44\nBut as you see, you're much more likely\n1:47\nto find the electron close to\n1:50\nthe center of the atom than further out.\n1:54\nAlthough you might have had an observation with the electron\n1:56\nsitting all the way out there, or sitting over here.\n1:58\nSo it really could have been anywhere,\n1:59\nbut if you take multiple observations,\n2:01\nyou'll see what that probability function is describing.\n2:04\nIt's saying look, there's a much lower probability of\n2:07\nfinding the electron out in this little cube of volume space\n2:11\nthan it is in this little cube of volume space.\n2:14\nAnd when you see these diagrams\n2:16\nthat draw this orbital like this.\n2:18\nLet's say they draw it like a shell, like a sphere.\n2:23\nAnd I'll try to make it look three-dimensional.\n2:25\nSo let's say this is the outside of it,\n2:27\nand the nucleus is sitting some place on the inside.\n2:29\nThey're just saying -- they just draw a cut-off\n2:32\n-- where can I find the electron 90% of the time?\n2:35\nSo they're saying, OK, I can find the electron\n2:36\n90% of the time within this circle,\n2:38\nif I were to do the cross-section.\n2:40\nBut every now and then the electron\n2:42\ncan show up outside of that, right?\n2:44\nBecause it's all probabilistic.\n2:45\nSo this can still happen.\n2:46\nYou can still find the electron\n2:47\nif this is the orbital we're talking about out here.\n2:51\nRight?\n2:52\nAnd then we, in the last video, we said,\n2:54\nOK, the electrons fill up the orbitals\n2:57\nfrom lowest energy state to high energy state.\n3:05\nYou could imagine it. If I'm playing Tetris--\n3:09\nwell I don't know if Tetris is the thing--\n3:10\nbut if I'm stacking cubes, I lay out cubes from low energy,\n3:14\nif this is the floor,\n3:15\nI put the first cube at the lowest energy state.\n3:17\nAnd let's say I could put the second cube\n3:21\nat a low energy state here.\n3:21\nBut I only have this much space to work with.\n3:27\nSo I have to put the third cube\n3:28\nat the next highest energy state.\n3:30\nIn this case our energy would\n3:32\nbe described as potential energy, right?\n3:34\nThis is just a classical, Newtonian physics example.\n3:36\nBut that's the same idea with electrons.\n3:39\nOnce I have two electrons in this 1s orbital\n3:44\n-- so let's say the electron configuration of helium is 1s2\n3:49\n-- the third electron I can't put there anymore,\n3:52\nbecause there's only room for two electrons.\n3:54\nThe way I think about it is these two electrons are now\n3:57\ngoing to repel the third one I want to add.\n3:59\nSo then I have to go to the 2s orbital.\n4:02\nAnd now if I were to plot the 2s orbital on top of this one,\n4:06\nit would look something like this,\n4:07\nwhere I have a high probability\n4:08\nof finding the electrons in this shell\n4:12\nthat's essentially around the 1s orbital, right?\n4:19\nSo right now, if maybe I'm dealing with lithium right now.\n4:23\nSo I only have one extra electron.\n4:24\nSo this one extra electron,\n4:25\nthat might be where I observed that extra electron.\n4:29\nBut every now and then it could show up there,\n4:31\nit could show up there, it could show up there,\n4:32\nbut the high probability is there.\n4:34\nSo when you say where is it going to be 90% of the time?\n4:37\nIt'll be like this shell that's around the center.\n4:39\nRemember, when it's three-dimensional\n4:40\nyou would kind of cover it up.\n4:42\nSo it would be this shell.\n4:42\nSo that's what they drew here.\n4:45\nThey do the 1s.\n4:47\nIt's just a red shell.\n4:49\nAnd then the 2s.\n4:50\nThe second energy shell is just this blue shell over it.\n4:53\nAnd you can see it a little bit better in, actually,\n4:55\nthe higher energy orbits, the higher energy shells,\n4:57\nwhere the seventh s energy shell is this red area.\n5:02\nThen you have the blue area, then the red, and the blue.\n5:04\nAnd so I think you get the idea\n5:05\nthat each of those are energy shells.\n5:07\nSo you kind of keep overlaying\n5:09\nthe s energy orbitals around each other.\n5:11\nBut you probably see this other stuff here.\n5:14\nAnd the general principle, remember,\n5:15\nis that the electrons fill up the orbital\n5:18\nfrom lowest energy orbital to higher energy orbital.\n5:21\nSo the first one that's filled up is the 1s.\n5:24\nThis is the 1.\n5:26\nThis is the s.\n5:27\nSo this is the 1s.\n5:28\nIt can fit two electrons.\n5:30\nThen the next one that's filled up is 2s.\n5:32\nIt can fill two more electrons.\n5:34\nAnd then the next one, and this is where it gets interesting,\n5:37\nyou fill up the 2p orbital.\n5:40\n2p orbital.\n5:42\nThat's this, right here.\n5:44\n2p orbitals.\n5:46\nAnd notice the p orbitals have something,\n5:49\np sub z, p sub x, p sub y.\n5:53\nWhat does that mean?\n5:55\nWell, if you look at the p-orbitals,\n5:57\nthey have these dumbbell shapes.\n5:58\nThey look a little unnatural, but I think in future videos\n6:00\nwe'll show you how they're analogous to standing waves.\n6:03\nBut if you look at these, there's three ways\n6:06\nthat you can configure these dumbbells.\n6:08\nOne in the z direction, up and down.\n6:09\nOne in the x direction, left or right.\n6:11\nAnd then one in the y direction,\n6:13\nthis way, forward and backwards, right?\n6:16\nAnd so if you were to draw--\n6:17\nlet's say you wanted to draw the p-orbitals.\n6:20\nSo this is what you fill next.\n6:22\nAnd actually, you fill one electron here,\n6:24\nanother electron here, then another electron there.\n6:26\nThen you fill another electron,\n6:28\nand we'll talk about spin and things like that in the future.\n6:30\nBut, there, there, and there.\n6:32\nAnd that's actually called Hund's rule.\n6:34\nMaybe I'll do a whole video on Hund's rule,\n6:36\nbut that's not relevant to a first-year chemistry lecture.\n6:39\nBut it fills in that order, and once again,\n6:42\nI want you to have the intuition of what this would look like.\n6:46\nLook.\n6:47\nI should put look in quotation marks,\n6:50\nbecause it's very abstract.\n6:52\nBut if you wanted to visualize the p orbitals--\n6:54\nlet's say we're looking at\n6:56\nthe electron configuration for, let's say, carbon.\n7:01\nSo the electron configuration for carbon,\n7:04\nthe first two electrons go into, so, 1s1, 1s2.\n7:09\nSo then it fills-- sorry, you can't see everything.\n7:13\nSo it fills the 1s2, so carbon's configuration.\n7:20\nIt fills 1s1 then 1s2.\n7:23\nAnd this is just the configuration for helium.\n7:26\nAnd then it goes to the second shell,\n7:28\nwhich is the second period, right?\n7:30\nThat's why it's called the periodic table.\n7:32\nWe'll talk about periods and groups in the future.\n7:34\nAnd then you go here.\n7:35\nSo this is filling the 2s.\n7:38\nWe're in the second period right here.\n7:40\nThat's the second period.\n7:41\nOne, two.\n7:43\nHave to go off, so you can see everything.\n7:45\nSo it fills these two.\n7:47\nSo 2s2.\n7:50\nAnd then it starts filling up the p orbitals.\n7:52\nSo then it starts filling 1p and then 2p.\n7:56\nAnd we're still on the second shell, so 2s2, 2p2.\n8:01\nSo the question is what would this look like\n8:04\nif we just wanted to visualize this orbital\n8:07\nright here, the p orbitals?\n8:08\nSo we have two electrons.\n8:11\nSo one electron is going to be in a-- Let's say if this is,\n8:14\nI'll try to draw some axes.\n8:16\nThat's too thin.\n8:20\nSo if I draw a three-dimensional volume kind of axes.\n8:28\nIf I were to make a bunch of observations of, say,\n8:30\none of the electrons in the p orbitals,\n8:33\nlet's say in the pz dimension,\n8:35\nsometimes it might be here, sometimes it might be there,\n8:38\nsometimes it might be there.\n8:39\nAnd then if you keep taking a bunch of observations,\n8:46\nyou're going to have something that looks like this bell shape,\n8:51\nthis barbell shape right there.\n8:53\nAnd then for the other electron\n8:55\nthat's maybe in the x direction,\n8:58\nyou make a bunch of observations.\n9:00\nLet me do it in a different,\n9:01\nin a noticeably different, color.\n9:03\nIt will look like this.\n9:04\nYou take a bunch of observations, and you say,\n9:06\nwow, it's a lot more likely to find that\n9:09\nelectron in kind of the dumbell, in that dumbbell shape.\n9:12\nBut you could find it out there.\n9:13\nYou could find it there.\n9:14\nYou could find it there.\n9:15\nThis is just a much higher probability of\n9:17\nfinding it in here than out here.\n9:19\nAnd that's the best way I can think of to visualize it.\n9:23\nNow what we were doing here,\n9:25\nthis is called an electron configuration.\n9:27\nAnd the way to do it-- and there's multiple ways that are\n9:30\ntaught in chemistry class, but the way I like to do it\n9:33\n-- is you take the periodic table and you say, these groups,\n9:40\nand when I say groups I mean the columns,\n9:42\nthese are going to fill the s subshell or the s orbitals.\n9:51\nYou can just write s up here, just right there.\n9:53\nThese over here are going to fill the p orbitals.\n9:59\nActually, let me take helium out of the picture.\n10:01\nThe p orbitals.\n10:03\nLet me just do that.\n10:04\nLet me take helium out of the picture.\n10:05\nThese take the p orbitals.\n10:07\nAnd actually, for the sake of figuring out these,\n10:09\nyou should take helium and throw it right over there.\n10:12\nRight?\n10:13\nThe periodic table is just a way\n10:14\nto organize things so it makes sense,\n10:16\nbut in terms of trying to figure out orbitals,\n10:18\nyou could take helium.\n10:19\nLet me do that.\n10:20\nThe magic of computers.\n10:22\nCut it out, and then let me paste it right over there.\n10:27\nRight?\n10:29\nAnd now you see that helium, you get 1s and then you get 2s,\n10:33\nso helium's configuration is\n10:34\n-- Sorry, you get 1s1, then 1s2.\n10:38\nWe're in the first energy shell.\n10:40\nRight?\n10:41\nSo the configuration of hydrogen is 1s1.\n10:50\nYou only have one electron\n10:52\nin the s subshell of the first energy shell.\n10:58\nThe configuration of helium is 1s2.\n11:02\nAnd then you start filling the second energy shell.\n11:06\nThe configuration of lithium is 1s2.\n11:12\nThat's where the first two electrons go.\n11:13\nAnd then the third one goes into 2s1, right?\n11:18\nAnd then I think you start to see the pattern.\n11:20\nAnd then when you go to nitrogen you say,\n11:24\nOK, it has three in the p sub-orbital.\n11:29\nSo you can almost start backwards, right?\n11:31\nSo we're in period two, right?\n11:36\nSo this is 2p3.\n11:39\nLet me write that down.\n11:40\nSo I could write that down first. 2p3.\n11:45\nSo that's where the last three electrons\n11:47\ngo into the p orbital.\n11:48\nThen it'll have these two that go into the 2s2 orbital.\n11:57\nAnd then the first two, or the electrons\n12:01\nin the lowest energy state, will be 1s2.\n12:06\nSo this is the electron configuration,\n12:07\nright here, of nitrogen.\n12:11\nAnd just to make sure you did your configuration right,\n12:15\nwhat you do is you count the number of electrons.\n12:17\nSo 2 plus 2 is 4 plus 3 is 7.\n12:20\nAnd we're talking about neutral atoms,\n12:22\nso the electrons should equal the number of protons.\n12:24\nThe atomic number is the number of protons.\n12:27\nSo we're good.\n12:28\nSeven protons. So this is, so far,\n12:30\nwhen we're dealing just with the s's and the p's,\n12:32\nthis is pretty straightforward.\n12:34\nAnd if I wanted to figure out the configuration of silicon,\n12:39\nright there, what is it?\n12:42\nWell, we're in the third period.\n12:43\nOne, two, three.\n12:46\nThat's just the third row.\n12:47\nAnd this is the p-block right here.\n12:50\nSo this is the second row in the p-block, right?\n12:52\nOne, two, three, four, five, six.\n12:54\nRight.\n12:56\nWe're in the second row of the p-block,\n12:57\nso we start off with 3p2.\n13:03\nAnd then we have 3s2.\n13:08\nAnd then it filled up all of this p-block over here.\n13:10\nSo it's 2p6.\n13:14\nAnd then here, 2s2.\n13:17\nAnd then, of course, it filled up at the first shell\n13:19\nbefore it could fill up these other shells.\n13:20\nSo, 1s2.\n13:21\nSo this is the electron configuration for silicon.\n13:26\nAnd we can confirm that we should have 14 electrons.\n13:29\n2 plus 2 is 4, plus 6 is 10.\n13:33\n10 plus 2 is 12 plus 2 more is 14.\n13:38\nSo we're good with silicon.\n13:40\nI think I'm running low on time right now,\n13:42\nso in the next video we'll start addressing what happens\n13:44\nwhen you go to these elements, or the d-block.\n13:47\nAnd you can kind of already guess what happens.\n13:50\nWe're going to start filling up these d orbitals here\n13:54\nthat have even more bizarre shapes.\n13:56\nAnd the way I think about this, not to waste too much time,\n13:59\nis that as you go further and further out from the nucleus,\n14:03\nthere's more space in between the lower energy orbitals\n14:06\nto fill in more of these bizarro-shaped orbitals.\n14:10\nBut these are kind of the balance --\n14:12\nI will talk about standing waves in the future\n14:14\n-- but these are kind of a balance between trying to\n14:16\nget close to the nucleus\n14:18\nand the proton and those positive charges,\n14:20\nbecause the electron charges are attracted to them,\n14:22\nwhile at the same time avoiding the other electron charges,\n14:25\nor at least their mass distribution functions.\n14:27\nAnyway, see you in the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's do a few more problems that bring together the\n0:03\nconcepts that we learned in the last two videos.\n0:05\nSo let's say we have the inequality 4x plus 3 is less\n0:11\nthan negative 1.\n0:12\nSo let's find all of the x's that satisfy this.\n0:16\nSo the first thing I'd like to do is get rid of this 3.\n0:18\nSo let's subtract 3 from both sides of this equation.\n0:23\nSo the left-hand side is just going to end up being 4x.\n0:27\nThese 3's cancel out.\n0:29\nThat just ends up with a zero.\n0:31\nNo reason to change the inequality just yet.\n0:33\nWe're just adding and subtracting from both sides,\n0:35\nin this case, subtracting.\n0:36\nThat doesn't change the inequality as long as we're\n0:38\nsubtracting the same value.\n0:40\nWe have negative 1 minus 3.\n0:43\nThat is negative 4.\n0:45\nNegative 1 minus 3 is negative 4.\n0:49\nAnd then we'll want to-- let's see, we can divide both sides\n0:53\nof this equation by 4.\n1:00\nOnce again, when you multiply or divide both sides of an\n1:02\ninequality by a positive number, it doesn't change the\n1:06\ninequality.\n1:06\nSo the left-hand side is just x.\n1:09\nx is less than negative 4 divided by 4 is negative 1.\n1:15\nx is less than negative 1.\n1:16\nOr we could write this in interval notation.\n1:19\nAll of the x's from negative infinity to negative 1, but\n1:24\nnot including negative 1, so we put a\n1:25\nparenthesis right there.\n1:27\nLet's do a slightly harder one.\n1:31\nLet's say we have 5x is greater than 8x plus 27.\n1:39\nSo let's get all our x's on the left-hand side, and the\n1:41\nbest way to do that is subtract 8x from both sides.\n1:45\nSo you subtract 8x from both sides.\n1:49\nThe left-hand side becomes 5x minus 8x.\n1:53\nThat's negative 3x.\n1:56\nWe still have a greater than sign.\n1:57\nWe're just adding or subtracting the same\n1:59\nquantities on both sides.\n2:01\nThese 8x's cancel out and you're just left with a 27.\n2:04\nSo you have negative 3x is greater than 27.\n2:08\nNow, to just turn this into an x, we want to divide both\n2:11\nsides by negative 3.\n2:12\nBut remember, when you multiply or divide both sides\n2:16\nof an inequality by a negative number, you swap the\n2:19\ninequality.\n2:20\nSo if we divide both sides of this by negative 3, we have to\n2:29\nswap this inequality.\n2:30\nIt will go from being a greater than sign\n2:33\nto a less than sign.\n2:36\nAnd just as a bit of a way that I remember greater than\n2:39\nis that the left-hand side just looks bigger.\n2:41\nThis is greater than.\n2:42\nIf you just imagine this height, that height is greater\n2:45\nthan that height right there, which is just a point.\n2:48\nI don't know if that confuses you or not.\n2:49\nThis is less than.\n2:50\nThis little point is less than the\n2:53\ndistance of that big opening.\n2:55\nThat's how I remember it.\n2:56\nBut anyway, 3x over negative 3.\n3:00\nSo now that we divided both sides by a negative number, by\n3:04\nnegative 3, we swapped the inequality from greater than\n3:07\nto less than.\n3:08\nAnd the left-hand side, the negative 3's cancel out.\n3:11\nYou get x is less than 27 over negative 3,\n3:16\nwhich is negative 9.\n3:18\nOr in interval notation, it would be everything from\n3:21\nnegative infinity to negative 9, not including negative 9.\n3:26\nIf you wanted to do it as a number line, it\n3:29\nwould look like this.\n3:31\nThis would be negative 9, maybe this would be negative\n3:35\n8, maybe this would be negative 10.\n3:37\nYou would start at negative 9, not included, because we don't\n3:40\nhave an equal sign here, and you go everything less than\n3:44\nthat, all the way down, as we see, to negative infinity.\n3:47\nLet's do a nice, hairy problem.\n3:52\nSo let's say we have 8x minus 5 times 4x plus 1 is greater\n4:05\nthan or equal to negative 1 plus 2 times 4x minus 3.\n4:12\nNow, this might seem very daunting, but if we just\n4:14\nsimplify it step by step, you'll see it's no harder than\n4:17\nany of the other problems we've tackled.\n4:20\nSo let's just simplify this.\n4:21\nYou get 8x minus-- let's distribute this negative 5.\n4:26\nSo let me say 8x, and then distribute the negative 5.\n4:29\nNegative 5 times 4x is negative 20x.\n4:33\nNegative 5-- when I say negative 5, I'm talking about\n4:35\nthis whole thing.\n4:36\nNegative 5 times 1 is negative 5, and then that's going to be\n4:42\ngreater than or equal to negative 1 plus\n4:45\n2 times 4x is 8x.\n4:48\n2 times negative 3 is negative 6.\n4:51\nAnd now we can merge these two terms. 8x minus 20x is\n4:56\nnegative 12x minus 5 is greater than or equal to-- we\n5:04\ncan merge these constant terms. Negative 1 minus 6,\n5:10\nthat's negative 7, and then we have this plus 8x left over.\n5:16\nNow, I like to get all my x terms on the left-hand side,\n5:18\nso let's subtract 8x from both sides of this equation.\n5:30\nI'm subtracting 8x.\n5:32\nThis left-hand side, negative 12 minus 8,\n5:34\nthat's negative 20.\n5:36\nNegative 20x minus 5.\n5:41\nOnce again, no reason to change the\n5:42\ninequality just yet.\n5:44\nAll we're doing is simplifying the sides, or adding and\n5:46\nsubtracting from them.\n5:48\nThe right-hand side becomes-- this thing cancels out, 8x\n5:53\nminus 8x, that's 0.\n5:54\nSo you're just left with a negative 7.\n5:57\nAnd now I want to get rid of this negative 5.\n5:59\nSo let's add 5 to both sides of this equation.\n6:06\nThe left-hand side, you're just left with a negative 20x.\n6:12\nThese 5's cancel out.\n6:14\nNo reason to change the inequality just yet.\n6:17\nNegative 7 plus 5, that's negative 2.\n6:22\nNow, we're at an interesting point.\n6:23\nWe have negative 20x is greater than or equal to\n6:26\nnegative 2.\n6:28\nIf this was an equation, or really any type of an\n6:31\ninequality, we want to divide both sides by negative 20.\n6:33\nBut we have to remember, when you multiply or divide both\n6:36\nsides of an inequality by a negative number, you have to\n6:39\nswap the inequality.\n6:40\nSo let's remember that.\n6:42\nSo if we divide this side by negative 20 and we divide this\n6:46\nside by negative 20, all I did is took both of these sides\n6:50\ndivided by negative 20, we have to swap the inequality.\n6:54\nThe greater than or equal to has to become a less than or\n6:58\nequal sign.\n6:59\nAnd, of course, these cancel out, and you get x is less\n7:03\nthan or equal to-- the negatives cancel\n7:05\nout-- 2/20 is 1/10.\n7:10\nIf we were writing it in interval notation, the upper\n7:13\nbound would be 1/10.\n7:15\nNotice, we're including it, because we have an equal sign,\n7:18\nless than or equal, so we're including 1/10, and we're\n7:22\ngoing to go all the way down to negative infinity,\n7:24\neverything less than or equal to 1/10.\n7:27\nThis is just another way of writing that.\n7:29\nAnd just for fun, let's draw the number line.\n7:33\nLet's draw the number line right here.\n7:35\nThis is maybe 0, that is 1.\n7:38\n1/10 might be over here.\n7:42\nEverything less than or equal to 1/10.\n7:45\nSo we're going to include the 1/10 and everything less than\n7:51\nthat is included in the solution set.\n7:54\nAnd you could try out any value less than 1/10 and\n7:56\nverify that it will satisfy this inequality.",

3,\n0:44\nwell then y is going to be -3.\n0:46\nWhen x is, let me try x = 2, because then 1/2 x 2\n0:50\nis just gonna be 1.\n0:52\nSo when x = 2, you're going to have\n0:55\n1/2 x 2 = 1, -3 is -2.\n1:00\nWhen x is equal to, let's try 4.\n1:04\nSo 1/2 x 4 is 2, and then -3 is -1,\n1:12\nand we could keep going but actually\n1:14\nall we need is two points for a line.\n1:16\nSo we're ready to plot this line if we'd like.\n1:18\nThe point 0, -3 is on this line.\n1:22\n0, -3 and actually let me do this in a slightly darker color\n1:25\nso that we can see it on this white background.\n1:27\n0, -3 is on the line, 2, -2 is on the line.\n1:32\nSo 2, -2 and then we have 4, -1.\n1:38\nSo when x is 4, y is -1,\n1:42\nand I could draw a line that connects all of these\n1:47\nso it would look something like...\n1:49\nIf I, let's see if I could do this.\n1:51\nIt would look something like,\n1:54\nit would something like, like that.\n1:59\nSo this right over here, this is literally,\n2:01\nthis is the graph of y = 1/2x - 3.\n2:09\nNow when we look at a graph like this\n2:11\nan interesting thing that we might want to ask ourself\n2:13\nis where does the graph intersect our axes?\n2:18\nSo first we can say, well where does\n2:19\nin intersect our x-axis?\n2:22\nWhen you look at this, it looks like\n2:23\nit happens at this point right over here.\n2:26\nThis point where a graph intersects an axes\n2:30\nthis is called an intercept.\n2:31\nThis one in particular is called the x-intercept.\n2:35\nWhy is it called the x-intercept?\n2:37\nBecause that's where the graph\n2:38\nis intersecting the x-axis\n2:41\nand the x-intercept, it looks like\n2:44\nthis is at the .6, 0.\n2:47\nNow it's very interesting, the x-intercept\n2:49\nhappens when y = 0.\n2:51\nRemember, you're on the x-axis when\n2:53\nyou haven't moved up or down from that axis\n2:56\nwhich means y = 0.\n2:58\nSo your x-intercept happens at x = 6, y = 0.\n3:02\nIt's this coordinate.\n3:04\nNow what about the y-intercept?\n3:06\nWell the y-intercept is this point right over here.\n3:08\nThis is where you intersect or I guess\n3:10\nyou could say intercept the y-axis.\n3:13\nSo this right over here, that over there\n3:16\nis the y-intercept.\n3:19\nThe y-intercept is at the coordinate\n3:21\nthat has a 0 for the x-coordinate.\n3:24\nX is 0 here and y is -3.\n3:27\nX is 0 and y is -3.\n3:30\nThis was actually one of the points,\n3:31\nor one of the pairs that we first tried out.\n3:36\nYou can validate that 6, 0 satisfies this equation\n3:40\nright over here.\n3:41\nIf x is 6, 1/2 x 6 is 3, -3 is indeed equal to 0.\n3:46\nSo now that we know what an x-intercept is,\n3:49\nit's the point where a graph intersects the x-axis\n3:52\nor intercepts the x-axis and the y-intercept\n3:54\nis the point where a graph intercepts the y-axis\n3:58\nor intersects the y-axis.\n4:00\nLet's try to see if we can find the x and y-intercepts\n4:01\nfor a few other linear equations.\n4:05\nSo let's say that I had the linear equation.\n4:09\nLet's say that I have 5x + 6y = 30.\n4:19\nI encourage you to pause this video,\n4:21\nand figure out what are the x and y-intercepts\n4:24\nfor the graph that represents the solutions,\n4:27\nall the xy pairs that satisfy this equation.\n4:31\nWell the easiest thing to do here,\n4:33\nlet's see what the y value is when x = 0\n4:38\nand what x value is when y = 0.\n4:42\nWhen x = 0 this becomes 6y = 30.\n4:46\nSo 6 times what is 30?\n4:48\nWell y would be equal to 5 here.\n4:50\nSo when x is 0, y is 5.\n4:54\nWhat about when y is 0?\n4:55\nWell when y is 0, that's going to be 0,\n4:57\nand you have 5x = 30.\n4:59\nWell then x would be equal to 6.\n5:02\nThen x would be equal to 6.\n5:05\nSo we could plot those points, 0, 5.\n5:08\nWhen x is 0, y is 5.\n5:12\nWhen x is 6, y is 0.\n5:16\nSo those are both points on this graph\n5:20\nand then the actual graph is going to,\n5:22\nor the actual line that represents the x and y pairs\n5:26\nthat satisfy this equation is going to look like,\n5:30\nit's going to look like this.\n5:32\nI'll just try.\n5:34\nSo I can make it go, it's going to look like...\n5:38\nIt's going to go through those two points.\n5:41\nSo it going to...I can make it go the other way too.\n5:44\nLet me see.\n5:45\nIt's going to go through those two points\n5:48\nand so it's going to look something like that.\n5:51\nNow what are its' x and y-intercepts?\n5:54\nWell, we already kind of figured it out\n5:55\nbut the intercepts themselves,\n5:56\nthese are the points on the graph where\n5:58\nthey intersect the axes.\n6:01\nSo this right over here, this is the y-intercept.\n6:03\nThat point is the y-intercept\n6:06\nand it happens, it's always going to happen\n6:08\nwhen x = 0, and when x = 0 we know that y = 5.\n6:13\nIt's that point, the point 0, 5.\n6:15\nAnd what is the y inter...what is the x-intercept?\n6:19\nThe x-intercept is the point, it's actually\n6:21\nthe same x-intercept for this equation right over here.\n6:25\nIt's the point 6, 0. That point right over there.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the last video we looked at a function\n0:02\nand tried to draw its derivative.\n0:04\nNow in this video, we're going to look at a function\n0:06\nand try to draw its antiderivative.\n0:10\nWhich sounds like a very fancy word,\n0:12\nbut it's just saying the antiderivative of a function\n0:16\nis a function whose derivative is that function.\n0:19\nSo for example, if we have f of x,\n0:22\nand let's say that the antiderivative of f of x\n0:33\nis capital F of x.\n0:35\nAnd this tends to be the notation, when you're\n0:37\ntalking about an antiderivative.\n0:39\nThis just means that the derivative\n0:45\nof capital F of x, which is equal to, you could say capital\n0:49\nf prime of x, is equal to f of x.\n0:54\nSo we're going to try to do here is, we have our f of x.\n0:57\nAnd we're going to try to think about what's\n0:59\na possible function that this could be the derivative of?\n1:01\nAnd you're going to study this in much more depth\n1:04\nwhen you start looking at integral calculus.\n1:06\nBut there's actually many possible functions\n1:09\nthat this could be the derivative of.\n1:11\nAnd our goal in this video is just\n1:12\nto draw a reasonable possibility.\n1:14\nSo let's think about it a little bit.\n1:16\nSo let's, over here on the top, draw\n1:18\ny is equal to capital F of x.\n1:22\nSo what we're going to try to draw\n1:23\nis a function where its derivative\n1:26\ncould look like this.\n1:28\nSo what we're essentially doing is,\n1:31\nwhen we go from what we're draw up here to this,\n1:33\nwe're taking the derivative.\n1:34\nSo let's think about what this function could look like.\n1:37\nSo when we look at this derivative,\n1:39\nit says over this interval over this first interval right\n1:42\nover here, let me do this in purple,\n1:44\nit says over this interval from x\n1:46\nis equal to 0 all the way to whatever value of x,\n1:50\nthis right over here, it says that the slope is\n1:53\na constant positive 1.\n1:56\nSo let me draw a line with a slope of a constant positive 1.\n2:00\nAnd I could shift that line up and down.\n2:02\nOnce again, there's many possible antiderivatives.\n2:05\nI will just pick a reasonable one.\n2:08\nSo I could have a line that looks something like this.\n2:16\nI want to draw a slope of positive 1 as best as I can.\n2:21\nSo let's say it looks something like this.\n2:24\nAnd I could make the function defined here or undefined here.\n2:27\nThe derivative is undefined at this point.\n2:30\nI could make the function defined or undefined\n2:32\nas I see fit.\n2:34\nThis will probably be a point of discontinuity\n2:36\non the original function.\n2:37\nIt doesn't have to be, but I'm just\n2:39\ntrying to draw a possible function.\n2:41\nSo let's actually just say it actually\n2:42\nis defined at that point right over there.\n2:44\nBut since this is going to be discontinuous,\n2:46\nthe derivative is going to be undefined at that point.\n2:49\nSo that's that first interval.\n2:51\nNow let's look at the second interval.\n2:52\nThe second interval, from where that first interval ended,\n2:55\nall the way to right over here.\n2:59\nThe derivative is a constant negative 2.\n3:03\nSo that means over here, I'm going\n3:04\nto have a line of constant negative slope,\n3:08\nor constant negative 2 slope.\n3:10\nSo it's going to be twice as steep as this one right\n3:13\nover here.\n3:14\nSo I actually could just draw it.\n3:16\nI could make it a continuous function,\n3:17\nI could just make a negative 2 slope, just like this.\n3:21\nAnd it looks like this interval is about half as long\n3:23\nas this interval.\n3:24\nSo it maybe gets to the exact same point.\n3:25\nSo it could look something-- let me\n3:29\ndraw it a little bit neater-- like this.\n3:39\nThe slope right over here is equal to 1,\n3:45\nwe see that right over there in the derivative.\n3:47\nAnd then the slope right over here is equal to negative 2.\n3:53\nWe see that in the derivative.\n3:56\nNow things get interesting.\n3:57\nOnce again, I could have shifted this blue line up and down.\n4:00\nI did not have to construct a continuous function like this.\n4:02\nBut I'm doing it just for fun.\n4:04\nThere's many possible antiderivatives\n4:06\nof this function.\n4:08\nNow what's going on over the next interval?\n4:14\nAnd I'll do it do it in orange.\n4:16\nThe slope starts off at a very high value.\n4:20\nIt starts off at positive 2.\n4:22\nThen it keeps decreasing, and it gets to 0, right over here.\n4:26\nThe slope gets to 0 right over there.\n4:29\nAnd then it starts becoming more and more and more\n4:32\nand more negative.\n4:33\nSo I'll just try to make this a continuous function, just\n4:36\nfor fun.\n4:36\nOnce again, it does not have to be.\n4:38\nSo over here the slope is very positive.\n4:40\nIt's a positive 2.\n4:41\nSo our slope is going to be like, this is negative 2,\n4:44\nso it's going to be a positive 2.\n4:46\nAnd then it gets more and more and more negative up to this,\n4:49\nor, it becomes less and less and less positive I should say.\n4:52\nEven here the slope is positive.\n4:54\nAnd it gets to 0 right over there.\n4:56\nSo maybe it gets to 0 maybe right over here.\n5:02\nAnd so what we have, we could have some type of a parabola.\n5:05\nSo the downward facing parabola.\n5:08\nSo notice, the slope is a very positive value.\n5:11\nIt's a positive 2 right over here,\n5:13\nthen it becomes less and less and less and less positive,\n5:17\nall the way to 0 right over there.\n5:19\nAnd then the slope starts turning negative.\n5:25\nAnd so our function could look something\n5:28\nlike that over the interval.\n5:29\nLet me draw it a little bit neater.\n5:33\nThis is symmetric.\n5:35\nHow ever positive our slope was here,\n5:36\nit's equally negative here.\n5:38\nSo our curve should probably be symmetric as well.\n5:41\nSo let me draw it like this over that interval.\n5:45\nIt could look like that.\n5:47\nAnd then finally, over this last interval,\n5:51\nor I guess we could say, it keeps going, our slope is 0.\n5:56\nAnd once again I don't have to draw a continuous function.\n5:59\nBut when the slope is 0, that just\n6:01\nmeans that I have a line with slope 0.\n6:04\nI have a horizontal line.\n6:05\nAnd I could draw that horizontal line up here, in which case\n6:09\nI'd have to say its discontinuous.\n6:11\nOr I could draw that horizontal line right over here,\n6:17\nand try to make my antiderivative\n6:19\na continuous function.\n6:20\nSo once again, I could have shifted any of these segments\n6:23\nup or down, and gotten the exact same derivative.\n6:25\nBut then I would not have gotten a continuous function\n6:28\nlike this.\n6:29\nBut we have been able to construct\n6:31\na possible antiderivative for f of x.\n6:34\nAnd just as a reminder, that's just saying this f of x is--\n6:37\nthe antiderivative is a function that f of x\n6:41\ncould be the derivative of.",

This is the deck right here.\n1:20\nThe rope attaches 15 feet away from the base of the mast.\n1:26\nSo if this is the base of the mast, we go 15 feet, might be\n1:29\nabout that distance right there.\n1:31\nLet me mark that.\n1:36\nAnd the rope attaches right here.\n1:37\nFrom the top of the mast all the way that base.\n1:40\nSo the rope goes like that.\n1:44\nAnd then they ask us, how long is the rope?\n1:48\nSo there's a few things you might realize.\n1:50\nWe're dealing with a triangle here.\n1:52\nAnd it's not any triangle.\n1:53\nWe're assuming that the mast goes straight up and that the\n1:57\ndeck is straight left and right.\n1:59\nSo this is a right triangle.\n2:00\nThis is a 90 degree angle right here.\n2:05\nAnd we know that, if we know two sides of a right triangle,\n2:08\nwe can always figure out the third side of a right triangle\n2:11\nusing the Pythagorean theorem.\n2:19\nAnd all that tells us is it the sum of the squares of the\n2:24\nshorter sides of the triangle are going to be equal to the\n2:27\nsquare of the longer side.\n2:29\nAnd that longer side is call the hypotenuse.\n2:36\nAnd in all cases, the hypotenuse is the side\n2:39\nopposite the 90 degree angle.\n2:40\nIt is always going to be the longest side\n2:42\nof our right triangle.\n2:44\nSo we need to figure out the hypotenuse here.\n2:46\nWe know the lengths of the two shorter sides.\n2:48\nSo we can see that if we take 15 squared, that's one of the\n2:54\nshort sides, I'm squaring it.\n2:56\nAnd then add that to the square of the other shorter\n2:59\nside, to 20 feet squared.\n3:01\nAnd when I say the shorter side, I mean relative to the\n3:03\nhypotenuse.\n3:04\nThe hypotenuse will always be the longest side.\n3:09\nLet's say the hypotenuse is in green just so we get our color\n3:12\ncoding nice.\n3:13\nThat is going to be equal to the rope squared.\n3:17\nOr the length of the rope.\n3:18\nLet's call this distance right here r.\n3:21\nr for rope.\n3:28\nSo 15 squared plus 20 squared is going to\n3:30\nbe equal to r squared.\n3:33\nAnd what's 15 squared?\n3:34\nIt's 225.\n3:37\n20 squared is 400.\n3:43\nAnd that's going to be equal to r squared.\n3:47\nNow 225 plus 400 is 625.\n3:52\n625 is equal to r squared.\n3:55\nAnd then we can take the principal root of both sides\n3:57\nof this equation.\n3:58\nBecause we're talking about distances, we want the\n4:00\npositive square root.\n4:01\nSo you take the positive square root, or the principal\n4:04\nroot, of both sides of this equation.\n4:07\nAnd you are left with r is equal to the\n4:10\nsquare root of 625.\n4:11\nYou can play with it a little bit if you like.\n4:13\nBut if you've ever played with numbers around 25, you'll see\n4:17\nthat this is 25 squared.\n4:20\nSo r is equal to the square root of 625, which is 25.\n4:25\nSo this distance right here, the length of the rope, is\n4:28\nequal to 25 feet.",

take the absolute value of negative 1.\n0:10\nWhat you're really doing is you're saying, how far is that\n0:13\nnumber from 0?\n0:16\nAnd in the case of negative 1, if we draw a number line right\n0:20\nthere-- that's a very badly drawn number line.\n0:23\nIf we draw a number line right there, that's 0.\n0:26\nYou have a negative 1 right there.\n0:28\nWell, it's 1 away from 0.\n0:30\nSo the absolute value of negative 1 is 1.\n0:33\nAnd the absolute value of 1 is also 1 away from 0.\n0:38\nIt's also equal to 1.\n0:40\nSo on some level, absolute value is the distance from 0.\n0:43\nBut another, I guess simpler way to think of it, it always\n0:46\nresults in the positive version of the number.\n0:48\nThe absolute value of negative 7,346 is equal to 7,346.\n0:59\nSo with that in mind, let's try to solve some equations\n1:02\nwith absolute values in them.\n1:05\nSo let's say I have the equation the absolute value of\n1:08\nx minus 5 is equal to 10.\n1:14\nAnd one way you can interpret this, and I want you to think\n1:16\nabout this, this is actually saying that the distance\n1:18\nbetween x and 5 is equal to 10.\n1:23\nSo how many numbers that are exactly 10 away from 5?\n1:26\nAnd you can already think of the solution to this equation,\n1:29\nbut I'll show you how to solve it systematically.\n1:31\nNow this is going to be true in two situations.\n1:36\nEither x minus 5 is equal to positive 10.\n1:41\nIf this evaluates out to positive 10, then when you\n1:44\ntake the absolute value of it, you're going to\n1:46\nget positive 10.\n1:48\nOr x minus 5 might evaluate to negative 10.\n1:53\nIf x minus 5 evaluated to negative 10, when you take the\n1:56\nabsolute value of it, you would get 10 again.\n1:59\nSo x minus 5 could also be equal to negative 10.\n2:04\nBoth of these would satisfy this equation.\n2:07\nNow, to solve this one, add 5 to both\n2:10\nsides of this equation.\n2:11\nYou get x is equal to 15.\n2:14\nTo solve this one, add 5 to both sides of this equation.\n2:17\nx is equal to negative 5.\n2:20\nSo our solution, there's two x's that\n2:23\nsatisfy this equation.\n2:24\nx could be 15.\n2:26\n15 minus 5 is 10, take the absolute value, you're going\n2:29\nto get 10, or x could be negative 5.\n2:32\nNegative 5 minus 5 is negative 10.\n2:36\nTake the absolute value, you get 10.\n2:39\nAnd notice, both of these numbers are exactly 10 away\n2:43\nfrom the number 5.\n2:45\nLet's do another one of these.\n2:48\nLet's do another one.\n2:51\nLet's say we have the absolute value of x plus\n2:54\n2 is equal to 6.\n2:58\nSo what does that tell us?\n2:59\nThat tells us that either x plus 2, that the thing inside\n3:03\nthe absolute value sign, is equal to 6.\n3:07\nOr the thing inside of the absolute value sign, the x\n3:10\nplus 2, could also be negative 6.\n3:12\nIf this whole thing evaluated to negative 6, you take the\n3:13\nabsolute value, you'd get 6.\n3:16\nSo, or x plus 2 could equal negative 6.\n3:20\nAnd then if you subtract 2 from both sides of this\n3:22\nequation, you get x could be equal to 4.\n3:25\nIf you subtract 2 from both sides of this equation, you\n3:29\nget x could be equal to negative 8.\n3:33\nSo these are the two solutions to the equation.\n3:37\nAnd just to kind of have it gel in your mind, that\n3:39\nabsolute value, you can kind of view it as a distance, you\n3:42\ncould rewrite this problem as the absolute value of x minus\n3:46\nnegative 2 is equal to 6.\n3:50\nAnd so this is asking me, what are the x's that are exactly 6\n3:55\naway from negative 2?\n3:57\nRemember, up here we said, what are the x's that are\n4:00\nexactly 10 away from positive 5?\n4:03\nWhatever number you're subtracting from positive 5,\n4:05\nthese are both 10 away from positive 5.\n4:08\nThis is asking, what is exactly 6 away\n4:11\nfrom negative 2?\n4:13\nAnd it's going to be 4, or negative 8.\n4:15\nYou could try those numbers out for yourself.\n4:17\nLet's do another one of these.\n4:20\nLet's do another one, and we'll do it in purple.\n4:25\nLet's say we have the absolute value of 4x-- I'm going to\n4:30\nchange this problem up a little bit.\n4:31\n4x minus 1.\n4:33\nThe absolute value of 4x minus 1, is equal to-- actually,\n4:36\nI'll just keep it-- is equal to 19.\n4:40\nSo, just like the last few problems, 4x minus 1 could be\n4:43\nequal to 19.\n4:47\nOr 4x minus 1 might evaluate to negative 19.\n4:51\nBecause then when you take the absolute value, you're going\n4:53\nto get 19 again.\n4:54\nOr 4x minus 1 could be equal to negative 19.\n4:59\nThen you just solve these two equations.\n5:00\nAdd 1 to both sides of this equation-- we could do them\n5:03\nsimultaneous, even.\n5:03\nAdd 1 to both sides of this, you get 4x is equal to 20.\n5:08\nAdd 1 to both sides of this equation, you get 4x is equal\n5:13\nto negative 18.\n5:15\nDivide both sides of this by 4, you get x is equal to 5.\n5:20\nDivide both sides of this by 4, you get x is equal to\n5:23\nnegative 18/4, which is equal to negative 9/2.\n5:31\nSo both of these x values satisfy the equation.\n5:35\nTry it out.\n5:36\nNegative 9/2 times 4.\n5:39\nThis will become a negative 18.\n5:41\nNegative 18 minus 1 is negative 19.\n5:44\nTake the absolute value, you get 19.\n5:46\nYou put a 5 here, 4 times 5 is 20.\n5:49\nMinus 1 is positive 19.\n5:51\nSo you take the absolute value.\n5:53\nOnce again, you'll get a 19.\n5:55\nLet's try to graph one of these, just for fun.\n5:58\nSo let's say I have y is equal to the absolute\n6:03\nvalue of x plus 3.\n6:04\nSo this is a function, or a graph, with an\n6:07\nabsolute value in it.\n6:09\nSo let's think about two scenarios.\n6:11\nThere's one scenario where the thing inside of the absolute\n6:14\nvalue is positive.\n6:16\nSo you have the scenario where x plus 3-- I'll write it over\n6:19\nhere-- x plus 3 is greater than 0.\n6:23\nAnd then you have the scenario where x plus 3 is less than 0.\n6:29\nWhen x plus 3 is greater than 0, this graph, or this line--\n6:35\nor I guess we can't call it a line-- this function, is the\n6:37\nsame thing as y is equal to x plus 3.\n6:41\nIf this thing over here is greater than 0, then the\n6:44\nabsolute value sign is irrelevant.\n6:46\nSo then this thing is the same thing as y is\n6:48\nequal to x plus 3.\n6:50\nBut when is x plus 3 greater than 0?\n6:52\nWell, if you subtract 3 from both sides, you get x is\n6:57\ngreater than negative 3.\n6:59\nSo when x is greater than negative 3, this graph is\n7:03\ngoing to look just like y is equal to x plus 3.\n7:08\nNow, when x plus 3 is less than 0.\n7:11\nWhen the situation where this-- the inside of our\n7:14\nabsolute value sign-- is negative, in that situation\n7:18\nthis equation is going to be y is equal to the\n7:22\nnegative of x plus 3.\n7:26\nHow can I say that?\n7:27\nWell, look, if this is going to be a negative number, if x\n7:30\nplus 3 is going to be a negative number-- that's what\n7:33\nwe're assuming here-- if it's going to be a negative number,\n7:36\nthen when you take the absolute value of a negative\n7:38\nnumber, you're going to make it positive.\n7:40\nThat's just like multiplying it by negative 1.\n7:43\nIf you know you're taking the absolute value of a negative\n7:45\nnumber, it's just like multiplying it by negative 1,\n7:48\nbecause you're going to make it positive.\n7:51\nAnd this is going to be the situation.\n7:53\nx plus 3 is less than 0.\n7:55\nIf we subtract 3 from both sides, when x is less than\n7:59\nnegative 3.\n8:01\nSo when x is less than negative 3, the graph will\n8:03\nlook like this.\n8:05\nWhen x is greater than negative 3, the graph will\n8:08\nlook like that.\n8:09\nSo let's see what that would make the\n8:11\nentire graph look like.\n8:13\nLet me draw my axes.\n8:21\nThat's my x-axis, that's my y-axis.\n8:26\nSo just let me multiply this out, just so we have it in mx\n8:29\nplus b form.\n8:29\nSo this is equal to negative x minus 3.\n8:36\nSo let's just figure out what this graph would\n8:37\nlook like in general.\n8:38\nNegative x minus 3.\n8:42\nThe y-intercept is negative 3, so 1, 2, 3.\n8:47\nAnd negative x means it slopes downward, has a\n8:51\ndownward slope of 1.\n8:52\nSo it would look like this.\n8:56\nThe x-intercept would be at x is equal to--.\n9:02\nSo if you say y is equal to 0, that would happen when x is\n9:07\nequal to negative 3.\n9:08\nSo it's going to go through that line,\n9:10\nthat point right there.\n9:11\nAnd the graph, if we didn't have this constraint right\n9:14\nhere, would look something like this.\n9:19\nThat's if we didn't constrain it to a certain interval on\n9:22\nthe x-axis.\n9:23\nNow this graph, what does it look like?\n9:27\nLet's see.\n9:27\nIt has its y-intercept at positive 3.\n9:31\nJust like that.\n9:33\nAnd where's its x-intecept?\n9:35\nWhen y is equal to 0, x is negative 3.\n9:37\nSo it also goes through that point right there, and it has\n9:39\na slope of 1.\n9:40\nSo it would look something like this.\n9:43\nThat's what this graph looks like.\n9:45\nNow, what we figured out is that this absolute value\n9:48\nfunction, it looks like this purple graph when x is less\n9:52\nthan negative 3.\n9:53\nSo when x is less than negative 3-- that's x is equal\n9:57\nto negative 3 right there-- when x is less than negative\n9:59\n3, it looks like this purple graph.\n10:03\nRight there.\n10:04\nSo that's when x is less than negative 3.\n10:07\nBut when x is greater than negative 3, it looks like the\n10:10\ngreen graph.\n10:12\nIt looks like that.\n10:14\nSo this graph looks like this strange v.\n10:17\nWhen x is greater than negative 3, this is positive.\n10:21\nSo we have the graph of-- we have a positive slope.\n10:24\nBut then when x is less than negative 3, we're essentially\n10:28\ntaking the negative of the function, if you want to view\n10:30\nit that way, and so we have this negative slope.\n10:32\nSo you kind of have this v-shaped function, this\n10:35\nv-shaped graph, which is indicative of an absolute\n10:38\nvalue function.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWe're first exposed to the idea of a slope of a line early on\n0:05\nin our algebra careers, but I figure it never hurts\n0:07\nto review it a bit.\n0:08\nSo let me draw some axes.\n0:10\nThat is my y-axis.\n0:12\nMaybe I should call it my f of x-axis.\n0:15\ny is equal to f of x.\n0:17\nLet me draw my x-axis, just like that, that is my x-axis.\n0:23\nAnd let me draw a line, let me draw a line like this.\n0:28\nAnd what we want to do is remind ourselves, how do we\n0:31\nfind the slope of that line?\n0:36\nAnd what we do is, we take two points on the line,\n0:42\nso let's say we take this point, right here.\n0:45\nLet's say that that is the point x is equal to a.\n0:48\nAnd then what would this be?\n0:49\nThis would be the point f of a, where the function is\n0:53\ngoing to be some line.\n0:54\nWe could write f of x is going to be equal to mx plus b.\n0:59\nWe don't know what m and b are, but this is all\n1:01\na little bit of review.\n1:02\nSo this is a.\n1:04\nAnd then the y-value is what happens to the function when\n1:06\nyou evaluated it at a, so that's that point right there.\n1:09\nAnd then we could take another point on this line.\n1:11\nLet's say we take point b, right there.\n1:14\nAnd then this coordinate up here is going to be\n1:17\nthe point b, f of b.\n1:22\nRight?\n1:22\nBecause this is just the point when you evaluate\n1:23\nthe function at b.\n1:24\nYou put b in here, you're going to get that point right there.\n1:27\nSo let me just draw a little line right there.\n1:29\nSo that is f of b, right there.\n1:32\nActually, let me make it clear that this coordinate right\n1:35\nis the point a, f of a.\n1:38\nSo how do we find the slope between these 2 points, or more\n1:42\ngenerally, of this entire line?\n1:43\nBecause whole the slope is consistent the\n1:46\nwhole way through it.\n1:48\nAnd we know that once we find the slope, that's\n1:50\nactually going to be the value of this m.\n1:51\nThat's all a review of your algebra, but how do we do it?\n1:54\nWell, a couple of ways to think about it.\n1:56\nSlope is equal to rise over run.\n2:05\nYou might have seen that when you first learned algebra.\n2:07\nOr another way of writing it, it's change in\n2:09\ny over change in x.\n2:13\nSo let's figure out what the change in why over the change\n2:16\nin x is for this particular case.\n2:18\nSo the change in y is equal to what?\n2:22\nWell, let's just take, you can take this guy as being the\n2:25\nfirst point, or that guy as being the first point.\n2:26\nBut since this guy has a larger x and a larger y,\n2:29\nlet's start with him.\n2:30\nThe change in y between that guy and that guy is this\n2:33\ndistance, right here.\n2:35\nSo let me draw a little triangle.\n2:36\nThat distance right there is a change in y.\n2:39\nOr I could just transfer it to the y-axis.\n2:42\nThis is the change in y.\n2:44\nThat is your change in y, that distance.\n2:46\nSo what is that distance?\n2:47\nIt's f of b minus f of a.\n2:51\nSo it equals f of b minus f of a.\n2:57\nThat is your change in y.\n3:01\nNow what is your change in x The slope is change\n3:05\nin y over change in x.\n3:09\nSo what our change in x?\n3:10\nWhat's this distance?\n3:11\nRemember, we're taking this to be the first point,\n3:13\nso we took its y minus the other point's y.\n3:16\nSo to be consistent, we're going to have to take this\n3:17\npoint x minus this point x.\n3:20\nSo this point's x-coordinate is b.\n3:23\nSo it's going to be b minus a.\n3:29\nAnd just like that, if you knew the equation of this line, or\n3:31\nif you had the coordinates of these 2 points, you would just\n3:34\nplug them in right here and you would get your slope.\n3:39\nThat straightforward.\n3:40\nAnd that comes straight out of your Algebra 1 class.\n3:43\nAnd let me just, just to make sure it's concrete for you, if\n3:46\nthis was the point 2, 3, and let's say that this, up here,\n3:55\nwas the point 5, 7, then if we wanted to find the slope of\n4:00\nthis line, we would do 7 minus 3, that would be our change in\n4:06\ny, this would be 7 and this would be 3, and then we\n4:10\ndo that over 5 minus 2.\n4:14\nBecause this would be a 5, and this would be a 2, and so this\n4:18\nwould be your change in x.\n4:19\n5 minus 2.\n4:20\nSo 7 minus 3 is 4, and 5 minus 2 is 3. so your\n4:24\nslope would be 4/3.\n4:30\nNow let's see if we can generalize this.\n4:33\nAnd this is what the new concept that we're going\n4:35\nto be learning as we delve into calculus.\n4:38\nLet's see if we can generalize this somehow to a curve.\n4:41\nSo let's say I have a curve.\n4:44\nWe have to have a curve before we can generalize\n4:46\nit to a curve.\n4:47\nLet me scroll down a little.\n4:47\nWell, actually, I want to leave this up here, show\n4:49\nyou the similarity.\n4:51\nLet's say I have, I'll keep it pretty general right now.\n4:56\nLet's say I have a curve.\n4:58\nI'll make it a familiar-looking curve.\n5:01\nLet's say it's the curve y is equal to x squared, which\n5:03\nlooks something like that.\n5:06\nAnd I want to find the slope.\n5:10\nLet's say I want to find the slope at some point.\n5:13\nAnd actually, before even talking about it, let's even\n5:15\nthink about what it means to find the slope of a curve.\n5:18\nHere, the slope was the same the whole time, right?\n5:22\nBut on a curve your slope is changing.\n5:24\nAnd just to get an intuition for that means, is, what's\n5:27\nthe slope over here?\n5:28\nYour slope over here is the slope of the tangent line.\n5:31\nThe line just barely touches it.\n5:33\nThat's the slope over there.\n5:34\nIt's a negative slope.\n5:35\nThen over here, your slope is still negative, but it's a\n5:37\nlittle bit less negative.\n5:39\nIt goes like that.\n5:40\nI don't know if I did that, drew that.\n5:41\nLet me do it in a different color.\n5:43\nLet me do it in purple.\n5:45\nSo over here, your slope is slightly less negative.\n5:48\nIt's a slightly less downward-sloping line.\n5:51\nAnd then when you go over here, at the 0 point, right here,\n5:56\nyour slope is pretty much flat, because the horizontal line, y\n6:00\nequals 0, is tangent to this curve.\n6:02\nAnd then as you go to more positive x's, then your\n6:05\nslope starts increasing.\n6:08\nI'm trying to draw a tangent line.\n6:10\nAnd here it's increasing even more, it's increased even more.\n6:14\nSo your slope is changing the entire time, and this is kind\n6:17\nof the big change that happens when you go from a\n6:19\nline to a curve.\n6:21\nA line, your slope is the same the entire time.\n6:24\nYou could take any two points of a line, take the change in y\n6:27\nover the change in x, and you get the slope for\n6:29\nthe entire line.\n6:30\nBut as you can see already, it's going to be a little\n6:32\nbit more nuanced when we do it for a curve.\n6:35\nBecause it depends what point we're talking about.\n6:37\nWe can't just say, what is the slope for this curve?\n6:40\nThe slope is different at every point along the curve.\n6:43\nIt changes.\n6:44\nIf we go up here, it's going to be even steeper.\n6:46\nIt's going to look something like that.\n6:50\nSo let's try a bit of an experiment.\n6:54\nAnd I know how this experiment turns out, so it won't\n6:57\nbe too much of a risk.\n6:59\nLet me draw better than that.\n7:02\nSo that is my y-axis, and that's my x-axis.\n7:11\nLet's call this, we can call this y, or we can call\n7:13\nthis the f of x axis.\n7:15\nEither way.\n7:16\nAnd let me draw my curve again.\n7:20\nAnd I'll just draw it in the positive coordinate, like that.\n7:24\nThat's my curve.\n7:26\nAnd what if I want to find the slope right there?\n7:33\nWhat can I do?\n7:34\nWell, based on our definition of a slope, we need 2 points\n7:38\nto find a slope, right?\n7:39\nHere, I don't know how to find the slope with 1 point.\n7:41\nSo let's just call this point right here,\n7:49\nthat's going to be x.\n7:50\nWe're going to be general.\n7:51\nThis is going to be our point x.\n7:53\nBut to find our slope, according to our traditional\n7:55\nalgebra 1 definition of a slope, we need 2 points.\n7:58\nSo let's get another point in here.\n8:02\nLet's just take a slightly larger version of this x.\n8:05\nSo let's say, we want to take, actually, let's do it even\n8:10\nfurther out, just because it's going to get messy otherwise.\n8:13\nSo let's say we have this point right here.\n8:15\nAnd the difference, it's just h bigger than x.\n8:18\nOr actually, instead of saying h bigger, let's just, well\n8:20\nlet me just say h bigger.\n8:22\nSo this is x plus h.\n8:25\nThat's what that point is right there.\n8:27\nSo what going to be their corresponding y-coordinates\n8:30\non the curve?\n8:31\nWell, this is the curve of y is equal to f of x.\n8:35\nSo this point right here is going to be f of our\n8:39\nparticular x right here.\n8:41\nAnd maybe to show you that I'm taking a particular x, maybe\n8:43\nI'll do a little 0 here.\n8:45\nThis is x naught, this is x naught plus h.\n8:48\nThis is f of x naught.\n8:51\nAnd then what is this going to be up here, this point up\n8:56\nhere, that point up here?\n8:59\nIts y-coordinate is going to be f of f of this x-coordinate,\n9:04\nwhich I shifted over a little bit.\n9:05\nIt's right there. f of this x-coordinate, which is\n9:08\nf of x naught plus h.\n9:10\nThat's its y-coordinate.\n9:12\nSo what is a slope going to be between these two points that\n9:15\nare relatively close to each other?\n9:17\nRemember, this isn't going to be the slope\n9:18\njust at this point.\n9:20\nThis is the slope of the line between these two points.\n9:23\nAnd if I were to actually draw it out, it would actually be a\n9:27\nsecant line between, to the curve.\n9:29\nSo it would intersect the curve twice, once at this point,\n9:31\nonce at this point.\n9:32\nYou can't see it.\n9:34\nIf I blew it up a little bit, it would look\n9:35\nsomething like this.\n9:41\nThis is our coordinate x naught f of x naught, and up here\n9:47\nis our coordinate for this point, which would be, the\n9:51\nx-coordinate would be x naught plus h, and the y-coordinate\n9:56\nwould be f of x naught plus h.\n9:59\nJust whatever this function is, we're evaluating it at this\n10:02\nx-coordinate That's all it is.\n10:03\nSo these are the 2 points.\n10:05\nSo maybe a good start is to just say, hey, what is the\n10:07\nslope of this secant line?\n10:10\nAnd just like we did in the previous example, you find the\n10:12\nchange in y, and you divide that by your change in x.\n10:22\nLet me draw it here.\n10:23\nYour change in y would be that right here, change in y, and\n10:26\nthen your change in x would be that right there.\n10:29\nSo what is the slope going to be of the secant line?\n10:33\nThe slope is going to be equal to, let's start with this\n10:37\npoint up here, just because it seems to be larger.\n10:39\nSo we want a change in y. so this value right here, this\n10:43\ny-value, is f of x naught plus h.\n10:46\nI just evaluated this guy up here.\n10:47\nLooks like a fancy term, but all it means is, look.\n10:49\nThe slightly larger x evaluate its y-coordinate.\n10:52\nWhere the curve is at that value of x.\n10:57\nSo that is going to be, so the change in y is going to be\n11:00\na f of x naught plus h.\n11:03\nThat's just the y-coordinate up here.\n11:05\nMinus this y-coordinate over here.\n11:08\nSo minus f of x naught.\n11:13\nSo that equals our change in y.\n11:16\nAnd you want to divide that by your change in x.\n11:21\nSo what is this?\n11:21\nThis is the larger x-value.\n11:23\nWe started with this coordinate, so we start\n11:25\nwith its x-coordinate.\n11:26\nSo it's x naught plus h, x naught plus h.\n11:30\nMinus this x-coordinate.\n11:32\nWell, we just picked a general number.\n11:33\nIt's x naught.\n11:36\nSo that is over your change in x.\n11:39\nJust like that.\n11:39\nSo this is the slope of the secant line.\n11:41\nWe still haven't answered what the slope is right at that\n11:43\npoint, but maybe this will help us get there.\n11:47\nIf we simplify this, so let me write it down like this.\n11:51\nThe slope of the secant, let me write that properly.\n11:57\nThe slope of the secant line is equal to the value of the\n12:03\nfunction at this point, f of x naught plus h, minus the value\n12:08\nof the function here, mine f of x naught.\n12:12\nSo that just tells us the change in y.\n12:14\nIt's the exact same definition of slope we've always used.\n12:18\nOver the change in x.\n12:19\nAnd we can simplify this.\n12:20\nWe have x naught plus h minus x naught.\n12:23\nSo x naught minus x naught cancel out, so you\n12:26\nhave that over h.\n12:27\nSo this is equal to our change in y over change in x.\n12:32\nFair enough.\n12:33\nBut I started off saying, I want to find the slope of\n12:36\nthe line at that point, at this point, right here.\n12:38\nThis is the zoomed-out version of it.\n12:40\nSo what can I do?\n12:42\nWell, I defined second point here as just the first\n12:45\npoint plus some h.\n12:49\nAnd we have something in our toolkit called a limit.\n12:52\nThis h is just a general number.\n12:55\nIt could be 10, it could be 2, it could be 0.02, it could be 1\n12:59\ntimes 10 to the negative 100.\n13:01\nIt could be an arbitrarily small number.\n13:03\nSo what happens, what would happen, at least theoretically,\n13:07\nif I were take the limit as h approaches 0?\n13:09\nSo, you know, first, maybe h is this fairly large number over\n13:13\nhere, and then if I take h a little bit smaller, then I'd be\n13:15\nfinding the slope of this secant line.\n13:17\nIf I took h to be even a little bit smaller, I'd be finding the\n13:20\nslope of that secant line.\n13:21\nIf h is a little bit smaller, I'd be finding\n13:23\nthe slope of that line.\n13:24\nSo as h approaches 0, I'll be getting closer and closer to\n13:28\nfinding the slope of the line right at my point in question.\n13:34\nObviously, if h is a large number, my secant line is going\n13:36\nto be way off from the slope at exactly that point right there.\n13:41\nBut if h is 0.0000001, if it's an infinitesimally small\n13:45\nnumber, then I'm going to get pretty close.\n13:47\nSo what happens if I take the limit as h\n13:51\napproaches zero of this?\n13:53\nSo the limit as h approaches 0 of my secant slope.\n14:00\nOf, let me switch to green.\n14:03\nf of x naught plus h minus f of x naught, that was my change in\n14:08\ny, over h, which is my change in x.\n14:15\nAnd now just to clarify something, and sometimes you'll\n14:17\nsee it in different calculus books, sometimes instead of an\n14:20\nh, they'll write a delta x here.\n14:22\nWhere this second point would have been defined as x naught\n14:25\nplus delta x, and then, this would have simplified to just\n14:28\ndelta x over there, and we'd be taking the limit as\n14:30\ndelta x approaches 0.\n14:31\nThe exact same thing.\n14:33\nh, delta x, doesn't matter.\n14:34\nWe're taking h as the difference between one x point\n14:37\nand then the higher x point, and then we're just going to\n14:39\ntake the limit as that approaches zero.\n14:40\nWe could have called that delta x just as easily.\n14:44\nBut I'm going to call this thing, which equals the slope\n14:52\nof the tangent line, and it does equal the slope of the\n14:54\ntangent line, I'm going to call this the derivative of f.\n14:58\nLet me write that down.\n15:05\nAnd I'm going to say that this is equal to f prime of x.\n15:10\nAnd this is going to be another function.\n15:12\nBecause remember, the slope changes at every x-value.\n15:16\nNo matter what x-value you pick, the slope is\n15:18\ngoing to be different.\n15:19\nDoesn't have to be, but the way I drew this curve,\n15:20\nit is different.\n15:21\nIt can be different.\n15:22\nSo now, you give me an x-value in here, I'll apply this\n15:27\nformula over here, and then I can tell you the\n15:30\nslope at that point.\n15:31\nAnd it all seems very confusing and maybe\n15:34\nabstract at this point.\n15:35\nIn the next video, I'll actually do an example of\n15:38\ncalculating a slope, and it'll make it everything a\n15:40\nlittle bit more concrete.",

    "question_type": "MCQ",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWelcome to the presentation on ordering numbers.\n0:04\nLet's get started with some problems that I think, as you\n0:06\ngo through the examples hopefully, you'll understand\n0:09\nhow to do these problems.\n0:10\nSo let's see.\n0:11\nThe first set of numbers that we have to order is 35.7%,\n0:23\n108.1% 0.5, 13/93, and 1 and 7/68.\n0:44\nSo let's do this problem.\n0:46\nThe important thing to remember whenever you're doing this type\n0:48\nof ordering of numbers is to realize that these are all just\n0:52\ndifferent ways to represent-- these are all a percent or a\n0:56\ndecimal or a fraction or a mixed-- are all just different\n1:00\nways of representing numbers.\n1:02\nIt's very hard to compare when you just look at it like this,\n1:05\nso what I like to do is I like to convert them\n1:07\nall to decimals.\n1:08\nBut there could be someone who likes to convert them all to\n1:11\npercentages or convert them all to fractions and then compare.\n1:14\nBut I always find decimals to be the easiest way to compare.\n1:16\nSo let's start with this 35.7%.\n1:19\nLet's turn this into a decimal.\n1:21\nWell, the easiest thing to remember is if you have a\n1:25\npercent you just get rid of the percent sign and\n1:27\nput it over 100.\n1:28\nSo 35.7% is the same thing as 35.7/100.\n1:38\nLike 5%, that's the same thing as 5/100 or 50% is just\n1:43\nthe same thing as 50/100.\n1:45\nSo 35.7/100, well, that just equals 0.357.\n1:53\nIf this got you a little confused another way to think\n1:55\nabout percentage points is if I write 35.7%, all you have to do\n2:01\nis get rid of the percent sign and move the decimal to the\n2:05\nleft two spaces and it becomes 0.357.\n2:10\nLet me give you a couple of more examples down here.\n2:11\nLet's say I had 5%.\n2:16\nThat is the same thing as 5/100.\n2:20\nOr if you do the decimal technique, 5%, you could just\n2:22\nmove the decimal and you get rid of the percent.\n2:24\nAnd you move the decimal over 1 and 2, and you put a 0 here.\n2:28\nIt's 0.05.\n2:30\nAnd that's the same thing as 0.05.\n2:33\nYou also know that 0.05 and 5/100 are the same thing.\n2:36\nSo let's get back to the problem.\n2:37\nI hope that distraction didn't distract you too much.\n2:40\nLet me scratch out all this.\n2:43\nSo 35.7% is equal to 0.357.\n2:49\nSimilarly, 108.1%.\n2:51\nLet's to the technique where we just get rid of the percent and\n2:54\nmove the decimal space over 1, 2 spaces to the left.\n2:59\nSo then that equals 1.081.\n3:08\nSee we already know that this is smaller than this.\n3:11\nWell the next one is easy, it's already in decimal form.\n3:14\n0.5 is just going to be equal to 0.5.\n3:18\nNow 13/93.\n3:21\nTo convert a fraction into a decimal we just take the\n3:24\ndenominator and divide it into the numerator.\n3:27\nSo let's do that.\n3:29\n93 goes into 13?\n3:36\nWell, we know it goes into 13 zero times.\n3:39\nSo let's add a decimal point here.\n3:43\nSo how many times does 93 go into 130?\n3:47\nWell, it goes into it one time.\n3:49\n1 times 93 is 93.\n3:55\nBecomes a 10.\n3:56\nThat becomes a 2.\n3:58\nThen we're going to borrow, so get 37.\n4:03\nBring down a 0.\n4:06\nSo 93 goes into 370?\n4:10\nLet's see.\n4:10\n4 times 93 would be 372, so it actually goes into\n4:14\nit only three times.\n4:19\n3 times 3 is 9.\n4:22\n3 times 9 is 27.\n4:30\nSo this equals?\n4:31\nLet's see, this equals-- if we say that this 0 becomes a 10.\n4:38\nThis become a 16.\n4:39\nThis becomes a 2.\n4:42\n81.\n4:45\nAnd then we say, how many times does 93 go into 810?\n4:48\nIt goes roughly 8 times.\n4:50\nAnd we could actually keep going, but for the sake of\n4:52\ncomparing these numbers, we've already gotten to a pretty\n4:55\ngood level of accuracy.\n4:57\nSo let's just stop this problem here because the decimal\n5:00\nnumbers could keep going on, but for the sake of comparison\n5:02\nI think we've already got a good sense of what this\n5:04\ndecimal looks like.\n5:05\nIt's 0.138 and then it'll just keep going.\n5:10\nSo let's write that down.\n5:13\nAnd then finally, we have this mixed number here.\n5:15\nAnd let me erase some of my work because I don't\n5:18\nwant to confuse you.\n5:18\nActually, let me keep it the way it is right now.\n5:22\nThe easiest way to convert a mixed number into a decimal is\n5:26\nto just say, OK, this is 1 and then some fraction\n5:29\nthat's less than 1.\n5:32\nOr we could convert it to a fraction, an improper fraction\n5:36\nlike-- oh, actually there are no improper fractions here.\n5:38\nActually, let's do it that way.\n5:39\nLet's convert to an improper fraction and then convert\n5:41\nthat into a decimal.\n5:44\nActually, I think I'm going to need more space, so let me\n5:46\nclean up this a little bit.\n5:58\nThere.\n5:58\nWe have a little more space to work with now.\n6:04\nSo 1 and 7/68.\n6:08\nSo to go from a mixed number to an improper fraction, what you\n6:13\ndo is you take the 68 times 1 and add it to the\n6:18\nnumerator here.\n6:19\nAnd why does this make sense?\n6:21\nBecause this is the same thing as 1 plus 7/68.\n6:26\n1 and 7/68 is the same thing as 1 plus 7/68.\n6:29\nAnd that's the same thing as you know from the fractions\n6:32\nmodule, as 68/68 plus 7/68.\n6:40\nAnd that's the same thing as 68 plus 7-- 75/68.\n6:47\nSo 1 and 7/68 is equal to 75/68.\n6:51\nAnd now we convert this to a decimal using the technique\n6:54\nwe did for 13/93.\n6:56\nSo we say-- let me get some space.\n6:58\nWe say 68 goes into 75-- suspicion I'm going\n7:05\nto run out of space.\n7:07\n68 goes into 75 one time.\n7:09\n1 times 68 is 68.\n7:13\n75 minus 68 is 7.\n7:16\nBring down the 0.\n7:17\nActually, you don't have to write the decimal there.\n7:20\nIgnore that decimal.\n7:21\n68 goes into 70 one time.\n7:24\n1 times 68 is 68.\n7:28\n70 minus 68 is 2, bring down another 0.\n7:30\n68 goes into 20 zero times.\n7:33\nAnd the problem's going to keep going on, but I think we've\n7:36\nalready once again, gotten to enough accuracy that\n7:38\nwe can compare.\n7:40\nSo 1 and 7/68 we've now figured out is equal to 1.10-- and if\n7:48\nwe kept dividing we'll keep getting more decimals of\n7:51\naccuracy, but I think we're now ready to compare.\n7:53\nSo all of these numbers I just rewrote them as decimals.\n7:56\nSo 35.7% is 0.357.\n8:00\n108.1%-- ignore this for now because we just used\n8:05\nthat to do the work.\n8:05\nIt's 108.1% is equal to 1.081.\n8:09\n0.5 is 0.5.\n8:11\n13/93 is 0.138.\n8:15\nAnd 1 and 7/68 is 1.10 and it'll keep going on.\n8:20\nSo what's the smallest?\n8:23\nSo the smallest is 0.-- actually, no.\n8:26\nThe smallest is right here.\n8:28\nSo I'm going to rank them from smallest to largest.\n8:31\nSo the smallest is 0.138.\n8:36\nThen the next largest is going to be 0.357.\n8:40\nThen the next largest is going to be 0.5.\n8:44\nThen you're going to have 1.08.\n8:47\nAnd then you're going to have 1 and 7/68.\n8:54\nWell, actually, I'm going to do more examples of this, but for\n8:56\nthis video I think this is the only one I have time for.\n8:59\nBut hopefully this gives you a sense of doing these problems.\n9:01\nI always find it easier to go into the decimal\n9:04\nmode to compare.\n9:05\nAnd actually, the hints on the module will\n9:06\nbe the same for you.\n9:08\nBut I think you're ready at least now to try the problems.\n9:11\nIf you're not, if you want to see other examples, you might\n9:13\njust want to either re-watch this video and/or I might\n9:16\nrecord some more videos with more examples right now.\n9:20\nAnyway, have fun.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWe have the function f of x is equal to x minus\n0:03\n1 squared minus 2.\n0:06\nAnd they've constrained the domain to x being less\n0:09\nthan or equal to 1.\n0:10\nSo we have the left half of a parabola right here.\n0:14\nThey've constrained so that it's not a full U parabola.\n0:17\nAnd I'll let you think about why that would make finding\n0:20\nthe inverse difficult.\n0:21\nBut let's try to find the inverse here.\n0:23\nAnd a good place to start -- let's just set y\n0:25\nbeing equal to f of x.\n0:26\nYou could say y is equal to f of x or we could just\n0:29\nwrite that y is equal to x minus 1 squared minus 2.\n0:35\nWe know it's 4.\n0:37\nx is less than or equal to 1.\n0:39\nBut right now we have y solved for in terms of x.\n0:45\nOr we've solved for y, to find the inverse we're going to want\n0:47\nto solve for x in terms of y.\n0:51\nAnd we're going to constrain y similarly.\n0:54\nWe could look at the graph and we could say, well, in this\n0:56\ngraph right here, this is defined for y being greater\n1:00\nthan or equal to negative 2.\n1:02\nSo we can maybe put in parentheses y being greater\n1:05\nthan or equal to negative 2.\n1:07\nBecause this is going to be -- right now this is our range.\n1:10\nBut when we swap the x's and y's, this is going\n1:12\nto be our domain.\n1:13\nSo let's just keep that in parentheses right there.\n1:16\nSo let's solve for x.\n1:18\nSo that's all you have to do, to find the inverse.\n1:20\nSolve for x and make sure you keep track of the\n1:22\ndomains and the ranges.\n1:23\nSo, let's see.\n1:24\nWe could add 2 to both sides of this equation.\n1:26\nWe get y plus 2 is equal to x minus 1 squared.\n1:32\nMinus 2, plus 2, so those cancel out.\n1:34\nAnd then, I'm just going to switch to the y constraint.\n1:37\nBecause now it's not clear what we're -- whether x is\n1:41\nthe domain or the range.\n1:42\nBut we know by the end of this problem, y is\n1:43\ngoing to be the domain.\n1:44\nSo let's just swap this here.\n1:46\nSo, 4 for y is greater than or equal to negative 2.\n1:50\nAnd we could also say, in parentheses, x is less than 1.\n1:53\nThis is -- we haven't solved it explicitly for either one, so\n1:55\nwe'll keep both of them around right now.\n1:58\nNow, to solve for x, you might be tempted to just take the\n2:02\nsquare root of both sides here.\n2:04\nAnd you wouldn't be completely wrong.\n2:05\nBut we have to be very, very, very careful here.\n2:07\nAnd this might not be something that you've ever seen before.\n2:11\nSo this is an interesting point here.\n2:13\nWe want the right side to just be x minus 1.\n2:19\nThat's our goal here, in taking the square root of both sides.\n2:21\nWe want to just have an x minus 1 over there.\n2:25\nNow, is x minus 1 a positive or a negative number?\n2:31\nWell, we've constrained our x's to being less than 1.\n2:35\nSo we're dealing only in a situation where x is\n2:37\nless than or equal to 1.\n2:38\nSo if x is less than or equal to 1, this is negative.\n2:44\nThis is negative.\n2:48\nSo we want to take the negative square root.\n2:50\nLet me just be very clear here.\n2:51\nIf I take negative 3 -- I take negative 3 and I were to square\n2:56\nit, that is equal to 9.\n2:58\nNow, if we take the square root of 9 -- if we take the square\n3:02\nroot -- let's say we take the square root of both\n3:04\nsides of this equation.\n3:05\nAnd our goal is to get back to negative 3.\n3:08\nIf we take the positive square root.\n3:11\nIf we just take the principle root of both sides of that, we\n3:16\nwould get 3 is equal to 3.\n3:18\nBut that's not our goal.\n3:19\nWe want to get back to negative 3.\n3:21\nSo we want to take the negative square root of our square.\n3:28\nSo because this expression is negative and we want to get\n3:30\nback to this expression, we want to get back to this x\n3:33\nminus 1, we need to take the negative square root\n3:36\nof both sides.\n3:37\nYou can always -- every perfect square has a\n3:39\npositive or a negative root.\n3:42\nThe principle root is a positive root.\n3:44\nBut here we want to take the negative root because this\n3:45\nexpression right here is going to be negative.\n3:48\nAnd that's what we want to solve for.\n3:50\nSo let's take the negative root of both sides.\n3:53\nSo you get the negative square root of y plus 2 is equal to\n3:58\n-- and I'll just write this extra step here, just so you\n4:01\nrealize what we're doing.\n4:02\nIs equal to the negative square root, the negative square\n4:06\nroot of x minus 1 squared.\n4:11\nFor y is greater than or equal to negative 2.\n4:15\nAnd x is less than or equal to 1.\n4:17\nThat's why the whole reason we're going to take the\n4:18\nnegative square there.\n4:20\nAnd then this expression right here -- so let me\n4:22\njust write the left again.\n4:24\nNegative square root of y plus 2 is equal to the negative\n4:29\nsquare root of x minus 1 squared is just going\n4:32\nto be x minus 1.\n4:34\nIt's just going to be x minus one.\n4:36\nx minus 1 squared is some positive quantity.\n4:39\nThe negative root is the negative number that you\n4:41\nhave to square to get it.\n4:43\nTo get x minus 1 squared.\n4:44\nSo that just becomes x minus 1.\n4:46\nHopefully that doesn't confuse you too much.\n4:48\nWe just want to get rid of this squared sign.\n4:50\nWe want to make sure we get the negative version.\n4:52\nWe don't want the positive version, which would\n4:53\nhave been 1 minus x.\n4:54\nDon't want to confuse you.\n4:56\nSo here, we now just have to solve for x.\n4:58\nAdd 1.\n4:58\nAnd let me write the 4.\n5:00\ny is greater than or equal to negative 2.\n5:04\nAdd 1 to both sides.\n5:06\nYou get negative square root of y plus 2 plus 1 is equal to x\n5:13\nfor y is greater than or equal to negative 2.\n5:17\nOr, if we want to rewrite it, we could say that x is equal to\n5:21\nthe negative square root of y plus 2 plus 1 for y is greater\n5:28\nthan or equal to negative 2.\n5:29\nOr if we want to write it in terms, as an inverse function\n5:31\nof y, we could say -- so we could say that f inverse of y\n5:36\nis equal to this, or f inverse of y is equal to the negative\n5:42\nsquare root of y plus 2 plus 1, for y is greater than\n5:48\nor equal to negative 2.\n5:49\nAnd now, if we wanted this in terms of x.\n5:52\nIf we just want to rename y as x we just replace\n5:55\nthe y's with x's.\n5:56\nSo we could write f inverse of x -- I'm just\n6:02\nrenaming the y here.\n6:03\nIs equal to the negative square root of x plus 2 plus 1 for,\n6:09\nI'm just renaming the y, for x is greater than or\n6:12\nequal to negative 2.\n6:13\nAnd if we were to graph this, let's see.\n6:16\nIf we started at x is equal to negative 2, this is 0.\n6:18\nSo the point negative 2, 1 is going to be on our graph.\n6:22\nSo negative 2, 1 is going to be on our graph.\n6:25\nLet's see, if we go to negative 1, negative 1 this will\n6:30\nbecome a negative 1.\n6:31\nNegative 1 is 0 on our graph.\n6:34\nNegative 1, 0 is on our graph.\n6:37\nAnd then, let's see.\n6:38\nIf we were to do, if we were to put x is equal to 2 here.\n6:42\nSo x is equal to 2 is 4.\n6:46\n4 square root, principle root is 2.\n6:48\nIt becomes a negative 2 So it becomes 2, negative 1.\n6:52\nSo that's on our graph right there.\n6:54\nSo the graph is going to look something like\n6:55\nthis, of f inverse.\n6:57\nIt's going to look something like that right there.\n7:02\nAs you can see, it is a reflection of our original\n7:05\nf of x along the line y is equal to x.\n7:08\nAlong the line y is equal to x.\n7:13\nBecause we've essentially just swapped the x and the y.\n7:16\nThis is about as hard of an inverse problem that\n7:18\nI expect you to see.\n7:19\nEspecially in a precalculus class because it really is\n7:22\ntricky to realize that you have to take the negative\n7:24\nsquare root here.\n7:25\nBecause the way our domain was constrained, this value right\n7:28\nhere is going to be negative.\n7:30\nSo to solve for it, you want to have the negative square root.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] You have two fractions, 1/4 and 5/6,\n0:04\nand you want to rewrite them\n0:05\nso they have the same denominator\n0:07\nand have whole number numerators.\n0:10\nWhat numbers could you use for the denominator?\n0:13\nSo here's our fractions, 1/4 and 5/6, and we want\n0:17\nto rewrite these fractions to have new denominators.\n0:22\nSo we currently have a four and a six as our denominator,\n0:26\nand could we just pick any new thing, like maybe five?\n0:28\nCould we say, \"Let's change them both to have five\n0:30\n\"as the denominator?\"\n0:32\nThe answer is no.\n0:33\nWe have to pick a multiple of four and six, a multiple,\n0:37\nsome number that we can multiply four\n0:41\nand get this number as an answer.\n0:45\nSo for example, for four, some multiples of four\n0:50\nwould be four times one is four,\n0:53\nfour times two is eight,\n0:55\nfour times three is 12, and so on.\n0:58\nThose are multiples of four.\n1:02\nAnd let's just pause here and look at why we have\n1:04\nto pick a multiple of four and six,\n1:07\nwhy we can't just pick any number\n1:09\nbut we have to pick a multiple of our denominators.\n1:14\nSo the fraction we were just talking about was 1/4.\n1:17\nWe could look at either one, but let's look at 1/4.\n1:20\nHere we have a picture showing fourths.\n1:24\nAnd to show 1/4,\n1:26\nwe shade one of these four equal-size pieces.\n1:31\nMaybe I wanna change this and I wanna say,\n1:33\n\"I want two, I want two as my numerator.\"\n1:36\nSo to have a numerator of two,\n1:40\nI'm gonna need to split this fourth up here into two pieces.\n1:45\nNow I have two shaded pieces.\n1:47\nSo can I say this is two, one, two,\n1:50\nout of one, two, three, four, five pieces?\n1:54\nIt's not 2/5 because these are not equal-size pieces.\n1:58\nSo if I split this fourth right here in half,\n2:00\nI need to split all of them in half.\n2:03\nAnd what I'm doing is doubling\n2:06\nthe amount of pieces.\n2:10\nSo now this is two pieces, this is two, and this is two,\n2:14\nbecause we need equal-size pieces.\n2:16\nSo now, this is one, two pieces out of one, two,\n2:20\nthree, four, five, six, seven, eight equal-size pieces.\n2:24\nSo 2/8.\n2:27\nAnd you can see, eight is a multiple of four\n2:30\nbecause we multiplied by two, and that's what we did.\n2:32\nWe multiplied each of our pieces by two.\n2:36\nWe also multiplied our numerator by two\n2:38\nbecause that was also doubled.\n2:40\nThe amount of shaded pieces doubled\n2:42\nwhen the entire amount of pieces doubled.\n2:45\nNow, we don't have to do this just with two.\n2:47\nWe could do any multiple of four.\n2:49\nFor example, we can do one more here.\n2:54\nIf we, again, let's shade 1/4,\n2:58\none of the four pieces.\n3:01\nAnd maybe this time we wanna split it\n3:03\ninto three equal-size pieces.\n3:08\nSo to have a new numerator of three,\n3:10\nand these should be equal-sized,\n3:13\nhere's a numerator of three.\n3:17\nBut we can't do our denominator yet\n3:20\nbecause we don't have equal-size pieces.\n3:23\nSo to get equal-size pieces we'll need\n3:25\nto split each of these fourths into three.\n3:31\nSo we are tripling the amount of pieces.\n3:36\nSo now we have three shaded pieces out of a total\n3:40\nof one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,\n3:43\nnine, 10, 11, 12,\n3:46\nout of 12.\n3:48\nAnd I could have figured that out without even counting\n3:50\nbecause I knew that we tripled.\n3:53\nThis time we multiplied\n3:57\nour original denominator times three, we tripled.\n4:00\nAnd we also multiplied our numerator times three.\n4:05\nSo these are the multiples, eight, 12, and so on,\n4:08\nand so those are the denominators we can pick,\n4:10\nsomething that we can multiply our denominator by\n4:15\nso we can multiply the entire amount of pieces.\n4:20\nAnd again, so this is super clear, 1/4 and 2/8 and 3/12,\n4:24\nthey all represent the same amount,\n4:27\nwhether we had 1/4, the original, here's 2/8, 3/12,\n4:30\nthey're all equivalent.\n4:32\nThey all represent the same amount.\n4:34\nThey're just different ways of writing the same number.\n4:39\nBack to our original question,\n4:41\nwhat denominators can we use for fourths and for sixths?\n4:46\nWe know we need to use multiples,\n4:48\nso let's look at the multiples.\n4:50\nFor four, we've already gone through some of these.\n4:53\nThe first multiple of four is four times one,\n4:55\nwhich is four.\n4:57\nSecond multiple of four is eight.\n4:59\nFour times two is eight, so we could split our fourths\n5:02\nin half and get eighths.\n5:04\nOr we could say four times three is 12,\n5:08\nwhich we showed again where we split our fourths,\n5:10\neach fourth into three equal pieces.\n5:14\nOr we could do four times four which is 16.\n5:17\nFour times five is 20,\n5:19\nfour times six is 24, and so on.\n5:24\nThe reason I'm stopping at 24 is I've looked\n5:26\nat my answer choices and I can see the largest possible\n5:30\nanswer is 24, so I don't need\n5:32\nto write any larger multiples.\n5:34\nThere are many, many, many more multiples of four,\n5:37\nbut we don't need to list them all\n5:38\n'cause the largest number we're gonna have\n5:40\nto consider is 24.\n5:43\nLet's do the same for sixths.\n5:45\nWe could leave our sixths alone, six times one,\n5:48\nand keep six pieces.\n5:50\nOr we could double our sixths.\n5:52\nSix times two would be 12,\n5:53\nif we doubled the pieces we would have 12 pieces.\n5:56\nWe could say six times three, which is 18,\n5:59\nor six times four, we could divide each\n6:01\nof our sixths into four pieces,\n6:03\nand we'd have six times four which is 24 or 24ths.\n6:09\nAnd so on, again, I'll stop at 24\n6:11\nsince it's the largest number we need to consider.\n6:15\nSo down to our answer choices,\n6:17\nwhat numbers could we use for the denominator?\n6:20\nCould we use eight?\n6:21\nLet's look at these lists.\n6:23\nEight is a multiple of four, so we could definitely split\n6:27\nfourths into eighths, but eight is not a multiple of six,\n6:31\nso we can not split sixths into eighths.\n6:35\nSo...\n6:36\nEight will not work as a denominator for both fractions.\n6:42\nHow about 12?\n6:44\n12 we can see is a multiple of four, and we showed that,\n6:47\nwe drew that already.\n6:49\nAnd 12 is a multiple of six,\n6:51\nwe could split our sixths into two equal pieces each\n6:53\nand we would have 12ths.\n6:55\nSo 12 does work, 12 is a denominator,\n6:59\na common denominator for fourths and sixths.\n7:03\n18, 18 is here on the sixths.\n7:06\nWe could split sixths into 18\n7:08\nbecause 18 is a multiple of six,\n7:10\nbut it is not a multiple of four.\n7:13\nSo we can rule out 18, 18 is not a common denominator.\n7:17\nAnd 24, you may remember, was the last number\n7:21\nwe wrote on both of them.\n7:22\nSo yes, 24 could be a denominator\n7:26\nfor fourths and sixths.\n7:28\nSo we could use either 12 or 24,\n7:31\nand there's a lot more numbers we could use too\n7:33\nas common denominators, but from these choices\n7:36\nwe could use 12 or 24 as a common denominator\n7:40\nfor fourths and sixths.\n7:43\nAnd just a note, lots of times people like\n7:45\nto use the smallest one, the least common denominator,\n7:48\nwhich in this case is 12.\n7:50\nAnd it makes a lot of sense because it's easier\n7:52\nto do computation with smaller numbers,\n7:54\nbut you don't absolutely have to use the smallest one.\n7:58\nYou could use 12ths or 24ths or lots of other options.\n8:02\nBut again, 12ths is probably the simplest one\n8:05\nto work with just 'cause generally it's easier\n8:07\nto work with smaller numbers.\n8:10\nBut for this question, the common denominators\n8:12\nwe can use from these choices\n8:14\nfor fourths and sixths are 12 and 24.",

truly random numbers\n0:24\nby measuring random fluctuations, known as noise.\n0:28\nWhen we measure this noise, known as sampling,\n0:32\nwe can obtain numbers.\n0:34\n- [Voiceover] One, two, three, four--\n0:36\n- [Voiceover] For example, if we measure\n0:37\nthe electric current of TV static over time,\n0:40\nwe will generate a truly random sequence.\n0:45\nWe can visualize this random sequence\n0:47\nby drawing a path that changes direction\n0:50\naccording to each number, known as a random walk.\n0:54\nNotice the lack of pattern at all scales.\n0:57\nAt each point in the sequence\n0:59\nthe next move is always unpredictable.\n1:03\nRandom processes are said to be nondeterministic,\n1:07\nsince they are impossible to determine in advance.\n1:11\nMachines, on the other hand, are deterministic.\n1:14\nTheir operation is predictable and repeatable.\n1:18\nIn 1946, John von Neumann was involved\n1:20\nin running computations for the military;\n1:23\nspecifically involved in the design of the hydrogen bomb.\n1:29\nUsing a computer called the ENIAC,\n1:31\nhe planned to repeatedly calculate approximations\n1:33\nof the processes involved in nuclear fission.\n1:37\nHowever, this required quick access\n1:38\nto randomly generated numbers\n1:40\nthat could be repeated, if needed.\n1:43\nHowever, the ENIAC had very limited internal memory;\n1:46\nstoring long random sequences was not possible.\n1:50\nSo, Neumann developed an algorithm\n1:52\nto mechanically simulate the scrambling aspect\n1:55\nof randomness as follows:\n1:58\nFirst, select a truly random number, called the \"seed\".\n2:02\nThis number could come from the measurement of noise,\n2:04\nor the current time in milliseconds.\n2:07\nNext, this seed is provided as input\n2:09\nto a simple calculation.\n2:12\nMultiply the seed by itself,\n2:14\nand then output the middle of this result.\n2:18\nThen you use this output as the next seed,\n2:20\nand repeat the process as many times as needed.\n2:26\nThis is known as the middle-squares method\n2:28\nand is just the first in a long line\n2:30\nof pseudorandom number generators.\n2:34\nThe randomness of the sequence is dependent on\n2:36\nthe randomness of the initial seed only.\n2:39\nSame seed, same sequence.\n2:41\nSo, what are the differences between\n2:43\na randomly generated versus\n2:45\npseudorandomly generated sequence?\n2:51\nLet's represent each sequence as a random walk.\n2:58\nThey seem similar until we speed things up.\n3:02\nThe pseudorandom sequence must eventually repeat.\n3:06\nThis occurs when the algorithm reaches a seed\n3:09\nit has previously used, and the cycle repeats.\n3:13\nThe length, before a pseudorandom sequence repeats,\n3:16\nis called \"the period\".\n3:19\nThe period is strictly limited\n3:21\nby the length of the initial seed.\n3:24\nFor example, if we use a two-digit seed,\n3:27\nthen an algorithm can produce, at most,\n3:29\n100 numbers, before reusing a seed\n3:32\nand repeating the cycle.\n3:34\nA three-digit seed can't expand past 1,000 numbers\n3:38\nbefore repeating its cycle,\n3:40\nand a four-digit seed can't expand\n3:43\npast 10,000 numbers before repeating.\n3:46\nThough if we use a seed large enough,\n3:49\nthe sequence can expand\n3:50\ninto trillions and trillions of digits before repeating.\n3:57\nThough the key difference is important.\n3:59\nWhen you generate numbers pseudorandomly,\n4:02\nthere are many sequences which cannot occur.\n4:06\nFor example, if Alice generates a truly random sequence\n4:09\nof 20 shifts, it's equivalent to a uniform selection\n4:14\nfrom the stack of all possible sequences of shifts.\n4:17\nThis stack contains 26 to the power of 20 pages,\n4:21\nwhich is astronomical in size.\n4:24\nIf we stood at the bottom and shined a light upwards,\n4:27\na person at the top would not see the light\n4:30\nfor around 200,000,000 years.\n4:33\nCompare this to Alice generating\n4:35\na 20 digit pseudorandom sequence,\n4:37\nusing a four-digit random seed.\n4:40\nNow, this is equivalent to a uniform selection\n4:43\nfrom 10,000 possible initial seeds,\n4:47\nmeaning she can only generate\n4:49\n10,000 different sequences,\n4:52\nwhich is a vanishingly small fraction\n4:55\nof all possible sequences.\n4:57\nWhen we move from random to pseudorandom shifts,\n5:00\nwe shrink the key space into\n5:03\na much, much smaller seed-space.\n5:06\nSo, for a pseudorandom sequence to be indistinguishable\n5:10\nfrom a randomly generated sequence,\n5:12\nit must be impractical for a computer\n5:15\nto try all seeds and look for a match.\n5:19\nThis leads to an important distinction\n5:21\nin computer science, between what is possible,\n5:24\nversus what is possible in a reasonable amount of time.\n5:29\nWe use the same logic when we buy a bike lock.\n5:32\nWe know that anybody can simply try\n5:34\nall possible combinations,\n5:35\nuntil they find a match and it opens.\n5:38\nBut it would take them days to do so.\n5:40\nSo, for eight hours we assume it's practically safe.\n5:46\nWith pseudorandom generators,\n5:48\nthe security increases as the length of the seed increases.\n5:54\nIf the most powerful computer would take\n5:56\nhundreds of years to run through all seeds,\n5:59\nthen we safely can assume it's practically secure,\n6:04\ninstead of perfectly secure.\n6:07\nAs computers get faster\n6:09\nthe seed size must increase accordingly.\n6:14\nPseudorandomness frees Alice and Bob\n6:16\nfrom having to share their\n6:18\nentire random shift sequence in advance.\n6:22\nInstead, they share a relatively short random seed,\n6:25\nand expand it into the same\n6:27\nrandom-looking sequence when needed.\n6:31\nBut what happens if they can never meet\n6:33\nto share this random seed?",

But I'll give you a\n0:36\nhint, and if you want a path to learn it in, you should\n0:39\nlearn about Fourier series and Fourier Transforms, which are\n0:42\nvery similar to Laplace Transforms. And that'll\n0:44\nactually build up the intuition on what the\n0:48\nfrequency domain is all about.\n0:50\nWell anyway, let's actually use the Laplace Transform to\n0:53\nsolve a differential equation.\n0:54\nAnd this is one we've seen before.\n0:56\nSo let me see.\n0:59\nSo let's say the differential equation is y prime prime,\n1:03\nplus 5, times the first derivative, plus\n1:07\n6y, is equal to 0.\n1:09\nAnd you know how to solve this one, but I just want to show\n1:10\nyou, with a fairly straightforward differential\n1:13\nequation, that you could solve it with the Laplace Transform.\n1:15\nAnd actually, you end up having a\n1:17\ncharacteristic equation.\n1:19\nAnd the initial conditions are y of 0 is equal to 2, and y\n1:27\nprime of 0 is equal to 3.\n1:32\nNow, to use the Laplace Transform here, we essentially\n1:36\njust take the Laplace Transform of both sides of\n1:38\nthis equation.\n1:40\nLet me use a more vibrant color.\n1:42\nSo we get the Laplace Transform of y the second\n1:47\nderivative, plus-- well we could say the Laplace\n1:51\nTransform of 5 times y prime, but that's the same thing as 5\n1:53\ntimes the Laplace Transform-- y prime.\n1:59\ny prime plus 6 times the Laplace Transform of y.\n2:06\nAnd let me ask you a question.\n2:06\nWhat's the Laplace Transform of 0?\n2:09\nLet me do that.\n2:11\nSo the Laplace Transform of 0 would be be the integral from\n2:12\n0 to infinity, of 0 times e to the minus stdt.\n2:19\nSo this is a 0 in here.\n2:20\nSo this is equal to 0.\n2:21\nSo the Laplace Transform of 0 is 0.\n2:23\nAnd that's good, because I didn't have space to do\n2:25\nanother curly L.\n2:28\nSo what are the Laplace Transforms of these things?\n2:30\nWell this is where we break out one of the useful\n2:33\nproperties that we learned.\n2:36\nLet me write it over here.\n2:37\nI think that's going to need as much\n2:40\nreal estate as possible.\n2:42\nLet me erase this.\n2:48\nSo we learned that the Laplace Transform-- I'll do it here.\n2:52\nActually, I'll do it down here.\n2:54\nThe Laplace Transform of f prime, or we could even say y\n3:01\nprime, is equal to s times the Laplace Transform of\n3:08\ny, minus y of 0.\n3:13\nWe proved that to you.\n3:15\nAnd this is extremely important to know.\n3:19\nSo let's see if we can apply that.\n3:20\nSo the Laplace Transform of y prime prime, if we apply that,\n3:23\nthat's equal to s times the Laplace Transform of-- well if\n3:33\nwe go from y prime to y, you're just taking the\n3:35\nanti-derivative, so if you're taking the anti-derivative of\n3:37\ny, of the second derivative, we just end up with the first\n3:40\nderivative-- minus the first derivative at 0.\n3:45\nNotice, we're already using our initial conditions.\n3:48\nI won't substitute it just yet.\n3:51\nAnd then we end up with plus 5, times-- I'll write it every\n3:56\ntime-- so plus 5 times the Laplace Transform of y prime,\n4:07\nplus 6 times the Laplace Transform of y.\n4:12\nAll of that is equal to 0.\n4:13\nSo just to be clear, all I did is I expanded this into this\n4:20\nusing this.\n4:22\nSo how can we rewrite the Laplace Transform of y prime?\n4:25\nWell, we could use this once again, so let's do that.\n4:27\nSo this over here-- I'll do it in magenta-- this is equal to\n4:31\ns times what?\n4:34\ns times the Laplace Transform of y prime.\n4:38\nWell that's s times the Laplace Transform of y, minus\n4:48\ny of 0, right?\n4:52\nI took this part and replaced it with what I have in\n4:55\nparentheses.\n4:56\nSo minus y prime of 0-- and now I'll switch colors-- plus\n5:05\n5 times-- once again the Laplace Transform of y prime.\n5:09\nWell we can use this again.\n5:10\nSo 5 times s times Laplace Transform of y, minus y of 0,\n5:24\nplus 6 times the Laplace Transform-- oh I ran out of\n5:27\nspace, I'll do it in another line-- plus 6 times the\n5:31\nLaplace Transform of y.\n5:34\nAll of that is equal to 0.\n5:35\nI know this looks really confusing but we'll\n5:36\nsimplify right now.\n5:37\nAnd we could get rid of this right here, because we've used\n5:39\nit as much as we need to.\n5:42\nSo now we just simplify.\n5:45\nAnd notice, using the Laplace Transform, we didn't have to\n5:46\nguess at a general solution or anything like that.\n5:49\nEven when we did a characteristic equation, we\n5:50\nguessed what the original general solution was.\n5:53\nNow we're just taking Laplace Transforms, and let's see\n5:54\nwhere this gets us.\n5:57\nAnd actually I just want to make clear, because I know\n5:59\nit's very confusing, so I rewrote this part as this.\n6:09\nAnd I rewrote this thing as this.\n6:14\nAnd everything else is the same.\n6:15\nBut now let's simplify the math.\n6:17\nSo we get s squared, times the Laplace Transform of y-- I'm\n6:23\ngoing to write smaller, I've learned my lesson-- minus s\n6:28\ntimes y of 0.\n6:32\nLet's substitute y of 0 here. y of 0 is 2, so s times y of 0\n6:35\nis 2 times s, so 2s, distribute that s, minus y\n6:41\nprime of 0.\n6:42\nY prime of 0 is 3.\n6:44\nSo minus 3, plus-- so we have 5 times s times the Laplace\n6:52\nTransform of y, so plus 5s times the Laplace Transform of\n6:58\ny, minus 5 times y of 0. y of 0 is 2, so minus 10.\n7:07\nMinus 10, right?\n7:08\n5 times-- this is 2 right here-- so 5 times 2, plus 6\n7:14\ntimes the Laplace Transform of y.\n7:18\nAll of that is equal to 0.\n7:22\nNow, let's group our Laplace Transform of y terms and our\n7:26\nconstant terms, and we should be hopefully\n7:28\ngetting some place.\n7:30\nSo let's see, my Laplace Transform of y terms, I have\n7:33\nthis one, I have this one, and I have that one.\n7:39\nSo what am I left with?\n7:40\nWell let me factor out the Laplace Transform of y part.\n7:43\nSo I get the Laplace Transform of y-- and that's good because\n7:47\nit's a pain to keep writing it over and over-- times s\n7:50\nsquared plus 5s plus 6.\n8:02\nSo those are all my Laplace Transform terms. And then I\n8:05\nhave my constant terms. So let's see, I have 1s, so minus\n8:09\n2s, minus 3, minus 10, is equal to 0.\n8:20\nAnd what can we do here?\n8:21\nWell, this is interesting, first of all.\n8:23\nNotice that the coefficients on the Laplace Transform of y\n8:28\nterms, that those are that characteristic equation that\n8:31\nwe dealt with so much, and that is hopefully, to some\n8:33\ndegree, second nature to you.\n8:34\nSo that's a little bit of a clue, and if you want some\n8:38\nvery tenuous connections, well that makes a lot of sense.\n8:40\nBecause the characteristic equation to get that, we\n8:43\nsubstituted e to the rt, and the Laplace Transform involves\n8:47\nvery similar function.\n8:48\nBut anyway, let's go back to the problem.\n8:49\nSo how do we solve this?\n8:51\nAnd actually, let me just give you the big picture here,\n8:53\nbecause this is a good point.\n8:54\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm going to solve this.\n8:56\nI'm going to say the Laplace Transform of\n8:58\ny is equal to something.\n9:00\nAnd then I'm going to say, boy, what functions the\n9:03\nLaplace Transform is at something?\n9:05\nAnd then I'll have the solution.\n9:06\nIf that confuses you, just wait and hopefully it'll make\n9:09\nsome sense.\n9:09\nFrom here until that point it's just some\n9:11\nfairly hairy algebra.\n9:13\nSo let's scroll down a little bit, just so we have some\n9:16\nbreathing room.\n9:17\nAnd so I get the Laplace Transform of y, times s\n9:23\nsquared, plus 5s, plus 6, is equal to-- let's add these\n9:29\nterms to both sides of this equation-- is equal to 2s plus\n9:34\n3 plus 10-- oh, that's silly-- plus 13.\n9:40\nThis is minus 13 here.\n9:42\nA phone call.\n9:44\nWho's calling?\n9:45\nI think it's some kind of marketing phone call.\n9:48\nAnyway, 2s plus 13, and now what can I do?\n9:51\nWell.\n9:51\nLet's divide both sides by this s squared plus 5s plus 6.\n9:55\nSo I get the Laplace Transform of y is equal to 2s plus 13,\n10:08\nover s squared plus 5s plus 6.\n10:13\nNow we're almost done.\n10:15\nEverything here is just a little bit of algebra.\n10:17\nSo now we're almost done.\n10:19\nWe haven't solved for y yet, but we know that the Laplace\n10:21\nTransform of y is equal to this.\n10:23\nNow, if we just had this in our table of our Laplace\n10:27\nTransforms, we would immediately know what y was,\n10:29\nbut I don't see something, or I don't remember anything we\n10:31\ndid in our table that looks like this expression of s.\n10:35\nI'm essentially out of time, so the next video we're going\n10:39\nto figure out what functions Laplace Transform is this.\n10:42\nAnd it actually turns out it's a sum of things we already\n10:45\nknow, and we just have to manipulate this a little bit\n10:47\nalgebraically.\n10:48\nSee you in the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\n- [Voiceover] Let's say that this is a red blood cell.\n0:04\nWhat makes up the outer layer of this red blood cell?\n0:08\nSince it's a cell, it has a cell membrane,\n0:11\nand that's made up of lipids.\n0:13\nBut embedded in those lipids, there's all kinds of proteins\n0:16\nand molecules, some of which I'm drawing here,\n0:20\nthat have all kinds of different functions.\n0:23\nThere are two of them that are sort of\n0:25\nmore important than the others,\n0:26\nat least for this topic that we're going to talk about,\n0:28\nand those are the A molecule and the B molecule.\n0:34\nI think you'll be pretty happy with those names,\n0:36\nnot too hard to remember.\n0:38\nI'm actually calling them molecules and not proteins\n0:40\nbecause they're actually not proteins.\n0:43\nThey are actually something called glycolipids,\n0:47\nwhich I actually didn't realize at first.\n0:50\nGlycolipids, glyco meaning a sugar group,\n0:54\nlipid meaning a fat group,\n0:55\nso it's some kind of mix of a sugar and fat.\n0:58\nYou can look it up if you're interested.\n1:04\nWhat's interesting, is that not all people\n1:05\nhave both of these molecules, these glycolipids,\n1:09\non their red blood cells.\n1:11\nSome people do have both, but some have only one.\n1:16\nFor example, some people might have only the A,\n1:20\nor, as you can imagine, some people would have only the B,\n1:23\nand some people, can you figure out the last possibility?\n1:28\nSome people have neither A nor B.\n1:31\nOf course, all these people have all kinds of other\n1:34\nproteins and molecules embedded in their red blood cells.\n1:41\nThe reason why we care about this\n1:42\nand why I'm talking about these As and these Bs,\n1:45\nis that in medicine, we often\n1:47\nhave to give blood transfusions.\n1:50\nLet's say you got in a car accident\n1:51\nand you lost a lot of blood.\n1:53\nYou're rushed to the hospital.\n1:54\nIf you've lost enough blood,\n1:56\nthey'll give you a transfusion of blood.\n1:58\nTransfusion just means they'll put a needle in your vein\n2:00\nand pump blood into your veins.\n2:03\nIt turns out that you can't just give any blood to anyone,\n2:06\nand it has to do with these A and B groups.\n2:10\nFor example, it turns out, and we'll explain this,\n2:13\nbut for example, it turns out that if you\n2:16\nare the kind of person who has this kind of blood\n2:18\nthat only has As on your blood cells,\n2:22\nthen it turns out that you can't get a blood transfusion\n2:24\nfrom someone who has this kind of blood, As and Bs.\n2:29\nLet's learn why.\n2:31\nIf you remember from the immune system,\n2:33\nthere's something called an antibody.\n2:34\nWe usually draw it in this shape here.\n2:37\nIf you remember from the immune system,\n2:39\nyour body has something called antibodies,\n2:43\nand it uses these antibodies to fight things\n2:45\nthat it doesn't want in the body.\n2:48\nFor example, if you have a bacterium,\n2:50\nI'm drawing one here, you'll have an antibody\n2:53\nthat will bind to that bacterium.\n2:54\nThe purpose of that is that now your body knows\n2:57\nthat is should destroy this bacterium.\n3:00\nThis antibody is kind of like a tag\n3:02\nthat marks this guy for destruction.\n3:06\nBut your body is very careful not to make\n3:08\nantibodies against itself, which is obvious, right?\n3:12\nIf your body made antibodies against itself,\n3:14\nthen it would start to attack itself.\n3:17\nFor that reason, someone who has this kind of blood,\n3:20\nwhich means that all of their red blood cells\n3:22\nhave As and Bs on them, that person\n3:26\nwould not want to make antibodies against\n3:29\nthe A and the B molecule, because if they did\n3:31\nthen their body would attack all of their red blood cells.\n3:35\nThese people don't have these antibodies.\n3:38\nBut, let's say if you have this kind of blood,\n3:41\nthen you might not make an antibody against\n3:45\nthe A molecule, but you can make it against\n3:48\nthe B molecule, because the B is not in your body,\n3:52\nand so there's no risk that your body is going to attack\n3:54\nitself by making an antibody against the B molecule.\n3:59\nSo these guys don't have the A antibody,\n4:02\nbut they do have the B antibody.\n4:04\nThese guys, on the other hand,\n4:06\nthey can have the A antibody,\n4:08\nbut they don't want the B antibody\n4:10\nbecause then they would attack themselves.\n4:13\nThis final guy, can you guess what he has?\n4:16\nHe can actually have both A and B antibodies.\n4:20\nHe actually will have both,\n4:22\nbecause that's the way your immune system works.\n4:24\nIt makes antibodies against pretty much anything\n4:27\nthat is not you, that is not yourself.\n4:30\nA and B molecules are not part of this guy.\n4:33\nHe has none of them, so he'll make antibodies against them.\n4:36\nLet me ask you, what would happen if this guy,\n4:41\nsomeone with just A blood, type A blood,\n4:44\ngot in a car accident and needed a transfusion?\n4:47\nLet's say they're rushed to the hospital\n4:48\nand you give them blood from someone with A and B molecules.\n4:54\nWhat would happen is that this guy's antibodies\n4:56\nagain B would go and bind to the B molecules\n5:01\non the blood that he's just received,\n5:03\nand then his body would start to destroy\n5:05\nall of these cells that he just received.\n5:08\nThat's bad because, first of all, it's a waste.\n5:11\nYou gave this guy blood\n5:12\nand now he's just going to destroy it.\n5:13\nBut second of all, it's going to cause a huge\n5:15\namount of inflammation, because this guy's body\n5:18\nis going to suddenly see all these antigens\n5:21\nthat he thinks are really dangerous,\n5:23\nand it's going to cause his whole immune system\n5:25\nto rev up, and that will actually be bad for him.\n5:29\nLet's go through all the different possible transfusions\n5:32\nbetween these different kinds of people.\n5:35\nLet's go through them methodically by drawing a table.\n5:39\nOn one side of the table we'll have the donors.\n5:44\nBear with me as I draw this table out.\n5:46\nWe'll have AB donor, A donor, type B donor,\n5:51\nand do you know what we call this kind of blood?\n5:53\nWe can't call it type B or type A\n5:55\nbecause that's these guys,\n5:56\nso we actually call this O, type O.\n6:00\nThen we also have the same guys as possible recipients,\n6:05\nso we have type AB blood recipient,\n6:07\ntype A blood recipient, type B blood recipient,\n6:10\nand type O blood recipient.\n6:13\nLet's make this into a table.\n6:19\nHere are our donors, blood donors,\n6:24\nand here are our blood recipients.\n6:31\nWhat did we say before?\n6:32\nWe said that someone with type A blood\n6:35\ncannot receive blood from someone with type AB blood.\n6:39\nSo that means that A recipient with AB donor is no good.\n6:45\nWell, how about someone with AB blood?\n6:48\nCan they receive blood from someone with AB blood?\n6:51\nThe answer is yes, because the guy with AB blood\n6:54\nhas no antibodies against A or B,\n6:56\nso he won't attack the AB blood that is given to him.\n7:00\nWhy don't you pause the video for a moment\n7:02\nand try to fill in the rest of this table?\n7:07\nHopefully you've paused for a second\n7:09\nand tried to fill in the rest of the table.\n7:11\nNow we'll fill it in together.\n7:13\nSomeone with AB blood can receive blood from A,\n7:17\nhe can receive blood from B,\n7:18\nand he can receive blood from O\n7:21\nbecause he has no antibodies to either A or B,\n7:25\nso he won't react to any of these guys.\n7:28\nLikewise, someone with type A blood can, of course,\n7:30\nreceive from A, B can receive from B,\n7:33\nO can receive

everyone.\n7:53\nSomething interesting you'll notice here is,\n7:55\nas we just said, O can give to anyone\n7:59\nbecause the O blood type has no As or Bs on it,\n8:03\nso no one's going to react to it.\n8:06\nFor that reason, we call O the universal donor.\n8:17\nThe other interesting thing you'll notice\n8:18\nis that AB can receive from everyone.\n8:23\nFor that reason, we call him the universal recipient.\n8:35\nAll these things, by the way,\n8:37\nAB, A, B, O, these are blood types.\n8:41\nSo when someone asks you for your blood type,\n8:43\nthis is what they're referring to.\n8:45\nThis is why it's really important to know your blood type\n8:49\nif you're ever going to require a blood transfusion.",

new series.\n0:09\nHowever, this one won't end here.\n0:11\nIf anything, we are kind of at the beginning still.\n0:14\nSo I'm going to do 3 different checkpoint videos.\n0:17\nThis one is on 'Advanced Lessons'.\n0:20\nHowever, I also want to eventually talk about Tests and Challenges,\n0:24\nand what we can do with more interactive explorations\n0:27\nand computer science lessons as it applies to cryptography.\n0:31\nBut for now, let's talk about Advanced Lessons.\n0:33\nWhen I say 'Advanced', I don't necessarily mean 'harder lessons',\n0:37\nI mean 'more detailed'.\n0:39\nLet me give you a conceptual idea\n0:41\nfor what I think this series could be and future series.\n0:45\nI like to think of each series as the trunk of a tree,\n0:48\nwhere I took you from prehistoric times\n0:51\nto around the 20th century, which is here,\n0:53\nwith a few different threads.\n0:55\nAnd these ideas kind of branch apart.\n0:59\nOnce you get to the 20th and 21st centuries,\n1:01\nthey start getting highly specific.\n1:04\nAnd way down here on the leaves are current research questions,\n1:09\nwhich over here might be\n1:11\nproblems related to prime number distribution\n1:13\nand over here some very specific work being done\n1:18\non randomized algorithms or hash functions,\n1:21\nand way up here we might have new public key protocols\n1:27\n- because RSA was just the first -\n1:29\nor we also have encryption standards such as DES and AES.\n1:33\nWe would have a whole new branch on quantum cryptography.\n1:37\nSo as you can see, there are so many different things\n1:40\nthat branch out of this series\n1:41\nand I couldn't possibly do justice to them all.\n1:44\nSo I think of this video as living right here.\n1:46\nAt kind of a junction point.\n1:49\nNow I can branch off with help of the community\n1:52\nand possibly other video creators\n1:54\nto fill out this tree gradually over time.\n1:58\nSpecifically with the help of the community.\n2:01\nI am really excited about the Q&A community\n2:04\nand the work being done to improve\n2:06\nhow people can help people on Khan Academy.\n2:09\nSo, for example,\n2:11\nin terms of where one of these branches can go,\n2:15\nI've noticed clusters of questions\n2:17\nkind of leading into a common branch.\n2:20\nFor example, under 'the pseudo-random number generator',\n2:23\nI have two questions here: one by Sonny and one by Drakain.\n2:26\nDrakain's question is:\n2:27\n\"Why has he suggested that time in milliseconds...\n2:31\n...is a suitable random seed?...\n2:33\nThis is a huge no-no in security. ...\n2:35\nThe time it is on your machine...\n2:38\n...is the time it is on my machine,...\n2:40\n...give or take 100 milliseconds...\n2:42\n(which can be brute-force attacked)\"\n2:44\nAnd again, this is a great question too\n2:46\nbecause it speaks to the need that\n2:48\nI didn't present a cryptographically secure pseudo-random generator.\n2:53\nSo the middle square's method is back here\n2:56\nin early 20th century, but up until today,\n2:59\nwe are not using the middle square's method\n3:02\nand that's a whole interesting branch.\n3:05\nIt is these sorts of questions which cluster together\n3:08\nand really drive new content.\n3:12\nI want to show you a really interesting example\n3:14\nof how this has happened already.\n3:16\nThis is a question Samuel asked on the 'One time pad'-video\n3:20\nhe said: \"wouldn't a computer be able to test all the possibilities very fast?\"\n3:24\nand Chuck Patrol basically asked the same question.\n3:28\nI see this happening a lot.\n3:30\nSimilar questions all speak to the need of a new video.\n3:33\nSo I went and created a video on 'perfect secrecy'\n3:37\nwhich really nails down\n3:39\nhow you can't beat randomness in the world of encryption.\n3:43\nOut of this video, Dawn made a really great comment.\n3:48\nWhat they did, was basically summarise my video in two sentences.\n3:52\nSo, this is what I want to try to do more of\n3:55\nin filling out these branches:\n3:56\ntake questions, make new content,\n3:58\nand have this feed-back loop and see what we can do.\n4:03\nNow what I would really love,\n4:05\nis for you to ask questions below this video\n4:08\nwhich arise after watching the entire series.\n4:12\nNot specific details about certain video's,\n4:14\n- those can go with the videos -\n4:16\nbut new questions, which are opening new can of worms.\n4:19\nAnd what I think will be fun to do, is:\n4:22\nYour question will lead to answers,\n4:26\nby both me and the rest of the community,\n4:30\nso we'll have multiple answers.\n4:32\nAnd what I can do is take this body of answers,\n4:35\nand out of this draft up a rough script\n4:40\nfor more advanced videos on specific topics\n4:43\nthat sub-sets of the community care about\n4:47\nSo hopefully, out of the discussion below,\n4:49\nover time we can grow a bunch of new videos!\n4:53\nI want to be clear: this is an ongoing process.\n4:56\nThis will not happen tomorrow or next week.\n4:59\nI hope it can happen months, even years from now.\n5:02\nWe can still be building out new videos after the series\n5:05\nand these videos can be a collaborative effort\n5:08\nbetween myself and the community\n5:10\nand perhaps other video creators down the road.\n5:13\nSo, let me know what you think below,\n5:15\nand let's get

So why do we have all these\n0:18\nXs and Ys and Zs and ABCs when we start dealing with Algebra?\n0:21\nYeah, exactly.\n0:22\nThat's interesting, well why don't we let people think about that for a second.\n0:28\nSo Sal, how would you answer this question?\n0:30\nWhy do we need letters in Algebra?\n0:32\nSo why letters. So there are a couple of ways I'd think about it.\n0:35\nOne is if you have an unknown.\n0:38\nSo if I were to write X plus three is equal to ten\n0:44\nthe reason why we're doing this is that we don't know what X is\n0:46\nIt's literally an unknown.\n0:48\nAnd so we're going to solve for it in some way.\n0:50\nBut it did not have to be the letter X.\n0:51\nWe could have literally written blank plus three is equal to ten.\n0:55\nOr we could have written Question Mark plus three is equal to ten.\n0:59\nSo it didn't have to be letters, but we needed some type of symbol.\n1:03\nIt literally could've been Smiley Face plus three is equal to ten.\n1:07\nBut until you know it, you need some type of a symbol to represent whatever that number is.\n1:12\nNow we can go and solve this equation and then know what that symbol represents.\n1:15\nBut if we knew it ahead of time, it wouldn't be an unknown.\n1:17\nIt wouldn't be something that we didn't know.\n1:20\nSo that's one reason why I would use letters\n1:23\nand where just numbers by itself wouldn't be helpful.\n1:26\nThe other is when you're describing relationships between numbers.\n1:28\nSo I could do something like - I could say - that\n1:32\nwhenever you give me a three, I'm going to give you a four.\n1:38\nAnd I could say, if you give me a five, I'm going to give you a six.\n1:43\nAnd i could keep going on and on forever.\n1:46\nIf you give me a 7.1, I'm going to give you an 8.1.\n1:51\nAnd I could keep listing this on and on forever.\n1:54\nMaybe you could give me any number, and I could tell you what I'm going to give you.\n1:57\nBut I would obviously run out of space and time if I were to list all of them.\n2:00\nAnd we could do that much more elegantly if we used letters to describe the relationship.\n2:06\nMaybe what you give me we call X, and what I give you we call Y.\n2:11\nAnd so I say, look, whatever you give me, I'm going to add one to it.\n2:14\nAnd that's what I'm going to give back to you.\n2:16\nAnd so now, this very simple equation here\n2:20\ncan describe an infinite number of relationships between X\n2:24\nor an infinite number of corresponding Ys and Xs.\n2:28\nSo now someone knows whatever X you give me\n2:31\nyou give me three, I add one to it, and I'm going to give you four.\n2:34\nYou give me 7.1, I'm going to add one to it and give you 8.1.\n2:38\nSo there is no more elegant way that you could've done it than by using symbols.\n2:41\nWith that said, I didn't have to use Xs and Ys.\n2:43\nThis is just a convention that kind of comes to use from history.\n2:46\nI could've defined what you give me as Star\n2:49\nand what I give you as Smiley Face\n2:54\nand this also would've been a valid way to express this.\n2:57\nSo the letters are really just symbols. Nothing more.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWe have the absolute value of 2r minus 3 and 1/4 is less\n0:05\nthan 2 and 1/2, and we want to solve for r.\n0:08\nSo right from the get go we have to deal with this\n0:10\nabsolute value.\n0:11\nAnd just as a bit of a review, if I were to say that the\n0:14\nabsolute value of x is less than, well let's just say,\n0:18\nless than 2 and 1/2, that means that the distance from x\n0:21\nto 0 is less than 2 and 1/2.\n0:24\nThat means that x would have to be less than 2 and 1/2, and\n0:32\nx would have to be greater than negative 2 and 1/2.\n0:36\nAnd just think about it for a second.\n0:38\nIf I were to draw it on a number line right here, that\n0:43\nis 0, that is 2 and 1/2, and that is negative 2 and 1/2.\n0:50\nThese two numbers are exactly 2 and 1/2 away from 0, because\n0:53\nboth of their absolute values is 2 and 1/2.\n0:56\nNow, if we want all of the numbers whose absolute value\n0:58\nis less than 2 and 1/2, or that are less than 2 and 1/2\n1:02\naway from 0, it would be all of the numbers in between.\n1:08\nAnd that's exactly what these two statements are saying. x\n1:11\nhas to be less than 2 and 1/2, and it has to be greater than\n1:15\nnegative 2 and 1/2.\n1:17\nIf this absolute value were the other way, that the\n1:19\nabsolute value of x has to be greater than 2 and 1/2, then\n1:21\nit would be the numbers outside of this, and\n1:23\nit would be an or.\n1:24\nBut we're dealing with the less than situation right\n1:26\nthere, so let's just do what we were able to figure out\n1:29\nwhen it was just an x.\n1:30\nThe distance from this thing to 0 has to be less than 2 and\n1:36\n1/2, so we can write that 2r minus 3 and 1/4 has to be less\n1:45\nthan 2 and 1/2 and 2r minus 3 and 1/4 has to be greater than\n1:55\nnegative 2 and 1/2.\n1:58\nSame exact reasoning here.\n1:59\nLet me draw a line so we don't get confused.\n2:01\nSame exact reasoning here.\n2:03\nThis quantity right here has to be between\n2:06\nnegative 2 and 1/2.\n2:08\nIt has to be greater than negative 2\n2:09\nand 1/2 right there.\n2:12\nAnd it has to be less than 2 and 1/2, so\n2:15\nthat's all I wrote there.\n2:16\nSo let's solve each of these independently.\n2:19\nWell, this first went over here, you've learned before\n2:22\nthat I don't like improper fractions, and I don't like\n2:26\nfractions in general.\n2:27\nSo let's make all of these fractions.\n2:29\nSorry, I don't like mixed numbers.\n2:31\nI want them to be improper fractions.\n2:32\nSo let's turn all of these into improper fractions.\n2:34\nSo if I were to rewrite it, we get 2r minus 3 and 1/4 is the\n2:38\nsame thing as 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n2:42\n2r minus 13/4 is less than-- 2 times 2 is 4, plus 1 is five--\n2:50\nis less than 5/2.\n2:51\nSo that's the first equation.\n2:53\nAnd then the second question-- and do the same thing here--\n2:56\nwe have 2r minus 13 over 4 has to be a greater\n3:02\nthan negative 5/2.\n3:04\nAll right, now let's solve each of these independently.\n3:08\nTo get rid of the fractions, the easiest thing to do is to\n3:10\nmultiply both sides of this equation by 4.\n3:13\nThat'll eliminate all of the fractions, so let's do that.\n3:15\nLet's multiply-- let me scroll to the left a little bit--\n3:18\nlet's multiply both sides of this equation by 4.\n3:22\nAnd what do we get?\n3:22\n4 times 2r is 8r, 4 times negative 13 over 4 is negative\n3:28\n13, is less than-- and I multiplied by a positive\n3:32\nnumber so I didn't have to worry about swapping the\n3:34\ninequality-- is less than 5/2 times 4 is 10, right?\n3:40\nYou get a 2 and a 1, it's 10.\n3:42\nSo you get 8r minus 13 is less than 10.\n3:46\nNow we can add 13 to both sides of this equation so that\n3:50\nwe get rid of it on the left-hand side.\n3:52\nAdd 13 to both sides and we get 8r-- these guys cancel\n3:56\nout-- is less than 23, and then we divide\n4:02\nboth sides by 8.\n4:06\nAnd once again, we didn't have to worry about the inequality\n4:08\nbecause we're dividing by a positive number.\n4:11\nAnd we get r is less than 23 over 8.\n4:17\nOr, if you want to write that as a mixed number, r is less\n4:20\nthan-- what is that-- 2 and 7/8.\n4:26\nSo that's one condition, but we still have to worry about\n4:28\nthis other condition.\n4:29\nThere was an and right here.\n4:30\nLet's worry about it.\n4:31\nSo our other condition tells us 2r minus 13 over 4 has to\n4:36\nbe greater than negative 5/2.\n4:38\nLet's multiply both sides of this equation by 4.\n4:41\nSo 4 times 2r is 8r.\n4:44\n4 times negative 13 over 4 is negative 13, is greater than\n4:49\nnegative 5/2 times 4 is negative 10.\n4:52\nNow we add 13 to both sides of this equation.\n4:59\nThe left-hand side-- these guys cancel out, you're just\n5:02\nleft with 8r-- is greater than negative 10 plus 13 is 3.\n5:08\nOr divide both sides of this by 8, and you're left with r\n5:13\nhas to be greater than 3/8.\n5:16\nSo our two conditions, r has to be less than 2 and 7/8 and\n5:20\ngreater than 3/8.\n5:21\nOr we can just write it like this: r is greater than 3/8,\n5:26\nso it's greater than-- maybe I should say 3/8 is less than r,\n5:31\nwhich is less than 2 and 7/8.\n5:36\nSo if we were to plot the solution on the number line--\n5:39\nwhich I'm about to do, so that's my number line-- this\n5:44\nis 0 right here, maybe this is 1, 2, and 3.\n5:51\nWe have 2 and 7/8.\n5:53\nWe have to be less than 2 and 7/8.\n5:55\nLet's say that this is 2 and 7/8 right there.\n5:59\nAnd we have to be greater than 3/8.\n6:01\nSay that is 3/8, so 3/8 will be some place\n6:05\nright around there.\n6:06\nAnd everything in between is a valid solution.\n6:12\nAnd we could try it out.\n6:13\nLet's try out something that, based on what I just drew,\n6:15\nshould be a valid solution.\n6:17\n1 should be a valid solution.\n6:18\nLet's try it out here.\n6:19\n2 times 1 minus 3 and 1/4, what is that?\n6:26\nThat's 2 minus 3 and 1/4.\n6:29\nAnd so what is that?\n6:30\n2 minus 3 and 1/4 is-- well, 3 and 1/4 minus 2 is 1 and 1/4,\n6:36\nso this will be negative 1 and 1/4.\n6:39\nBut we're taking the absolute value of it, so we take the\n6:42\nabsolute value of it, which is equal to 1 and 1/4, which is\n6:46\nindeed less than 2 and 1/2.\n6:48\nNow let's try another number.\n6:50\nLet's try 0.\n6:51\nBased on this, 0 should not work.\n6:53\nSo what happens if we put 0 here?\n6:55\nYou get 2 times 0, which is 0, minus 3 and 1/4.\n6:58\nIf you take the absolute value of negative 3 and 1/4, you'll\n7:02\nget positive 3 and 1/4, which won't work.\n7:05\n3 and 1/4 is greater than 2 and 1/2, so that's\n7:08\ntrue, that works out.\n7:09\nAnd same thing for 3.\n7:11\n2 times 3 is 6, minus 3 and 1/4 is 2 and 3/4.\n7:18\nTake the absolute value, it's 2 and 3/4, still bigger than 2\n7:22\nand 1/2, so it won't work.\n7:23\nSo at least the points that we tried out seem to validate\n7:26\nthis solution that we got.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nSo I have two 2-dimensional vectors\n0:02\nright over here, vector a and vector b.\n0:05\nAnd what I want to think about is how can we define\n0:08\nor what would be a reasonable way\n0:09\nto define the sum of vector a plus vector b?\n0:15\nWell, one thing that might jump at your mind\n0:16\nis, look, well, each of these are two dimensional.\n0:19\nThey both have two components.\n0:20\nWhy don't we just add the corresponding components?\n0:23\nSo for the sum, why don't we make the first component\n0:27\nof the sum just a sum of the first two components\n0:30\nof these two vectors.\n0:31\nSo why don't we just make it 6 plus negative 4?\n0:35\nWell, 6 plus negative 4 is equal to 2.\n0:38\nAnd why don't we just make the second component\n0:41\nthe sum of the two second components?\n0:43\nSo negative 2 plus 4 is also equal to 2.\n0:48\nSo we start with two 2-dimensional vectors.\n0:50\nYou add them together, you get another two\n0:52\n2-dimensional vectors.\n0:53\nIf you think about it in terms of real coordinates bases,\n0:56\nboth of these are members of R2--\n0:59\nI'll write this down here just so we get used to the notation.\n1:02\nSo vector a and vector b are both members of R2,\n1:14\nwhich is just another way of saying\n1:15\nthat these are both two tuples.\n1:16\nThey are both two-dimensional vectors right over here.\n1:21\nNow, this might make sense just looking at how we represented\n1:23\nit, but how does this actually make\n1:25\nvisual or conceptual sense?\n1:27\nAnd to do that, let's actually plot these vectors.\n1:29\nLet's try to represent these vectors in some way.\n1:32\nLet's try to visualize them.\n1:33\nSo vector a, we could visualize, this tells us\n1:37\nhow far this vector moves in each\n1:39\nof these directions-- horizontal direction\n1:42\nand vertical direction.\n1:44\nSo if we put the, I guess you could\n1:45\nsay the tail of the vector at the origin-- remember,\n1:48\nwe don't have to put the tail at the origin,\n1:49\nbut that might make it a little bit easier for us to draw it.\n1:52\nWe'll go 6 in the horizontal direction.\n1:53\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n1:56\nAnd then negative 2 in the vertical.\n1:58\nSo negative 2.\n1:59\nSo vector a could look like this.\n2:05\nVector a looks like that.\n2:09\nAnd once again, the important thing\n2:11\nis the magnitude and the direction.\n2:12\nThe magnitude is represented by the length of this vector.\n2:15\nAnd the direction is the direction\n2:17\nthat it is pointed in.\n2:19\nAnd also just to emphasize, I could have drawn vector a\n2:21\nlike that or I could have put it over here.\n2:26\nThese are all equivalent vectors.\n2:30\nThese are all equal to vector a.\n2:32\nAll I really care about is the magnitude and the direction.\n2:37\nSo with that in mind, let's also draw vector b.\n2:40\nVector b in the horizontal direction goes negative 4-- 1,\n2:44\n2, 3, 4, and in the vertical direction goes 4-- 1, 2, 3, 4.\n2:50\nSo its tail if we start at the origin,\n2:52\nif its tail is at the origin, its head\n2:55\nwould be at negative 4, 4.\n2:59\nSo let me draw that just like that.\n3:03\nSo that right over here is vector b.\n3:07\nAnd once again, vector b we could draw it like that\n3:10\nor we could draw it-- let me copy and let me paste it--\n3:15\nso this would also be another way to draw vector b.\n3:21\nOnce again, what I really care about\n3:23\nis its magnitude and its direction.\n3:25\nAll of these green vectors have the same magnitude.\n3:27\nThey all have the same length and they all\n3:29\nhave the same direction.\n3:31\nSo how does the way that I drew vector a and b\n3:33\ngel with what its sum is?\n3:36\nSo let me draw its sum like this.\n3:38\nLet me draw its sum in this blue color.\n3:41\nSo the sum based on this definition we just used,\n3:44\nthe vector addition would be 2, 2.\n3:47\nSo 2, 2.\n3:48\nSo it would look something like this.\n3:53\nSo how does this make sense that the sum,\n3:55\nthat this purple vector plus this green vector\n4:00\nis somehow going to be equal to this blue vector?\n4:02\nI encourage you to pause the video\n4:03\nand think about if that even makes sense.\n4:07\nWell, one way to think about it is this first purple vector,\n4:10\nit shifts us this much.\n4:12\nIt takes us from this point to that point.\n4:14\nAnd so if we were to add it, let's start at this point\n4:16\nand put the green vector's tail right there\n4:18\nand see where it ends up putting us.\n4:22\nSo the green vector, we already have a version.\n4:25\nSo once again, we start the origin.\n4:28\nVector a takes us there.\n4:30\nNow, let's start over there with the green vector\n4:32\nand see where green vector takes us.\n4:34\nAnd this makes sense.\n4:35\nVector a plus vector b.\n4:38\nPut the tail of vector b at the head of vector a.\n4:41\nSo if you were to start at the origin,\n4:43\nvector a takes you there then if you\n4:45\nadd on what vector b takes you, it takes you right over there.\n4:48\nSo relative to the origin, how much did you--\n4:52\nI guess you could say-- shift?\n4:53\nAnd once again, vectors don't only\n4:55\napply to things like displacement.\n4:56\nIt can apply to velocity.\n4:57\nIt can apply to actual acceleration.\n4:58\nIt can apply to a whole series of things,\n5:01\nbut when you visualize it this way,\n5:03\nyou see that it does make complete sense.\n5:05\nThis blue vector, the sum of the two,\n5:08\nis what results where you start with vector a.\n5:11\nAt that point right over there, vector a takes you there,\n5:15\nthen you take vector b's tail, start over there\n5:17\nand it takes you to the tip of the sum.\n5:21\nNow, one question you might be having is well,\n5:23\nvector a plus vector b is this, but what\n5:25\nis vector b plus vector a?\n5:31\nDoes this still work?\n5:33\nWell, based on the definition we had\n5:35\nwhere you add the corresponding components,\n5:37\nyou're still going to get the same sum vector.\n5:39\nSo it should come out the same.\n5:40\nSo this will just be negative 4 plus 6 is 2.\n5:43\n4 plus negative 2 is 2.\n5:46\nBut does that make visual sense?\n5:48\nSo if we start with vector b.\n5:49\nSo let's say you start right over here.\n5:51\nVector b takes you right over there.\n5:54\nAnd then if you were to go there and you\n5:56\nwere to start with vector a-- so let's do that.\n5:59\nSo actually, let me make this a little bit-- actually, let me\n6:02\nstart with a new vector b.\n6:06\nSo let's say that that's our vector b right over there.\n6:11\nAnd then-- actually, let me give this\n6:13\na place where I'll have some space to work with.\n6:15\nSo let's say that's my vector b right over there.\n6:18\nAnd then let me get a copy of the vector a.\n6:22\nThat's a good one.\n6:23\nSo copy and let me paste it.\n6:26\nSo I could put vector a's tail at the tip of vector b,\n6:31\nand then it'll take me right over there.\n6:35\nSo if I start right over here, vector b takes me there.\n6:42\nAnd now I'm adding to that vector a, which starting here\n6:45\nwill take me there.\n6:47\nAnd so from my original starting position, I have gone this far.\n6:52\nNow, what is this vector?\n6:53\nWell, this is exactly the vector 2, 2.\n6:57\nOr another way of thinking about it,\n6:58\nthis vector shifts you 2 in the horizontal direction and 2\n7:02\nin the vertical direction.\n7:04\nSo either way, you're going to get the same result,\n7:06\nand that should, hopefully, make visual or conceptual sense\n7:09\nas

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nIf the distance between the plane Ax-2y+z = d and the plane containing the lines,\n0:09\nand they give us two lines here in three-dimensions,\n0:12\nif that distance is square-root of 6, then the absolute value of d is...\n0:18\nSo let's think about it for a little bit. They're talking about the distance between this plane and some\n0:25\nplane that contains these two line.\n0:28\nSo in order to talk realistically about the distance between the planes, those planes will have to be\n0:33\nparallel, because if they're not parallel - if they intersect with each other, the distance is clearly\n0:37\nzero, and they're telling us here that the distance is square-root of 6.\n0:41\nSo we have a situation so that the planes can't intersect they must be parallel.\n0:46\nSo you have this plane up here, you have this plane up here, you could call this the equation here\n0:53\nis ax - 2y + z = d, and then you're going to have another plane, that's going to be parallel to it,\n1:01\nmaybe it looks something like this. You have the other plane that is parallel, and it's going to contain\n1:07\nboth of these lines. So maybe it has this line - so this line is in green, maybe this line looks something\n1:14\nlike this, it's on that blue plane. And then this line, maybe in magenta, is also going to be on the\n1:23\nblue plane. So how can we figure out the distances?\n1:26\nWell a good starting point would be to try to figure out the equation for this blue plane here.\n1:33\nAnd since these planes are parallel, this equation should look very much like this orange equation -\n1:40\nat least on the left-hand-side, it might just have a different d-value, and that's because it has the\n1:44\nexact same inclination. And then once we figure out the equation for this plane over here, then we could\n1:52\nactually probably figure out what 'a' is, then we could find some point on the blue plane and then use\n1:58\nour knowledge of finding the distance points and planes to figure out the actual distance from any point\n2:05\nto this orange plane.\n2:07\nSo let's figure out the equation of this blue plane first, and a good place to start is just to try to\n2:12\nfigure out two vectors on this blue plane, then we can take the cross-product of those two vectors to\n2:19\nfind out a normal to this blue plane, and then use that information to actually figure out the\n2:24\nequation for the blue plane.\n2:26\nSo let's figure out some points that sit on the blue plane.\n2:31\nSo on this green line right over here you have, see if I want all of these to be equal to zero, you'd\n2:37\nhave the point x is equal to 1, y is equal to 2, z is equal to 3, so you have the point (1,2,3) - that definitely sits\n2:46\non the blue plane. Let's come up with another point. let's see if I want all of these to be equal to\n2:52\none, I could make this, if I want this to evaluate to two, I'd have the point three, I would have the point,\n2:59\nif I want this to evaluate to one, I would want five minus two over three, so 3, 5, and then I would want this\n3:07\nto be seven. Seven minus three over four is also 1, so that's another point, actually both of these points sit on this\n3:16\nline right over here. 1,2,3 and then 3,5,7. And then let's do the same thing for this - let's find two\n3:24\npoints on this plane, and actually we just need to find one point on this plane, because if you have\n3:29\nthree points that's enough to figure out two different vectors -vectors that aren't scalar multiples\n3:35\nof each other, which would be enough to figure out the normal to this plane.\n3:39\nSo let's just figure out one more point over here and one more point would be, if we want all of these\n3:44\nthree to be equal to zero, would be the point (2,3,4).\n3:52\nBecause this would be zero, zero, zero. So that's also sitting the plane and that sits on the magenta\n3:57\nline right over there.\n3:59\nSo let's use these three points to figure out two vectors on the plane that aren't multiples of each\n4:03\nother, then we can take their cross-product to actually figure out a normal vector to the blue plane.\n4:11\nSo let's say the first vector, 'a', that sits on this plane, let's say it's the difference in the position\n4:16\nvectors that specify these two points, and then we know that will be on the plane.\n4:21\nAnd so that will be three minus one is 2i plus five minus two is 3j, plus seven minus three is 4k.\n4:37\nSo vector 'a' is actually going to sit on this green line, because both of these points are on this line,\n4:44\nso it's going to sit on that line. If we put it on the plane or if we were to start it at one of those\n4:48\npoints it will sit on that line.\n4:50\nAnd then we can do another vector, and it's essentially going between a point on the green line and a\n4:55\npoint on the purple line, but that's definitely going to be a vector on our blue plane.\n4:59\nLet's go between these two points - that looks pretty straight-forward, so let's call vector b,\n5:07\nso let's call vector b, let's call that, let's see, two minus one is 'i', three minus two is 'j', and then four minus three, that's just 1k.\n5:21\nSo this vector here is also sitting on the plane. So if I take the cross-product of 'a' and 'b' I am\n5:29\ngoing to get a vector that is perpendicular to the plane, or a normal vector to the plane.\n5:34\nSo let's do that. So let's find what 'a' cross 'b' is. 'a' cross 'b' is equal to - and this is how I\n5:43\nfind it easiest - I just write 'i', 'j', 'k', this is really the definition of the cross product, or\n5:49\nI guess one of them. And we write our first vector, we have 2, 3, 4, and then we have our second vector,\n5:56\nwhich is just 1,1,1, and then this is going to be equal to, first we'll look at the 'i' component, so\n6:02\ncross that row, that column out.\n6:04\nthree times one minus one times four, so that's just three minus four, so it's negative 'i', and then\n6:13\nminus, we're going to have the 'j', so let we write up minus here, minus , let me just swap signs, we\n6:19\nhave positive, negative, positive, so 'j' , get rid of that column, that row,\n6:23\ntwo times one which is two, minus one times four, so that's minus four, is negative 2,\n6:28\nso we could have written negative 2 here, but the negatives cancel out, so it becomes plus 2j,\n6:33\nand finally for the 'k', get rid of that row that column, two times one is two, minus one times three,\n6:39\nis two minus three, which is negative one, so it's negative k.\n6:44\nSo this right here is a normal vector to the plane.\n6:52\nSo if we want to find the equation for that plane, we've done it multiple times, we'd just have to take\n7:00\nthe dot product of that normal vector and any arbitrary vector on that that specified that we can specify\n7:13\nwith with an arbitrary x y and z, and we've done this multiple times in multiple videos.\n7:17\nIf this is any point, x, y, z, that sits on the plane, then the vector - let me draw the vector, let's\n7:29\nsay we go to this point right over here, so this vector right over here is going to be\n7:34\n- let me draw it the other way actually, so this vector right over here, let's say we're going between\n7:39\nthis point and x,y,z, this vector right here is going to be x minus three i, plus y minus five j, plus\n7:53\nz minus 7 k.\n7:56\nThat's what this vector is, it sits on the plane, assuming x,y and z sit on the plane.\n8:01\nSo if we take the dot product of this and the normal vector that has got to be equal to zero,\n8:06\nbecause it sits on the plane, and then we'll have our equation.\n8:09\nSo let's take 'n' dot that over there, so n dot x minus three i, plus y minus five j, plus z minus seven k.\n8:23\nIf any of this is confusing to you, I've gone into a little bit more depth in previous videos,\n8:28\nespecially in the linear algebra playlist where I talk about constructing the equation of a plane given\n8:32\na point on the plane and a normal vector, and even how you find that normal vector,\n8:38\nso you might want to watch those if you want some review there.\n8:40\nBut these are going to be equal to zero, so when you take the dot product, n, our normal vector is this,\n8:46\nso we just take the x term, which is negative one, times this x term right over here,\n8:51\nso negative one times this is just three minus x, and then plus this y component times this y component,\n8:58\nso it's two times this, so it's plus two y minus ten, and then finally the z component -\n9:05\nnegative one times this. So this is plus seven minus z is equal to zero, and what do we get?\n9:15\nSo we have our negative x, plus two y, minus z, and then is equal to, let's subtract three from both sides\n9:27\nSo if we take it out there it will be minus three. If we add ten to both sides, so then you have\n9:35\na plus ten over here, and then we subtract seven from both sides, this becomes a minus seven\n9:43\nSo then on the right-hand-side, negative three plus ten minus seven, well that's just going to be zero!\n9:50\nAnd just like that we have the equation for this blue plane over here - the plane that contains these two lines.\n10:04\nNow remember what we said at the beginning of the video - these two planes are parallel, so the ratio\n10:08\nof the coefficients on the 'x' terms, the 'y' term and the 'z' term has got to be the same.\n10:14\nSo this one has a positive 2, that has a negative 2, this is just to simplify it, so it looks very similar\n10:20\nto each other. Let's multiple this equation right here, both sides, by negative one. And then we're going\n10:25\nto get x minus two y plus z is equal to zero; so this is a completely valid, another alternate way of\n10:34\nexpressing the same plane. And what like about this about this is that it looks very similar to this -\n10:39\nat least the ratio of the x, y's and z's, negative two y, negative two y; one z, one z, and remember\n10:46\nthe ratios have to be the same.\n10:47\nSo here we have a one-to-one ratio between the z-coefficient and the z-coefficient, the y-coefficient\n10:52\nand the y-coefficient, so it's also going to be for the x coefficient.\n10:56\nSo here we know if this is going to be parallel to the blue plane we know that 'a' has got to be equal\n11:01\nto one.\n11:03\nSo this is x minus two y plus z is equal to d. So now let's figure out the actual distance between these\n11:18\ntwo planes. So what we can do is we can take a point on this blue plane - and we have several examples\n11:24\nof points on the blue plane, and find the distance between that point and this plane over here.\n11:30\nAnd actually I just finished doing some videos on how to find the distance between a point and a plane,\n11:35\nso I'm just going to use that formula (if you want it to be proved go watch that video - it's actually\n11:39\npretty interesting proof I think) but the distance between let's say this point, (1,2,3), and this plane\n11:47\nover here, so this distance right here is going to be in the direction of the normal,\n11:52\nthe distance is going to be, you literally just evaluate this, let me do it this way:\n12:08\nyou literally just put in this point for the x, y and z, and then you subtract the d in the numerator,\n12:14\nand we saw that as the formula for finding the distance. So it's literally going to be one, one,\n12:20\n(I'm actually using this point right over here)\n12:23\nSo it's going to be one, one, because we just have one x so it's just going to be one minus two times\n12:27\ntwo, one minus four (that's two times two), plus three, minus d, over here the d is just d, so we're\n12:39\njust going to write minus d, just like that, all of that over what is essentially the magnitude of the\n12:46\nnormal vector, and we saw in several videos that's just the square of the coefficients on each of these\n12:50\nterms right here, and taking the sum of those, taking the square root,\n12:54\nso it's going to be equal to: 1 squared, plus negative 2 squared which is four, plus one squared which is one.\n13:05\nSo this is going to simplify to the distance is equal to one minus four plus three is zero.\n13:13\nSo in the numerator we have negative d, all of that over the square root of one plus four plus one,\n13:21\nso all over the square root of six. So they say the distance\n13:30\nbetween this plane and this plane over here is square root of six. So they're saying the distance is\n13:36\nequal to the square root of six, that's what this information right over here is, maybe I should do that\n13:44\nin another colour.\n13:49\nThe distance between the two planes is going to be the square root of six, and so then if we solve for d,\n13:55\nmultiple both sides of this equation times the square root of six, you get six is equal to negative d,\n14:01\nor d is equal to negative six.\n14:07\nNow, what they care about is the absolute value of d, or the absolute distance, so this would be kinda\n14:12\nthe signed distance - it specifies whether we're above or below the plane.\n14:15\nSince we're below the plane we got a negative number - I just happened to draw it right, if we above\n14:19\nthe plane we would get a positive number.\n14:22\nSo this distance is negative six, the absolute value of it, the absolute value of d which is the same\n14:27\nas the absolute value of negative six, is equal to six.\n14:31\nSo take any point on this blue plane and you look for the closest point on the orange plane, and they\n14:38\nwill be exactly six apart. Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.",

at first this might seem daunting,\n0:12\nI have this rational expression, I have xs in the numerators\n0:15\nand xs in the denominators, but we just have to remember,\n0:18\nwe just have to do some algebraic manipulation,\n0:20\nand this is going to seem a lot more attractable.\n0:22\nThis is the same thing as the definite integral\n0:24\nfrom negative one to negative two of\n0:28\n16 over x to the third\n0:31\nminus x to the third\n0:33\nover x to the third,\n0:35\nminus x to the third over x to the third dx.\n0:38\nAnd now what is that going to be equal to?\n0:41\nThat is going be equal to the definite integral\n0:44\nfrom negative one to negative two of,\n0:48\nI could write this first term right over here,\n0:52\nlet me do this in a different color.\n0:54\nI could write, I could write this\n0:57\nas 16x to the negative three, x to the negative three,\n1:02\nand this second one,\n1:05\nwe have minus x to the third over x to the third.\n1:09\nWell x to the third is just over,\n1:11\nx to the third over x to the third\n1:12\nis just going to be equal to one.\n1:14\nSo this is going to be minus one dx,\n1:19\nso dx.\n1:21\nAnd so what is this going to be equal to?\n1:23\nWell, let's take the antiderivative of each of these parts\n1:26\nand then we're going to have to evaluate them\n1:28\nat the different bounds.\n1:29\nSo, let's see.\n1:31\nThe antiderivative of 16x to the negative three,\n1:34\nwe're just gonna do the power rule\n1:35\nfor derivatives in reverse.\n1:37\nYou can view this as the power rule of integration\n1:39\nor the power rule of taking the antiderivative\n1:42\nwhere what you do is\n1:43\nyou're gonna increase our exponent by one,\n1:46\nso you're gonna go from negative three to negative two,\n1:49\nand then you're gonna divide by that amount,\n1:52\nby negative two.\n1:53\nSo it's going to be 16 divided by negative two\n1:57\ntimes x to the negative two.\n1:59\nAll I did is I increased the exponent\n2:01\nand I divided by that amount.\n2:02\nSo that's the antiderivative here.\n2:04\nAnd 16 divided by negative two,\n2:07\nthat is just negative eight.\n2:10\nSo we have negative eight, x to the negative two.\n2:12\nAnd then the antiderivative of negative one,\n2:15\nwell, that's just negative x, negative, negative x,\n2:21\nnegative x.\n2:23\nAnd actually you might just know that,\n2:25\nand then hey, if I take the derivative of negative x\n2:27\nI get negative one, or if you view this\n2:29\nas negative x to the zero power, because that's what one is,\n2:33\nwell, it's the same thing.\n2:34\nYou increase the exponent by one\n2:37\nto get x to the first power.\n2:39\nAnd then you divide by one and so,\n2:40\nI mean, you can view it as that right over there,\n2:43\nbut either way you get to negative or minus x.\n2:48\nAnd so now we want to evaluate that.\n2:50\nWe're going to evaluate that at the bounds\n2:52\nand take the difference.\n2:54\nSo we're going to evaluate that at negative two\n2:57\nand then subtract from that this evaluated at negative one.\n3:01\nAnd let me do those in two different colors\n3:03\nso we can see what's going on.\n3:04\nSo we're gonna evaluate it at negative two\n3:06\nand we're gonna evaluate it at negative one.\n3:09\nSo let's first evaluate it at negative two.\n3:12\nSo this is going to be equal to,\n3:14\nthis is going to be equal to,\n3:16\nwhen you evaluate it at negative two,\n3:18\nit's going to be negative eight, negative eight\n3:22\ntimes x to the negative two.\n3:24\nSo negative two the the negative two power\n3:27\nminus negative two.\n3:30\nAnd from that we're going to subtract it\n3:33\nand evaluate it at negative one.\n3:35\nSo, it's going to be negative eight times negative one\n3:40\nto the negative two power minus negative one.\n3:45\nAll right, so then what is this going to be?\n3:47\nSo, negative two the negative two.\n3:50\nSo negative two to the negative two\n3:53\nis equal to one over negative two squared,\n3:57\nwhich is equal to 1/4.\n3:59\nSo this is equal to positive 1/4,\n4:03\nbut then negative eight times positive 1/4\n4:07\nis going to be equal to negative two.\n4:11\nAnd then we have negative two minus negative two,\n4:14\nso that's negative two plus two.\n4:17\nAnd so everything I've just done in this purplish color\n4:20\nthat is just going to be zero.\n4:22\nAnd then if we look at what's going on in the orange,\n4:26\nwhen you evaluate it at negative one,\n4:28\nlet's see, negative one to the negative two power,\n4:31\nwell, that's one over negative one squared.\n4:33\nWell, this all is just going to be one.\n4:34\nAnd so we're gonna have negative eight plus one,\n4:39\nwhich is equal to negative seven.\n4:43\nSo all of this evaluates to negative seven.\n4:46\nBut remember, we're subtracting negative seven,\n4:48\nand so this is going to result,\n4:50\nwe deserve a little bit of a drum roll,\n4:51\nthis is going to be equal to positive, positive seven.\n4:56\nAnd obviously you don't have to write\n4:57\nthat positive out in front,\n4:58\nI just wrote that just to emphasize\n5:00\nthat this is going to be a positive seven.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn your mathematical careers you might\n0:03\nencounter people who say it is wrong to say\n0:05\nthat i is equal to the principal square root of negative 1.\n0:10\nAnd if you ask them why is this wrong,\n0:12\nthey'll show up with this kind of line of logic\n0:15\nthat actually seems pretty reasonable.\n0:17\nThey will tell you that, OK, well\n0:19\nlet's just start with negative 1.\n0:21\nWe know from definition that negative 1\n0:23\nis equal to i times i.\n0:26\nEverything seems pretty straightforward right now.\n0:28\nAnd then they'll say, well look, if you\n0:30\ntake this, if you assume this part right here,\n0:33\nthen we can replace each of these i's with the square root\n0:36\nof negative 1.\n0:36\nAnd they'd be right.\n0:37\nSo then this would be the same thing\n0:39\nas the square root of negative 1 times the square root\n0:42\nof negative 1.\n0:43\nAnd then they would tell you that,\n0:45\nhey, look just from straight up properties\n0:48\nof the principal square root function,\n0:50\nthey'll tell you that the square root of a times b\n0:53\nis the same thing as the principal square root\n0:55\nof a times the principal square root of b.\n0:58\nAnd so if you have the principal square root of a times\n1:01\nthe principal square root of b, that's\n1:02\nthe same thing as the square root of a times b.\n1:04\nSo based on this property of the radical of the principal root,\n1:09\nthey'll say that this over here is\n1:11\nthe same thing as the square root\n1:13\nof negative 1 times negative 1.\n1:20\nIf I have the principal root of the product of two things,\n1:23\nthat's the same thing as the product\n1:24\nof each of their principal roots.\n1:26\nI'm doing this in the other order here.\n1:28\nHere I have the principal root of the products,\n1:30\nover here I have this on the right.\n1:32\nAnd then from that we all know that negative 1 times\n1:35\nnegative 1 is 1.\n1:36\nSo this should be equal to the principal square root of 1.\n1:41\nAnd then the principal square root of 1-- Remember,\n1:44\nthis radical means principal square root,\n1:45\npositive square root, that is just going to be positive 1.\n1:51\nAnd they'll say, this is wrong.\n1:52\nClearly, negative 1 and positive 1 are not the same thing.\n1:59\nAnd they'll argue therefore, you can't make this substitution\n2:02\nthat we did in this step.\n2:04\nAnd what you should then point out\n2:06\nis that this was not the incorrect step.\n2:09\nThat it is true negative 1 is not equal to 1,\n2:11\nbut the faulty line of reasoning here\n2:13\nwas in using this property when both a and b are negative.\n2:21\nIf both a and b are negative, this will never be true.\n2:26\nSo a and b both cannot be negative.\n2:36\nIn fact normally when this property is given-- sometimes\n2:38\nit's given a little bit in the footnotes\n2:40\nor you might not even notice it because it's not relevant\n2:42\nwhen you're learning it the first time--\n2:43\nbut they'll usually give a little bit of a constraint\n2:45\nthere.\n2:45\nThey'll usually say for a and b greater than or equal to 0.\n2:52\nSo that's where they list this property.\n2:53\nThis is true for a and b greater than or equal 0.\n2:56\nAnd in particular, it's false if both a and b are both,\n3:00\nif they are both negative.\n3:03\nNow, I've just spent the last three minutes\n3:07\nsaying that people who tell you that this is wrong are wrong.\n3:11\nBut with that said, I will say that you\n3:12\nhave to be a little bit careful about it.\n3:16\nWhen we take traditional principal square roots.\n3:19\nSo when you take the principle square root of 4.\n3:22\nWe know that this is positive 2, that 4 actually\n3:24\nhas two square roots.\n3:26\nThere's negative 2 also is a square root of 4.\n3:34\nIf you have negative 2 times negative 2\n3:36\nit's also equal to 4.\n3:38\nThis radical symbol here means principal square root.\n3:42\nOr when we're just dealing with real numbers, non\n3:44\nimaginary, non complex numbers, you\n3:46\ncould really view it as the positive square root.\n3:48\nThis has two square roots, positive and negative 2.\n3:50\nIf you have this radical symbol right here\n3:52\nprincipal square roots, it means the positive square root of 2.\n3:57\nSo when you start thinking about taking\n3:59\nsquare roots of negative numbers--\n4:01\nor even in the future we'll do imaginary numbers\n4:03\nand complex numbers and all the rest--\n4:05\nyou have to expand the definition\n4:07\nof what this radical means.\n4:08\nSo when you are taking the square root of really\n4:12\nof any negative number, you're really\n4:16\nsaying that this is no longer the traditional principal\n4:19\nsquare root function.\n4:20\nYou're now talking that this is the principal complex square\n4:24\nroot function, or this is now defined\n4:25\nfor complex inputs or the domain,\n4:28\nit can also generate imaginary or complex outputs,\n4:31\nor I guess you could call that the range.\n4:34\nAnd if you assume that, then really straight\n4:36\nfrom this you get that negative, the square root of negative x\n4:42\nis going to be equal to i times the square root of x.\n4:47\nAnd this is only-- and I'm going to make this clear\n4:49\nbecause I just told you that this will be false\n4:51\nif both a and b are negative.\n4:52\nSo this is only true-- So we could\n4:55\napply this when x is greater than or equal to 0.\n5:06\nSo if x is greater than or equal to 0,\n5:08\nthen negative x is clearly a negative number,\n5:10\nor I guess it could also be 0.\n5:12\nIt's a negative number.\n5:13\nAnd then we can apply this right over here.\n5:16\nIf x was less than 0, then we would\n5:18\nbe doing all of this nonsense up here.\n5:20\nAnd we start to get nonsensical answers.\n5:23\nAnd if you look at it this way and you say hey,\n5:25\nlook, i can be the square root of negative one,\n5:27\nif it's the principal branch of the complex square root\n5:30\nfunction.\n5:31\nThen you could rewrite this right over here\n5:33\nas the square root of negative 1 times the square root of x.\n5:41\nAnd so really the real fault in this logic when people\n5:45\nsay, hey, negative 1 can't be equal to 1,\n5:48\nthe real fault is using this property\n5:52\nwhen both a and b, where both of these are negative numbers.\n5:57\nThat will come up with something that is unambiguously false.\n6:00\nIf you expand your definition of the complex\n6:03\nor expand your definition of the principal root\n6:05\nto include negative numbers in the domain\n6:09\nand to include imaginary numbers, then you can do this.\n6:13\nYou can say the square root of negative x\n6:16\nis the square root of negative 1 times--\n6:19\nOr you should say the principal square root of negative x--\n6:22\nI should be particular my words--\n6:23\nis the same thing as the principal square root\n6:26\nof negative 1 times the principal square root of x when\n6:30\nx is greater than or equal to 0.\n6:32\nAnd I don't want to confuse you, if x\n6:34\nis greater than or equal to 0, this negative x, that\n6:39\nis clearly a negative, or I guess\n6:41\nyou should say a non positive number.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nFor those of you who are curious\n0:01\nand have a little bit of a background in calculus,\n0:03\nI thought I would do a very optional and\n0:05\nwhen I say it's optional, you don't have to\n0:07\nunderstand this in order to progress with the\n0:09\neconomics playlist, but a very optional proof\n0:12\nshowing you that in general,\n0:14\nthe slope of the marginal revenue curve for a monopolist is\n0:17\ntwice the slope of the demand curve,\n0:20\nassuming that the demand curve is a line.\n0:21\nSo if the demand curve looks like that, this is price.\n0:25\nThis is quantity. That is demand right over there.\n0:28\nI'm going to show that the marginal revenue curve\n0:30\nhas twice the slope. It is twice as steep as this.\n0:33\nIt's really twice the negative slope.\n0:36\nSo let me just write price as a function of quantity.\n0:39\nWe know we get price.\n0:41\nSince this is a line, we can essentially write it in\n0:44\nour traditional slope y-intercept form.\n0:46\nIn algebra class, you would write\n0:48\nif this was y and this was x,\n0:49\nyou would write y = mx+b\n0:53\nwhere m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n0:56\nI'll do something very similar, but instead of y and x\n0:58\nwe have P and Q.\n1:00\nSo, if P = m x Q where m is the slope\n1:05\nplus ... plus the P-intercept + b.\n1:10\nSo this right over here is b\n1:12\nand if you were to ... If you were to take your,\n1:15\nIf you were to take your change in P,\n1:18\nif you were to take your change in P\n1:19\nand divide it by your change in Q ... your change in Q,\n1:23\nyou would get m. That is your slope,\n1:26\nchange in P / change in Q.\n1:30\nNow what is going to be our total revenue?\n1:33\nAnd this is kind of ... We're just kind of almost doing\n1:35\nwhat we've done in the last few videos,\n1:36\nbut we're doing it in general terms.\n1:38\nSo if this is total revenue,\n1:40\ntotal revenue as a function of quantity.\n1:43\nWell, total revenue is just price x quantity.\n1:46\nTotal revenue is just price x quantity.\n1:49\nWe've already written ... We've already written price as a\n1:52\nfunction of quantity right over here, so we could take that\n1:55\nand substitute it ... and substitute it in right over there.\n1:58\nSo we get total revenue is equal to and I'll write it all in blue.\n2:03\nWe have mQ + b and then we're going to multiply that x Q.\n2:09\nWe're going to multiply that x Q or we get\n2:12\ntotal revenue = mQ^2.\n2:16\nmQ^2 + b x Q\n2:20\nAnd this is a parabola and it's actually going to be a\n2:23\ndownward sloping parabola because\n2:24\nm is going to be negative.\n2:26\nThis is downward sloping.\n2:27\nm has a negative slope, so m is negative.\n2:30\nSo we know ... We know that M < 0 over here.\n2:34\nThat's one of the assumptions we'll make.\n2:35\nIf m < 0, this is going to be a downward opening parabola.\n2:40\nTotal revenue will look something,\n2:41\ntotal revenue will look something like that.\n2:45\nThat is our total revenue.\n2:46\nNow, the marginal revenue as a function of quantity is\n2:50\njust the derivative and this is the calculus part.\n2:52\nIt's the slope of the tangent line at any given point\n2:54\nand that is what the derivative is.\n2:57\nIt's the slope of the tangent line at any point as a function\n3:00\nas a function of quantity. So you give me a quantity,\n3:03\nI will tell you what the slope of the tangent line of the\n3:06\ntotal revenue function is at that point.\n3:09\nSo we essentially just have to take the derivative of this\n3:11\nwith respect to Q.\n3:13\nSo we get D, TR/DQ.\n3:18\nSo how much does total revenue change with a very, very\n3:21\nsmall change in quantity, infinitely small, infinitesimal\n3:25\nchange in quantity and this comes straight out of calculus.\n3:29\nm is a constant. Q^2, the derivative of Q^2 with respect\n3:33\nto Q is 2Q. So it's going to be 2Q x the constant.\n3:38\nSo it's going to be 2m ... 2mQ.\n3:42\nAnd then b is a constant. We're assuming it's given.\n3:46\nb is a constant.\n3:47\nThe derivative of bQ with respect to Q is just going to be b.\n3:53\nIt's just going to be b.\n3:55\nAnd so right over here, this is our marginal revenue curve.\n3:58\nor I should say our marginal line.\n4:00\nIt is 2mQ + b.\n4:03\nSo notice, it has the same y-intercept as our demand curve\n4:08\nso definitely starts right over there,\n4:10\nbut it has twice the slope.\n4:12\nThe slope of our demand curve is m.\n4:14\nThe slope of our marginal revenue curve is 2m, is 2m\n4:19\nand this is a negative slope, so this will be twice as negative.\n4:22\nSo it will look something like this.\n4:24\nIt will look something like this, just like that.\n4:27\nSo no matter what your demand curve is,\n4:29\nif you assume it's a line like this,\n4:32\nthe marginal revenue curve will be a line with twice the\n4:35\nslope and in this case, it's twice the negative slope which\n4:38\nis kind of ... what's going to be generally true.\n4:40\nAnyway, if you understood that, great.\n4:42\nYou now feel good that this is always the case for a\n4:44\nlinear demand curve like this.\n4:46\nIf you did not understand it, don't worry.\n4:48\nYou can proceed with the economics playlist.\n4:50\nYou don't need to know calculus for this playlist.",

What is the nature of reality?\n0:10\n\"Why is the universe organized the way that it is?\"\n0:13\nAnd these questions are what we attempt to answer\n0:17\nin the field of physics...\n0:21\nIn the field of physics,\n0:22\nwhich you could view\n0:23\nmaybe right after mathematics\n0:24\nas the purest of the sciences.\n0:27\nSo you have math, which is very pure,\n0:30\nand then on that foundation of math\n0:33\nyou have physics.\n0:34\nAnd physics really does try to use that mathematics\n0:39\nalong with some core ideas\n0:41\nto explain the phenomena,\n0:43\nall the phenomena,\n0:44\nof the universe.\n0:45\nAnd physicists will the the first to admit\n0:47\nthat they are just beginning to understand\n0:49\nthe nature of reality,\n0:51\nthe nature of everything around us.\n0:53\nNow a lot of times, we think physics\n0:54\nis only limited to things like cosmological phenomena\n0:59\nor getting rockets into space,\n1:01\nor how waves move or building structures.\n1:04\nBut physics is the foundation for\n1:07\nall of the other sciences.\n1:09\nWhen we think about chemistry,\n1:10\nwhen we think about chemistry,\n1:12\nwhich is at the end of the day\n1:13\ninteractions between atoms,\n1:15\nthose interactions are really physics-based interactions.\n1:18\nSo chemistry, chemistry is actually laid down\n1:22\non a foundation of physics.\n1:25\nAnd then even when we think about ourselves,\n1:28\nour bodies, even our consciousness, our brains,\n1:30\nit really all boils down to chemistry and physics.\n1:35\nIt boils down to interactions between atoms\n1:37\nand even mechanical properties of our bodies.\n1:40\nAnd so even biology,\n1:43\neven what we are,\n1:45\nis built on a foundation of chemistry.\n1:49\nSo this is biology right over here,\n1:53\nwhich is built on a foundation of physics,\n1:54\nwhich is highly dependent on some of the math\n1:57\nthat you've been learning your whole life\n1:59\nand that you will continue to learn.\n2:00\nAnd that fundamental question that you might have said,\n2:03\n\"Well you know, hey, why am I learning this math?\"\n2:04\nWell one, 'cause the math is beautiful,\n2:06\nbut also you will see that it starts to,\n2:08\nin almost the most pure way,\n2:10\ndescribe the structure of the universe.\n2:13\nAnd we're going to see that more and more and more\n2:15\nas we go into physics.\n2:17\nAll of this complex phenomena\n2:19\nthat you see around us,\n2:20\nwhether we're looking at a galaxy\n2:21\nor we're looking at ocean waves,\n2:22\nor we're looking at even biological systems,\n2:25\nwe'll see that a shocking amount of them\n2:28\ncan start to be described using some fairly elegant\n2:31\nmathematics that we can build on\n2:33\nand continue to build on.\n2:34\nSimple or elegant mathematics\n2:36\nlike force is equal to mass times acceleration.\n2:40\nAnd we're gonna talk about force and acceleration\n2:43\nas vector quantities.\n2:45\nWe're gonna think about things like displacement,\n2:48\nand I'll put it as a vector quantity,\n2:50\nand we'll soon learn more about vector\n2:52\nand scalar quantities are.\n2:53\nDisplacement is equal to velocity times time.\n2:58\nWe'll learn things like accelaration\n3:00\nis equal to change in velocity over change in time.\n3:04\nWhat we'll see with even a handful\n3:06\nof very simple ideas like this.\n3:09\nWe'll go into much more depth in future videos.\n3:11\nYou can explain all sorts of complex phenomena.\n3:14\nAnd the one thing that I always loved about physics,\n3:16\nand I don't think it's always fully appreciated,\n3:18\nsometimes as you start to learn physics,\n3:20\nyou'll see all these complicated formula,\n3:21\nall of these kind of complicated problems,\n3:24\nbut it's super valuable to realize\n3:27\nit's all coming from some of these basic ideas.\n3:29\nSome of the things that I just mentioned,\n3:31\nthese ideas, we're gonna explore ideas of energy.\n3:34\nWe're going to explore Newton's laws.\n3:37\nWe're going to explain, we're gonna think about\n3:39\nwhat are the the different types of forces out there,\n3:41\nand why they might, why they might actually exist.\n3:44\nAt its essence, it's all about trying to\n3:48\nexplain the complexity of the universe,\n3:51\npredict what is going to happen\n3:52\nbased on simple ideas.\n3:55\nAnd that's what physics is all about.\n3:58\nNow when we think of physics,\n3:59\nit's been studied by humanity for a very, very long time.\n4:02\nIn fact, I'm sure we don't know\n4:04\nwho the first physicists were.\n4:07\nBut some of the,\n4:08\nI guess you could say foundational thinkers\n4:11\nin physics are these gentlemen that I have here.\n4:14\nAnd this is just a...\n4:15\nYou could kind of say\n4:16\nthis is some of the most prominent thinkers in physics,\n4:19\nbut this is by no means a complete list.\n4:21\nFirst and foremost, we'd wanna include Isaac Newton.\n4:25\nEspecially when you start to study physics,\n4:27\nyou're starting to understand the world\n4:30\nas Newton understood it.\n4:31\nHe understood, \"Hey, you know,\n4:32\n\"things don't fall to the ground\n4:34\n\"just 'cause they always fall to,\n4:35\n\"just 'cause that's the way the universe is.\n4:37\n\"That's a force that's acting on it,\n4:39\n\"and maybe that same force that's causing me\n4:41\n\"to be stuck to my chair right now\n4:44\n\"is what keeps Earth orbiting around the Sun\n4:46\n\"or the moon orbiting around the Earth.\"\n4:50\nHe developed Law of Gravitation,\n4:53\nNewton's Laws, and we're going to study that\n4:54\nas we delve into our basic physics.\n4:57\nAnd what we'll see,\n4:58\neven classical mechanics,\n5:00\nthe physics that Newton established,\n5:03\ncan explain a large range of phenomena\n5:05\nwith amazing precision.\n5:07\nBut as we get into the early 20th century,\n5:10\nphysics starts to get even more wild\n5:12\nas we start to look at the scales\n5:14\nof the super small,\n5:15\nand we have Max Planck giving us quantum mechanics,\n5:18\nand then we have Albert Einstein\n5:20\nas we start thinking about super fast speeds,\n5:23\nthe speed of light, and we realize that's an absolute.\n5:26\nThat nothing can travel faster than the speed of light,\n5:29\nwhich is this mind-boggling thing\n5:31\nthat we have these notions\n5:33\nof general and special relativity,\n5:35\nand we start realizing that the universe\n5:37\nis in some ways more bizarre, and more mysterious,\n5:40\nand more fascinating than we ever could have imagined.\n5:43\nBut all of the work, even to understand the modern physics\n5:46\nof Max Planck and Albert Einstein,\n5:49\nit's based on a lot of the core ideas\n5:52\nthat were given to us by Isaac Newton,\n5:54\neven people before Isaac Newton.\n5:56\nSo as you go into your study of physics,\n5:58\nand I'm kind of a physicist wannabe.\n6:01\nI wanted to be a physicist.\n6:03\nI imagined kind of,\n6:04\n'cause it's all about, we all wonder,\n6:06\nwhy are we here?\n6:07\nWhat is the nature of reality?\n6:09\nWhy do things happen the way they are?\n6:12\nAnd these are the questions that physics\n6:14\nis attempting to answer.\n6:16\nAnd so as you go into your study of physics,\n6:19\nI wanna leave you with some quotes\n6:21\nfrom these three gentlemen.\n6:22\nSo the first two are from Isaac Newton.\n6:25\n\"Truth is ever to be found in simplicity,\n6:29\n\"and not in the multiplicity and the confusion of things.\"\n6:32\nAnd I really wanted to stress this,\n6:34\nbecause a lot of times in your studies,\n6:35\nyou might be finding yourself memorizing formulas\n6:37\nand vocabulary, but that's,\n6:41\nif you're doing that, you're just at the very surface.\n6:43\nBut if you really start to think about it,\n6:45\nreally start to think about where these things come from,\n6:48\nit'll come to simpler and simpler and more intuitive ideas.\n6:51\nAnd then, you are getting closer to the truth.\n6:54\nNow, I love this second quote from Isaac Newton.\n6:57\n\"I do not know what I may appear to...\n7:00\n\"I do not know what I may appear to the world,\n7:03\n\"but to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy\n7:07\n\"playing on the seashore,\n7:08\n\"and diverting myself in now and then\n7:11\n\"finding a smoother pebble\n7:12\n\"or prettier shell than ordinary,\n7:14\n\"whilst the great ocean of truth\n7:17\n\"lay all undiscovered before me.\"\n7:20\nI like to imagine there's so much,\n7:22\nwe, even though we think we know so much,\n7:24\nthat we haven't even learned a small fraction\n7:27\nof how the universe really is.\n7:29\nAnd even a great thinker like Isaac Newton,\n7:31\nhe recognized this.\n7:32\nHe's like, \"Hey, I'm just kind of dabbling\n7:34\n\"into the seashore and picking up a pebble there,\n7:36\n\"but there's this vast ocean\n7:37\n\"that I can't even begin to understand.\"\n7:39\nYou can even imagine alien civilizations\n7:41\nthat are thousands of years ahead of us\n7:43\ntechnologically or scientifically\n7:45\nor even millions of years,\n7:47\nhow they might perceive the reality,\n7:49\nand they might see us as ants\n7:50\nin that we are just beginning\n7:51\nto scrape the surface of how the world works.\n7:55\nThis is from Max Planck.\n7:56\n\"When you change the way you look at things,\n7:59\n\"the things you look at change.\"\n8:01\nAnd I find this to be pretty profound,\n8:03\nbecause it is true.\n8:04\nAs you study physics,\n8:05\nyou will start to see, whoa,\n8:06\nmost of what we consider to be reality,\n8:08\nour current understanding is based\n8:09\non these forces, but what are these forces?\n8:11\nAnd even these things that we think are solid,\n8:14\nwhen we go down to the atomic level,\n8:15\nwe see it's mostly empty space\n8:17\nand it's really just the interaction of forces\n8:18\nthat make us think that something\n8:20\nis solid or there or tangible is some way.\n8:23\nAnd you realize these very tangible things\n8:24\naren't so tangible after all.\n8:27\nAt the end of the day, the whole world\n8:28\nis just a mental model that we have.\n8:31\nIn some ways,\n8:32\nit's an illusion\n8:34\nthat our mind creates so that we can operate inside of it.\n8:37\nBut we're just beginning to understand it.\n8:40\nAnd last but not least,\n8:42\nand there's actually a ton of great quotes\n8:43\nfrom these folks and others,\n8:44\nbut especially Albert Einstein.\n8:46\n\"The most beautiful experience\n8:48\n\"we can have is the mysterious.\n8:50\n\"It is the fundamental emotion that stands\n8:53\n\"at the cradle of true art and true science.\"\n8:56\nAnd I really want you to take this to heart\n8:58\nas you study your physics.\n9:00\nThere will be times where we're going\n9:02\nto be building our tool kits.\n9:03\nWhat's a vector?\n9:04\nWhat's a scalar?\n9:04\nGoing into some mathematics,\n9:06\nproving some formulas.\n9:07\nThose are the tool kits,\n9:09\nbut then we're gonna try to understand\n9:10\nfundamental phenomena.\n9:12\nHow does the universe actually work?\n9:14\nAnd if when we start to think about these,\n9:16\nyou don't get a few chills on your skin,\n9:18\na few goosebumps, and feel that the universe\n9:21\nis more mysterious than you thought,\n9:23\nthen we're not studying physics\n9:25\nthe say that we should be studying physics.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWhat I want to do in this video is answer an age-old question,\n0:04\nor at least an interesting question to me.\n0:06\nAnd the question is, let's say I have a ledge here--\n0:10\nI have a ledge or cliff, or maybe\n0:12\nthis is a building of some kind.\n0:14\nAnd let's say it has height, h.\n0:17\nSo let's say it has a height of h, right over here.\n0:21\nAnd what I'm curious about is if I were to either-- Let's\n0:25\nsay that this is me over here, so this is me.\n0:29\nIf I were to either jump, myself--\n0:32\nthat's not recommended for very large h's.\n0:35\nOr If I were to throw something, maybe a rock off of this\n0:38\nledge, how fast would either myself or that rock\n0:42\nbe going right before it hits the ground?\n0:48\nAnd like all of the other videos we're\n0:49\ndoing on projectile motion right now,\n0:52\nwe're going to ignore air resistance.\n0:54\nAnd for small h's and for small velocities,\n0:57\nthat's actually reasonable.\n0:59\nOr if the object is very aerodynamic\n1:02\nand is kind of dense, then the air resistance\n1:04\nwill matter less.\n1:05\nIf it's me kind of belly flopping from a high altitude,\n1:08\nthen the air resistance will start to matter a lot.\n1:10\nBut for the sake of simplicity, we're going to assume no air.\n1:15\nOr we're not going to take into effect\n1:17\nthe effects of air resistance.\n1:19\nOr we could assume that we're doing\n1:20\nthis on an Earth-like planet that has no atmosphere.\n1:24\nHowever you want to do it.\n1:25\nSo let's just think about the problem.\n1:27\nAnd just so you know, some of you might say,\n1:28\nthat's not realistic.\n1:29\nBut this actually would be realistic for a small h.\n1:32\nIf you were to jump off of the roof of a one-story building,\n1:35\nair resistance will not be a major component\n1:37\nin determining your speed if.\n1:39\nIt was to be a much larger building, then all of a sudden\n1:41\nit matters.\n1:42\nAnd I don't recommend you do any of these things.\n1:43\nThose are all very dangerous things.\n1:45\nMuch better to do it with a rock.\n1:46\nSo that's actually the example we're going to be considering.\n1:49\nSo let's just think about this a little bit.\n1:52\nWe want to figure out-- So at the top,\n1:56\nright when the thing gets dropped,\n1:57\nright when the rock gets dropped,\n1:59\nyou have an initial velocity of 0.\n2:05\nAnd once again, we're going to use the convention here\n2:07\nthat positive velocity means upwards,\n2:11\nor a positive vector means up, a negative vector means down.\n2:16\nSo we're going to have an initial velocity over here\n2:18\nof 0.\n2:19\nAnd then at the bottom we're going\n2:21\nto have some final velocity here that\n2:30\nis going to be a negative number.\n2:33\nSo it's going to have some negative value over here.\n2:36\nSo this is going to be negative.\n2:39\nThis is going to be a negative number right over there.\n2:43\nAnd we know that the acceleration of gravity\n2:46\nfor an object on free fall, an object in free\n2:49\nfall near the surface of the earth.\n2:51\nWe know it, and we're going to assume that it's constant.\n2:54\nSo our constant acceleration is going\n2:56\nto be negative 9.8 meters per second squared.\n3:01\nSo what we're going to do is given an h,\n3:03\nand given that their initial velocity is 0\n3:05\nand that our acceleration is negative 9.8 meters per\n3:07\nsquared, we want to figure out what our final velocity is\n3:11\ngoing to be right before we hit the ground.\n3:14\nWe're going to assume that this h is\n3:15\ngiven in meters, right over here.\n3:17\nAnd we'll get an answer in meters\n3:18\nper second for that final velocity.\n3:20\nSo let's see how we can figure it out.\n3:22\nSo we know some basic things.\n3:24\nAnd the whole point of these is to really show you\n3:26\nthat you can always derive these more interesting questions\n3:29\nfrom very basic things that we know.\n3:32\nSo we know that displacement is equal to average velocity times\n3:41\nchange in time.\n3:45\nAnd we know that average velocity--\n3:48\nif we assume acceleration is constant,\n3:50\nwhich we are doing-- average velocity\n3:53\nis the final velocity plus the initial velocity over 2.\n4:01\nAnd then our change in time, the amount of elapsed time\n4:06\nthat goes by-- this is our change in velocity.\n4:10\nSo elapsed time is the same thing.\n4:12\nI write it over here-- is our change in velocity\n4:16\ndivided by our acceleration.\n4:20\nAnd just to make sure you understand this,\n4:22\nit just comes straight from the idea\n4:24\nthat acceleration-- or let me write it this way--\n4:26\nthat change in velocity is just acceleration times time.\n4:32\nOr I should say, acceleration times change in time.\n4:36\nSo if you divide both sides of this equation by acceleration,\n4:39\nyou get this right over here.\n4:42\nSo that is what our displacement-- Remember,\n4:43\nI want an expression for displacement\n4:45\nin terms of the things we know and the one\n4:48\nthing that we want to find out.\n4:50\nWell, for this example right over here,\n4:55\nwe know a couple of things.\n4:56\nWell actually, let me take it step by step.\n4:58\nWe know that our initial velocity is 0.\n5:03\nSo this first expression for the example we're doing,\n5:06\nthe average velocity is going to be our final velocity divided\n5:10\nby 2, since our initial velocity is 0.\n5:13\nOur change in velocity is the same thing\n5:19\nas final velocity minus initial velocity.\n5:25\nAnd once again, we know that the initial velocity is 0 here.\n5:28\nSo our change in velocity is the same thing\n5:30\nas our final velocity.\n5:32\nSo once again, this will be times.\n5:33\nInstead of writing change in velocity here,\n5:35\nwe could just write our final velocity\n5:37\nbecause we're starting at 0.\n5:38\nInitial velocity is 0.\n5:39\nSo times our final velocity divided by our acceleration.\n5:46\nFinal velocity is the same thing as change in velocity\n5:48\nbecause initial velocity was 0.\n5:51\nAnd all of this is going to be our displacement.\n5:56\nAnd now it looks like we have everything\n5:59\nwritten in things we know.\n6:01\nSo if we multiply both sides of this expression\n6:04\nor both sides of this equation by 2 times our acceleration\n6:11\non that side.\n6:12\nAnd we multiply the left-hand side\n6:14\nby-- I'll do the same colors-- 2 times our acceleration.\n6:21\nOn the left hand side, we get 2 times our acceleration\n6:27\ntimes our displacement is going to be equal to,\n6:35\non the right hand side, the 2 cancels out with the 2,\n6:38\nthe acceleration cancels out with the acceleration--\n6:40\nit will be equal to the velocity,\n6:42\nour final velocity squared.\n6:49\nFinal velocity times final velocity.\n6:52\nAnd so we can just solve for final velocity here.\n6:56\nSo we know our acceleration is negative 9.8 meters\n7:01\nper second squared.\n7:02\nSo let me write this over here.\n7:04\nSo this is negative 9.8.\n7:07\nSo we have 2 times negative 9.8--\n7:10\nlet me just multiply that out.\n7:12\nSo that's negative 19.6 meters per second squared.\n7:19\nAnd then what's our displacement going to be?\n7:21\nWhat's the displacement over the course\n7:23\nof dropping this rock off of this ledge or off of this roof?\n7:27\nSo you might be tempted to say that our displacement is h.\n7:29\nBut remember, these are vector quantities,\n7:32\nso you want to make sure you get the direction right.\n7:34\nFrom where the rock started to where it ends, what's it doing?\n7:39\nIt's going to go a distance of h,\n7:41\nbut it's going to go a distance of h downwards.\n7:44\nAnd our convention is down is negative.\n7:48\nSo in this example, our displacement\n7:52\nfrom when it leaves your hand to when it hits the ground,\n7:55\nthe displacement is going to be equal to negative h.\n7:58\nIt's going to travel a distance of h,\n8:00\nbut it's going to travel that distance downwards.\n8:02\nAnd that's why this vector notion is very important here.\n8:05\nOur convention is very important here.\n8:07\nSo our displacement over here is going to be negative h meters.\n8:17\nSo this is the variable, and this\n8:19\nis the shorthand for meters.\n8:20\nSo when you multiply these two things out,\n8:22\nlucky for us these negatives cancel out,\n8:24\nand you get 19.6h meters squared per second squared is equal\n8:37\nto our final velocity squared.\n8:44\nAnd notice, when you square something\n8:45\nyou lose the sign information.\n8:47\nIf our final velocity was positive, you square it,\n8:49\nyou still get a positive value.\n8:50\nIf it was negative and you square it,\n8:52\nyou still get a positive value.\n8:53\nBut remember, in this example, we're\n8:55\ngoing to be moving downward.\n8:56\nSo we want the negative version of this.\n8:58\nSo to really figure out our final velocity,\n9:01\nwe take, essentially, the negative square root\n9:03\nof both sides of this equation.\n9:07\nSo if we were to take the square root of both sides of this,\n9:10\nyou take the square root of that side,\n9:12\nyou take the square root of that side, you will get--\n9:14\nand I'll flip them around-- your final velocity, we could say,\n9:21\nis equal to the square root of 19.6h.\n9:25\nAnd you can even take the square root of the meter squared\n9:27\nper second squared, treat them almost like variables,\n9:30\neven though they're units.\n9:31\nAnd then outside of the radical sign,\n9:33\nyou will get a meters per second.\n9:35\nAnd the thing I want to be careful here\n9:37\nis if we just take the principal root here,\n9:39\nthe principal root here is the positive square root.\n9:41\nBut we know that our velocity is going to be downwards here,\n9:44\nbecause that is our convention.\n9:45\nSo we want to make sure we get the negative square root.\n9:50\nSo let's try it out with some numbers.\n9:52\nWe've essentially solved what we set out\n9:54\nto solve at the beginning of this video,\n9:56\nhow fast would we be falling, as a function of the height.\n9:59\nWell, let's try it out with something.\n10:01\nSo let's say that the height is-- I don't know,\n10:03\nlet's say the height is 5 meters, which\n10:09\nwould be probably jumping off of a\n10:12\nor throwing a rock off of a one-story, maybe\n10:14\na commercial one-story building.\n10:18\nThat's about 5 meters, would be about 15 feet.\n10:20\nSo yeah, about the roof of a commercial building,\n10:23\ngive or take.\n10:24\nSo let's turn it on.\n10:27\nAnd so what do we get?\n10:28\nIf we put 5 meters in here, we get 19.6 times 5 gives us 98.\n10:38\nSo almost 100.\n10:41\nAnd then, we want to take the square root of that,\n10:43\nso it's going to be almost 10.\n10:45\nSo the square root of 98 gives us roughly 9.9.\n10:51\nAnd we want the negative square root of that.\n10:53\nin that situation, when the height is 5 meters-- So\n10:56\nif you jump off of a one-story commercial building,\n10:59\nright at the bottom, or if you throw a rock off that, right\n11:01\nat the bottom, right before it hits the ground,\n11:03\nit will have a velocity of negative 9.9 meters per second.\n11:11\nSo negative 9.9 meters per second.\n11:15\nI'll leave it up to you, as an exercise,\n11:17\nto figure out how fast this is either kilometers\n11:20\nper hour or miles per hour because it's pretty fast.\n11:23\nIt's not something you's want to do.\n11:24\nAnd this is just off of a one-story building.\n11:26\nBut you can usually figure this out.\n11:28\nYou could use this for, really, any height as\n11:30\nlong as we're reasonably close to the surface of the earth\n11:33\nand you ignore the effects of air resistance.\n11:35\nAt really high heights, especially if the object is not\n11:38\nthat aerodynamic, then air resistance\n11:40\nwill start to matter a lot.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLike we've done in the last several videos, let's assume\n0:03\nthat we have some set of basis vectors B.\n0:07\nAnd let's say our basis is going to be v1 v2\n0:11\nall the way to vk.\n0:14\nSo this will span a subspace of dimension k.\n0:18\nAnd let's assume that each of these guys are members of Rn.\n0:22\nSo v1 v2 all the way to vk.\n0:27\nThey're all members of Rn.\n0:30\nNow in the last video, we saw that we can define a change of\n0:33\nbasis matrix.\n0:35\nAnd it's a fancy word, but all it means is a matrix that has\n0:39\nthese basis vectors as its columns.\n0:41\nSo v1, v2 all the way to vk as its columns.\n0:48\nSo we're going to have k columns and we're going to\n0:52\nhave n rows.\n0:53\nBecause each of these guys are members of Rn, so they're\n0:55\ngoing to have n entries.\n0:56\nSo we're going to have n rows.\n0:58\nSo it's going to be an n by k matrix.\n1:01\nAnd we saw in the last video that if I have some vector a\n1:08\nthat is a member of Rn-- and assuming that a is in the span\n1:14\nof B-- I can represent a.\n1:16\nI could say that a is equal to the change of basis matrix\n1:22\ntimes the coordinates of a with respect to our basis.\n1:28\nThis is what we saw in the last video.\n1:30\nIf I have the coordinates of a with respect to B, I can\n1:34\nmultiply it by the change of basis matrix and I'll get my\n1:36\nvector a in standard coordinates.\n1:38\nOr if I have my vector a in standard coordinates, then I\n1:41\ncan solve for my vector a in coordinates with respect to B.\n1:45\nWe saw that in the last video.\n1:47\nNow let's take a special case.\n1:50\nLet's assume that C is invertible.\n2:02\nWhat does that mean?\n2:03\nOr what does that tell us about C?\n2:05\nWell if C is invertible, it's two things.\n2:07\nIt means that C is a square matrix or has the same number\n2:11\nrows and columns.\n2:12\nAnd that its rows or columns-- You can pick either of them--\n2:15\nhave to be linearly independent.\n2:16\nSo linearly independent, let's just pick columns.\n2:20\nNow the second statement is a bit redundant.\n2:21\nWe know that C has linearly independent columns, because\n2:24\nits columns are bases for a subspace.\n2:28\nSo a basis, by definition, all of the vectors have to be\n2:31\nlinearly independent.\n2:32\nSo we know this is a bit redundant.\n2:37\nBut what's interesting is if we know that C is invertible,\n2:39\nC has to be square.\n2:41\nAnd if all of these vectors are members of Rn, then k has\n2:44\nto be equal to n.\n2:48\nSo C is square means that k is equal to n or that we have n\n2:55\nbasis vectors.\n2:59\nNow if that's the case, what is the span of B?\n3:03\nThink about it.\n3:04\nWe have n linearly independent vectors in Rn.\n3:20\nSo any time you have n linearly independent vectors\n3:23\nin Rn, those guys are a basis for Rn.\n3:27\nBecause any basis that has n entries-- and they're all\n3:30\nlinearly independent-- is going to be a basis for Rn.\n3:35\nSo then B is a basis for Rn.\n3:42\nSo if we know that C is invertible, we also know that\n3:45\nyou can get to any vector in Rn by some linear combination\n3:50\nof your basis vectors right there.\n3:54\nIn the last video, we had to make sure that this guy was in\n3:59\nthe span of these vectors.\n4:01\nBut now we don't have to make sure, because if C is\n4:03\ninvertible, then the span of B is going to be equal to Rn.\n4:17\nOr another way you could say it is if the span of B is\n4:19\nequal to Rn.\n4:21\nIf we have n vectors here, if k was equal to n, then we know\n4:25\nthat the span of B would be equal to Rn.\n4:28\nAnd so we'd have n vectors here, n linearly independent\n4:31\ncolumns here, and it would be an n by n matrix with all of\n4:34\nthe columns linearly independent.\n4:35\nSo then C would be invertible.\n4:37\nSo we could write if and only if.\n4:39\nAnd we could write it the other way.\n4:41\nIf the span of B is Rn, then C is invertible.\n4:53\nAnd that's useful, because if either of these things are\n4:56\ntrue, then we can rewrite the same equation.\n5:00\nSo let's say if we know this and we're looking for that, we\n5:03\ncan just multiply C times that.\n5:05\nLet's say we know this and we're looking for that.\n5:07\nBefore we had to do that augmented matrix and solve for\n5:10\nit, whatnot.\n5:10\nBut if we know C is invertible, then one, we know\n5:15\nthat any vector here can be represented in\n5:19\nthe span of our basis.\n5:20\nSo any vector here can be represented as linear\n5:22\ncombinations of these guys.\n5:23\nSo you know that any vector can be represented in these\n5:27\ncoordinates or with coordinates with\n5:28\nrespect to our basis.\n5:30\nWe can multiply both sides of this equation times C inverse.\n5:34\nAnd what do you get if you multiply?\n5:35\nSo it becomes C inverse C times our coordinates of a\n5:40\nwith respect to B is equal to C inverse times a.\n5:45\nThis is just the identity matrix right there.\n5:50\nAnother way of writing this is that the coordinates of a,\n5:54\nwith respect to our basis B, which spans all of Rn, is\n5:59\nequal to C inverse times our vector a.\n6:04\nLet's apply this a little bit.\n6:06\nLet's apply this.\n6:07\nLet's use this information, what we've done in this video.\n6:11\nLet's do some concrete examples.\n6:13\nSo let's say I have some basis.\n6:20\nLet me define two vectors.\n6:21\nI'll do it this way.\n6:22\nSo let's say I have v1 is equal to the vector 1, 3.\n6:28\nAnd let's say v2 is equal to the vector 2, 1.\n6:35\nAnd I have a basis that is equal to the set of v1 and v2.\n6:43\nNow I'll leave it for you to verify that these guys are\n6:45\nlinearly independent.\n6:46\nBut if I have two linearly independent vectors in R2,\n6:49\nthen B is a basis for R2.\n6:59\nAnd if we write the change of basis matrix, if we say C is\n7:05\nequal to 1, 3, 2, 1, we know that C is invertible.\n7:10\nAnd actually to show that C is invertible, we can just\n7:12\ncalculate its inverse.\n7:14\nSo what's the determinant of C?\n7:16\nThe determinant of C is equal to 1 times 1 minus 2 times 3.\n7:24\nSo it's equal minus 5.\n7:27\nThat's the determinant of C.\n7:28\nAnd so C inverse-- We figured out a general formula for\n7:31\ndoing this for 2 by 2 matrices-- is equal to 1 over\n7:35\nthe determinant of C, so 1 over minus 5 times-- You\n7:42\nswitch these two guys, so you switch the 1's, and you make\n7:45\nthese two guys negative.\n7:47\nSo minus 2, and then minus 3.\n7:50\nAnd the very fact that this guy, the determinant of C, was\n7:54\nnon-zero told us that this was invertible.\n7:57\nBut anyway, this is C inverse.\n7:59\nSo let's say that I have some vector a that\n8:04\nis a member of R2.\n8:09\nI'm just going to pick some random numbers.\n8:10\nLet's say that a is equal to 7, 2.\n8:13\nAnd I want to find out what the coordinates of a are with\n8:17\nrespect to my basis B.\n8:24\nWell we go to this situation.\n8:26\nWe know what a is, so we just multiply a times C inverse to\n8:32\nget this guy right here, to get the coordinates of a with\n8:35\nrespect to B.\n8:37\nSo let me write that down.\n8:38\nSo what is C?\n8:39\nSo C is that.\n8:40\nC inverse is that.\n8:41\nSo we could write the coordinates of a with respect\n8:46\nto B is equal to C inverse times the standard\n8:50\ncoordinates of a.\n8:51\nOr this is the same thing.\n8:53\nLet me put the actual numbers here.\n8:54\nThe coordinates of a with respect to B are going to be\n8:58\nequal to C inverse, which is minus 1/5 times 1 minus 3\n9:05\nminus 2, 1, times a, times 7, 2.\n9:15\nAnd what is this equal to?\n9:15\nThis is equal to minus 1/5.\n9:19\nAnd then we're going to get 1 times 7 plus minus 2 times 2.\n9:24\nSo it's minus 4.\n9:25\nSo 7 minus 4 is 3.\n9:27\nAnd then we're going to get minus 3 times 7, which is\n9:30\nminus 21, plus 1 times 2.\n9:33\nSo minus 21 plus 2 is minus is 19.\n9:39\nSo the coordinates of a with respect to the basis B are\n9:46\ngoing to be equal to-- Let me just multiply the negative\n9:48\n1/5-- you get minus 3/5.\n9:52\nAnd then you get plus 19/5.\n9:55\nSo 19 over 5.\n10:00\nJust like that.\n10:00\nAnd let's verify that.\n10:03\nThis means that a is equal to minus 3/5 times our first\n10:06\nbasis vector plus 19/5 times our second basis vector.\n10:10\nLet's verify that that's the case.\n10:12\nSo let's see, minus 3/5 times 1, 3, plus 19/5 times 2, 1.\n10:25\nLet's see what this is going to be equal to.\n10:31\nLet me write the two vectors.\n10:33\nThis is minus 3/5 times 3 is minus 9/5.\n10:42\nAnd there we're going to add it to this guy.\n10:45\nSo this guy is 2 times 19 is 38/5.\n10:51\nRight?\n10:52\nAnd then 19/5 times 1 is 19/5.\n10:56\nAnd then if you add these two vectors\n10:58\ntogether, what do we get?\n11:00\nWe get minus 3/5 plus 38/5.\n11:04\nThat's 35/3.\n11:06\n35/5 is 7, minus 9/5 plus 19/5.\n11:13\nThat's 10/5 or 2.\n11:16\nAnd there you have it.\n11:17\nThat was our original a.\n11:19\nSo we see that a can definitely be represented as\n11:21\nminus 3/5 times our first basis vector plus 19/5 times\n11:26\nour second basis vector.\n11:28\nNow that was a case where we had some vector a and we\n11:31\nwanted to represent it in coordinates with respect to B.\n11:34\nWhat if we had the other way?\n11:36\nWhat if we said that some vector w's coordinates with\n11:43\nrespect to B are-- I'll do something simple-- are 1, 1.\n11:50\nThen what is w in standard coordinates?\n11:54\nWell there we can just multiply.\n11:58\nRemember w is just equal to the change of basis matrix\n12:01\ntimes w's coordinates with respect to the basis B.\n12:05\nSo w is going to be equal to the change of basis matrix,\n12:10\nwhich is just 1, 3, 2, 1, times the coordinates of w\n12:19\nwith respect to B times 1, 1.\n12:22\nWhich is equal to 1 times 1 plus 2 times 1 is 3.\n12:27\nAnd then 3 times 1 plus 1 plus 1.\n12:31\nSo 3 times 1 is 3, plus 1 is 4.\n12:35\nSo w is just equal to the vector 3, 4.\n12:38\nSo there you see if our change of basis matrix is invertible,\n12:41\nwhich is really just another way of saying that are basis\n12:44\nspans Rn-- in this example it was R2-- then you can easily\n12:49\ngo back and forth between coordinate representations in\n12:52\nour standard coordinates and coordinate representations\n12:59\nwith respect to our basis.\n13:02\nRight?\n13:02\nThis is with respect to the basis.\n13:03\nThis is in standard coordinates.\n13:08\nAnd you can do that just simply by either using this\n13:12\ninformation or just saying, oh, the coordinates with\n13:16\nrespect to the basis equal to C inverse times a, or the\n13:18\ninverse of our change of basis matrix times a.\n13:21\nOr saying our coordinates with respect to the standard basis\n13:27\nis just equal to the change of basis matrix times the\n13:30\ncoordinates with respect to the basis.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's see if we can learn a thing or two\n0:01\nabout significant figures, sometimes\n0:06\ncalled significant digits.\n0:07\nAnd the idea behind significant figures\n0:10\nis just to make sure that when you do a big computation\n0:13\nand you have a bunch of digits there,\n0:14\nthat you're not over-representing\n0:16\nthe amount of precision that you had,\n0:17\nthat the result isn't more precise than the things\n0:20\nthat you actually measured, that you used to get that result.\n0:24\nBefore we go into the depths of it\n0:25\nand how you use it with computation,\n0:27\nlet's just do a bunch of examples\n0:28\nof identifying significant figures.\n0:30\nThen we'll try to come up with some rules of thumb.\n0:32\nBut the general way to think about it is, which digits\n0:34\nare really giving me information about how precise\n0:38\nmy measurement is?\n0:39\nSo on this first thing right over here,\n0:41\nthe significant figures are this 7, 0, 0.\n0:45\nSo over here, you have three significant figures.\n0:51\nAnd it might make you a little uncomfortable that we're not\n0:53\nincluding these 0's that are after the decimal point\n0:57\nand before this 7, that we're not including those.\n0:59\nBecause you're just like, that does help define the number.\n1:02\nAnd that is true, but it's not telling us\n1:05\nhow precise our measurement is.\n1:06\nAnd to try to understand this a little bit better,\n1:08\nimagine if this right over here was a measurement\n1:11\nof kilometers, so if we measured 0.00700 kilometers.\n1:19\nThis would be the exact same thing as 7.00 meters.\n1:26\nMaybe, in fact, we just used a meter stick.\n1:28\nAnd we said it's exactly 7.00 meters.\n1:32\nSo we measured to the nearest centimeter.\n1:34\nAnd we just felt like writing it in kilometers.\n1:36\nThese two numbers are the exact same thing.\n1:39\nThey're just different units.\n1:40\nBut I think when you look over here,\n1:41\nit makes a lot more sense why you only\n1:43\nhave three significant figures.\n1:45\nThese 0's are just shifting it based\n1:50\non the units of measurement that you're using.\n1:53\nBut the numbers that are really giving you the precision\n1:55\nare the 7, the 0, and the 0.\n1:58\nAnd the reason why we're counting these trailing 0's is\n2:00\nthat whoever wrote this number didn't have to write them down.\n2:03\nThey wrote them down to explicitly say,\n2:05\nlook, I measured this far.\n2:06\nIf they didn't measure this far, they\n2:08\nwould have just left these 0's off.\n2:10\nAnd they would have just told you 7 meters, not 7.00.\n2:14\nLet's do the next one.\n2:15\nSo based on the same idea, we have the 5 and the 2.\n2:18\nThe non-zero digits are going to be significant figures.\n2:21\nYou don't include this leading 0,\n2:23\nby the same logic that if this was 0.052 kilometers,\n2:28\nthis would be the same thing as 52 meters, which clearly only\n2:33\nhas two significant figures.\n2:37\nSo you don't want to count leading\n2:42\n0's before the first non-zero digit, I guess we could say.\n2:52\nYou don't want to include those.\n2:54\nYou just want to include all the non-zero digits and everything\n2:57\nin between, and trailing 0's if a decimal point is involved.\n3:03\nI'll make those ideas a little bit more formal.\n3:06\nSo over here, the person did 370.\n3:08\nAnd then they wrote the decimal point.\n3:10\nIf they didn't write the decimal point,\n3:12\nit would be a little unclear on how precise this was.\n3:14\nBut because they wrote the decimal point,\n3:16\nit means that they measured it exactly to be 370.\n3:19\nThey didn't get 372 and then round down.\n3:21\nOr they didn't have kind of a roughness only\n3:24\nto the nearest tens place.\n3:25\nThis decimal tells you that all three of these are significant.\n3:29\nSo this is three significant figures over here.\n3:34\nThen on this next one, once again, this decimal\n3:37\ntells us that not only did we get to the nearest one,\n3:40\nbut then we put another trailing 0 here,\n3:41\nwhich means we got to the nearest tenth.\n3:43\nSo in this situation, once again,\n3:45\nwe have three significant figures.\n3:48\nOver here, the 7 is in the hundreds.\n3:52\nBut the measurement went all the way down\n3:54\nto the thousandths place.\n3:55\nAnd even though there are 0's in between,\n3:57\nthose 0's are part of our measurement,\n3:59\nbecause they are in between non-zero digits.\n4:02\nSo in this situation, every digit here,\n4:06\nthe way it's written, is a significant digit.\n4:08\nSo you have six significant digits.\n4:12\nNow, this last one is ambiguous.\n4:14\nThe 37,000-- it's not clear whether you\n4:17\nmeasured exactly 37,000.\n4:19\nMaybe you measured to the nearest one,\n4:21\nand you got an exact number.\n4:22\nYou got exactly 37,000.\n4:25\nOr maybe you only measured to the nearest thousand.\n4:29\nSo there's a little bit of ambiguity here.\n4:33\nIf you just see something written exactly like this,\n4:36\nyou would probably say, if you had to guess-- or not guess.\n4:39\nIf there wasn't any more information,\n4:41\nyou would say that there's just two significant figures\n4:46\nor significant digits.\n4:47\nFor this person to be less ambiguous,\n4:49\nthey would want to put a decimal point right over there.\n4:52\nAnd that lets you know that this is actually\n4:55\nfive digits of precision, that we actually\n4:57\ngo to five significant figures.\n4:58\nSo if you don't see that decimal point, I would go with two.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nI've got a 2 by 2 matrix here.\n0:02\nLet's say A is equal to a, b, c, d.\n0:07\nSo I'm going to keep it really general.\n0:08\nSo this is really any 2 by 2 matrix.\n0:11\nWhat I want to do is use our technique for finding an\n0:15\ninverse of this matrix to essentially find a formula for\n0:18\nthe inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix.\n0:21\nSo I want to essentially find a inverse, and I want to do it\n0:25\njust using a formula that it just applies to this matrix\n0:28\nright here.\n0:28\nSo how can I do that?\n0:30\nWell, we know a technique.\n0:31\nWe just create an augmented matrix.\n0:33\nSo let's just create an augmented matrix right here.\n0:37\nSo we have a, b, c, d, and then we augment it with the\n0:43\nidentity in R2, so 1, 0, 0, 1.\n0:47\nAnd we know if we perform a series of row operations on\n0:50\nthis augmented matrix to get the left-hand side in reduced\n0:53\nrow echelon form.\n0:54\nThe right-hand side, if the reduced row echelon form here\n0:57\ngets to the identity, then the right-hand side is going to be\n1:00\nthe inverse.\n1:01\nSo let's do it in this general case, not dealing with\n1:04\nparticular numbers here.\n1:06\nSo the first thing I want to do, or I would like to do, is\n1:08\nI would like to zero this guy out.\n1:11\nWhat we want to do is we want to zero that out, zero that\n1:13\nout, and then these two terms have to become equal to 1.\n1:15\nSo the best way to zero this out, let's perform a little\n1:20\ntransformation here.\n1:22\nSo if I perform the transformation on the columns,\n1:29\nC1, so those are the entries of a column-- this would be\n1:32\none column right here, that would be another column right\n1:35\nthere, that's the third column,\n1:37\nthat's the fourth column.\n1:38\nBut the transformation I'm going to perform on each of\n1:40\nthese columns, and we know this is equivalent to a row\n1:41\noperation, is going to be equal to-- since I want to\n1:44\nzero this one out, I'm going to keep my first row the same,\n1:49\nso it's going to be C1, and I'm going to replace my second\n1:52\nrow with a times my second row minus c times my first row.\n1:59\nNow why am I doing that?\n2:00\nBecause a times c minus c times a is going to be 0.\n2:04\nSo this guy's going to be 0.\n2:05\nThat's the row operation I'm going to perform.\n2:07\nAnd I'm doing this so we can kind of keep track, account\n2:10\nfor what we're doing because the algebra's going to get\n2:12\nhairy in a little bit.\n2:13\nSo let me perform this operation.\n2:15\nSo if I perform that operation on our matrix, what do we\n2:18\nhave.\n2:19\nSo our first row's going to be the same.\n2:22\nLet me start with our second row because that's a little\n2:24\nbit more complicated.\n2:25\nSo I'm going to replace c with a times c minus c times a.\n2:31\nThat's ac-- so let me put it this way-- so that's going to\n2:34\nbe 0 right there.\n2:36\nI'm going to replace d with d times a or a times d minus c\n2:45\ntimes C1 in this column vector.\n2:48\nSo minus c times b.\n2:50\nLet me write this as bc.\n2:52\nAnd then let me augment it.\n2:55\nAnd then this guy's going to be a times 0, because he's C2\n2:58\nminus c times C1.\n3:00\nSo it's going to be minus c.\n3:03\nAnd then finally, this guy right here is going to be a\n3:07\ntimes 1-- a times this 1 right here-- minus c times 0.\n3:12\nSo that's just going to be an a.\n3:14\nAnd then the first row is pretty straightforward.\n3:17\nWe know that the first row or the first entries in our\n3:19\ncolumn vectors just stay the same through this\n3:21\ntransformation.\n3:23\nSo it's a, b, 1, 0.\n3:27\nAnd just to make sure you're clear what we're doing, when\n3:30\nyou perform this transformation on this column\n3:32\nvector right here, you got this column\n3:35\nvector right there.\n3:36\nWhen you perform the transformation on this column\n3:38\nvector right there, you get this column\n3:40\nvector right there.\n3:41\nNow I just want to make that clear because I did all of the\n3:44\nsecond entries of all of the column vectors at once because\n3:48\nwe all were essentially performing the same row\n3:50\noperation, so that just helped me simplify at least my\n3:52\nthinking a little bit.\n3:53\nLet me stay in this mode.\n3:55\nSo let's continue to get this in reduced row echelon form.\n3:58\nThe next thing we want to do is, let's make another\n4:00\ntransformation, we'll call this T1.\n4:02\nThat was our first transformation.\n4:03\nLet's do another transformation.\n4:05\nT2, or another set of row operations.\n4:08\nSo if I start with the column vector C1, C2, what I want to\n4:13\ndo now is I want to keep my second row the same and I want\n4:16\nto zero out this character right here.\n4:19\nI want to zero him out.\n4:20\nI know I'm going to keep my second row the same, so C2 is\n4:24\njust going to still be C2.\n4:27\nBut in order to zero this out, what I can do is I can replace\n4:30\nthe first row with this scaling factor times the first\n4:35\nrow minus this scaling factor times the second row.\n4:38\nSo it'll be ad minus bc times your first entry in your\n4:44\ncolumn vector minus b times your second entry.\n4:50\nAnd the whole reason why I'm doing that is so that this guy\n4:53\nzeroes out.\n4:55\nSo if we apply that to this matrix up here-- let's do the\n4:59\nfirst row first.\n5:01\nSo this first entry right here is going to be ad minus bc\n5:05\ntimes a, because that's C1-- let me write that down.\n5:08\nSo it's ad minus bc times a minus b times C2 minus 0.\n5:20\nSo it's just going to be-- that second term\n5:22\njust becomes 0.\n5:24\nFair enough.\n5:25\nNow what is this guy going to be?\n5:26\nHe's going to be-- I'll write it out.\n5:28\nHe's going to be ad minus bc times b minus b times your C2\n5:40\nin this column vector, minus b times ad minus bc.\n5:47\nAnd you can see immediately that these two guys are going\n5:49\nto cancel out and you're going to get a 0 there.\n5:52\nAnd then we've got to augment it.\n5:54\nI want to make sure I don't run out of space, I should've\n5:56\nstarted to the left a little bit more.\n5:58\nSo what's this guy going to be?\n5:59\nWell I'm going to have this guy times ad minus bc-- I'll\n6:03\ndo it in pink-- so you're going to have ad minus bc\n6:07\ntimes 1, which is just ad minus bc minus b times C2, so\n6:13\nminus b times minus c.\n6:16\nSo that's plus bc.\n6:20\nSo 1 times ad minus bc minus b times minus\n6:25\nc is equal to that.\n6:26\nAnd you can immediately see that these two guys will\n6:28\ncancel out.\n6:28\nYou're just [INAUDIBLE]\n6:29\nad.\n6:30\nAnd then this guy over here, you're going to have 0 times\n6:34\nad minus bc, which is just a 0, minus b times a.\n6:39\nSo you have minus ab-- just squeeze it in there.\n6:44\nAnd we know that our second row just stays the same.\n6:47\nOur second row just stays the same in this transformation.\n6:50\nSo we had a 0 here, we're still going to have a 0.\n6:52\nWe had an ad minus bc.\n6:54\nWe'll still have an ad minus bc.\n6:56\nWe had a minus c.\n6:58\nThen we had an a.\n7:01\nJust like that.\n7:02\nNow let me re-write this matrix just so it gets cleaned\n7:05\nup a little bit.\n7:06\nSo let me re-write it right here.\n7:09\nI'll do it in my orange-- well, let me\n7:11\ndo it in this yellow.\n7:14\nSo I have ad minus bc times a.\n7:21\nAnd then this term right here just became a 0.\n7:24\nThis term right here is a 0.\n7:26\nThis term right here is an ad minus bc.\n7:31\nAnd then our augmented part, this part was just an ad.\n7:35\nThis was a minus ab.\n7:38\nThis is a minus c.\n7:40\nAnd then this is an a.\n7:43\nNow we're almost at reduced row echelon form right here.\n7:46\nThese two things just have to be equal to 1 in order to get\n7:49\nreduced row echelon form.\n7:50\nSo let's define a transformation that'll make\n7:53\nboth of these equal to 1.\n7:54\nSo if this was T2 let me define my transformation T3.\n8:02\nYou give it a column vector, C1, C2.\n8:06\nAnd it's just going to scale each of the column vectors.\n8:08\nSo what I want to do is I want to divide my first entries by\n8:13\nthis scaling factor right here so that this becomes a 1.\n8:16\nSo I'm essentially going to multiply 1 over ad minus bc\n8:25\ntimes a, so 1 over ad, bc, a times my first entry in each\n8:30\nof my column vectors.\n8:33\nAnd then my second one I want to divide by this.\n8:34\nSo that this guy becomes a 1.\n8:36\nSo I'm doing two scalar divisions in one\n8:39\ntransformation.\n8:40\nSo this one's going to be 1 over ad minus bc times C2.\n8:47\nSo I'm just scaling everything by these two scaling factors.\n8:50\nSo if you apply this transformation to that right\n8:52\nthere, what do we get?\n8:54\nWe get a matrix.\n8:56\nAnd this guy, I'm going to divide him by ad minus bc\n9:01\ntimes a, so I'm dividing it by itself, so that\n9:04\nguy's going to be 1.\n9:05\nI'm going to divide 0 by this, but 0 divided by\n9:08\nanything is just 0.\n9:12\nThen we're in an augmented part.\n9:13\nad divided by-- so let me write it like this.\n9:17\nSo ad-- I'm going to divide by this-- so it's going to be ad\n9:22\nminus bc times a-- you immediately see that the a's\n9:26\ncancel out.\n9:27\nThis is going to be minus ab divided by ad\n9:34\nminus bc times a.\n9:36\nOnce again, the a's cancel out.\n9:38\nAnd then in my second row are my second entries in my column\n9:42\nvectors, 0 divided by anything is 0.\n9:45\nSo 0 divided by this thing is going to be 0, assuming we can\n9:49\ndivide by that, and we're going to talk\n9:51\nabout that in a second.\n9:53\nThis guy divided by this guy, we're just dividing by\n9:55\nhimself, so it's going to be equal to 1.\n9:58\nNow we have minus c divided by this, or ad minus bc.\n10:06\nAnd then we have an a.\n10:08\na divided by ad, ad minus bc.\n10:13\nAnd we're done.\n10:14\nWe put the left-hand side of our augmented matrix into\n10:18\nreduced row echelon form.\n10:20\nAnd now this is going to be our inverse.\n10:22\nSo let me clean it up a little bit.\n10:25\nSo, so far we started off with a matrix-- I'll do it in\n10:28\npurple-- we started off with a matrix a is\n10:31\nequal to a, b, c, d.\n10:35\nAnd now just using our technique we figured out that\n10:38\na inverse is equal to this thing right here.\n10:42\nAnd just to simplify-- well let me just write it the way I\n10:45\nhave it there, because I don't want to skip any steps-- this\n10:46\nis equal to d over ad minus bc.\n10:52\nRight, this guy and that guy canceled out.\n10:55\nAnd then we have a minus b over ad minus bc because that\n11:02\nguy and that guy canceled out.\n11:04\nThen you have a minus c over ad minus bc.\n11:09\nAnd then finally you have an a over ad minus bc,\n11:14\nwhich is our inverse.\n11:15\nBut one thing might just pop out at you immediately is that\n11:18\neverything in our inverse is being divided by this.\n11:21\nSo maybe an easier way to write our inverse.\n11:24\nWe could also write our inverse like this.\n11:26\nWe could just write it as 1 over ad minus bc times the\n11:31\nmatrix d minus b minus c and a.\n11:38\nAnd just like that we have come up with a formula for the\n11:42\ninverse of a 2 by 2 matrix.\n11:44\nYou give me any real numbers here and I'm going to give you\n11:48\nits inverse.\n11:48\nThat straightforward.\n11:50\nNow one thing you might be saying, hey, but not all 2 by\n11:53\n2 matrices are invertible.\n11:55\nHow can this be the case for all of them.\n11:58\nAnd I'll give you a question, when will this thing right\n12:00\nhere not be defined?\n12:02\nWhen is this thing not defined?\n12:06\nEvery operation I did, I can do with any real numbers, and\n12:09\nthis applies to any real numbers.\n12:10\nBut when is this thing not defined?\n12:16\nWell it's not defined when I divide by 0.\n12:19\nAnd when would I divide by 0?\n12:20\nEverything else you can multiply and subtract and add\n12:23\na zero to anything, but you just can't divide by 0.\n12:26\nWe've never defined what it means when you divide\n12:28\nsomething by 0.\n12:30\nSo it's not defined if ad minus bc is equal to 0.\n12:38\nSo this is an interesting thing.\n12:39\nI can always find the inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix as long as\n12:44\nad minus bc is not equal to 0.\n12:48\nWe came up with all of these fancy things for\n12:50\ninvertability, you've got to put it into reduced row\n12:52\nechelon form, and before that we talked being\n12:54\non 2 and 1 to 1.\n12:56\nFor at least a 2 by 2 matrix we've\n12:57\nreally simplified things.\n12:59\nAs long as ad minus bc does not equal 0, we can use this\n13:07\nformula and then we know that a-- and it goes both ways-- a\n13:11\nis invertible.\n13:13\nAnd not only is it invertible, but we can just apply this\n13:16\nformula to it.\n13:18\nSo immediately something interesting might-- you might\n13:20\nsay hey, this is an interesting number.\n13:24\nWe should come up with some name for it.\n13:25\nAnd lucky for us, we have come up with a name for it.\n13:29\nThis is called the determinant.\n13:33\nLet me write it in pink.\n13:35\nDeterminant.\n13:39\nSo the determinant of a, and it's also written like this\n13:45\nwith these little straight lines around a, and you could\n13:49\nalso write it like this, a, b, c, d.\n13:54\nBut most people kind of think this is redundant to have\n13:57\nbrackets and these lines.\n13:58\nSo then they just write it like this, this is equal to\n14:01\njust, they just write the lines, a, b, c, d.\n14:04\nI want to make this very clear.\n14:05\nIf you have the brackets you're dealing with a matrix.\n14:08\nIf you have just these straight lines you're talking\n14:10\nabout the determinant of the matrix.\n14:12\nBut this is defined for the 2 by 2 case to be\n14:16\nequal to ad minus bc.\n14:20\nThis is a definition of the determinant.\n14:28\nSo we can re-write, if we have some matrix here, we have some\n14:32\nmatrix a which is equal to a, b, c, d.\n14:37\nWe can now write its inverse, a inverse is equal to 1 over\n14:43\nthis thing, which we've defined as the determinant of\n14:45\na times-- and let's just see a good way of kind\n14:54\nof memorizing this.\n14:55\nWe're swapping these two guys, right, the a\n14:59\nand the d get swapped.\n15:01\nSo you get a d and an a.\n15:03\nAnd then these two guys stay the same,\n15:05\nthey just become negative.\n15:06\nSo minus b and minus c.\n15:09\nSo that's the general formula for the\n15:11\ndeterminant of a 2 by 2 matrix.\n15:13\nLet's try to do a couple.\n15:15\nLet's try to find the determinant of the\n15:20\nmatrix 1, 2, 3, 4.\n15:26\nEasy enough.\n15:27\nSo the determinant of-- let's say this is the matrix B.\n15:30\nSo the determinant of B, or we could write it like that,\n15:33\nthat's equal to the determinant of B.\n15:36\nThat is just equal to-- that's this thing right here-- 1\n15:39\ntimes 4 minus 3 times 2, which is equal to 4 minus 6, which\n15:49\nis equal to minus 2.\n15:50\nSo the determinant is minus 2, so this is invertible.\n15:55\nNot only is it invertible, but it's very easy to find its\n15:57\ninverse now.\n15:58\nWe can apply this formula.\n16:00\nThe inverse of B in this case-- let me do it in this\n16:04\ncolor-- B inverse is equal to 1 over the determinant, so\n16:07\nit's 1 over minus 2 times the matrix where we swap-- well,\n16:12\nthis is the determinant of B.\n16:14\nI want to be careful.\n16:15\nB is the same thing, but with brackets.\n16:18\n1, 2, 3, 4.\n16:22\nSo B inverse is going to be 1 over the determinant of B,\n16:25\nwhich is equal to minus 2.\n16:27\nSo 1 over minus 2.\n16:28\nWe swap these two guys, so they get a 4 and a 1, and then\n16:32\nthese two guys become negative-- minus 2\n16:35\nand then minus 3.\n16:36\nAnd then if we were to multiply this out it would be\n16:39\nequal to minus 1/2 times 4 is minus 2.\n16:43\nMinus 1/2 times minus 2 is 1.\n16:46\nMinus 1/2 times minus 3 is 3/2, minus 1/2\n16:51\ntimes 1 is minus 1/2.\n16:53\nSo that there is the inverse of B.\n16:56\nNow let's say we have another matrix.\n16:57\nLet's say we have the matrix C, and C is\n17:00\nequal to 1, 2, 3, 6.\n17:05\nWhat is the determinant of C?\n17:09\nIt is equal to-- we could write this way-- 1, 2, 3, 6.\n17:15\nAnd it is equal to 1 times 6 minus 3 times 2, which is\n17:21\nequal to 6 minus 6, which is equal to 0.\n17:25\nAnd there you see it's equal to 0, so you cannot find-- so\n17:29\nthis is not invertible.\n17:35\nSo we can't find its inverse because if we would try to\n17:37\napply this formula right here you'd have a 1 over 0.\n17:40\nBut we know this formula just comes out-- that attempt to\n17:43\nput it into reduced row echelon form, and in that last\n17:45\nstep we just had to essentially divide everything\n17:48\nby these terms. So these terms would be 0 in this matrix C\n17:52\nthat I just constructed for you.\n17:55\nAnd the reason why I knew-- I just pulled this out of my\n17:58\nbrain-- I knew this wasn't going to be invertible because\n18:00\nI constructed a situation where I have columns that are\n18:03\nlinear combinations of each other.\n18:04\nI have 1, 3-- you multiply that by 2 you get 2 and 6.\n18:08\nSo I knew that these aren't linearly independent columns.\n18:11\nSo you know that its rank wasn't going to be equal to,\n18:14\nso I knew it wasn't going to be invertible, but we see that\n18:16\nhere by just computing its determinant.",

And we'll talk a little bit more\n3:18\nabout kind of the difference.\n3:20\nA venture capitalist really is a private equity firm because\n3:22\nit's buying private equity.\n3:23\nBut private equity tends to invest in more established\n3:26\nbusiness, when people just talk about\n3:27\nprivate equity by itself.\n3:28\nBut we'll do several videos on that.\n3:31\nSo this is, essentially, this company is a private company\n3:33\nraising private equity.\n3:35\nNow, the example we did in the last video is, let's say this\n3:39\ncompany grows to a certain size.\n3:40\nLet me just do another company so it's clean.\n3:43\nLet's say I have another company, these are its assets.\n3:48\nAnd this is its-- let me draw its current\n3:50\nequity base right there.\n3:55\nThey should be the same size, but you get the idea-- and\n3:58\nthese assets, it could be it has some cash.\n4:02\nIt has some factories or land.\n4:05\nIt could have a bunch of stuff.\n4:06\nIt could have some technology, or we could have some\n4:08\nintellectual property.\n4:10\nMaybe it's a drug company, or maybe it's\n4:12\na technology company.\n4:12\nIt has a bunch of patents and stuff.\n4:14\nAnd then it has some intangibles-- a brand-- who\n4:16\nknows what it has.\n4:17\nThese are the assets of the firm.\n4:18\nThis is the equity of the firm.\n4:19\nSo this company right now has no debt.\n4:21\nAnd we'll talk about that in a second, what it\n4:22\nmeans to have debt.\n4:26\nAnd this is its current shareholder base, maybe some\n4:28\nof these are some VCs who invested in the company when\n4:31\nit was private.\n4:32\nMaybe the founder has these shares.\n4:34\nBut this is the equity base right here.\n4:36\nAnd let's say this company wants to raise a lot of money,\n4:39\nand as just kind of a review of the last video, it can do\n4:41\nan initial public offering.\n4:42\nSo right now it's private.\n4:44\nAll of these shares right now that are owned by the VCs and\n4:50\nthe initial founders of the company, they are not traded\n4:53\non a public exchange.\n4:54\nThis VC can't go to the NASDAQ and sell their shares.\n4:57\nThey can't go to the broker and say hey, sell my million\n4:59\nshares I have in Company X.\n5:01\nThey have to just sit on them.\n5:02\nMaybe they can find another private equity investor to buy\n5:05\ntheir shares, or maybe these founders-- there's no\n5:08\nliquidity here.\n5:09\nThere's no other person they can sell the shares to.\n5:12\nAnd also, if this company wants to raise money right now\n5:14\nit has to kind of go to a VC and do the whole process where\n5:18\nyou negotiate what this value is-- what the\n5:20\npre-money value is.\n5:21\nAnd they have to come up with all these legal documents, and\n5:24\nall of these stipulations around, we'll give you this\n5:28\nmoney, but if this happens, then you have to give us this\n5:30\ninterest rate.\n5:30\nAnd just all these type of things.\n5:33\nSo, what they might want to say is, we need to\n5:35\nraise a lot of money.\n5:36\nAll of these guys want a way for them to be able to sell\n5:39\ntheir shares easily if they need to.\n5:41\nAnd this company says well, we need to raise a ton of money.\n5:44\nLet's say we want to raise $100 million.\n5:46\nAnd that's hard to raise from just any one individual\n5:48\ninvestor, even if they are a big institution.\n5:51\nSo they'll do an initial public offering, and that\n5:53\nreally just means and-- the IPO, and this is review of the\n5:56\nlast one-- is that for the first time this company is\n5:59\ngoing to register its shares with the SEC, and because it\n6:04\ndoes, it's going to list its shares on an exchange.\n6:06\nIt will get a ticker symbol, it will maybe be company--\n6:09\nthis'll be its ticker, T-I-C-K, or in the last video\n6:13\ncould be SOCKS, because it's going to sell socks.\n6:16\nAnd then people can trade these shares on that exchange.\n6:20\nIt could be on the NASDAQ or something.\n6:22\nAnd I think some of you all have had experience doing that\n6:25\nwhere you go on your Charles Schwab account and you say I'm\n6:28\ngoing to sell SOCK.\n6:29\nWell, that company that you're selling, at some point, did an\n6:32\ninitial public offering, and registered with the SEC, and\n6:35\ngot listed on an exchange.\n6:37\nAnd the way it really works is, it's fundamentally the\n6:40\nsame as when you raise money from a VC.\n6:42\nBut now, instead of raising money from a VC, all the money\n6:48\ncomes from, essentially, the public.\n6:52\nIt goes through these banks and brokerages, but it's\n6:54\ncoming from a bunch of small-- I'm just\n6:57\ndivvying it up right here.\n6:58\nIt could be coming from millions\n7:00\nand millions of people.\n7:01\nBut the same process kind of holds.\n7:03\nIn order to see what price these shares are bought at,\n7:07\nsomeone has to say well, what is the company worth before it\n7:09\ngets the money?\n7:11\nWhat is the company worth before it gets this money?\n7:13\nKind of a pre-money valuation.\n7:14\nThat still has to happen, and that's what the\n7:16\ninvestment bank does.\n7:17\nThe investment bank will essentially do a model and\n7:19\nthey'll say oh, this is worth-- the company beforehand\n7:22\nwas worth $50 million.\n7:27\nThey'll kind of go out into the market to say well, our--\n7:29\nand let's say the company right now has\n7:33\nfive million shares.\n7:35\nSo that this piece right here is five million.\n7:38\nSo if the banks value the company at $50 million, and it\n7:41\nhas five million shares, they'll say OK, right now, the\n7:43\npre-money valuation is $10 a share.\n7:46\nAnd the bank will go out there.\n7:47\nIt'll kind of gauge interest and say well, does it seem\n7:50\nlike the market's willing to pay $10 a share for a\n7:53\ncompany like this?\n7:53\nOr give this company a $50 million pre-money valuation?\n7:59\nAnd if so, they'll move forth with the IPO.\n8:02\nAnd, hopefully, the market actually wants to\n8:05\nnot pay $10 per share.\n8:06\nThe market maybe wants to pay $20 a share.\n8:08\nSo all of these guys, let's say they'll pay $10 a share,\n8:12\nso let's say that they sell 10 million shares at $10 a share.\n8:18\nSo the company is able to raise $100 million.\n8:21\n10 times $10, $100 million.\n8:24\nThen they can do big ads and all of that.\n8:27\nAnd what the bank hopes is by selling these shares at $10 a\n8:31\nshare-- so let's say this is days, and this is price.\n8:38\nLet me change colors-- so what the investment bank wants to\n8:42\nhope is that, on day one, you sell it at $10 a share, and\n8:45\nthen the price moves up.\n8:46\nThat the demand was actually to sell it for much more.\n8:48\nAnd there's a bit of a balancing act, because if they\n8:50\nsell for too little, then the company won't get as much\n8:51\nmoney as it deserves.\n8:53\nBut if they sell for too much, then the stock price goes\n8:55\ndown, then you kind of have a stigma\n8:57\nassociated with the IPO.\n8:59\nBut anyway, this begs the question of sure, I understand\n9:02\nwhy the company is selling shares.\n9:04\nIt needs money.\n9:04\nIt needs to operate.\n9:06\nIt needs to build factories or put out\n9:07\nadvertising, and all that.\n9:08\nBut why are people buying shares to begin with?\n9:10\nWhy do people buy shares in the stock market?\n9:13\nAnd frankly, there's two answers.\n9:15\nAnd one is kind of the obvious one, because they think the\n9:17\nshares will go up.\n9:18\nBut to some degree, that's speculation.\n9:21\nIf I'm buying a share at $10, just because I'm hoping that\n9:24\nthere's some other dude out there who, maybe a few weeks\n9:27\nlater, is going to pay $15, I'm just speculating.\n9:30\nI'm just saying oh, IPOs go up so let me buy it.\n9:31\nBut, economically, why was this even worth\n9:36\n$10 to begin with?\n9:38\nHow do we even think about that valuation, at a very even\n9:41\nhigh level, why is this even worth $10 a\n9:43\nshare to begin with?\n9:44\nAnd the idea is that these assets-- assets are nothing\n9:48\nbut claims on future benefits, right?\n9:51\nA house is an asset because you get the future benefit of\n9:55\ngetting to live in it, right?\n9:56\nOr the future benefit of not having to pay rent.\n9:59\nSo, the future benefit of these is, they'll hopefully,\n10:02\nat some point in the future, generate an income stream.\n10:05\nAnd even more, they'll generate cash.\n10:07\nAnd at some point in the future, and a lot of companies\n10:09\ndon't do it right now, they'll actually\n10:11\ndividend out that cash.\n10:12\nSo there's a couple of things that will make this equity\n10:17\nhave kind of an economic-- it'll ground it economically.\n10:20\nAnd it could be these assets starting to pump out cash, and\n10:23\nthen each of the shareholders will get a dividend.\n10:28\nA dividend is just cash that is given to the shareholders.\n10:30\nSo let's say that this is a stock certificate in SOCK.\n10:34\nSo at some point when the assets of this company start\n10:38\ngenerating cash, each of the shareholders might be getting\n10:40\na dividend.\n10:41\nOr maybe a large company, at some future date, says wow,\n10:45\nthis is an awesome technology.\n10:47\nIt'll complement what we already have. And maybe\n10:49\nthey'll buy out the company.\n10:50\nMaybe they'll pay $300 million for this company.\n10:55\nAnd then, essentially, they're paying $300 million-- and\n10:59\nthere's, what, fifteen million shares?\n11:00\nSo they're paying $20 a share.\n11:02\nSo those are the economic kind of grounding points that why\n11:05\nthese shares even have a value.\n11:07\nAnd I'll go into a lot more detail, I'll do a whole\n11:09\nplaylist on how do you even think about whether this is\n11:13\nworth $50 million, or is it worth $5 million, or is it\n11:16\nworth $500 million.\n11:17\nAnd it's kind of an art, more than a science, because you're\n11:21\ngoing to make tons of assumptions in terms of how\n11:23\nfast the company grows, what's the risk free rate of return\n11:27\nthat you could get on other assets?\n11:29\nEssentially, where else you could you put your money?\n11:31\nWhen does the company dividend out its-- there's so many\n11:34\nassumptions, so it's more of an art.\n11:35\nSo it's really kind of you try to get a handle on things.\n11:38\nBut there's no real right answer.\n11:40\nThe real right answer is kind of what someone's willing to\n11:42\npay for it.\n11:43\nBut anyway, I'll see you in the next video.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nYou have reached the first checkpoint\n0:02\nin the 'Journey to cryptography'-series.\n0:04\nAnd now I want to talk about what's next,\n0:07\nbecause I'm working on a new series.\n0:09\nHowever, this one won't end here.\n0:11\nIf anything, we are kind of at the beginning still.\n0:14\nSo I'm going to do 3 different checkpoint videos.\n0:17\nThis one is on 'Advanced Lessons'.\n0:20\nHowever, I also want to eventually talk about Tests and Challenges,\n0:24\nand what we can do with more interactive explorations\n0:27\nand computer science lessons as it applies to cryptography.\n0:31\nBut for now, let's talk about Advanced Lessons.\n0:33\nWhen I say 'Advanced', I don't necessarily mean 'harder lessons',\n0:37\nI mean 'more detailed'.\n0:39\nLet me give you a conceptual idea\n0:41\nfor what I think this series could be and future series.\n0:45\nI like to think of each series as the trunk of a tree,\n0:48\nwhere I took you from prehistoric times\n0:51\nto around the 20th century, which is here,\n0:53\nwith a few different threads.\n0:55\nAnd these ideas kind of branch apart.\n0:59\nOnce you get to the 20th and 21st centuries,\n1:01\nthey start getting highly specific.\n1:04\nAnd way down here on the leaves are current research questions,\n1:09\nwhich over here might be\n1:11\nproblems related to prime number distribution\n1:13\nand over here some very specific work being done\n1:18\non randomized algorithms or hash functions,\n1:21\nand way up here we might have new public key protocols\n1:27\n- because RSA was just the first -\n1:29\nor we also have encryption standards such as DES and AES.\n1:33\nWe would have a whole new branch on quantum cryptography.\n1:37\nSo as you can see, there are so many different things\n1:40\nthat branch out of this series\n1:41\nand I couldn't possibly do justice to them all.\n1:44\nSo I think of this video as living right here.\n1:46\nAt kind of a junction point.\n1:49\nNow I can branch off with help of the community\n1:52\nand possibly other video creators\n1:54\nto fill out this tree gradually over time.\n1:58\nSpecifically with the help of the community.\n2:01\nI am really excited about the Q&A community\n2:04\nand the work being done to improve\n2:06\nhow people can help people on Khan Academy.\n2:09\nSo, for example,\n2:11\nin terms of where one of these branches can go,\n2:15\nI've noticed clusters of questions\n2:17\nkind of leading into a common branch.\n2:20\nFor example, under 'the pseudo-random number generator',\n2:23\nI have two questions here: one by Sonny and one by Drakain.\n2:26\nDrakain's question is:\n2:27\n\"Why has he suggested that time in milliseconds...\n2:31\n...is a suitable random seed?...\n2:33\nThis is a huge no-no in security. ...\n2:35\nThe time it is on your machine...\n2:38\n...is the time it is on my machine,...\n2:40\n...give or take 100 milliseconds...\n2:42\n(which can be brute-force attacked)\"\n2:44\nAnd again, this is a great question too\n2:46\nbecause it speaks to the need that\n2:48\nI didn't present a cryptographically secure pseudo-random generator.\n2:53\nSo the middle square's method is back here\n2:56\nin early 20th century, but up until today,\n2:59\nwe are not using the middle square's method\n3:02\nand that's a whole interesting branch.\n3:05\nIt is these sorts of questions which cluster together\n3:08\nand really drive new content.\n3:12\nI want to show you a really interesting example\n3:14\nof how this has happened already.\n3:16\nThis is a question Samuel asked on the 'One time pad'-video\n3:20\nhe said: \"wouldn't a computer be able to test all the possibilities very fast?\"\n3:24\nand Chuck Patrol basically asked the same question.\n3:28\nI see this happening a lot.\n3:30\nSimilar questions all speak to the need of a new video.\n3:33\nSo I went and created a video on 'perfect secrecy'\n3:37\nwhich really nails down\n3:39\nhow you can't beat randomness in the world of encryption.\n3:43\nOut of this video, Dawn made a really great comment.\n3:48\nWhat they did, was basically summarise my video in two sentences.\n3:52\nSo, this is what I want to try to do more of\n3:55\nin filling out these branches:\n3:56\ntake questions, make new content,\n3:58\nand have this feed-back loop and see what we can do.\n4:03\nNow what I would really love,\n4:05\nis for you to ask questions below this video\n4:08\nwhich arise after watching the entire series.\n4:12\nNot specific details about certain video's,\n4:14\n- those can go with the videos -\n4:16\nbut new questions, which are opening new can of worms.\n4:19\nAnd what I think will be fun to do, is:\n4:22\nYour question will lead to answers,\n4:26\nby both me and the rest of the community,\n4:30\nso we'll have multiple answers.\n4:32\nAnd what I can do is take this body of answers,\n4:35\nand out of this draft up a rough script\n4:40\nfor more advanced videos on specific topics\n4:43\nthat sub-sets of the community care about\n4:47\nSo hopefully, out of the discussion below,\n4:49\nover time we can grow a bunch of new videos!\n4:53\nI want to be clear: this is an ongoing process.\n4:56\nThis will not happen tomorrow or next week.\n4:59\nI hope it can happen months, even years from now.\n5:02\nWe can still be building out new videos after the series\n5:05\nand these videos can be a collaborative effort\n5:08\nbetween myself and the community\n5:10\nand perhaps other video creators down the road.\n5:13\nSo, let me know what you think below,\n5:15\nand let's get started!",

    "question_text": "Are the angles in an equilateral triangle always 60 degrees?",
    "question_type": "MCQ",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWhat we've got over here is a triangle where all three sides\n0:04\nhave the same length, or all three sides\n0:06\nare congruent to each other.\n0:08\nAnd a triangle like this we call equilateral.\n0:11\nThis is an equilateral triangle.\n0:16\nNow what I want to do is prove that if all three sides are\n0:20\nthe same, then we know that all three angles are\n0:25\ngoing to have the same measure.\n0:28\nSo let's think how we can do this.\n0:29\nWell, first of all, we could just\n0:31\nlook at-- we know that AB is equal to AC.\n0:34\nSo let's just pretend that we don't even\n0:36\nknow that this also happens to be equal to BC.\n0:39\nAnd we know for isosceles triangles,\n0:41\nif two legs have the same length,\n0:45\nthen the base angles have the same length.\n0:49\nSo let's write this down.\n0:50\nWe know that angle ABC is going to be congruent to angle ACD.\n0:56\nSo let me write this down.\n0:57\nWe know angle ABC is congruent to angle ACD.\n1:07\nSo maybe this is my statement right over here.\n1:12\nAnd then we have reason.\n1:16\nAnd the reason here, and I'll write it\n1:17\nin just kind of shorthand, is that they're base angles of,\n1:21\nI guess you could say an isosceles.\n1:22\nBecause we know that this side is equal to that side.\n1:24\nAnd obviously, this is an equilateral.\n1:26\nAll of the sides are equal.\n1:27\nBut the fact that these two legs are equal so\n1:29\nthat the base angles are equal.\n1:30\nSo we say two legs equal imply base angles are\n1:39\ngoing to be equal.\n1:40\nAnd that just comes from what we actually did in the last video\n1:43\nwith isosceles triangles.\n1:45\nBut we can also view this triangle the other way.\n1:47\nWe could also say that maybe this angle over here\n1:50\nis the vertex angle, and maybe these two are the base angles.\n1:53\nBecause then you have a situation\n1:55\nwhere this side and this side are congruent to each other.\n1:58\nAnd then that angle and that angle\n2:00\nare going to the base angles.\n2:01\nSo you could say angle CAB is going\n2:07\nto be congruent to angle ABC, really for the same reason.\n2:22\nWe're now looking at different legs here and different base\n2:26\nangles.\n2:26\nThis would now be the base in this example.\n2:29\nYou can imagine turning an isosceles triangle on its side.\n2:32\nBut it's the exact same logic.\n2:34\nSo let's just review what I talked about.\n2:36\nThese two sides are equal, which imply\n2:37\nthese two base angles are equal.\n2:39\nThese two sides being equal implied\n2:41\nthese two base angles are equal.\n2:44\nWell, if ABC is congruent to ACD and is congruent to CAB,\n2:48\nthen all of these angles are congruent to each other.\n2:53\nSo then we get angle ABC is congruent to angle ACB, which\n3:02\nis congruent to angle CAB.\n3:04\nAnd that pretty much gives us all of the angles.\n3:07\nSo if you have an equilateral triangle,\n3:09\nit's actually an equiangular triangle as well.\n3:11\nAll of the angles are going to be the same.\n3:13\nAnd you actually know what that measure is.\n3:15\nIf you have three things that are the same--\n3:16\nso let's call that x, x, x-- and they add up to 180,\n3:20\nyou get x plus x plus x is equal to 180, or 3x is equal to 180.\n3:27\nDivide both sides by 3, you get x is equal to 60 degrees.\n3:32\nSo in an equilateral triangle, not only\n3:34\nare they all the same angles, but they're all\n3:37\nequal to exactly-- they're all 60 degree angles.\n3:44\nNow let's think about it the other way around.\n3:46\nLet's say I have a triangle.\n3:48\nLet's say we've got ourselves a triangle where\n3:50\nall of the angles are the same.\n3:54\nSo let's say that's point X, point Y, and point Z.\n4:00\nAnd we know that all the angles are the same.\n4:02\nSo we know that this angle is congruent to this angle\n4:05\nis congruent to that angle.\n4:07\nSo what we showed in the last video on isosceles triangles\n4:11\nis that if two base angles are the same,\n4:13\nthen the corresponding legs are also going to be the same.\n4:17\nSo we know, for example, that YX is congruent to YZ.\n4:28\nAnd we know that because the base angles are congruent.\n4:39\nNow we also know that YZ-- so I'll rewrite YZ--\n4:46\nis congruent to XZ, by the same argument.\n4:57\nBut here we're dealing with different base angles.\n4:59\nSo now, once again, you can view this\n5:00\nas almost an isosceles triangle turned on its side.\n5:03\nThis is the vertex angle right over here.\n5:05\nThese are the two base angles.\n5:06\nThis would be the base now.\n5:07\nAnd we know that because these two base angles are congruent.\n5:11\nSo by the same logic.\n5:13\nOver in this first case, the base angles\n5:16\nwere this angle and that angle.\n5:17\nIn the second case, the base angles\n5:19\nare that angle and that angle.\n5:21\nAnd actually let me write it down.\n5:23\nThe base angles in this first case--\n5:25\nlet me do that same magenta-- are\n5:27\nangle YXZ is congruent to angle YZX.\n5:41\nThat was in the first case.\n5:42\nThese are the base angles.\n5:43\nSo based on the proof we saw in the last video,\n5:46\nthat implies these sides are congruent.\n5:48\nHere, we have these two base angles.\n5:52\nLet me do that in green.\n5:53\nAngle XYZ is congruent to angle YXZ.\n6:05\nAnd so that implies that these two guys right over here\n6:08\nare congruent.\n6:09\nWell, there we've proved it.\n6:10\nWe've said that this side YX is congruent to YZ.\n6:14\nAnd we've shown that YZ is congruent to XZ.\n6:16\nSo all of the sides are congruent to each other.\n6:18\nSo once again, if you have all the angles equal,\n6:20\nand they're going to have to be 60 degrees,\n6:22\nthen you know that all of the sides\n6:24\nare going to be equal as well.\n6:26\nThey're going to be congruent.",

    "question_text": "When calculating the projection of a vector onto a line, is the line treated as though it passes through the origin no matter where it actually is?",
    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the last video we saw that if we had some line that was\n0:03\ndefined as all of the scalar multiples of sum vector-- I'll\n0:09\njust write it like this.\n0:11\nThe scalar multiples, obviously,\n0:13\nare any real number.\n0:15\nWe defined a transformation, and I didn't speak of it much\n0:18\nin terms of transformations, but it was a transformation.\n0:21\nWe defined a projection onto that line L as a\n0:26\ntransformation.\n0:27\nIn the video, we drew it as transformations within R2, but\n0:30\nit could be, in general, a transformation from Rn to Rn.\n0:36\nWe defined it as, the projection of x onto L was\n0:44\nequal to the dot product of x, with this defining vector.\n0:49\nx dot this defining vector, divided by that defining\n0:53\nvector dotted with itself.\n0:58\nAll of that times the defining vector of the line.\n1:01\nThis was our definition.\n1:03\nA couple of things might have popped out at you right when\n1:05\nwe first saw this.\n1:07\nWhen you dot a vector with itself, what's that equal to?\n1:10\nWe know that if I take some vector, and I dot it with\n1:15\nitself, that is equivalent to the length\n1:19\nof the vector squared.\n1:22\nWe can rewrite this as being equal to x dot v, over the\n1:30\nlength of v squared, all of that times v.\n1:34\nWouldn't it be nice if the length of v was 1.\n1:38\nThe length of v was equal to 1.\n1:43\nIf the length of v was 1, or this is another way of saying\n1:46\nthat, v is a unit vector.\n1:52\nOur formula for our projection would just\n1:55\nsimplify to x dot v.\n1:59\nAll of that times, this will just be some scalar number,\n2:02\nthat times v.\n2:05\nYou say, hey Sal, how do we know if this is a\n2:08\nunit vector or not.\n2:10\nWhat you can realize is that any-- Let me draw it this way.\n2:14\nWhen I drew it in the previous video, I just picked\n2:18\na line, like that.\n2:20\nThe line can be really defined to this vector v in the line.\n2:23\nIt can be any of the vectors that's contained in the line.\n2:26\nThe vector v could be like that.\n2:28\nLet's say someone gives you a vector v that\n2:30\nisn't a unit vector.\n2:31\nLet's say that the length of v is not equal to 1.\n2:36\nHow can you define a line using sum unit vector.\n2:39\nYou can just normalize v.\n2:42\nYou can define sum unit vector right here.\n2:46\nYou could define sum vector right there.\n2:48\nLet's call it u, and I'll say it's a unit vector.\n2:52\nThat is equal to 1 over 1 over the length of v times v.\n2:59\nI showed you this in the unit vector video.\n3:01\nYou can construct a unit vector that goes in the same\n3:03\ndirection as any vector, essentially just by dividing,\n3:07\nor I guess multiplying, that vector\n3:09\ntimes 1 over its length.\n3:11\nIn general, we can always redefine the line.\n3:14\nAll of the possible scalar multiples of v are going to be\n3:17\nthe same thing as all of the scalar multiples of our unit\n3:20\nvector, u, which is just a scalar multiple of v.\n3:24\nWe can redefine our line.\n3:26\nIf we redefine our line, L, as being equal to all the\n3:30\npossible scalar multiples of our unit vector, where the\n3:35\nscalars are any members of the real numbers.\n3:39\nOur projection definition simplifies a good bit.\n3:41\nThe projection of x onto L becomes x dot our unit vector,\n3:51\ntimes the unit vector, times the unit vector itself.\n3:57\nThat case that I did in the previous video, where I had\n4:00\nthose two vectors.\n4:02\nWhere I said the vector v that defined the line, I think it\n4:04\nwas vector 2, 1.\n4:08\nOur vector x was equal to 2, 3.\n4:16\nIf you want to do this definition, we just have to\n4:18\nturn this guy into a unit vector first.\n4:21\nThe way you turn him into a unit vector, you figure out\n4:25\nthe magnitude.\n4:26\nIn this case the magnitude of v is equal to what.\n4:30\n2 squared plus 1 squared is 1.\n4:35\nYou take the square root of that.\n4:37\nLet me just write.\n4:37\nIt's equal to square root of 2 squared plus 1 squared, which\n4:41\nis equal to the square root of 5.\n4:43\nYou can define your u-- your unit vector could just be 1\n4:47\nover this, times that guy.\n4:49\n1 over the square root of 5 times 2, 1.\n4:54\nYou could multiply it out, or not.\n4:55\nYou could just leave it in this form.\n4:57\nYou can always, for any vector v, you can always find a unit\n5:00\nvector that goes in the same direction, assuming that we're\n5:03\ndealing with non-zero vectors.\n5:05\nYou can always reduce anything like this, to some other\n5:10\ndefinition, like this.\n5:11\nWhere this is a unit vector version of\n5:13\nyour vector v up there.\n5:16\nI just said that, look, this is a\n5:17\ntransformation from Rn to Rn.\n5:19\nThe one thing that we're not sure of, is this a linear\n5:23\ntransformation.\n5:24\nWe can always write it like this.\n5:26\nLet's see if this is always going to be a linear\n5:28\ntransformation.\n5:30\nThere's two conditions for it to be a linear transformation.\n5:41\nLet's see what happens if I take the projection onto L of\n5:47\ntwo vectors.\n5:48\nLet's say the vector a plus the vector v.\n5:52\nIf I take the sum of their vectors.\n5:53\nIf this is a linear transformation, this should be\n5:55\nequivalent to taking each of their projections\n5:58\nindividually, and then summing.\n5:59\nLet's see if this is the case.\n6:01\nThis is equal to, by our definition, we'll use the unit\n6:03\nvector version, because it's simpler.\n6:06\nThis is equal to a plus b, that's our x, dot u.\n6:14\nAnd then, all of that times our unit vector.\n6:18\nWe know that the dot product has a distributive property,\n6:20\nso that this is equal to a dot u plus b dot u.\n6:29\nThese are unit vectors.\n6:31\nAll of that times the vector u.\n6:33\nThese are just scalar numbers.\n6:34\nSo scalar multiplication has distributive properties.\n6:37\nThis is equal to a dot u, times our vector u.\n6:44\nRemember, this is just going to be some scalar.\n6:46\nPlus b dot u times our unit vector u.\n6:52\nWhat is this equal to.\n6:54\nThis right here is equal to the projection of a.\n6:58\nThis is equal to the projection of a onto L, by\n7:02\ndefinition, right here.\n7:03\nBy this definition.\n7:04\nIf we assume that we're dealing with the unit vector\n7:07\ndefinition for the line.\n7:09\nThis is equal to, this whole thing right here, is equal to\n7:13\nplus the projection onto L of the vector b.\n7:18\nWe see our first condition for this being a linear\n7:23\ntransformation holds.\n7:25\nA projection of the sum of the vectors is equal to the sum of\n7:28\nthe projections of the vectors.\n7:30\nOur second condition is that the projection of a scalar\n7:33\nmultiple should be equal to a scalar multiple of the\n7:35\nprojection.\n7:36\nLet me write that down.\n7:39\nWhat is the projection onto L of some scalar multiple of\n7:44\nsome vector a.\n7:46\nThat is equal to ca dot our unit vector u\n7:53\ntimes unit vector u.\n7:57\nThis one is a little bit more straightforward.\n7:58\nThis is the scalar multiple.\n8:01\nWe see it in our dot product properties, this is equal to c\n8:04\ntimes a dot u, times the vector u.\n8:09\nThis is just equal to c times, this right here, is a\n8:12\nprojection of a onto L.\n8:18\nWe met both of our conditions for linear transformations.\n8:21\nWe know that our projection onto a line L in Rn is a\n8:26\nlinear transformation.\n8:27\nThat tells us that we can represent it as a matrix\n8:30\ntransformation.\n8:35\nWe know that projection of x onto L, we already know this\n8:41\ndefinition, it can be rewritten.\n8:42\nIt doesn't hurt to rewrite it.\n8:43\nAs x dot some unit vector that defines our line.\n8:48\nLet me draw it with a little hat to show that\n8:50\nit is a unit vector.\n8:51\nTimes the unit vector itself, so that we\n8:53\nactually get a vector.\n8:56\nHow can I write this as some matrix product.\n8:59\nSome matrix vector product.\n9:01\nI want to write it as a product of some\n9:02\nmatrix times x.\n9:09\nTo simplify things, since we're actually dealing with a\n9:11\nmatrix, let's limit ourselves to the case of R2.\n9:15\nI'm assuming that my projection onto L is going to\n9:19\nbe a mapping from R2 to R2.\n9:22\nYou could do what I'm doing here with\n9:23\nan arbitrary dimension.\n9:25\nIf we're doing it in R2, then our matrix A, right there, is\n9:29\ngoing to be a 2 by 2 matrix.\n9:33\nWe've seen in multiple videos that to figure out the matrix\n9:36\nA, we just take the identity matrix that has the standard\n9:41\nbasis vectors as columns.\n9:43\n0, 1.\n9:44\nOr 1, 0, and then 0, 1.\n9:46\nAnd we apply the transformation to each of\n9:48\nthese columns.\n9:50\nWe could say that A is going to be equal to-- its first\n9:54\ncolumn is going to be equal to the projection onto L of this\n9:58\nthing right here.\n10:00\nWe'll do it in this orange color, right here.\n10:03\nWhat is that going to be.\n10:05\nThat is going to be this dot u.\n10:08\nLet me write my u.\n10:09\nMy unit vector, let's just assume that u can be rewritten\n10:12\nas my unit vector is equal to sum u1 and u2.\n10:17\nJust like that.\n10:20\nI need to take this dot my unit vector, let\n10:23\nme write this down.\n10:24\nLet me write this on the side.\n10:25\nThe first thing I want to do is figure out what the\n10:27\nprojection-- the projection onto L, let me\n10:32\nwrite it this way.\n10:35\nWe know the projection is just equal to this dot this times\n10:38\nthat vector.\n10:39\nLet me write that.\n10:41\nThe vector 1, 0 dot the unit vector u,\n10:46\nwhich is just u1, u2.\n10:48\nWe're going to have that times my unit vector.\n10:53\nI'll write it like this.\n10:54\nTimes the vector u1, u2.\n10:58\nThis is going to be my first column in my\n11:00\ntransformation matrix.\n11:02\nMy second column is going to be the same thing, but I'm not\n11:06\nready to take the projection of this guy.\n11:07\nThe definition of our projection is you dot this guy\n11:10\nwith our unit vector.\n11:13\nSo we dot it.\n11:14\nWe're taking the dot product of 0, 1.\n11:19\n0, 1 dot my unit vector dot u1, u2.\n11:26\nI'm going to multiply that times my unit\n11:28\nvector, times u1, u2.\n11:31\nThis seems very complicated, but it should simplify when we\n11:34\nactually try to work out our transformation matrix.\n11:36\nLet's do it.\n11:38\nWhen I dot these two guys, what do I get.\n11:40\nLet me write it here.\n11:42\nMy matrix A will become 1 times u1, plus 0 times u2.\n11:50\nThat's just u1.\n11:52\nThis whole thing just simplifies to u1, when I take\n11:55\nthe dot product of these two things.\n11:57\nTimes u1, u2.\n12:01\nThat's going to be my first column.\n12:03\nMy second column, if I dot these two guys, I get 0 times\n12:06\nu1 plus 1 times u2.\n12:08\nSo I'm going to get u2 times my unit vector, u1, u2.\n12:16\nIf I multiply that out, this will be equal to what.\n12:18\nI can just write them as columns. u1\n12:20\ntimes u1 is u1 squared.\n12:24\nu1 times u2 is u1, u2.\n12:29\nu2 times u1 is u2 times u1.\n12:34\nThen, u2 times u2 is u2 squared.\n12:38\nYou give me any unit vector and I will give you the\n12:43\ntransformation that gives you any projection of some other\n12:45\nvector onto the line defined by that.\n12:48\nThat was a very long way of saying that.\n12:50\nLet's go back to what I did before.\n12:54\nLet's say we want to find any projection onto the line, onto\n12:58\nthe vector, I'll draw it here.\n13:00\nWe'll do the same example that we did in the last video.\n13:03\nIf I have some vector v that looks like that.\n13:07\nWe said the vector v was equal to the vector 2, 1.\n13:13\nThat was my vector v.\n13:14\nHow can we find sum transformation for the\n13:16\nprojection onto the line defined by v?\n13:19\nOnto this line right here.\n13:21\nThe line defined by v.\n13:24\nWhat we can first do is convert v into a unit vector.\n13:29\nWe can convert v into a unit vector that\n13:32\ngoes in the same direction.\n13:34\nSome unit vector u.\n13:36\nWe did that already up here.\n13:38\nWhere we essentially just divided [? bv ?]\n13:40\nby it's length.\n13:42\nLet's take v and divide by it's length.\n13:44\nThe unit vector is this, 1 over the square root of 5\n13:46\ntimes our vector v.\n13:50\nIt was 1 over the square root of 5 times our\n13:55\nvector v, right there.\n13:56\nYou start with a unit vector there.\n13:59\nYou just create this matrix, and then we will have our\n14:02\ntransformation matrix.\n14:04\nIf this is our u, what will our matrix be equal to.\n14:07\nThis is u.\n14:09\nThen our matrix would be equal to u1 squared.\n14:14\nWhat is u1 squared.\n14:15\nLet me rewrite our u a little bit, not at angles.\n14:20\nOur vector u, our unit vector that defines this line, is\n14:24\nequal to the vector 2 over the square root of 5 and 1 over\n14:29\nthe square root of 5.\n14:29\nI just multiplied out this scalar.\n14:32\nIf we want to construct this matrix, we get A is equal to\n14:37\nu1 squared.\n14:38\nWhat is this squared?\n14:39\nIt becomes 2 squared 4 over the square root of 5 squared,\n14:43\nwhich is just 5.\n14:44\nEquals 4 over 5.\n14:48\nWhat is u1 times u2?\n14:50\n2 times 1 over square root of 5 times square root of 5.\n14:52\nSo, 2/5.\n14:55\nI just multiplied these two.\n14:56\nWhat is u2 times u1.\n14:58\nSame thing.\n14:59\nOrder doesn't matter when you multiply.\n15:01\nThis will also be 2/5.\n15:03\nWhat is u2 squared.\n15:04\n1 squared over the square root of 5 squared is just 1/5.\n15:11\nNow we can say-- and that's the neat thing about creating\n15:14\nthese matrices, that the projection-- Let's say we have\n15:18\nsome, let's say this is the origin right here, we have\n15:20\nsome other vector x, right here.\n15:22\nWe can now define our transformation.\n15:25\nThe projection onto L where L is equal to any scalar\n15:31\nmultiple of our unit vector u.\n15:34\nIt's right here.\n15:37\nIs a member of the reals.\n15:39\nThat is our line L.\n15:40\nThe projection onto L of any vector x is\n15:43\nequal to this matrix.\n15:45\nIs equal to the matrix 4, 5, 2/5, 2/5, 1/5 times x.\n15:54\nWhich is a pretty neat result, at least for me.\n15:56\nWe once again reduced everything to just a matrix\n15:59\nmultiplication.\n16:00\nYou take this x and you multiply it by this matrix,\n16:03\nyou're going to get its projection onto\n16:05\nthe L, onto the line.\n16:08\nIf you take this vector, let's say a, and you multiply it\n16:13\ntimes this matrix right there, you're going to get its\n16:15\nprojection.\n16:16\nIts projection onto the line.\n16:18\nIf you could take this vector-- No, it should go\n16:21\nthrough the origin.\n16:22\nI want to draw it in standard position.\n16:23\nIf you take this vector, right there, and multiply it times\n16:26\nthis matrix, you're going to get this vector, right here,\n16:30\nthat is contained in the line.\n16:32\nWhen you subtract it from this, it's orthogonal.\n16:34\nWe know the definition.\n16:35\nIt's kind of the shadow of that vector.\n16:37\nAnyway, I think this is pretty neat.",

of x to the third power.\n0:14\nAnd we are interested in figuring out\n0:16\nwhat f prime of x is going to be equal to.\n0:21\nSo we want to figure out f prime of x and as we will see,\n0:25\nthe chain rule is going to be very useful here\n0:28\nand what I'm going to do is\n0:29\nI'm going to first just apply the chain rule\n0:31\nand then maybe dig into it a little bit\n0:32\nto make sure we draw the connection\n0:34\nbetween what we're doing here and then what you might see\n0:36\nin maybe some of your Calculus textbooks\n0:38\nthat explain the chain rule.\n0:39\nSo if we have a function\n0:42\nthat is defined as essentially a composite function,\n0:45\nnotice this expression right here,\n0:47\nwe are taking something to the third power.\n0:50\nIt isn't just an x that we're taking to the third power.\n0:52\nWe are taking a cosine of x to the third power.\n0:55\nSo we're taking a function, you could view it this way,\n0:57\nwe're taking the function cosine of x\n0:59\nand then we're inputting it in to another function\n1:01\nthat takes it to the third power.\n1:04\nSo let me put it this way.\n1:06\nIf you viewed,\n1:07\nif you say, look, we could take an x,\n1:10\nwe put it into one function and that is,\n1:14\nthat first function is cosine of x\n1:17\nso first, we evaluate the cosine\n1:21\nand so that's going to produce cosine of x,\n1:24\ncosine of x,\n1:26\nand then we're going to input it into a function\n1:28\nthat just takes things to the third power.\n1:31\nSo it just takes things to the third power.\n1:34\nAnd so what are you going to end up with?\n1:36\nWell, you're going to end up with,\n1:38\nwhat are you taking to the third power?\n1:39\nYou're taking cosine of x.\n1:41\nCosine of x to the third power.\n1:44\nThis is a composite function.\n1:47\nYou could view this,\n1:50\nyou could view this as the function,\n1:52\nlet's call this blue one, the function v\n1:55\nand let's call this the function u\n1:58\nand so if we're taking x and into u,\n2:01\nthis is u of x\n2:04\nand then if we're taking u of x into the input\n2:07\nor as the input into the function v\n2:09\nthen this output right over here,\n2:11\nthis is going to be v of,\n2:15\nwell, what was inputted?\n2:16\nV of u of x.\n2:18\nV of u of x\n2:21\nor another way of writing it,\n2:23\nI'm going to write it multiple ways.\n2:24\nThat's the same thing as v of cosine of x.\n2:28\nV of cosine of x.\n2:31\nAnd so v, whatever you input into it,\n2:33\nit just takes it to the third power.\n2:35\nIf you were to write v of x,\n2:36\nit would be x to the third power.\n2:38\nSo the chain rule tells us\n2:40\nor the chain rule is what our brain should say.\n2:41\nHey, it becomes applicable\n2:44\nif we're going to take the derivative of a function\n2:46\nthat can be expressed as a composite function like this.\n2:49\nSo just to be clear, we can write f of x.\n2:53\nf of x is equal to v of u of x.\n2:57\nI know I'm essentially saying the same thing\n3:00\nover and over again\n3:01\nbut I'm saying it in slightly different ways\n3:02\nbecause the first time you learn this,\n3:03\nit can be a little bit hard to grok\n3:05\nor really deeply understand\n3:08\nso I'm going to try to write it in different ways.\n3:10\nAnd the chain rule tells us\n3:12\nthat if you have a situation like this\n3:14\nthen the derivative, f prime of x,\n3:17\nand this is something that you will see in your textbooks.\n3:20\nWell, this is going to be\n3:21\nthe derivative of this whole thing\n3:24\nwith respect to u of x\n3:25\nso we could write that as v prime of u of x.\n3:30\nV prime of u of x\n3:33\ntimes the derivative of u with respect to x.\n3:37\nTimes u prime of x.\n3:40\nThis right over here,\n3:41\nthis is one expression of the chain rule\n3:45\nand so how do we evaluate it in this case?\n3:48\nWell, let me color code it in a similar way.\n3:50\nSo the v function,\n3:52\nthis outer thing that just takes things to the third power,\n3:54\nI'll put in blue.\n3:56\nSo f prime of x,\n3:57\nanother way of expressing it\n3:59\nand I'll use it with more of the differential notation,\n4:02\nyou could view this as the derivative of,\n4:06\nwell, I'll write it a couple of different ways.\n4:07\nYou could view it as the derivative of v.\n4:11\nThe derivative of v\n4:16\nwith respect to u.\n4:19\nI want to get the colors right.\n4:20\nThe derivative of v with respect to u,\n4:26\nthat's what this thing is right over here,\n4:28\ntimes the derivative of u\n4:32\nwith respect to x.\n4:35\nSo times the derivative of u with respect to x.\n4:39\nAnd just to be clear,\n4:40\nso you're familiar with the different notations\n4:41\nyou'll see in different textbooks,\n4:43\nthis is this right over here just using different notations\n4:47\nand this is this right over here.\n4:51\nSo let's actually evaluate these things.\n4:53\nYou're probably tired of just talking in the abstract.\n4:56\nSo this is going to be equal to,\n4:59\nthis is going to be equal to\n5:01\nand I'm going to write it out again,\n5:02\nthis is the derivative,\n5:05\ninstead of just writing v and u,\n5:06\nI'm going to write it, let me write this way.\n5:08\nThis is going to be,\n5:10\nI keep wanting, I'm using the wrong colors.\n5:13\nThis is going to be the derivative of,\n5:15\nand I'm going to leave some space,\n5:17\ntimes the derivative of something else\n5:20\nwith respect to something else\n5:22\nso we're going to have to first take the derivative of v.\n5:23\nWell, v is\n5:26\ncosine of x to the third power.\n5:29\nCosine of x.\n5:30\nWe're going to take the derivative of that\n5:31\nwith respect to u which is just cosine of x\n5:35\nand we're going to multiply that\n5:36\ntimes the derivative of u which is cosine of x\n5:40\nwith respect to x.\n5:42\nWith respect to x.\n5:44\nSo this one, we have good,\n5:47\nwe've seen this before.\n5:50\nWe know that the derivative with respect to x\n5:53\nof cosine of x.\n5:56\nCosine.\n5:57\nWe use it in that same color.\n5:59\nThe derivative of cosine of x,\n6:02\nwell, that's equal to negative sine of x.\n6:05\nSo this one right over here, that is negative sine of x.\n6:09\nYou might be more familiar with seeing\n6:11\nthe derivative operated this way\n6:13\nbut in theory, you won't see this as often\n6:15\nbut this helps my brain really grok what we're doing.\n6:17\nWe're taking the derivative of cosine of x\n6:19\nwith respect to x.\n6:20\nWell, that's going to be negative sine of x.\n6:22\nWell, what about taking the derivative\n6:24\nof cosine of x to the third power\n6:26\nwith respect to cosine of x?\n6:29\nWhat is this thing over here mean?\n6:31\nWell, if I were taking the derivative,\n6:34\nif I was taking the derivative of,\n6:37\nlet me write it this way,\n6:38\nif I was taking the derivative of x to the third power,\n6:43\nx to the third power with respect to x,\n6:46\nif it was like that,\n6:48\nwell, this is just going to be\n6:50\nand let me put some brackets here\n6:51\nto make it a little bit clear.\n6:52\nIf I'm taking the derivative of that,\n6:55\nthat is going to be,\n6:57\nthat is going to be,\n6:58\nwe bring the exponent out front.\n6:59\nThat's going to be three,\n7:01\nthree times x.\n7:05\nThree times x to the second power.\n7:08\nThree times x to the second power.\n7:12\nSo the general notion here is\n7:14\nif I'm taking the derivative of something,\n7:17\nwhatever this something happens to be,\n7:19\nlet me do this in a new color.\n7:20\nI'm doing the derivative of orange circle to the third power\n7:24\nwith respect to orange circle.\n7:27\nWell, that's just going to be three times orange\n7:29\nor yellow circle.\n7:31\nLet me make it an actual orange circle.\n7:33\nSo the derivative of orange circle to the third power\n7:36\nwith respect to orange circle,\n7:38\nthat's going to be three times the orange circle squared.\n7:42\nSo if I'm taking the derivative of cosine of x\n7:44\nto the third power with respect to cosine of x,\n7:47\nwell, that's just going to be,\n7:48\nthis is just going to be\n7:51\nthree times cosine of x,\n7:55\ncosine of x to the second power.\n7:59\nTo the second power.\n8:02\nNotice, one way to think about it.\n8:04\nI'm taking the derivative of this outside function\n8:06\nwith respect to the inside.\n8:07\nSo I would do the same thing\n8:09\nas taking the derivative of x to the third power\n8:11\nbut instead of an x, I have a cosine of x\n8:13\nso instead of it being three x squared,\n8:14\nit is three cosine of x squared\n8:18\nand then the chain rule says,\n8:19\nif we want to get finally get\n8:20\nthe derivative with respect to x,\n8:21\nwe then take the derivative of cosine of x\n8:24\nwith respect to x.\n8:25\nI know that's a big mouthful but we are at the homestretch.\n8:29\nWe've now figured out the derivative.\n8:31\nIt's going to be this times this.\n8:34\nSo let's see, that's going to be negative three,\n8:36\nnegative three times sine of x\n8:40\ntimes cosine squared of x\n8:45\nand I know that was kind of a long way of saying it.\n8:47\nI'm trying to explain the chain rule at the same time.\n8:50\nBut once you get the hang of it, you're just going to say,\n8:52\nalright, well, let me take the derivative of the outside\n8:56\nof something to the third power with respect to the inside.\n8:59\nLet me just treat that cosine of x like as if it was an x.\n9:02\nWell, that's going to be,\n9:03\nif I do that, that's going to be three cosine squared of x\n9:06\nso that's that part and that part\n9:08\nand then let me take the derivative of the inside\n9:11\nwith respect to x.\n9:12\nWell, that is negative sine of x.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the last video we hopefully learned the intuition\n0:04\nbehind the ideal gas equation, that pressure times volume is\n0:09\nequal to the number of molecules we have\n0:12\ntimes some constant times the temperature.\n0:17\nAnd that's all nice and it hopefully it makes sense to you\n0:20\nhow all of these fit together.\n0:21\nThat pressure should be inverse to volume\n0:23\nand that's why you're multiplying both sides by each other.\n0:27\nYou could take volume and put it on this side of the equation.\n0:29\nOr that pressure should be proportional\n0:31\nto the number of particles and the temperature.\n0:33\nBut now let's apply it and actually do some problems.\n0:36\nBecause just knowing this isn't good enough.\n0:39\nSo let's say that I have a two liter container,\n0:47\nor let's say a two liter balloon, containing hydrogen gas.\n1:03\nAnd that's hydrogen as a diatomic molecule.\n1:06\nSo each molecule has two hydrogens in it.\n1:08\nAnd let's say I'm measuring it at 30 degrees Celsius.\n1:13\nUse different color. 30 degrees Celsius.\n1:18\nMy brain is really malfunctioning.\n1:20\n30 degrees, not 30 percent, 30 degrees Celsius.\n1:27\nAnd let's say that the pressure on the outside of the balloon,\n1:33\nwe've measuredat two atmospheres.\n1:39\nSo my question to you is\n1:42\nhow many moles of hydrogen do we have? How many moles...\n1:55\nSo let's apply our ideal gas equation.\n1:59\nAnd since we're dealing with liters and atmospheres,\n2:02\nwe have to make sure we use the right proportionality constant.\n2:05\nBut in general, if we keep pressure.\n2:07\nSo our pressure is given in atmospheres.\n2:09\nLet me write down all the units, actually.\n2:11\nSo we have 2 atmospheres times our volume is 2 liters,\n2:24\nis equal to n.\n2:26\nn is the number of particles we care about,\n2:28\nand we care about it in moles,\n2:30\nbut let's just write n there for now.\n2:31\nIs equal to n times R.\n2:37\nI'll do R in a second times.\n2:40\nR times T.\n2:43\nNow you might be atempted to just put 30 degrees in there.\n2:46\nBut in all of these problems--\n2:48\nin fact in general, whenever you're doing\n2:49\nany of these gas problems or thermodynamics problems,\n2:53\nor any time you're doing math with temperature--\n2:56\nyou should always convert into Kelvin.\n2:58\nAnd just as a bit of review as to what Kelvin is,\n3:01\nit's just a different scale.\n3:03\nSo for example, the lowest possible temperature\n3:06\nthat can be achieved in the universe,\n3:09\nwhen you think about it in Celsius,\n3:11\nlet me draw a little temperature scale here.\n3:13\nSo if that's the temperature scale.\n3:16\nI'll draw two, one for Celsius and one for Kelvin.\n3:20\nSo the lowest possible temperature\n3:22\nthat can be achieved in the universe,\n3:25\nand when we say the lowest possible temperature that means that\n3:32\nthe average kinetic energy of the molecules or the atoms are zero.\n3:36\nThey're just not moving.\n3:38\nThey're just stationary.\n3:40\nSo in Celsius, it's minus 273.15 degrees Celsius.\n3:49\nSo zero might be some place over here.\n3:52\nZero, that's where water freezes.\n3:55\nAnd then 100 degrees, that's where water boils.\n3:59\nAnd you can immediately see, the whole Celsius scale\n4:03\nwas made based on the freezing point\n4:05\nand the boiling point of water. Now, Kelvin.\n4:08\nSo look at this and you say, if I have something that's 5 degrees\n4:13\nand I have another thing that's 10 degrees,\n4:15\nwhen you look at the Celsius scale, you're like,\n4:17\noh, maybe the 10 degree thing it has twice\n4:19\nas much energy as the 5 degree thing.\n4:21\nIt has twice the temperature.\n4:22\nBut when you look at it from the absolute distance to zero.\n4:25\nLet me see if I can draw this.\n4:30\nSo the 10 degree is all the way over here\n4:33\nand the 5 degree is almost as far, that far.\n4:36\nSo the 10 degrees Celsius is only a slight increment\n4:39\nover 5 degrees Celsius, if you were to divide the two.\n4:42\nIt's not twice as hot.\n4:43\nAnd that's why they came up with the Kelvin scale.\n4:45\nBecause in the Kelvin scale, absolute zero is defined as 0.\n4:49\nZero Kelvin. So this right here is zero degrees Kelvin.\n4:56\nAnd so zero degrees Kelvin is absolute zero.\n4:58\nSo what is zero degrees Celsius?\n5:00\nAnd the increments are the same.\n5:04\nOne degree change in Celsius\n5:05\nis one degree change in Kelvin.\n5:07\nSo at least they keep it, it's just a shift.\n5:09\nSo this is going to be plus 273 degrees Kelvin.\n5:14\nAnd then 5 degrees would be plus 278\n5:17\n10 degrees would be plus 283 Kelvin.\n5:21\nAnd then you see that 5 and 10 degrees\n5:23\nreally aren't that different from each other.\n5:25\nBut in general, if you want to convert from Celsius to Kelvin\n5:27\nyou just add 273 degrees.\n5:30\nSo 30 degrees Celsius is what?\n5:34\nWell, this 5 and 10 I drew too close to 100.\n5:36\nBut let's say it's sitting here.\n5:37\nIt would be 303 degrees Kelvin.\n5:42\nSo this is equal to 303 degrees Kelvin.\n5:48\nAll right, so now for our temperature,\n5:51\nthat's what we were worried about.\n5:52\nWe wanted to put in the temperature there.\n5:54\nSo now we can put in our 303 degrees Kelvin.\n5:59\nNow we have to figure out what constant to use here.\n6:03\nAnd I've written a couple of down here.\n6:05\nRemember, we're dealing with atmospheres and liters.\n6:08\nSo I wrote down a couple of versions of R right here.\n6:13\nLet's see we're dealing with atmospheres and liters.\n6:16\nAnd in the denominator we're always dealing\n6:17\nwith mole and Kelvin no matter what.\n6:19\nSo those are always going to be there.\n6:20\nSo we should use this proportionality constant.\n6:22\nR is equal to 0.082 liter atmospheres per mole Kelvin.\n6:28\nLet me write that down.\n6:30\nSo let me rewrite our whole equation actually.\n6:34\nSo I have 2 atmospheres times 2 liters is equal to n times,\n6:41\nI have a bad memory, 0.082 liter atmospheres per mole Kelvin,\n6:52\ntimes 303 degrees Kelvin.\n6:56\nSo let's see what we can do.\n6:59\nLet's see if all of the units work out.\n7:01\nSo we can always, when you do dimensional analysis,\n7:04\nyou can treat units like numbers.\n7:06\nSo if you divide both sides of this equation by atmospheres,\n7:09\nthe atmospheres cancel out.\n7:11\nDivide both sides of this equation by liters,\n7:13\nliters cancel out.\n7:15\nYou have a Kelvin in the numerator,\n7:17\nKelvin in the denominator, that cancels out.\n7:19\nAnd so we have 2 times 2 is\n7:24\nequal to n times 0.082 times 303.\n7:34\nAnd then we have just a per mole and a 1 over the mole.\n7:39\nSo to solve for n, or the number of moles, what we do is\n7:43\nwe divide both sides of this equation by all of this stuff.\n7:47\nSo we get 2 times 2 is 4.\n7:53\n4 divided by 0.082 divided by 303.\n8:01\nI'm just taking this and putting it on the left-hand side,\n8:03\ndividing both sides by it.\n8:05\nAnd when you divide by a per mole,\n8:06\nif you put a 1 over a mole here,\n8:08\nthat's the same thing as multiplying by a mole.\n8:13\nSo it's good, the units all worked out.\n8:15\nWe're getting n in terms of moles.\n8:17\nAnd so we just have to get the calculator out\n8:19\nand figure out how many moles we're dealing with.\n8:21\nSo we have 4 divided by 0.082\n8:27\ndivided by 303 is equal to 0.16.\n8:33\nIf we wanted to go more digits, 0.161,\n8:35\nbut we'll just round.\n8:36\nSo this is equal to 0.16 moles of H2.\n8:43\nI am telling you actually here,\n8:46\nthe exact number of hydrogen molecules.\n8:51\nBut if you wanted a number,\n8:54\nyou'd just multiply this times 6.02 times 10 to the 23\n8:58\nand then you would have a number in kind of the traditional sense.\n9:00\nAnd of course, if you wanted to know\n9:02\nwhat is the mass of the hydrogen you have.\n9:05\nYou'd say, OK well one mole of H2 has a mass of what?\n9:12\nThe mass of one hydrogen is one atomic mass unit.\n9:18\nThe mass of two hydrogen when it's in its molecular form,\n9:21\nis two atomic mass units.\n9:23\nSo a mole of it is going to be 2 grams.\n9:26\nSo in this case, we have 0.16 moles.\n9:30\nSo if we wanted to convert that to grams, this in the case\n9:34\nof these hydrogen gas molecules would be 0.32 grams.\n9:41\nAnd I just multiplied it by 2 because each mole is 2 grams.\n9:45\nAnyway, I hope you found that\n9:46\nthere's a bunch more of these problems.\n9:48\nBecause I think the math is pretty straightforward here.\n9:51\nThe thing that always makes it daunting, I think,\n9:54\nis the units and making sure you're using the right units.\n9:56\nWhat is they are using meters cubed instead of liters,\n9:59\nor kilopascals instead of atmospheres.\n10:01\nSo I'll try to do a bunch of examples\n10:02\nwhere we use all the different units\n10:04\nand you're able to pick our constants appropriately.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nFind the volume of a sphere with a diameter of 14 centimeters.\n0:06\nSo if I have a sphere-- so this isn't just a circle,\n0:09\nthis is a sphere.\n0:10\nYou could view it as a globe of some kind.\n0:12\nSo I'm going to shade it a little bit so you\n0:14\ncan tell that it's three-dimensional.\n0:15\nThey're giving us the diameter.\n0:17\nSo if we go from one side of the sphere\n0:19\nstraight through the center of it.\n0:20\nSo we're imagining that we can see through the sphere.\n0:23\nAnd we go straight through the centimeter,\n0:25\nthat distance right over there is 14 centimeters.\n0:28\nNow, to find the volume of a sphere-- and we've proved this,\n0:32\nor you will see a proof for this later when you learn calculus.\n0:36\nBut the formula for the volume of a sphere\n0:38\nis volume is equal to 4/3 pi r cubed,\n0:43\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n0:47\nSo they've given us the diameter.\n0:48\nAnd just like for circles, the radius of the sphere\n0:54\nis half of the diameter.\n0:56\nSo in this example, our radius is going to be 7 centimeters.\n1:00\nAnd in fact, the sphere itself is the set\n1:02\nof all points in three dimensions that is exactly\n1:05\nthe radius away from the center.\n1:07\nBut with that out of the way, let's just\n1:09\napply this radius being 7 centimeters to this formula\n1:12\nright over here.\n1:14\nSo we're going to have a volume is\n1:16\nequal to 4/3 pi times 7 centimeters to the third power.\n1:22\nSo I'll do that in that pink color.\n1:25\nSo times 7 centimeters to the third power.\n1:31\nAnd since it already involves pi,\n1:33\nand you could approximate pi with 3.14.\n1:35\nSome people even approximate it with 22/7.\n1:39\nBut we'll actually just get the calculator out\n1:41\nto get the exact value for this volume.\n1:43\nSo this is going to be-- so my volume is\n1:47\ngoing to be 4 divided by 3.\n1:51\nAnd then I don't want to just put a pi there,\n1:53\nbecause that might interpret it as 4 divided by 3 pi.\n1:56\nSo 4 divided by 3 times pi, times 7 to the third power.\n2:07\nIn order of operations, it'll do the exponent\n2:09\nbefore it does the multiplication,\n2:10\nso this should work out.\n2:12\nAnd the units are going to be in centimeters cubed or cubic\n2:15\ncentimeters.\n2:17\nSo we get 1,436.\n2:19\nThey don't tell us what to round it to.\n2:21\nSo I'll just round it to the nearest 10th-- 1,436.8.\n2:25\nSo this is equal to 1,436.8 centimeters cubed.\n2:32\nAnd we're done.",

So here they\n0:24\ntell us that a line has a slope of negative 5, so m is\n0:28\nequal to negative 5.\n0:30\nAnd it has a y-intercept of 6.\n0:34\nSo b is equal to 6.\n0:36\nSo this is pretty straightforward.\n0:37\nThe equation of this line is y is equal to\n0:41\nnegative 5x plus 6.\n0:47\nThat wasn't too bad.\n0:49\nLet's do this next one over here.\n0:51\nThe line has a slope of negative 1 and contains the\n0:54\npoint 4/5 comma 0.\n0:57\nSo they're telling us the slope, slope of negative 1.\n1:00\nSo we know that m is equal to negative 1, but we're not 100%\n1:05\nsure about where the y-intercept is just yet.\n1:09\nSo we know that this equation is going to be of the form y\n1:12\nis equal to the slope negative 1x plus b, where b is the\n1:19\ny-intercept.\n1:20\nNow, we can use this coordinate information, the\n1:23\nfact that it contains this point, we can use that\n1:25\ninformation to solve for b.\n1:28\nThe fact that the line contains this point means that\n1:31\nthe value x is equal to 4/5, y is equal to 0 must satisfy\n1:37\nthis equation.\n1:38\nSo let's substitute those in. y is equal to 0 when x is\n1:43\nequal to 4/5.\n1:44\nSo 0 is equal to negative 1 times 4/5 plus b.\n1:50\nI'll scroll down a little bit.\n1:52\nSo let's see, we get a 0 is equal to negative 4/5 plus b.\n1:58\nWe can add 4/5 to both sides of this equation.\n2:02\nSo we get add a 4/5 there.\n2:04\nWe could add a 4/5 to that side as well.\n2:07\nThe whole reason I did that is so that cancels out with that.\n2:10\nYou get b is equal to 4/5.\n2:16\nSo we now have the equation of the line.\n2:19\ny is equal to negative 1 times x, which we write as negative\n2:23\nx, plus b, which is 4/5, just like that.\n2:32\nNow we have this one.\n2:34\nThe line contains the point 2 comma 6 and 5 comma 0.\n2:39\nSo they haven't given us the slope or the y-intercept\n2:42\nexplicitly.\n2:43\nBut we could figure out both of them from these\n2:45\ncoordinates.\n2:45\nSo the first thing we can do is figure out the slope.\n2:48\nSo we know that the slope m is equal to change in y over\n2:53\nchange in x, which is equal to-- What is the change in y?\n2:58\nLet's start with this one right here.\n2:59\nSo we do 6 minus 0.\n3:04\nLet me do it this way.\n3:05\nSo that's a 6-- I want to make it color-coded-- minus 0.\n3:10\nSo 6 minus 0, that's our change in y.\n3:14\nOur change in x is 2 minus 2 minus 5.\n3:24\nThe reason why I color-coded it is I wanted to show you\n3:26\nwhen I used this y term first, I used the 6 up here, that I\n3:30\nhave to use this x term first as well.\n3:33\nSo I wanted to show you, this is the coordinate 2 comma 6.\n3:36\nThis is the coordinate 5 comma 0.\n3:38\nI couldn't have swapped the 2 and the 5 then.\n3:41\nThen I would have gotten the negative of the answer.\n3:45\nBut what do we get here?\n3:46\nThis is equal to 6 minus 0 is 6.\n3:51\n2 minus 5 is negative 3.\n3:54\nSo this becomes negative 6 over 3, which is the same\n3:58\nthing as negative 2.\n4:01\nSo that's our slope.\n4:02\nSo, so far we know that the line must be, y is equal to\n4:06\nthe slope-- I'll do that in orange-- negative 2 times x\n4:12\nplus our y-intercept.\n4:15\nNow we can do exactly what we did in the last problem.\n4:17\nWe can use one of these points to solve for b.\n4:20\nWe can use either one.\n4:22\nBoth of these are on the line, so both of these must satisfy\n4:25\nthis equation.\n4:26\nI'll use the 5 comma 0 because it's always nice when\n4:29\nyou have a 0 there.\n4:31\nThe math is a little bit easier.\n4:32\nSo let's put the 5 comma 0 there.\n4:34\nSo y is equal to 0 when x is equal to 5.\n4:38\nSo y is equal to 0 when you have negative 2 times 5, when\n4:43\nx is equal to 5 plus b.\n4:47\nSo you get 0 is equal to -10 plus b.\n4:52\nIf you add 10 to both sides of this equation, let's add 10 to\n4:57\nboth sides, these two cancel out.\n5:00\nYou get b is equal to 10 plus 0 or 10.\n5:03\nSo you get b is equal to 10.\n5:06\nNow we know the equation for the line.\n5:07\nThe equation is y-- let me do it in a new color-- y is equal\n5:14\nto negative 2x plus b plus 10.\n5:22\nWe are done.\n5:23\nLet's do another one of these.\n5:28\nAll right, the line contains the points 3 comma 5 and\n5:31\nnegative 3 comma 0.\n5:32\nJust like the last problem, we start by figuring out the\n5:36\nslope, which we will call m.\n5:40\nIt's the same thing as the rise over the run, which is\n5:44\nthe same thing as the change in y over the change in x.\n5:48\nIf you were doing this for your homework, you wouldn't\n5:50\nhave to write all this.\n5:50\nI just want to make sure that you understand that these are\n5:52\nall the same things.\n5:55\nThen what is our change in y over our change in x?\n5:58\nThis is equal to, let's start with the side first. It's just\n6:02\nto show you I could pick either of these points.\n6:03\nSo let's say it's 0 minus 5 just like that.\n6:14\nSo I'm using this coordinate first. I'm kind of viewing it\n6:17\nas the endpoint.\n6:19\nRemember when I first learned this, I would always be\n6:22\ntempted to do the x in the numerator.\n6:24\nNo, you use the y's in the numerator.\n6:25\nSo that's the second of the coordinates.\n6:28\nThat is going to be over negative 3 minus 3.\n6:41\nThis is the coordinate negative 3, 0.\n6:44\nThis is the coordinate 3, 5.\n6:46\nWe're subtracting that.\n6:47\nSo what are we going to get?\n6:49\nThis is going to be equal to-- I'll do it in a neutral\n6:52\ncolor-- this is going to be equal to the numerator is\n6:56\nnegative 5 over negative 3 minus 3 is negative 6.\n7:02\nSo the negatives cancel out.\n7:03\nYou get 5/6.\n7:05\nSo we know that the equation is going to be of the form y\n7:08\nis equal to 5/6 x plus b.\n7:15\nNow we can substitute one of these coordinates in for b.\n7:18\nSo let's do.\n7:19\nI always like to use the one that has the 0 in it.\n7:21\nSo y is a zero when x is negative 3 plus b.\n7:33\nSo all I did is I substituted negative 3 for x, 0 for y.\n7:37\nI know I can do that because this is on the line.\n7:40\nThis must satisfy the equation of the line.\n7:44\nLet's solve for b.\n7:45\nSo we get zero is equal to, well if we divide negative 3\n7:49\nby 3, that becomes a 1.\n7:51\nIf you divide 6 by 3, that becomes a 2.\n7:54\nSo it becomes negative 5/2 plus b.\n8:02\nWe could add 5/2 to both sides of the equation,\n8:05\nplus 5/2, plus 5/2.\n8:08\nI like to change my notation just so you get\n8:10\nfamiliar with both.\n8:12\nSo the equation becomes 5/2 is equal to-- that's a 0-- is\n8:17\nequal to b.\n8:19\nb is 5/2.\n8:22\nSo the equation of our line is y is equal to 5/6 x plus b,\n8:31\nwhich we just figured out is 5/2, plus 5/2.\n8:37\nWe are done.\n8:38\nLet's do another one.\n8:41\nWe have a graph here.\n8:43\nLet's figure out the equation of this graph.\n8:45\nThis is actually, on some level, a little bit easier.\n8:46\nWhat's the slope?\n8:47\nSlope is change in y over change it x.\n8:52\nSo let's see what happens.\n8:53\nWhen we move in x, when our change in x is 1, so that is\n8:57\nour change in x.\n8:58\nSo change in x is 1.\n9:00\nI'm just deciding to change my x by 1, increment by 1.\n9:04\nWhat is the change in y?\n9:05\nIt looks like y changes exactly by 4.\n9:10\nIt looks like my delta y, my change in y, is equal to 4\n9:14\nwhen my delta x is equal to 1.\n9:20\nSo change in y over change in x, change in y is 4 when\n9:24\nchange in x is 1.\n9:26\nSo the slope is equal to 4.\n9:30\nNow what's its y-intercept?\n9:32\nWell here we can just look at the graph.\n9:33\nIt looks like it intersects y-axis at y is equal to\n9:38\nnegative 6, or at the point 0, negative 6.\n9:41\nSo we know that b is equal to negative 6.\n9:46\nSo we know the equation of the line.\n9:48\nThe equation of the line is y is equal to the slope times x\n9:56\nplus the y-intercept.\n9:59\nI should write that.\n10:01\nSo minus 6, that is plus negative 6 So that is the\n10:07\nequation of our line.\n10:09\nLet's do one more of these.\n10:12\nSo they tell us that f of 1.5 is negative 3, f of\n10:17\nnegative 1 is 2.\n10:18\nWhat is that?\n10:19\nWell, all this is just a fancy way of telling you that the\n10:23\npoint when x is 1.5, when you put 1.5 into the function, the\n10:30\nfunction evaluates as negative 3.\n10:33\nSo this tells us that the coordinate 1.5, negative 3 is\n10:36\non the line.\n10:38\nThen this tells us that the point when x is negative 1, f\n10:41\nof x is equal to 2.\n10:44\nThis is just a fancy way of saying that both of these two\n10:47\npoints are on the line, nothing unusual.\n10:51\nI think the point of this problem is to get you familiar\n10:54\nwith function notation, for you to not get intimidated if\n10:56\nyou see something like this.\n10:57\nIf you evaluate the function at 1.5, you get negative 3.\n11:01\nSo that's the coordinate if you imagine that y is\n11:04\nequal to f of x.\n11:06\nSo this would be the y-coordinate.\n11:06\nIt would be equal to negative 3 when x is 1.5.\n11:09\nAnyway, I've said it multiple times.\n11:10\nLet's figure out the slope of this line.\n11:13\nThe slope which is change in y over change in x is equal to,\n11:20\nlet's start with 2 minus this guy, negative 3-- these are\n11:27\nthe y-values-- over, all of that over, negative\n11:32\n1 minus this guy.\n11:40\nLet me write it this way, negative 1 minus\n11:43\nthat guy, minus 1.5.\n11:48\nI do the colors because I want to show you that the negative\n11:50\n1 and the 2 are both coming from this, that's why I use\n11:54\nboth of them first. If I used these guys first, I would have\n11:57\nto use both the x and the y first. If I use the 2 first, I\n12:00\nhave to use the negative 1 first. That's why I'm\n12:02\ncolor-coding it.\n12:03\nSo this is going to be equal to 2 minus negative 3.\n12:08\nThat's the same thing as 2 plus 3.\n12:10\nSo that is 5.\n12:16\nNegative 1 minus 1.5 is negative 2.5.\n12:23\n5 divided by 2.5 is equal to 2.\n12:27\nSo the slope of this line is negative 2.\n12:30\nActually I'll take a little aside to show you it doesn't\n12:32\nmatter what order I do this in.\n12:34\nIf I use this coordinate first, then I have to use that\n12:36\ncoordinate first. Let's do it the other way.\n12:38\nIf I did it as negative 3 minus 2 over 1.5 minus\n12:54\nnegative 1, this should be minus the 2 over 1.5 minus the\n12:59\nnegative 1.\n13:03\nThis should give me the same answer.\n13:04\nThis is equal to what?\n13:06\nNegative 3 minus 2 is negative 5 over 1.5 minus negative 1.\n13:12\nThat's 1.5 plus 1.\n13:14\nThat's over 2.5.\n13:16\nSo once again, this is equal the negative 2.\n13:18\nSo I just wanted to show you, it doesn't matter which one\n13:20\nyou pick as the starting or the endpoint, as long as\n13:23\nyou're consistent.\n13:23\nIf this is the starting y, this is the starting x.\n13:26\nIf this is the finishing y, this has to be\n13:28\nthe finishing x.\n13:29\nBut anyway, we know that the slope is negative 2.\n13:33\nSo we know the equation is y is equal to negative 2x plus\n13:36\nsome y-intercept.\n13:39\nLet's use one of these coordinates.\n13:40\nI'll use this one since it doesn't have a decimal in it.\n13:43\nSo we know that y is equal to 2.\n13:47\nSo y is equal to 2 when x is equal to negative 1.\n13:55\nOf course you have your plus b.\n13:57\nSo 2 is equal to negative 2 times negative 1 is 2 plus b.\n14:02\nIf you subtract 2 from both sides of this equation, minus\n14:06\n2, minus 2, you're subtracting it from both sides of this\n14:10\nequation, you're going to get 0 on the left-hand side is\n14:12\nequal to b.\n14:14\nSo b is 0.\n14:15\nSo the equation of our line is just y is\n14:18\nequal to negative 2x.\n14:22\nActually if you wanted to write it in function notation,\n14:23\nit would be that f of x is equal to negative 2x.\n14:28\nI kind of just assumed that y is equal to f of x.\n14:30\nBut this is really the equation.\n14:32\nThey never mentioned y's here.\n14:33\nSo you could just write f of x is equal to 2x right here.\n14:37\nEach of these coordinates are the coordinates\n14:40\nof x and f of x.\n14:46\nSo you could even view the definition of slope as change\n14:49\nin f of x over change in x.\n14:53\nThese are all equivalent ways of viewing the same thing.",

I can now afford a better car!\n3:49\nWhy should I you know,\n3:51\nthis is not safe\n3:52\nmaybe or not as safe as the other cars,\n3:53\nand I want to impress my friends\n3:56\nfrom high school and all that,\n3:57\nso something very strange might happen for this car,\n4:00\nthe demand for this car.\n4:02\nIt actually will decrease\n4:04\nso the whole curve could shift to the left.\n4:11\nSo income is a very strange thing for this good\n4:14\nbecause income increasing maybe people say,\n4:16\nhey you know what,\n4:17\nI could trade out of this good\n4:18\nI could get a good that\n4:19\nI'd rather have than just getting more of this thing right over here\n4:23\nDemand went down.\n4:24\nAnd goods like this, we call them inferior goods.\n4:30\nAnd the general way to think about\n4:32\ninferior goods are the goods\n4:33\nthat people will want to not own if they had more money\n4:36\nthey would want to buy, I guess, less inferior goods.\n4:39\nOr another way to think about it is,\n4:41\nif income were to go down,\n4:45\nand more people are budget strapped\n4:46\nand they can't afford\n4:47\nthe Mercedes-Benz or the BMW\n4:49\nor even the mid-sized sedan anymore,\n4:51\nso if income were to go down\n4:52\nand things were getting tighter,\n4:54\nmore people would want this car\n4:56\nmore people would have to trade down to this\n4:57\nbecause they're strapped,\n4:59\nthey're tightening their belts\n5:00\nand so you'll have this strange situation\n5:04\nwhere if income goes down,\n5:06\ndemand would go up for this thing\n5:09\nSo income goes down,\n5:12\ndemand goes up.\n5:13\nRemember, we're talking about demand,\n5:15\nwe're talking about the entire shifting of the curve.\n5:17\nAt any given price point,\n5:18\nthe quantity demanded will go up.\n5:21\nBecause, this is, or we're assuming,\n5:23\nis the cheapest car on the market.\n5:27\nSo, and likewise,\n5:28\nif income were to go down for a normal good,\n5:30\nit'll do what you'll expect,\n5:31\ndemand would go down.\n5:32\nSo this, an inferior good,\n5:33\ndoes the opposite of a normal good\n5:35\nwhen we're talking about the income effect,\n5:40\nthe inferior good will do the opposite of a normal good\n5:44\nand that's because people want to trade out of it\n5:46\nwhen their income goes up\n5:47\nor they don't want to buy it\n5:48\nor they want to buy something nicer.\n5:49\nAnd when their income goes down,\n5:50\nthey'll say\n5:51\nI have to buy this thing,\n5:52\nso you know, let me just do it.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWelcome back.\n0:01\nI now want to play a little bit of devil's\n0:02\nadvocate with myself.\n0:04\nI made this argument where I show that for the exact\n0:06\nidentical house, if these are the numbers -- I mean you'd\n0:08\nhave to work it out based on your market, and what the\n0:10\nnumbers are at the time.\n0:11\nBut if this is the comparable rent for a $1 million house, I\n0:14\nshowed you that for the $1 million house you're burning\n0:17\n$40,000 a year.\n0:19\nThis is not money that is going to build equity.\n0:21\nThis not money that's going to the principal of your house.\n0:23\nThis is money that just going out of your pocket, you'll\n0:25\nnever see again.\n0:26\nIn a way, and actually not in a way, in reality, you can\n0:29\nview this $40,000 as rent on the money that you borrowed.\n0:33\nInterest is nothing but rent.\n0:35\nSo when you have an asset, if the asset is cash, the rent on\n0:39\nit is interest. If the asset is a house, the rent on it is\n0:42\nyour monthly rent payment.\n0:44\nSo when you think of it this way, when people say home\n0:45\nownership, they really aren't homeowners yet.\n0:48\nYou're not a homeowner until you don't have debt.\n0:51\nYou are a money renter.\n0:54\nSo your choice is either to be a money renter here, or to be\n0:57\na house renter here.\n0:59\nAnd I show that you are burning\n1:01\nalmost double the money.\n1:02\nBut then there's the argument of well, there are advantages,\n1:06\nstill, to buying this house.\n1:07\nAnd what are they?\n1:09\nWell one example is, in this situation, if I did get a\n1:12\nfixed-rate mortgage -- and we learned, when you look at all\n1:14\nthose adjustable-rate mortgages, we know that a lot\n1:16\nof people didn't.\n1:17\nBut if I have a fixed-rate mortgage, I know what my\n1:19\npayment is for the foreseeable future, for the next 30 years.\n1:22\nWhile my landlord, in this case, they could\n1:26\nkeep raising my rent.\n1:27\nSo this might look good right now, but what if my landlord\n1:33\nraised the rent to, I don't know, $3,500 a month.\n1:37\nWell then, out of your pocket, 0.5 times 12, you'd be\n1:44\nspending $42,000 a year.\n1:46\nAnd then of course you get the interest from the money that\n1:49\nyou put in the bank.\n1:50\nPlus 10.\n1:52\nOh, minus 10 actually, sorry.\n1:56\nSo in that case, if the rent goes up, then out of your\n1:58\npocket is $32,000 every year.\n2:00\nRight?\n2:00\nOr what if the interest that you get on your cash in the\n2:03\nbank goes down?\n2:03\nThen this $10,000 thousand will become lower.\n2:05\nBut as we can see, the rent would have to go up a lot to\n2:08\nmake up for $41,000, to make this a break-even situation.\n2:12\nLet's figure out how much it would have to go up.\n2:14\nSo in this first scenario, in order for your net outflow to\n2:20\nbe $41,500, assuming you're getting $10,000 from the money\n2:25\nin the bank, your rent would have to be $51,500.\n2:31\nRight?\n2:31\nBecause you're getting $10,000 from the bank.\n2:35\nAnd so divided by 12, your rent would have to be $4,300\n2:45\nin this situation to make this a break-even proposition.\n2:50\nThis is another way to view it.\n2:51\nIf I were to buy the house, and if I were to move, how\n2:53\nmuch would I have to rent this house out for, in order to not\n2:58\nbe losing money every month?\n2:59\nWell I would have to rent it out for $4,300 a month, even\n3:02\nthough maybe the market rents are only at $3,000.\n3:06\nAnd there is another devil's advocate argument.\n3:09\nAnd that's, well, housing -- and this is something that you\n3:12\nheard a lot about three years ago.\n3:14\nAnd a lot of these people aren't talking as much now.\n3:16\nBut they would say, housing has never -- housing has done\n3:19\nnothing but gone up, and I will build equity just from\n3:22\nhousing appreciation.\n3:23\nSo how much does my house have to appreciate every year?\n3:27\nWell, to make up this difference-- $41,500 minus\n3:36\n26-- so to make up that $15,500 difference every year,\n3:45\nthis is $15,500 favorable.\n3:47\nMy house would have to appreciate by a comparable\n3:50\namount, right?\n3:51\nSo how much appreciation is that on my house?\n3:54\nWell that's a $1 million house, right?\n3:56\nSo $15,500 appreciation on a $1 million house.\n4:01\nI'm doing everything in thousands, so 1,000 thousands\n4:03\nis a million.\n4:04\nSo that's only 1.5% appreciation.\n4:07\nSo if my house appreciates by 1.5%, that's it-- 1.5%.\n4:12\nIf my house just appreciates by 1.5%, I'm going to make up\n4:17\nthis $15,500.\n4:18\nAnd so it is worth it for me.\n4:21\nIt is worth it for me to blow this money by having kind of\n4:24\nan increased -- by renting the money for more than I would\n4:27\nhave to pay to rent the house.\n4:29\nAnd that might sound like a very reasonable proposition,\n4:32\nthat the house will appreciate by 1.5%.\n4:34\nFrom 2001 to 2005, 2006, houses were appreciating like\n4:39\n10%, 15% a year.\n4:40\nSo it seemed -- and a real estate agent would often do\n4:44\nthis very math with you, and say, well, you're definitely\n4:46\ngoing to get 1.5%.\n4:47\nIn fact, you're probably going to get 10% appreciation.\n4:49\nAnd you're going to make much more than this.\n4:50\nBut think about, in the presentation of the balance\n4:53\nsheet and leverage, what happens if housing prices go\n4:56\ndown by 1.5%?\n4:58\nWhat happens if it's minus 1.5%?\n5:01\nWell, then you're going to spend this much to rent the\n5:04\nmoney, right?\n5:06\nAnd you're not going to gain this much.\n5:07\nYou're going to lose this much every year.\n5:09\nAnd so the proposition becomes even worse.\n5:12\nSo this is a big deal.\n5:13\nNow that, I think, on a nationwide basis, a lot of the\n5:15\nhousing indices show that housing prices have gone down,\n5:18\nI think by 6%.\n5:19\nThat's what the Case-Shiller index says.\n5:22\n6% is a lot.\n5:23\nEspecially on a $1 million house, that's $60,000 a year\n5:26\nthat's just evaporating.\n5:28\nThat's wealth that someone thought they had, that's just\n5:29\ndisappearing out of their equity.\n5:31\nSo this is rationale of pay more to rent the money for a\n5:36\nhouse than to rent the house is justified if\n5:40\nhousing prices go up.\n5:41\nIt becomes 10 times worse when housing prices are flat.\n5:44\nOr, God forbid, if housing prices actually go down.\n5:47\nAnd now we see that housing prices actually go down.\n5:50\nIn the last couple of years especially, in the areas\n5:52\nwhere, like the Bay Area, or Florida, or California,\n5:55\nespecially Southern California,\n5:56\nwhere this is happening.\n5:57\nAnd back even two or three years ago, when people used to\n6:00\nmake this argument.\n6:02\nPeople used to make the argument, well you know, my\n6:03\nhouse just has to go up 1% or 2% percent, and I'm going to\n6:06\nmake up the difference.\n6:07\nI'd say well, why is your house going to\n6:09\ngo up 1% or 2% percent?\n6:11\nI mean, there has to be some reason why next year someone's\n6:13\nwilling to pay 2% more for that house.\n6:16\nIs it because rents are going up 2% a year, so the income\n6:18\nstream is going to be 2% higher?\n6:20\nAnd actually in the Bay Area, from 2001 to roughly 2003,\n6:25\nrents were going down.\n6:26\nAnd there were actually people moving out.\n6:27\nAll the tech workers were getting laid off.\n6:29\nYou had a lot of programming jobs being outsourced to India\n6:32\nand wherever else.\n6:33\nSo you had this whole situation where the population\n6:35\nwas actually decreasing.\n6:36\nDemand for housing was going down.\n6:39\nBut for some reason housing prices were going up.\n6:42\nSo people said well, they've been going up for the last\n6:44\nfive years, so they'll continue.\n6:45\nAnd they've never gone down, et cetera, et cetera.\n6:46\nBut it didn't make an economic argument.\n6:49\nAnd I'll show in a future video that the only reason why\n6:51\nhousing prices did go up is that it just became easier and\n6:55\neasier and easier to buy a house.\n6:59\nThe standards that banks used for giving out a loan became\n7:02\nlower and lower and lower.\n7:03\nThere are actually examples in Southern California, and in\n7:07\nSan Jose and some of the suburbs, where people who had\n7:10\nincomes of $30,000 or $40,000 a year.\n7:12\nThe bank actually gave them a $1 million loan to buy a $1\n7:16\nmillion house, based on stated income.\n7:18\nThere's things called stated income loans, where you just\n7:20\ntell the bank what you earn.\n7:22\nYou don't have to prove it to them.\n7:24\nAnd so every year that went by, it just became easier and\n7:26\neasier and easier.\n7:27\nMore and more people just thought that housing always\n7:29\nappreciates.\n7:30\nSo that's why they want to pay more and more to essentially\n7:33\nrent the money for a house.\n7:35\nAnd this became a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n7:37\nBut as we see on the way down, it works\n7:39\ncompletely against you.\n7:40\nSo in the situation where we are now, where nationwide\n7:43\nhousing prices are actually declining-- and actually they\n7:46\nwill decline until this rent-versus-buy equation\n7:49\nstarts to make a little bit more sense-- it really hurts\n7:54\nthe home buyer.\n7:55\nAnd what's even worse, and this is kind of adding insult\n7:58\nto injury, is that this guy, if I bought this house, and\n8:03\nall of a sudden I lose my job, and I can't pay the house\n8:06\nback, I might lose my entire $250,000 down payment because\n8:10\nmaybe I can't sell the house, or the house\n8:11\nis selling for less.\n8:13\nOr maybe I want to move, and there's no one out there who\n8:15\ncan buy a house because the banks all of a sudden got\n8:19\nsmart again, and realized that they should become more\n8:20\nserious in terms of who they give money to.\n8:23\nAnd so I'm stuck holding this house, and my flexibility in\n8:26\nterms of where I can move is limited.\n8:27\nActually a friend of mine was telling me that they've\n8:29\nactually done studies.\n8:30\nAnd there's a correlation between\n8:31\nunemployment and home ownership.\n8:33\nBecause when you own a home, you have less flexibility in\n8:36\nlooking for a job.\n8:37\nIf I have a house in San Jose but there's a job in LA, I\n8:40\nmight not be able to take that job because I\n8:42\ncan't sell my house.\n8:42\nOr I might not even want to look for a job in LA.\n8:44\nWhile the renter, of course, my lease ends and I leave.\n8:49\nSo this is just a rough sense of the rent versus buy.\n8:52\nAnd I know I get very impassioned about this.\n8:54\nBut that's just because I explain this a lot.\n8:56\nAnd when I'm at parties and I start talking about the\n8:59\ncalculations, people's eyes glaze over.\n9:01\nBut I made this video now and I'll just tell\n9:04\npeople to watch it.\n9:06\nSee you in the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nI told you in the last video on calendar notation that,\n0:03\nregardless of whether you're using BC, AD or BCE and CE,\n0:08\nthat there is no year 0, that we had 1 BC.\n0:13\nAnd then we had that theoretical birth of Jesus,\n0:16\nand most historians don't think that he\n0:18\nwas born right exactly on January 1, 1 AD.\n0:23\nBut there's no year 0.\n0:24\nRight after that, you go from December 31, 1\n0:28\nBC, to January 1, 1 AD.\n0:31\nThere's no year 0.\n0:33\nAnd despite the fact that I emphasized\n0:35\nthat in the last video, I didn't take that into consideration\n0:39\nwhen I calculated how many years there\n0:41\nwere between Plato's birth and Columbus discovering\n0:46\nthe new world.\n0:47\nAnd the reason why I didn't take that into consideration\n0:50\nis that the year 1492, whether you\n0:52\nwant to call it AD 1492, Anno Domini 1492.\n0:57\nWhether you want to call it that,\n0:58\nor whether you want to call it 1492 in the Common Era.\n1:01\nIt's not 1492 years since the theoretical birth of Jesus,\n1:07\nwhich we know is not the actual birth.\n1:08\nHe was probably born before that.\n1:11\nIt is 1,491 years since the birth of Jesus.\n1:15\nAnd to think about it this way, let's\n1:17\njust assume-- I'll keep emphasizing,\n1:19\nit's a theoretical date that we're talking--\n1:21\nor the theoretical event, this kind of birth of Jesus\n1:24\nthat our calendars revolve around.\n1:27\nIf we talk about January 1, let's think about it this way.\n1:33\nSo January 1, 1 in the Common Era.\n1:42\nHow long is that since the birth of Jesus?\n1:45\nIt's not one year.\n1:46\nYou wouldn't just look at this and say\n1:47\nit's been one year, because this is theoretically\n1:50\nthe day that he was born.\n1:52\nSo this is zero years, or almost zero years\n1:55\nsince that theoretical birth of Jesus.\n1:57\nAnother way to think about it is how long after January 1,\n2:04\nthe year 1 before the Common Era--\n2:09\nand I could've called this AD, and I\n2:11\ncould've called this BC-- what's the time\n2:13\ndifference between these two dates?\n2:15\nSo the way I calculated it before, I said,\n2:17\noh, this is one year after that theoretical birth.\n2:19\nThat's wrong.\n2:20\nThis is during that theoretical birth.\n2:22\nBut if I did it the way I did in the last video,\n2:24\nI would have said, oh, that's one year after,\n2:25\none year before.\n2:26\nYou add them together, and you would get two.\n2:28\nBut that's wrong because there is no year 0.\n2:31\nSo January 1, 1 AD, or 1 in the Common Era is right over here.\n2:37\nAnd then January 1, 1 BCE, is exactly one year before that.\n2:42\nSo there's only one year, one year difference.\n2:45\nAnd the reason why the math is strange\n2:47\nis because there is no year 0.\n2:50\nIf there was a year 0, then my calculation in the last video\n2:53\nwas correct.\n2:54\nSo really, the way that you would calculate\n2:57\nthe time between Plato's birth at 428 BC and Columbus sailing\n3:03\nacross the Atlantic in 1492, you would say, OK.\n3:08\nThis is 428 years before that theoretical birth of Christ.\n3:13\nBut this isn't 1,492 years after that theoretical birth.\n3:18\nThis is 1492 minus 1.\n3:21\nSo what you would do is you would add these two numbers.\n3:23\nThis is 428 before.\n3:25\nThis is 1,492 minus 1 years after.\n3:28\nSo you would add them and then subtract 1.\n3:31\nSo the correct answer-- so this is the correction part--\n3:34\nit isn't 1,920 years between Plato's birth and Columbus.\n3:40\nWe want to subtract 1 from that.\n3:42\nIt is 1,920 minus 1 years.\n3:45\nSo that is 1,919 years.\n3:49\nThe same way that the difference between 1 AD and 1 BCE,\n3:54\nyou could almost view it as positive and negative numbers.\n3:57\nYou say, oh, this is positive 1 minus negative 1.\n3:59\nThat would give me two.\n4:00\nBut there is no 0, so you would need to subtract another 1.\n4:03\nSo this is exactly 1 year difference.\n4:06\nSo just want to clarify that.\n4:07\nThat's what that no year 0 does to us.",

    "source_material": "Translator: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Jessica Ruby\nToday, we're going to look at the world of Rome\nthrough the eyes of a young girl.\nHere she is, drawing a picture of herself\nin the atrium of her father's enormous house.\nHer name is Domitia,\nand she is just 5 years old.\nShe has an older brother who is fourteen,\nLucius Domitius Ahenobarbus,\nnamed after her dad.\nGirls don't get these long names that boys have.\nWhat is worse is that Dad insists\non calling all his daughters Domitia.\n\"Domitia!\"\nHis call to Domitia drawing on the column,\nDomitia III.\nShe has an older sister, Domitia II, who is 7 years old.\nAnd then there's Domitia I, who is ten.\nThere would have been a Domitia IV,\nbut mom died trying to give birth to her three years ago.\nConfused?\nThe Romans were too.\nThey could work out ancestry through the male line\nwith the nice, tripartite names\nsuch as Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus.\nBut they got in a real mess\nover which Domitia was married to whom\nand was either the great aunt\nor the great stepmother and so on to whom\nwhen they came to write it down.\nDomitia III is not just drawing on the pillar,\nshe's also watching the action.\nYou see, it's early,\nin the time of day when all her dad's clients and friends\ncome to see him at home to pay their respects.\nLucius Popidius Secundus, a 17 year old,\nhe wants to marry Domitia II\nwithin the next five to seven years,\nhas come as well.\nHe seems to be wooing not his future wife,\nbut her dad.\nPoor Lucius, he does not know that Domitia's dad\nthinks he and his family are wealthy\nbut still scumbags from the Subura.\nAfterall, it is the part of Rome\nfull of barbers and prostitutes.\nSuddenly, all the men are leaving with Dad.\nIt's the second hour\nand time for him to be in court\nwith a sturdy audience of clients\nto applaud his rhetoric\nand hiss at his opponent.\nThe house is now quieter.\nThe men won't return for seven hours,\nnot until dinner time.\nBut what happens in the house for those seven hours?\nWhat do Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia do all day?\nNot an easy question!\nEverything written down by the Romans\nthat we have today was written by men.\nThis makes constructing the lives of women difficult.\nHowever, we can't have a history of just Roman men,\nso here it goes.\nWe can begin in the atrium.\nThere is a massive loom,\non which Dad's latest wife is working on a new toga.\nDomitia, Domitia, and Domitia are tasked\nwith spinning the wool\nthat will be used to weave this mighty garment,\n30 or more feet long and elliptical in shape.\nRomans loved the idea\nthat their wives work wool.\nWe know that because it's written\non the gravestones of so many Roman women.\nUnlike women in Greece,\nRoman women go out the house\nand move about the city.\nThey go to the baths in the morning to avoid the men\nor to separate baths that are for women only.\nSome do go in for the latest fad of the AD 70s:\nnude bathing with men present.\nWhere they have no place\nis where the men are:\nin the Forum,\nin the Law Court,\nor in the Senate House.\nTheir place in public is in the porticos\nwith gardens,\nwith sculpture,\nand with pathways for walking in.\nWhen Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia want\nto leave the house to go somewhere,\nlike the Portico of Livia,\nthey must get ready.\nDomitia II and Domitia III are ready,\nbut Domitia I, who is betrothed to be married\nin two years to darling Philatus,\nisn't ready.\nShe's not slow, she just has more to do.\nBeing betrothed means she wears the insignia of betrothal:\nengagement rings\nand all the gifts Pilatus has given her -\njewels,\nearrings,\nnecklaces,\nand the pendants.\nShe may even wear her myrtle crown.\nAll this bling shouts,\n\"I'm getting married to that 19 year old\nwho gave me all this stuff I'm wearing!\"\nWhile as they wait, Domitia II and Domitia III play with their dolls\nthat mirror the image of their sister\ndecked out to be married.\nOne day, these dolls will be dedicated\nto the household gods on the day of their wedding.\nOkay, we're ready.\nThe girls step into litters carried by some burly slaves.\nThey also have a chaperone with them\nand will be meeting an aunt at the Porticus of Livia.\nCarried high on the shoulders of these slaves,\nthe girls look out through the curtains\nto see the crowded streets below them.\nThey traverse the city, pass the Coliseum,\nbut then turn off to climb up the hill\nto the Porticus of Livia.\nIt was built by Livia, the wife of the first emperor Augustus,\non the site of the house of Vedius Pollio.\nHe wasn't such a great guy.\nHe once tried to feed a slave\nto the eels in his fish pond\nfor simply dropping a dish.\nLuckily, the emperor was at the dinner\nand tamed his temper.\nThe litters are placed on the ground\nand the girls get out\nand arm in arm, two by two,\nthey ascend the steps\ninto the enclosed garden with many columns.\nDomitia III shot off and is drawing on a column.\nDomitia II joins her\nbut seeks to read the graffiti higher up on the column.\nShe spots a drawing of gladiators\nand tries to imagine seeing them fighting,\nsomething she will never be permitted to do,\nexcept from the very rear of the Coliseum.\nFrom there, she will have a good view\nof the 50,000 spectators\nbut will see little by way of blood and gore.\nIf she really wanted a decent view,\nshe could become a vestal virgin\nand would sit right down the front.\nBut a career tending the sacred flame of Vesta\nis not to everybody's taste.\nDomitia I has met another ten year old\nalso decked out in the insignia of betrothal.\nHome time.\nWhen they get there after the eighth hour,\nsomething is up.\nA smashed dish lies on the floor.\nAll the slaves are being gathered together in the atrium\nand await the arrival of their master.\nDad is going to go mad.\nHe will not hit his children,\nbut like many other Romans,\nhe believes that slaves have to be

actually even really still see.\n0:13\nSAL KHAN: Right.\n0:14\nBecause I have seen this before.\n0:16\nAnd I've even visited it at the Louvre--\n0:19\nI know I'm pronouncing it wrong.\n0:21\nYes, you're right.\n0:23\nThis is probably the most famous painting world.\n0:25\nBETH HARRIS: And I just read that most people spend\n0:28\nabout 15 seconds in the Louvre looking at the painting, which\n0:32\nis a funny statistic.\n0:34\nSAL KHAN: Well, it's stressful, because there's\n0:35\npeople behind you.\n0:36\nAnd on top of that, it's actually surprisingly small\n0:39\nwhen you see it in real life.\n0:40\nI mean, now that I'm able to take my time,\n0:42\nand not worry about the tourists behind me,\n0:44\nand I'm looking at it for real, I'm\n0:46\nalready-- things are jumping out at me that I actually\n0:48\nhad never noticed before.\n0:49\nBETH HARRIS: Like what?\n0:50\nSAL KHAN: Well, it looks like the scenery is\n0:52\nsome kind of like Vulcan territory or something.\n0:54\n[LAUGHING] There's this-- it's like mountainous,\n0:57\nand well, I guess, there's a little bridge in there.\n0:59\nThere's a road.\n1:00\nI guess I never paid much attention to that before.\n1:03\nYeah, actually, I'd never even noticed\n1:04\nthis chair she was on before either.\n1:06\nYou can see hand resting on it.\n1:07\nActually-- and I never noticed that there's\n1:09\na ledge, right behind her, where's there jars.\n1:13\nI could probably keep going.\n1:15\nBETH HARRIS: I like your analogy to Vulcan territory,\n1:17\nas a Star Trek fan myself.\n1:20\nThat landscape is otherworldly and very mysterious.\n1:23\nBut it's Interesting, isn't it, how\n1:25\nthe bottom part of the landscape at her neck and below\n1:28\nlooks like an inhabited landscape with a winding road\n1:31\nand a bridge, but the landscape that's at her neck and head\n1:35\nis more mysterious and looks very much like another planet?\n1:39\nSAL KHAN: That's right.\n1:40\nAnd actually, when you point that out\n1:42\nand how that painting is divided based\n1:44\non where those landscapes and the ledge divide the painting,\n1:47\nI don't have my ruler out, but I would\n1:48\nguess that it's pretty close to the golden mean.\n1:51\nBETH HARRIS: I think you're probably right.\n1:53\nThose things that look like jars are actually\n1:55\nthe bottom of columns cut off on either side of the painting.\n2:00\nSAL KHAN: So Leonardo da Vinci actually painted the columns,\n2:03\nand it was cropped?\n2:04\nBETH HARRIS: That's right.\n2:05\nAnd so the space that she's in would\n2:07\nhave made a lot more sense as a balcony.\n2:09\nSAL KHAN: Well, you know, all of this-- actually,\n2:11\njust take a step back.\n2:12\nI mean, we started with this presumption that\n2:14\nit's-- and it's true-- that it's probably the most famous\n2:17\npainting in the world, but I guess,\n2:19\nI've never quite gotten why.\n2:20\nI mean, is this just a case of marketing?\n2:22\nBETH HARRIS: I think it happened in 1911, when the painting was\n2:26\nstolen from the Louvre and disappeared\n2:28\nfor a couple of years and became notorious.\n2:31\nAt that point in the 19th century,\n2:33\nthe \"Mona Lisa\" was not the most popular painting at the Louvre.\n2:36\nPaintings by other artists, like Titian and Raphael,\n2:39\nwere much more popular and even valued more highly\n2:42\nfor insurance purposes.\n2:45\nSo it really probably is only in the 20th century\n2:47\nthat she became as important as she is now.\n2:50\nSAL KHAN: If you go back 150 years ago,\n2:52\n\"Mona Lisa\" was not something that\n2:54\nwas just ingrained in our culture.\n2:55\nBETH HARRIS: She was important.\n2:57\nPeople were interested in her, and people\n2:58\nwere writing about her and they said some interesting things.\n3:01\nBut she wasn't as famous as she is now.\n3:03\nAnd also, don't forget that the technology to reproduce her\n3:07\nexisted only, really, in the 20th century in terms\n3:09\nof mass color reproductions.\n3:11\nAnd so her currency has certainly increased, I think,\n3:15\nin the last 100 years or so.\n3:16\nSAL KHAN: I see.\n3:17\nIf you go back 150 years, there was probably\n3:19\nno such thing as super famous paintings.\n3:22\nBETH HARRIS: I think that might be true, actually.\n3:24\nThere were paintings that were famous, or important,\n3:27\nbut not celebrities in the way that the \"Mona Lisa\" is.\n3:29\nSAL KHAN: Right.\n3:30\nNot something that every person on the street would recognize.\n3:31\nBETH HARRIS: Yeah.\n3:32\nAnd of course, now I think most people\n3:33\nwould say that what's so interesting about her\n3:35\nis her look and her smile, which have been interpreted\n3:39\nin many different ways.\n3:40\nSAL KHAN: Yeah, I know.\n3:41\nAnd I know that's kind of, I guess,\n3:43\none of the claims to fame of the painting.\n3:45\nAnd you see that.\n3:46\nI mean, people like to look at it-- is she smirking,\n3:49\nis she happy, is she sad.\n3:50\nAll of these things.\n3:51\nIs she looking at you.\n3:52\nAll of these things that people try\n3:53\nto-- but, I guess, trying to look at it without all\n3:57\nof the social programming that I've had around this painting,\n3:59\nit strikes me is an interesting painting.\n4:02\nAnd it seems very technically well done.\n4:04\nAnd there's something very bright,\n4:06\nand just kind of an aura around her face.\n4:09\nI don't know if I wasn't programmed to really know\n4:11\nthis painting and if I were to see this in the museum\n4:13\namongst many, many others, that I would--\n4:15\nit really jump out at me.\n4:16\nBETH HARRIS: Portraits really took off during the Renaissance\n4:19\nbeginning in the 1400s in Italy.\n4:22\nAnd Leonardo painted this in Florence.\n4:24\nAnd that's because of humanism.\n4:26\nOne way that we define humanism is\n4:28\ntaking an interest in human beings,\n4:31\nand the things of this world, and human achievement,\n4:33\nand individuality.\n4:35\nAll of those values becoming more important\n4:38\nin the 15th century.\n4:39\nAnd so we begin to see a lot more portraits.\n4:42\nAlso with the beginnings of a wealthy merchants\n4:45\nclass in Florence in the 15th century,\n4:48\npeople could afford portraits and begin to want them.\n4:51\nAt first, portraits were painted with the figure in profile.\n4:54\nBut later, especially in northern Europe,\n4:57\nartists like Durer or Memling started\n5:00\nto put their figures in believable spaces.\n5:03\nSAL KHAN: Right.\n5:04\nBETH HARRIS: And so, Leonardo's really\n5:05\nthe first artist in Italy to do those things.\n5:08\nTo make an oil painting, which is a relatively new medium\n5:12\nin Italy.\n5:12\nSAL KHAN: What did people use before oil?\n5:13\nBETH HARRIS: They used fresco and tempera painting.\n5:15\nTempera for panel painting.\n5:18\nSo this is oil on wood, whereas before, artists\n5:20\nwould paint tempera on wood.\n5:22\nTempera tends to look more flat than oil paint, where\n5:26\nyou can really get a sense of modeling and light and dark.\n5:29\nSo Leonardo's making this three-dimensional figure,\n5:32\nand he's using another technique called sfumato,\n5:35\nwhich means a kind of smokey haziness.\n5:38\nSo he obscures the hard outlines around the forms,\n5:42\nwhich tend to flatten them.\n5:43\nOne of the things that's fun to talk about with the Mona Lisa,\n5:45\ntoo, is all the things that people\n5:47\nhave said about her over the years.\n5:48\nYou might not be aware of the fact\n5:50\nthat Sigmund Freud actually had a particular interpretation\n5:54\nof the Mona Lisa.\n5:55\nSAL KHAN: Yes, I'm sure he did.\n5:56\n[LAUGHTER]\n5:58\nI'm somewhat skeptical of him.\n6:00\nI would like to interpret his interpretations someday.\n6:03\nBut yes.\n6:04\nBETH HARRIS: Freud said that the \"Mona Lisa's\" smile combined\n6:07\nthe two ways that we tend to look at women in our culture.\n6:10\nIn one way, she's very mothering and nurturing.\n6:13\nAnd in the other way, she seems very seductive.\n6:15\nSAL KHAN: I think that says more about Freud\n6:17\nthan about Leonardo.\n6:18\nBETH HARRIS: You could be right.\n6:19\n[LAUGHTER]\n6:20\nAnd later artists, another artist that you already know,\n6:23\nDuchamp--\n6:24\nSAL KHAN: Duchamp, my favorite.\n6:25\nBETH HARRIS: Your favorite.\n6:26\nHe took a reproduction of the \"Mona Lisa\"\n6:29\nand drew a mustache on her.\n6:30\nSAL KHAN: I could imagine him doing that.\n6:32\n[LAUGHTER]\n6:33\nBETH HARRIS: I think the moustache is interesting,\n6:35\nbecause there is something not entirely feminine about her.\n6:37\nSomething a little bit masculine.\n6:39\nSAL KHAN: Do you think it's that?\n6:40\nOr I mean, I guess there is a certain-- I mean,\n6:42\nit's kind of old now, especially because Duchamp did it,\n6:44\nI'm guessing, 80, 90 years ago.\n6:47\nBut there is something hilarious about drawing\n6:49\na mustache on a feminine form.\n6:51\nWe all remember doing it as school kids-- just\n6:53\ngetting a kick out of it.\n6:54\nAnd I could see it's especially funny for this painting.\n6:57\nBETH HARRIS: Taking something that's so high art\n6:59\nand making it silly, you know?\n7:01\nSAL KHAN: Exactly.\n7:02\nBETH HARRIS: Recently, the Prado in Madrid,\n7:05\nfound what turns out to be, after some scientific testing,\n7:09\na copy of the \"Mona Lisa,\" which in and of itself\n7:12\nis not that unusual, but it turns out\n7:14\nthat their copy was made by another artist sitting\n7:19\nright next to Leonardo copying what he did stroke for stroke.\n7:24\nAnd they can tell this by analyzing the under drawing.\n7:27\nSAL KHAN: Yeah, she looks much younger.\n7:29\nBETH HARRIS: She has eyebrows.\n7:30\nSAL KHAN: Oh, that's right.\n7:32\nIt makes you appreciate it.\n7:32\nThat's where the creepiness comes from, because the \"Mona\n7:35\nLisa\" we see looks jaundiced-- it's yellow.\n7:37\nAnd so, the painting is a little bit different.\n7:39\nThe face is a little bit different,\n7:41\nbut we can assume that the colors might have not\n7:43\nbeen that different.\n7:44\nBETH HARRIS: Exactly.\n7:45\nAnd it's a really interesting thing to think about.\n7:47\nWhat she would look like if she was cleaned.\n7:49\nAnd if she would still mean what she means to us.\n7:53\nIf she--\n7:53\nSAL KHAN: Oh, I don't think she would,\n7:54\nbecause when I look at this cleaned painting,\n7:56\nit loses a lot of the mystery.\n7:58\nBETH HARRIS: Yeah, I agree.\n8:00\nAnd you can then understand the Louvre's decision\n8:02\nnot to clean her.\n8:03\nSAL KHAN: I mean, the cleaned one, she looks better.\n8:05\nShe looks younger.\n8:07\nShe loses a lot of the motherly aspects\n8:09\nthat Freud seems to want to ascribe to her.\n8:12\nYeah, because the colors are brighter, they're more vibrant,\n8:15\nit's not as muted as the one that we've learned to like.\n8:18\nBETH HARRIS: Yeah.\n8:19\nAlthough, her reputation has grown over the years, who's\n8:22\nto say that we won't care so much about her again.\n8:24\nSAL KHAN: There might be a post-celebrity world\n8:26\nat some point.\n8:27\n[LAUGHTER]\n8:27\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] So Kim, we've been talking\n0:01\nabout the run up to the Civil War.\n0:03\nWe talked about the Compromise of 1850,\n0:05\nwhich angered a lot of anti-slavery\n0:07\nand abolitionist folks in the North.\n0:09\nAs we get to the election of 1860,\n0:13\nyou have Abraham Lincoln\n0:15\ngetting elected.\n0:16\nAnd a lot of folks view that as a bit\n0:18\nof the final catalyst for the Civil War.\n0:21\nWhat's happening?\n0:22\nAnd is that accurate?\n0:23\n- [Voiceover] So, Lincoln is elected\n0:25\nas a Republican Party president.\n0:28\nThis is the first Republican Party president, ever.\n0:31\nAnd the real basis of the Republican Party\n0:35\nis an anti-slavery platform.\n0:37\nThey really don't want slavery\n0:40\nto extend into the Western territories\n0:43\nthat have been acquired through the Mexican War.\n0:46\nSo, they have been making both an economic,\n0:50\nand to some extent, moral argument against slavery.\n0:54\nSo, when Lincoln becomes president,\n0:56\nthe states of the South, particularly the Deep South,\n0:59\nor this Cotton Belt area, whose entire economic system\n1:04\nrelies on slavery, they think that they are under attack.\n1:08\nThat Lincoln is going to be coming for slavery\n1:12\nas soon as he gets a chance, as president.\n1:14\n- [Voiceover] And we're talking about\n1:16\nthese states down here.\n1:17\nThis is Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,\n1:19\nAlabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida.\n1:21\n- [Voiceover] Right; so these are the real\n1:24\ncotton states, where slavery is highly entrenched.\n1:29\nThere, more than 50% of the population\n1:32\nis enslaved working on cotton plantations.\n1:35\nAnd it's making the elite people,\n1:37\nelite whites in the South, very wealthy.\n1:40\nCotton is just the backbone of their economy.\n1:44\n- [Voiceover] So what do they do?\n1:45\nLincoln gets elected.\n1:46\nThis is November of 1860?\n1:48\n- [Voiceover] That's right.\n1:49\n- [Voiceover] So what do they do about it?\n1:51\nThey're afraid.\n1:52\n- [Voiceover] They're afraid that Lincoln\n1:53\nis going to do something about slavery.\n1:56\nSo, over the course of this winter period,\n2:01\nthis is in a period before we moved\n2:05\nthe inauguration up to January,\n2:07\nso it used to be that presidents\n2:09\nwould be elected in November\n2:11\nand not take office until March.\n2:13\n- [Voiceover] Yeah, we have here,\n2:15\nthis Lincoln gets elected in November,\n2:16\nbut then he doesn't get inaugurated\n2:17\nuntil March, over here.\n2:18\n- [Voiceover] So there's this long,\n2:19\nlame duck period where everyone\n2:21\nknows that a new political party\n2:23\nis going to be in power, a new president\n2:25\nis in power, but he's not in office yet.\n2:28\n- [Voiceover] And so you have James Buchanan\n2:30\nsitting around; he's still the president, but.\n2:32\n- [Voiceover] But, yeah, his days are numbered,\n2:36\nand his power is pretty limited.\n2:38\nSo, over the course of what they call this\n2:40\nSecession Winter, the seven states\n2:43\nof the Deep South get together\n2:46\nand they secede from the Union, one after another.\n2:50\nAnd this includes South Carolina,\n2:52\nMississippi, Florida, Alabama,\n2:55\nGeorgia, Louisiana, and Texas.\n2:58\nThey secede from the Union,\n2:59\nand they form what they call\n3:00\nThe Confederate States of America,\n3:02\nwhich is, basically, almost exactly\n3:05\nthe same as The United States of America.\n3:07\nTheir constitution is based very\n3:10\nclosely on the US Constitution.\n3:12\nBut it guarantees the existence of slavery.\n3:16\nIt explicitly says that slavery\n3:17\nis allowed and protected forever.\n3:20\nAnd they elect Jefferson Davis as their president.\n3:24\n- [Voiceover] So when they seceded,\n3:26\nfor them it was clearly about slavery.\n3:28\n- [Voiceover] Right; everything is about slavery.\n3:30\nThey are concerned that Lincoln\n3:33\nis going to interfere with slavery.\n3:35\nThey are afraid that because slavery\n3:37\nis being outlawed many other places\n3:39\nin the world, particularly in the Western Hemisphere,\n3:43\nthat, one way or another, slavery's days are numbered.\n3:46\nAnd if they're going to protect their livelihood\n3:49\nas slave owners and as cotton planters,\n3:52\nthey're going to have to form their own nation\n3:54\nto make sure that it's protected.\n3:56\n- [Voiceover] And James Buchanan\n3:57\nis officially president when all of this has happened.\n4:00\nYou have seven states of the United States,\n4:02\nI guess they're not so united anymore, leaving.\n4:05\nIs he just powerless to do anything?\n4:07\n- [Voiceover] Well, he tries a few things.\n4:10\nHe was a very ineffective president to begin with.\n4:14\nIt's hard to be an effective president\n4:16\nwhen Congress is so divided over issues.\n4:19\nOne thing that Congress actually does\n4:21\nbefore Lincoln is in office, and before\n4:24\nthese states officially secede,\n4:26\nis they try what's called the Crittenden Plan,\n4:29\nproposed by John Crittenden of Kentucky,\n4:32\nsaying we will officially protect\n4:35\nslavery in the Constitution.\n4:37\nWe will say that you can't outlaw\n4:39\nslavery in the South, and we'll even\n4:42\nextend this Missouri Compromise\n4:44\nline, which was sort of the official line\n4:46\nbetween North and South,\n4:47\nbetween free states and slave states,\n4:50\nall the way to the Pacific.\n4:51\nSo, just so you know, Southern states,\n4:53\nwe'll make sure that we won't get rid of slavery.\n4:55\n- [Voiceover] So this Crittenden Compromise,\n4:57\nthis was kind of a last ditch effort.\n4:58\nEveryone's started to see the writing on the wall.\n5:00\nThese seven states, especially,\n5:01\nwere very loose-in-the-socket.\n5:04\n- [Voiceover] And this was a last ditch\n5:05\neffort to keep them in the Union, perhaps.\n5:09\n- [Voiceover] Yeah, and I don't want to say\n5:10\nit's too little too late, but for the South,\n5:13\nthey have seen the writing on the wall.\n5:16\nThey have seen that this is going\n5:18\nto be their only opportunity to secede.\n5:21\n- [Voiceover] Lincoln got elected, and his\n5:22\nwhole party is based on being anti-slavery.\n5:24\n- [Voiceover] Right.\n5:25\nSo, they want to get out while the getting is good.\n5:28\nSo that they can make sure\n5:29\nthat slavery remains in their states.\n5:31\n- [Voiceover] All right, so during this lame duck period,\n5:34\nthe seven states, these Deep South states, they secede.\n5:37\nThen Lincoln gets inaugurated.\n5:39\nHe is now president.\n5:41\nAnd we're not really in the Civil War yet.\n5:43\n- [Voiceover] No, in fact, Lincoln's\n5:45\ninaugural address is very conciliatory.\n5:50\nWe think of Lincoln as being a really great orator.\n5:53\nAnd he certainly was, but his first inaugural address,\n5:57\nif you read it, is very much\n6:00\na plea to the South,\n6:02\nsaying hey, really, I'm not planning\n6:07\non outlawing slavery.\n6:08\nSo, the anti-slavery platform that Lincoln\n6:11\nascribes to is specifically about\n6:14\nnot extending slavery to the West.\n6:16\nSo he's saying I'm not in favor\n6:19\nof getting rid of slavery where it is,\n6:22\nso there's no reason for you all to secede.\n6:25\nCome back, everything will be situation normal.\n6:28\n- [Voiceover] And they don't.\n6:29\n- [Voiceover] No, as I said,\n6:32\nthey've already seen\n6:35\nthat this is their opportunity\n6:37\nto make sure that slavery continues,\n6:40\nby creating their own nation.\n6:43\nSo, in the South, there are\n6:45\na bunch of arsenals\n6:48\nand forts that belong to the United States;\n6:51\nand most of these are taken over by the Confederacy\n6:56\nwhen it becomes its own nation.\n6:58\n- [Voiceover] This is a picture of one right here.\n6:59\nThis is Sumter.\n7:01\n- [Voiceover] Right; so Fort Sumter\n7:03\nis right in Charleston Harbor.\n7:05\nAnd this is a Union fort, or a United States fort,\n7:08\nthat's holding out, basically.\n7:10\nThey're running out of supplies,\n7:13\nthey have tried to have supplies brought\n7:15\nin to them before, which have been repelled.\n7:20\n- [Voiceover] They're holding out.\n7:21\nThey're well in Confederate territory,\n7:23\nbut they're still controlled by United States soldiers.\n7:28\n- [Voiceover] Right; so, they do not\n7:31\nwant to surrender this fort.\n7:32\nLincoln lets the Confederates, the Rebels,\n7:37\nknow that he wants to resupply this fort.\n7:43\nThe Confederates instead fire on Fort Sumter.\n7:47\nThey start lobbing artillery at it.\n7:50\nOver the course of a day, they force\n7:55\nthe Union forces in Fort Sumter to surrender.\n7:59\n- [Voiceover] I guess this was the real\n8:02\nmatchstick for the war.\n8:04\nBut this wasn't the first tension.\n8:05\n- [Voiceover] No; obviously this had been\n8:07\ngoing on for some time.\n8:09\n- [Voiceover] Even in Buchanan's\n8:11\nlame duck period, there's probably a little bit of tension.\n8:13\n- [Voiceover] Yeah, if you want to be expansive,\n8:17\nyou could say that this tension is almost built into\n8:20\nthe Constitution when they don't--\n8:22\n- [Voiceover] (laughs) - [Voiceover] (laughs)\n8:23\nsecede.\n8:24\n- [Voiceover] You got that right.\n8:25\nBut especially, even post-secession\n8:26\nof these first seven states,\n8:28\nthere are already some tensions,\n8:30\nespecially if they're taking over these forts.\n8:32\nFormer United States soldiers are now\n8:34\nthinking about cutting off supplies\n8:35\nto current United States soldiers.\n8:39\nAnd then Fort Sumter, it sounds\n8:40\nlike this was definitely the straw\n8:42\nthat breaks the camel's back, so to speak.\n8:44\n- [Voiceover] Yeah, this is the tinder box.\n8:45\nAnd I think it's maybe intended\n8:47\nto be a tinder box on both sides.\n8:49\nBecause Lincoln wants to be sure\n8:51\nthat if there's going to be a war,\n8:53\nthe North isn't going to fire the first shot.\n8:55\nThey want to make sure\n8:56\nthat this is the South's decision.\n8:58\nIt can be blamed on them if it needs to be.\n9:00\n- [Voiceover] This is a pattern you see\n9:02\nthroughout history, is that no one at least\n9:04\nwants to, officially, be the person to fire the first shot.\n9:07\nThey often look for a good reason\n9:09\nto fire the first shot because\n9:10\nthey want to get into war,\n9:11\nbut everyone wants\n9:13\nto have the moral high ground.\n9:14\n- [Voiceover] Right; and in the South,\n9:17\nthey are looking to make sure\n9:20\nthat this is kind of a morale building moment.\n9:23\nWhen they fire on Fort Sumter,\n9:25\nthey're firing on a federal fort, right?\n9:28\n- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm.\n9:30\n- [Voiceover] In any circumstances,\n9:31\nthat's going to bring on war.\n9:32\nAnd they're hoping that if they can\n9:34\nkind of get this fire started,\n9:37\nthen these four other slaveholding\n9:39\nstates, or actually eight other\n9:41\nslaveholding states, in the South\n9:43\nare going to join the effort.\n9:46\nAnd that's pretty much exactly what happens.\n9:48\nSo, after they fire on Fort Sumter,\n9:50\nthe fort is surrendered to the Confederacy.\n9:54\nLincoln says, okay, you want to start a war, we got a war.\n9:57\nHe calls for 75,000 troops,\n10:02\nvolunteers to put down the insurrection.\n10:05\nHe calls them for a 90-day service period,\n10:08\nwhich tells you how long\n10:10\nthey thought this was gonna last.\n10:11\nAfter Lincoln has asked for this army,\n10:15\nfour more slaveholding states in the South secede.\n10:19\nAnd that's Virginia, the most important of these,\n10:22\nit's gonna be the real battleground of the Civil War.\n10:25\n- [Voiceover] Today, we'd consider that West Virginia\n10:28\nand Virginia, but that was Virginia back then.\n10:30\n- [Voiceover] Right; Virginia, Arkansas,\n10:33\nTennessee, and North Carolina\n10:35\nalso join the Confederate States of America.\n10:37\nAnd the war is on.\n10:40\n- [Voiceover] Fascinating.",

    "source_material": "Hey it's me Destin.\nWelcome back to Smarter Every Day.\nYou've heard people say,\n\"It's just like riding a bike\"\nmeaning it's really easy and you can't forget how to do it, right?\nBut I did something.\nI did something that damaged my mind.\nIt happened on the streets of Amsterdam\nand I got really scared honestly.\nI can't ride a bike like you can anymore.\nBefore I show you the video of what happened\nI need to tell you the back story.\nLike many six year olds with a MacGyver mullet\nI learned how to ride a bike when I was really young.\nI had learned a life skill and I was really proud of it.\nEverything changed though when my friend Barney called me 25 years later.\nWhere I work, the welders are geniuses, and they like to play jokes on the engineers.\nHe had a challenge for me.\nHe had built a special bicycle and he wanted me to try to ride it.\nHe had only changed one thing.\nWhen you turn the handlebar to the left, the wheel goes to the right.\nWhen you turn it to the right, the wheel goes to the left.\nI thought this would be easy so I hopped on the bike\nready to demonstrate how quickly I could conquer this.\n- And here he is ladies and gentlemen,\nMr Destin Sandlin.\nFirst attempt riding the bicycle.\n- Yeah, yeah.\nI couldn't do it.\nYou can see that I'm laughing but I'm actually really frustrated.\nIn this moment I had a really deep revelation.\nMy thinking was in a rut.\nThis bike revealed a very deep truth to me.\nI had the knowledge of how to operate the bike,\nbut I did not have the understanding.\nTherefore, knowledge is not understanding.\nLook I know what you're probably thinking.\nDestin's probably just an uncoordinated engineer and can't do it.\nBut that's not the case at all.\nThe algorithm that's associated with riding a bike,\nin your brain, is just that complicated.\nThink about it.\nDownwards force on the pedals,\nleaning your whole body,\npulling and pushing the handlebars,\ngyroscopic procession in the wheels,\nevery single force is part of this algorithm.\nAnd if you change any one part it affects the entire control system.\nI do not make definitive statements that often,\nbut I'm telling you right now,\nyou cannot ride this bicycle.\nYou might think you can, but you can't.\nI know this because I'm often asked to speak at universities and conferences\nand I take the bike with me.\nIt's always the same.\nPeople think they're gonna try some trick or they're just gonna power through it.\nIt doesn't work.\nYour brain cannot handle this.\nFor instance, this guy.\nI offered him two hundred dollars just to ride this bike ten feet across the stage.\nEverybody thought he could do it.\n[crowd exclaims] No no no. You didn't understand.\nSo.. this way, not that way. [crowd laughs]\nAlright so, whenever you're ready.\nRemember you have to keep your feet on.. [crowd laughs]\n[laughing crowd]\nYou've gotta start rolling at least. And go.\nKeep your feet on the pedal, go.\n[laughing crowd]\nJust keep your feet on the pedals.\nAlright, one more time.\nOnce you have a rigid way of thinking in your head,\nsometimes you cannot change that, even if you want to.\nSo here's what I did.\nIt was a personal challenge.\nI stayed out here in this driveway\nand I practiced about 5 minutes every day.\nMy neighbors made fun of me.\nI had many wrecks.\nBut after 8 months, this happened.\nOne day I couldn't ride the bike, and the next day I could.\nIt was like I could feel some kind of pathway in my brain that was now unlocked.\nIt was really weird though.\nIt's like there's this trail in my brain,\nbut if I wasn't paying close enough attention to it,\nmy brain would easily lose that neural path and jump back onto the old road it was more familiar with.\nAny small distractions at all, like a cellphone ringing in my pocket,\nwould instantly throw my brain back to the old control algorithm and I would wreck.\nBut at least I could ride it.\nMy son is the closest person to me genetically\nand he's been riding a normal bike for 3 years,\nthat's over half his life.\nI wanted to know how long it would take him to learn how to ride a backwards bike\nso I told him if he learned how to ride a backwards bike\nhe could go with me to Australia and meet a real astronaut.\nAre you gonna give up?\n- No.\n- Go ahead.\nThis is how it starts.\nLook at this.\nThis is such a big deal.\nGet up, you got it.\nDid you see his brain get it?\nSo he, in.. How many weeks we been doing this? Two weeks?\nIn two weeks he did something that took me 8 months to do,\nwhich demonstrates that a child has more neural plasticity,\nam I even saying that right?\nThan an adult.\nIt's clear from this experiment that children have a much more plastic brain than adults.\nThat's why the best time to learn a language is when you're a young child.\nAlright, today's bike log.\nI can ride smooth, I can ride fast.\nI'm thinking the experiment is over.\nOK now I'm in Amsterdam,\na city that has more bicycles than people.\nThe question is, can I ride a normal bike now.\nI mean I have spent all this time unlearning how to ride a bike,\nIf I go back and try to ride a normal one will my brain mess up.\nSo I've tweeted a Smarter Every Day.. meetup, if you will.\nAnd I'm gonna see if somebody brings a bicycle and I'm gonna try to ride a normal bike.\nIt's backwards, it's backwards.\nThis was one of the most frustrating moments of my life.\nI had ridden a normal bike since I was six,\nbut in this moment I couldn't do it any more.\nI had set out to prove that I could free my brain from a cognitive bias,\nbut at this point I'm pretty sure that all I've proved is that I can only re-designate that bias.\nSo what you're not seeing is there's a group of people here,\nlooking at me.\nLooking at the strange American,\nthat can't ride a bike, cause they think I'm dumb.\nBut I'm actually two levels deep into this,\nbecause I've learned and un-learned. Alright.\nAfter 20 minutes of making a fool out of myself,\nsuddenly my brain clicked back into the old algorithm.\nI can't explain it, but it happened in a very specific moment.\n[laughter]\nI've got it, I've got it, I've got it.\nI'm back.\nOh it clicked. It clicked.\nI've got it, I've got it.\nOK there it is.\nThere was the moment.\nOK I can ride a bike.\nI tried to explain this to the people around me,\nand they just didn't get it.\nThey thought I was faking the previous 20 minutes\nand I couldn't get anybody to believe me.\nThat looked like I faked it, didn't it.\nYou think I'm faking. You don't believe me.\n- It looked so weird...\n- You think I'm lying don't you.\nI'm not lying.\nI felt like the only person on the planet who had ever un-learned how to ride a bike,\nand I couldn't articulate it to anyone\nbecause everybody just knew that you can't forget how to ride a bike.\nSo I learned 3 things from this experiment.\nI learned that welders are often smarter than engineers,\nI learned that knowledge does not equal understanding,\nand I learned that truth is truth.\nNo matter what I think about it.\nSo be very careful how you interpret things\nbecause you're looking at the world with a bias\nwhether you think you are or not.\nI'm Destin,\nyou're getting Smarter Every Day,\nhave a good one.\nOK if you wanna support Smarter Every Day\nyou can download a free audio book at audible.com/smarter\nI recommend Commander Hadfield's book\nwhich is An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth.\nI read it, it was awesome.\nIf you think about it, I had to learn how to ride a different kind of bicycle\nand my son did it as well,\nbut Commander Hadfield had to learn how to ride a different space ship.\nNot only that, but a different type of space station.\nHe was on Mir and the International Space Station.\nAnyway, if you're interested in supporting Smarter Every Day,\naudible.com/smarter, An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth.\nI'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.\nHave a good one.\n[crowd cheers]\nEverything is wrong... My instinctive reaction is wrong.\n(Destin) Why don't you ride it? You just build it?\n- I can't ride it, I just build it.\n[laughs]\n",

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nLet's learn a little bit about the law of large numbers, which\n0:08\nis on many levels, one of the most intuitive laws in\n0:11\nmathematics and in probability theory.\n0:14\nBut because it's so applicable to so many things, it's often a\n0:18\nmisused law or sometimes, slightly misunderstood.\n0:22\nSo just to be a little bit formal in our mathematics, let\n0:26\nme just define it for you first and then we'll talk a little\n0:28\nbit about the intuition.\n0:29\nSo let's say I have a random variable, X.\n0:33\nAnd we know its expected value or its population mean.\n0:38\nThe law of large numbers just says that if we take a sample\n0:41\nof n observations of our random variable, and if we were\n0:46\nto average all of those observations-- and let me\n0:49\ndefine another variable.\n0:50\nLet's call that x sub n with a line on top of it.\n0:54\nThis is the mean of n observations of our\n0:56\nrandom variable.\n0:57\nSo it's literally this is my first observation.\n1:00\nSo you can kind of say I run the experiment once and I get\n1:03\nthis observation and I run it again, I get that observation.\n1:07\nAnd I keep running it n times and then I divide by my\n1:11\nnumber of observations.\n1:12\nSo this is my sample mean.\n1:14\nThis is the mean of all the observations I've made.\n1:17\nThe law of large numbers just tells us that my sample mean\n1:23\nwill approach my expected value of the random variable.\n1:27\nOr I could also write it as my sample mean will approach my\n1:32\npopulation mean for n approaching infinity.\n1:39\nAnd I'll be a little informal with what does approach or\n1:43\nwhat does convergence mean?\n1:44\nBut I think you have the general intuitive sense that if\n1:46\nI take a large enough sample here that I'm going to end up\n1:50\ngetting the expected value of the population as a whole.\n1:54\nAnd I think to a lot of us that's kind of intuitive.\n1:56\nThat if I do enough trials that over large samples, the trials\n2:01\nwould kind of give me the numbers that I would expect\n2:04\ngiven the expected value and the probability and all that.\n2:06\nBut I think it's often a little bit misunderstood in terms\n2:09\nof why that happens.\n2:10\nAnd before I go into that let me give you\n2:13\na particular example.\n2:15\nThe law of large numbers will just tell us that-- let's say I\n2:17\nhave a random variable-- X is equal to the number of heads\n2:24\nafter 100 tosses of a fair coin-- tosses or flips\n2:30\nof a fair coin.\n2:36\nFirst of all, we know what the expected value of\n2:37\nthis random variable is.\n2:39\nIt's the number of tosses, the number of trials times\n2:43\nthe probabilities of success of any trial.\n2:46\nSo that's equal to 50.\n2:49\nSo the law of large numbers just says if I were to take a\n2:53\nsample or if I were to average the sample of a bunch of these\n2:57\ntrials, so you know, I get-- my first time I run this trial I\n3:03\nflip 100 coins or have 100 coins in a shoe box and I shake\n3:06\nthe shoe box and I count the number of heads, and I get 55.\n3:10\nSo that Would be X1.\n3:11\nThen I shake the box again and I get 65.\n3:15\nThen I shake the box again and I get 45.\n3:18\nAnd I do this n times and then I divide it by the number\n3:22\nof times I did it.\n3:24\nThe law of large numbers just tells us that this the\n3:27\naverage-- the average of all of my observations, is going\n3:31\nto converge to 50 as n approaches infinity.\n3:38\nOr for n approaching 50.\n3:40\nI'm sorry, n approaching infinity.\n3:42\nAnd I want to talk a little bit about why this happens\n3:45\nor intuitively why this is.\n3:47\nA lot of people kind of feel that oh, this means that if\n3:50\nafter 100 trials that if I'm above the average that somehow\n3:54\nthe laws of probability are going to give me more heads\n3:57\nor fewer heads to kind of make up the difference.\n4:00\nThat's not quite what's going to happen.\n4:01\nThat's often called the gambler's fallacy.\n4:04\nLet me differentiate.\n4:05\nAnd I'll use this example.\n4:06\nSo let's say-- let me make a graph.\n4:08\nAnd I'll switch colors.\n4:23\nThis is n, my x-axis is n.\n4:25\nThis is the number of trials I take.\n4:27\nAnd my y-axis, let me make that the sample mean.\n4:32\nAnd we know what the expected value is, we know the expected\n4:36\nvalue of this random variable is 50.\n4:39\nLet me draw that here.\n4:42\nThis is 50.\n4:47\nSo just going to the example I did.\n4:49\nSo when n is equal to-- let me just [INAUDIBLE]\n4:53\nhere.\n4:54\nSo my first trial I got 55 and so that was my average.\n4:59\nI only had one data point.\n5:00\nThen after two trials, let's see, then I have 65.\n5:04\nAnd so my average is going to be 65 plus 55 divided by 2.\n5:09\nwhich is 60.\n5:10\nSo then my average went up a little bit.\n5:13\nThen I had a 45, which will bring my average\n5:15\ndown a little bit.\n5:16\nI won't plot a 45 here.\n5:18\nNow I have to average all of these out.\n5:19\nWhat's 45 plus 65?\n5:22\nLet me actually just get the number just\n5:23\nso you get the point.\n5:24\nSo it's 55 plus 65.\n5:28\nIt's 120 plus 45 is 165.\n5:32\nDivided by 3.\n5:36\n3 goes into 165 5-- 5 times 3 is 15.\n5:39\nIt's 53.\n5:42\nNo, no, no.\n5:43\n55.\n5:45\nSo the average goes down back down to 55.\n5:46\nAnd we could keep doing these trials.\n5:49\nSo you might say that the law of large numbers tell this,\n5:51\nOK, after we've done 3 trials and our average is there.\n5:56\nSo a lot of people think that somehow the gods of probability\n6:00\nare going to make it more likely that we get fewer\n6:02\nheads in the future.\n6:03\nThat somehow the next couple of trials are going to have to\n6:06\nbe down here in order to bring our average down.\n6:09\nAnd that's not necessarily the case.\n6:10\nGoing forward the probabilities are always the same.\n6:13\nThe probabilities are always 50% that I'm\n6:15\ngoing to get heads.\n6:16\nIt's not like if I had a bunch of heads to start off with or\n6:19\nmore than I would have expected to start off with, that all of\n6:22\na sudden things would be made up and I would get more tails.\n6:25\nThat would the gambler's fallacy.\n6:27\nThat if you have a long streak of heads or you have a\n6:29\ndisproportionate number of heads, that at some point\n6:32\nyou're going to have-- you have a higher likelihood of having a\n6:35\ndisproportionate number of tails.\n6:37\nAnd that's not quite true.\n6:38\nWhat the law of large numbers tells us is that it doesn't\n6:41\ncare-- let's say after some finite number of trials your\n6:45\naverage actually-- it's a low probability of this happening,\n6:48\nbut let's say your average is actually up here.\n6:50\nIs actually at 70.\n6:52\nYou're like, wow, we really diverged a good bit from\n6:56\nthe expected value.\n6:57\nBut what the law of large numbers says, well, I don't\n6:58\ncare how many trials this is.\n7:00\nWe have an infinite number of trials left.\n7:03\nAnd the expected value for that infinite number of trials,\n7:06\nespecially in this type of situation is going to be this.\n7:11\nSo when you average a finite number that averages out to\n7:15\nsome high number, and then an infinite number that's going to\n7:18\nconverge to this, you're going to over time, converge back\n7:22\nto the expected value.\n7:24\nAnd that was a very informal way of describing it, but\n7:27\nthat's what the law or large numbers tells you.\n7:29\nAnd it's an important thing.\n7:30\nIt's not telling you that if you get a bunch of heads that\n7:33\nsomehow the probability of getting tails is going\n7:36\nto increase to kind of make up for the heads.\n7:38\nWhat it's telling you is, is that no matter what happened\n7:41\nover a finite number of trials, no matter what the average is\n7:44\nover a finite number of trials, you have an infinite\n7:46\nnumber of trials left.\n7:47\nAnd if you do enough of them it's going to converge back\n7:51\nto your expected value.\n7:52\nAnd this is an important thing to think about.\n7:54\nBut this isn't used in practice every day with the lottery and\n7:57\nwith casinos because they know that if you do large enough\n8:02\nsamples-- and we could even calculate-- if you do large\n8:04\nenough samples, what's the probability that things\n8:07\ndeviate significantly?\n8:09\nBut casinos and the lottery every day operate on this\n8:12\nprinciple that if you take enough people-- sure, in the\n8:15\nshort-term or with a few samples, a couple people\n8:18\nmight beat the house.\n8:19\nBut over the long-term the house is always going to win\n8:22\nbecause of the parameters of the games that they're\n8:24\nmaking you play.\n8:25\nAnyway, this is an important thing in probability and I\n8:28\nthink it's fairly intuitive.\n8:29\nAlthough, sometimes when you see it formally explained like\n8:32\nthis with the random variables and that it's a little\n8:34\nbit confusing.\n8:34\nAll it's saying is that as you take more and more samples, the\n8:39\naverage of that sample is going to approximate the\n8:44\ntrue average.\n8:45\nOr I should be a little bit more particular.\n8:47\nThe mean of your sample is going to converge to the true\n8:51\nmean of the population or to the expected value of\n8:54\nthe random variable.\n8:56\nAnyway, see you in the next video.",

\"thinking like a historian\"?\n0:11\nDoes that mean that you have to go out and buy\n0:15\na tweed jacket with some elbow patches\n0:17\nand maybe grow a long, white beard\n0:20\nand sit around all day pondering whether the Civil War\n0:23\nwas caused by slavery or states' rights?\n0:27\nNo, but you can try that if you want.\n0:30\nBut I would say thinking like a historian is a little bit\n0:33\nlike being a combination between a storyteller\n0:41\nand a scientist . . .\n0:43\nyou're gonna see me draw a really, really bad beaker here\n0:49\nthere we go . . .\n0:53\nsome little fumes coming off of that.\n0:57\nand a lawyer, maybe I'll put a gavel here.\n1:08\nIt's a gavel, not a croquet mallet or a hammer.\n1:12\nSo first let's start with the storytelling aspect.\n1:18\nI think one of the most important things that we can learn\n1:22\nfrom telling this story of history is that\n1:24\nin a good story nothing just happens.\n1:32\nImagine a story where everything just happened.\n1:37\nThe story would be: the wind blows, the earth turns, right?\n1:42\nNo one is making those things happen\n1:45\nand that's why it's kind of a boring story\n1:48\nbecause it doesn't show cause and effect.\n1:50\nAnd that cause and effect is really\n1:53\nthe backbone of history, right?\n1:57\nAnd you would be surprised how often\n1:59\npeople can fall into the trap of telling history,\n2:03\nthis incredible story about what people have done\n2:07\nin the past that has led to the society we have today\n2:10\nas if it were kind of a laundry list of events\n2:14\nthat just followed one after another without\n2:16\nany possibility of things being different.\n2:19\nPeople will say, \"and then World War II happened\"\n2:21\nor \"and then the United States was born,\" right?\n2:26\nThose statements are in passive voice because they don't\n2:29\ntalk about the people who make these things happen.\n2:32\nAnd really, short of a natural disaster,\n2:35\npretty much everything happens in history\n2:38\nbecause people made it happen.\n2:41\nSo when you think like a historian, you kind of think\n2:44\nthe same way that a novelist might think.\n2:46\nOK, what is this character's motive?\n2:49\nWhat are they going to do to make their wish come true?\n2:55\nWhat are the influences that lead\n3:00\na person to make certain choices?\n3:02\nAnd just like people make choices,\n3:05\nnations make choices, right?\n3:07\nWorld War I didn't just happen\n3:10\nand just as people make choices,\n3:12\nactions have consequences.\n3:14\nYou wouldn't write a story where\n3:16\na thief stole 100 million dollars\n3:18\nand the police didn't even try to come after her.\n3:21\nNeither can you write a story about history without\n3:24\ntalking about the effects that actions have on people.\n3:27\nSo that's the storytelling aspect\n3:30\nof thinking like a historian.\n3:31\nLet's talk about the scientific aspect.\n3:34\nWe often think of history as something\n3:36\nthat's pretty much done, right?\n3:39\nIt's a series of events that happened in the past\n3:44\nand now we just have to memorize what happened\n3:47\nso we can learn from it and maybe have a good idea\n3:50\nabout what to do in the future.\n3:52\nBut really there is only so much we can actually know\n3:56\nabout what happened in the past.\n3:57\nAnd so historians always have to do\n4:01\na kind of research to understand what happened\n4:06\nand get a better idea of what people were feeling.\n4:10\nSo just like scientists have theories,\n4:14\nwhen historians think about the past,\n4:17\nthey're really thinking about theories as well.\n4:20\nThey're saying, \"ok, I have a theory about\n4:23\n\"what caused the evolution of jazz in the 1920s.\"\n4:27\nWhy did jazz become a major\n4:30\npopular form of music in the 1920s?\n4:33\nWell, I'm gonna theorize it was because people\n4:36\nwere reacting to the horror of World War I\n4:39\nwhich made so many people interested in kind of,\n4:42\nstaccato notes and discordant sounds.\n4:45\nAlright, so that's a theory.\n4:47\nWell, how do you go about proving a theory?\n4:49\nAnd the answer is you do research\n4:51\nand you consult evidence, right?\n4:53\nAnd the way that you do that in history\n4:56\nis usually by doing a lot of reading, right?\n4:59\nYou might say, alright well, let me take\n5:02\nthe letters of some jazz musicians from this time period\n5:05\nand see what they write about.\n5:06\nMaybe they write all about how\n5:09\nthey experienced battle in World War I\n5:11\nand they were trying to reflect that in their music.\n5:14\nOr maybe they write that World War I\n5:16\nhad nothing to do with their interest in music.\n5:19\nActually, they wanted to simulate the sounds of flight\n5:24\nbecause they were so interested in\n5:26\nmodern forms of transportation.\n5:28\nSo our understanding of what happened in the past\n5:30\nis always just a theory.\n5:33\nI mean we have a pretty good idea\n5:36\nof what was going on most of the time,\n5:39\nbut new information comes to light all the time, right?\n5:42\nI mean people are always cleaning out their grandma's attic\n5:45\nand finding some new documents\n5:47\nand as the preponderance of the evidence shifts and changes\n5:51\nso might our understanding of the past.\n5:54\nThe last aspect of thinking like a historian\n5:56\nI want to talk about is this kind of lawyerly aspect.\n6:00\nAnd what I mean by this is that historians\n6:04\nare always making an argument.\n6:14\nJust like a lawyer gets up in a court room and says,\n6:16\n\"Here's my idea, now let me support it\n6:19\n\"with the evidence from witnesses, from experts,\n6:23\n\"from objects we might have found at a crime scene.\"\n6:27\nA historian is saying, \"believe my theory.\n6:30\n\"Believe my evidence.\"\n6:33\nAnd I think the analogy of law is really powerful here\n6:36\nbecause you could see the same pieces of evidence\n6:39\nused to support two different arguments.\n6:42\nSo for example, say there's, maybe . . .\n6:46\na sock that was found at the scene of a crime\n6:51\nright, and here's our sock . . .\n6:58\nI'm not a beautiful artist.\n7:02\nBut, maybe the prosecution\n7:06\ntries to argue . . .\n7:09\nthat the accused must have committed\n7:12\nthis crime because the sock is his size.\n7:20\nRight, the sock shows he did it.\n7:22\nWhereas the defense\n7:27\nmight say, \"My client never wears socks,\n7:30\n\"he always wears sandals.\"\n7:32\nSo it's clear that the sock shows that\n7:35\nhe couldn't possibly have been the one to do this crime.\n7:38\nSo that's how we end up with so many\n7:40\ndifferent interpretations of the same event.\n7:43\nThe task of the historian is to gather evidence\n7:46\nand to present an argument that they think will\n7:51\nbest convince the public of their interpretation.\n7:55\nAnd so these interpretations do change over time.\n7:58\nSo in later videos we'll get into the nuts and bolts\n8:01\nof how you tell these stories and make these arguments.\n8:04\nBut for now, I just kind of want you to see\n8:07\nthat thinking like a historian is not\n8:09\nsomething that only historians can do.\n8:12\nIt's actually a really useful skill\n8:14\nfor lots of aspects of your life.\n8:16\nWe tell stories, search for evidence, and make arguments\n8:20\nin our lives all the time about things\n8:22\nthat we interact with every day like our favorite\n8:25\nbands, our favorite foods, our political views, right?\n8:29\nWe base those on our own experiences,\n8:32\nconsequences in our lives\n8:34\nand evidence that we see around us.\n8:37\nAnd we can do the same thing for the past.\n8:39\nIt's not such a foreign country.\n8:41\nWhat we have are the remnants of that past\n8:44\nand the ability to interpret them.",

I imagined taking a knife\n1:45\nand cutting into the earth, opening it up\n1:47\nand initial violence and pain that in time would heal.\"\n1:51\nShe writes,\"That the experience of the monument\n1:53\nwould help people to come to terms\n1:55\nwith the death of their loved ones.\"\n1:57\nSteven: There is a real journey involved here.\n1:58\nYou walk down in, you find the name\n2:01\nof your loved one embedded within\n2:03\nthe chronological sequence of the death\n2:06\nof all of these soldiers, and then you walk back out.\n2:09\nBeth: That's right. In the center,\n2:11\nthe chronology begins and goes down toward the right\n2:14\nas we're facing the wall and then picks up again\n2:16\non the low edge of the left side\n2:19\nand then towards the center again.\n2:21\nAs we move down the center, the path widens\n2:25\nand the granite rises more than 10 feet above us.\n2:28\nSteven: The names become a symbol of\n2:30\nthis person multiplied more than 58,000 times,\n2:34\nbut even though you've got that abstraction,\n2:36\nyou also have this very concrete reality.\n2:40\nYou have this place for family to come,\n2:42\nto gather, to reflect on that name.\n2:44\nBeth: Maya Lin talks about the name as\n2:47\nan abstraction that in fact, means more to\n2:51\nfamily and loved ones than a picture.\n2:55\nThe picture represents someone at\n2:56\na particular time and a particular place\n2:58\nas one moment in their lives whereas a name\n3:02\nmight recall everything about that person.\n3:04\nSteven: There is this powerful accumulation\n3:06\nof all of the names.\n3:08\nAs you descend, as you walk into the densest middle\n3:11\nof the monument, it becomes absolutely overwhelming.\n3:14\nBeth: It's a very different experience than\n3:16\nmost previous war memorials.\n3:19\nWhen we think about the history of war memorials,\n3:21\nwe often think about memorials to military heroes like\n3:25\nthe monument to Lord Nelson in Trafalgar Square\n3:28\nor we might think about the Shaw memorial by\n3:31\nAugustus Saint-Gaudens in the National Gallery\n3:33\nwhere you have a hero leading an\n3:36\nanonymous army with an allegorical figure\n3:39\nrepresenting peace and death,\n3:41\nthis combination of allegory and heroism\n3:44\nthat's usually in memorials,\n3:46\nit's completely absent here.\n3:48\nSteven: How can one create a meaningful monument\n3:51\nin the late 20th century?\n3:53\nWhat does it mean to strip away all of the\n3:55\nrepresentational form?\n3:56\nWhat does it mean to create something so\n3:59\nsubconsciously abstract and yet also so\n4:01\npowerful and so meaningful?\n4:03\nBeth: Evidently the committee that judged this\n4:05\ndecided that this abstraction would be best.\n4:08\nIt's interesting to think about how the committee\n4:11\ndidn't know who was Maya Lin was.\n4:13\nThere were 1,400 entries, completely anonymous.\n4:17\nMaya Lin at that point, was an undergraduate at Yale,\n4:19\nshe was an architecture student, she's an Asian American.\n4:22\nIt's interesting to think about what\n4:24\nmight have happened had they known\n4:26\nwho this application was from.\n4:28\nSteven: Once her identity had been revealed,\n4:30\nthere was real backlash and racism.\n4:33\nThere was backlash also about the abstraction.\n4:35\nUltimately that was resolved by\n4:37\na much more naturalistic sculpture\n4:38\nadjacent to the main memorial.\n4:41\nBeth: One that shows soldiers in a\n4:43\nvery naturalistic way, three-dimensionally,\n4:46\nwhich is also powerful, but in a way that\n4:48\nfeels much more public and far less intimate.\n4:50\nSteven: Maya Lin was brilliant in creating\n4:53\na public space and yet tremendous intimacy.\n4:56\nWe can feel those names inscribed.\n4:58\nThe active reading is to come close,\n5:00\nto internalize those names.\n5:03\nMaya Lin's Vietnam Memorial is one of the most\n5:06\nsuccessful memorials in the nation.\n5:08\nBeth: And apparently one of the most visited\n5:10\nmonuments in Washington D.C.\n5:13\nIn an article that was published much later,\n5:15\nwriting about her ideas for the monument,\n5:17\nMaya Lin said, \"It would be an interface between\n5:20\nour world and the quieter, darker,\n5:22\nmore peaceful world beyond.\n5:25\nI chose black granite in order to make\n5:27\nthe surface reflective and peaceful.\n5:29\nI never looked at the memorial as a wall,\n5:31\nan object, but as an edge to the earth,\n5:34\nan opened side. The mirrored sect would\n5:36\ndouble the size of the park creating two worlds;\n5:40\none we are part of and one we cannot enter.\"\n5:43\nSteven: Even that black granite created controversy.\n5:45\nShe also talked about how she couldn't\n5:48\nexpect granite that came from Canada\n5:50\nor from Sweden, two countries that had\n5:52\nreally good quality black granite because\n5:55\nthere was too much political baggage because\n5:58\ndraft dodgers had gone to both of those countries.\n6:00\nBeth: One opponent of her design said,\n6:03\n\"One needs no artistic education to see\n6:05\nthis memorial designed for what it is,\n6:07\na black scar and a hole hidden, as if out of shame.\"\n6:12\nNo, I think this is very different than what\n6:14\nMaya Lin intended for the wall.\n6:16\nShe specifically took an apolitical approach\n6:20\nand wanted the design to be about those veterans\n6:24\nwho had sacrificed their lives and not about\n6:26\nthe political controversy at all;\n6:28\nnot about whether if the was was\n6:29\nsomething shameful or something honorable.\n6:32\nSteven: The country had not only fought the war,\n6:34\nbut then fought itself over the meaning of the war.\n6:37\nMaya Lin was very wise in sidestepping that\n6:40\nand putting to the fore simply the names,\n6:45\nthe numerical power of all those fallen.\n6:48\nBeth: And she wrote, \"The wall dematerializes\n6:50\nof the form and allows the names\n6:52\nto become the object. Pure and reflective\n6:55\nsurfaces that would allow visitors\n6:57\nthe chance to see themselves with the name.\"\n7:00\n(music) (\"In The Sky With Diamonds\" by Scalding Lucy)",

gift shop about it.\n0:18\nSPEAKER 1: You can get your own little Rosetta Stone.\n0:20\nSPEAKER 2: Exactly!\n0:20\nSPEAKER 1: You can get Rosetta Stone posters.\n0:22\nSPEAKER 2: On a mug.\n0:23\nSPEAKER 1: I think you can get a doormat Rosetta Stone.\n0:25\nSPEAKER 2: Yeah.\n0:26\nSPEAKER 1: But the stone itself is historically\n0:28\nincredibly important.\n0:29\nIt allowed us for the first time to be able to understand,\n0:32\nto be able to read, to be able to translate hieroglyphics.\n0:36\nSPEAKER 2: Hieroglyphics was the written language\n0:38\nof the ancient Egyptians.\n0:40\nAnd until the mid 19th century, we really\n0:43\ndidn't know what it said.\n0:45\nSPEAKER 1: The language itself is pictorial.\n0:46\nAnd actually that led to one of the real confusions,\n0:49\nbecause they think that early archaeologists believed\n0:52\nand linguists believed that the pictures\n0:54\nthey could see-- you can make out\n0:55\nbirds and snakes in various different kinds of forms--\n0:58\nactually referred in some way to a specific thing in the world.\n1:01\nSPEAKER 2: Right.\n1:01\nSo if you saw a bird, it somehow referred to a bird.\n1:04\nSPEAKER 1: And in fact, that's not the case.\n1:06\nSPEAKER 2: Right.\n1:07\nSPEAKER 1: This is a far more sophisticated language.\n1:09\nSPEAKER 2: And the Rosetta Stone was really\n1:11\nwhat helped them to understand that Egyptian hieroglyphics are\n1:14\nnot pictorial.\n1:15\nThey're not pictographs.\n1:16\nThey're actually phonetic.\n1:18\nSo all those things that look like pictures actually\n1:21\nrepresent sounds.\n1:22\nAnd that's how they were able to finally figure\n1:24\nout and translate ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.\n1:27\nSPEAKER 1: And the reason we were able to do that\n1:29\nis because this stone said the same statement three times\n1:32\nin three different languages.\n1:34\nSo the three languages are ancient Greek,\n1:37\nwhich is down at the bottom.\n1:38\nNow, that was the language of the administration.\n1:41\nThat was the language of government.\n1:42\nAnd the reason for that is because Alexander the Great\n1:45\nhad conquered Egypt and had set up this sort of Greek rule\n1:49\nin this Hellenistic era, and that maintained itself\n1:52\nin ancient Egypt.\n1:53\nSPEAKER 2: Let's remember, we're talking about 200 BC here.\n1:56\nSPEAKER 1: Which is actually getting\n1:57\nclose to the end of the life of hieroglyphics as well.\n2:00\nIt would last for another few hundred years\n2:02\nbefore it died out completely.\n2:03\nSo this is really the tail end of this 3,000-year-long\n2:07\nlanguage.\n2:07\nSPEAKER 2: So the middle section is\n2:09\nDemotic, which actually means the language of the people.\n2:13\nAnd it was this common language used by the Egyptians.\n2:17\nSPEAKER 1: And the top, of course, was the sacred writing.\n2:20\nThis was hieroglyphs.\n2:21\nSPEAKER 2: Right.\n2:22\nSPEAKER 1: And that was the language\n2:23\nthat we really couldn't read.\n2:25\nSPEAKER 2: Until we had the Rosetta Stone,\n2:27\nand we could see within the writings of the Rosetta Stone\n2:31\ncartouches, which held the names of the rulers.\n2:35\nCartouches are a kind of oblong shape\n2:37\nthat contains the name of the ruler.\n2:39\nSPEAKER 1: In this case, that would be Ptolemy V.\n2:42\nSPEAKER 2: And by recognizing that ruler's name\n2:45\nin these three different languages,\n2:47\nwe found a way to begin to unlock hieroglyphics.\n2:49\nSPEAKER 1: Now, that would take decades.\n2:50\nIt was an incredibly difficult task.\n2:52\nSPEAKER 2: And we haven't even talked yet\n2:54\nabout how this was found.\n2:55\nNapoleon has his army in Egypt, and Napoleon's brought with him\n2:59\nsome what I guess what we would call\n3:01\nsort of archaeologist types.\n3:03\nAnd one of those people who accompanied Napoleon\n3:07\nfound or came across the Rosetta Stone.\n3:10\nSPEAKER 1: It was being used as a part\n3:11\nof the foundation of a fort, in fact.\n3:14\nSPEAKER 2: And of course, it would have originally\n3:16\nbeen erected in a temple or near an ancient Egyptian temple.\n3:18\nSPEAKER 1: And I suppose it's important to say that this\n3:21\nis the bottom portion of a much larger stele, or sort of stone\n3:24\ntablet, that would have been quite tall.\n3:26\nSPEAKER 2: So Napoleon took it back--\n3:28\nSPEAKER 1: Except hold on a second, because we're not\n3:29\nin the Louvre.\n3:30\nWe're in London in a British Museum.\n3:32\nSo how does that work?\n3:33\nSPEAKER 2: Well, the British defeated Napoleon\n3:36\nand brought back the stone.\n3:38\nAnd a year or two later, I think 1801 or 1802,\n3:41\nit was brought to the British Museum,\n3:42\nand it's been here ever since.\n3:43\nSPEAKER 1: Well, it's clearly still extremely popular.\n3:46\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWelcome back.\n0:01\nWe'll now do another tension problem and this one is just a\n0:04\nslight increment harder than the previous one just because\n0:06\nwe have to take out slightly more sophisticated algebra\n0:10\ntools than we did in the last one.\n0:11\nBut it's not really any harder.\n0:14\nBut you should actually see this type of problem because\n0:15\nyou'll probably see it on an exam.\n0:17\nSo let's figure out the tension in the wire.\n0:19\nSo first of all, we know that this point\n0:22\nright here isn't moving.\n0:24\nSo the tension in this little small wire right here is easy.\n0:26\nIt's trivial.\n0:28\nThe force of gravity is pulling down at this point\n0:30\nwith 10 Newtons because you have this weight here.\n0:33\nAnd of course, since this point is stationary, the\n0:35\ntension in this wire has to be 10 Newtons upward.\n0:37\nThat's an easy one.\n0:38\nSo let's just figure out the tension in these two slightly\n0:41\nmore difficult wires to figure out the tensions of.\n0:44\nSo once again, we know that this point right here, this\n0:47\npoint is not accelerating in any direction.\n0:49\nIt's not accelerating in the x direction, nor is it\n0:52\naccelerating in the vertical direction or the y direction.\n0:55\nSo we know that the net forces in the x direction need to be\n0:57\n0 on it and we know the net forces in the y\n1:00\ndirection need to be 0.\n1:03\nSo what are the net forces in the x direction?\n1:06\nWell they're going to be the x components of these two-- of\n1:10\nthe tension vectors of both of these wires.\n1:12\nI guess let's draw the tension vectors of the two wires.\n1:15\nSo this T1, it's pulling.\n1:18\nThe tension vector pulls in the direction of the wire\n1:21\nalong the same line.\n1:23\nSo let's say that this is the tension vector of T1.\n1:26\nIf that's the tension vector, its x component will be this.\n1:30\nLet me see how good I can draw this.\n1:33\nIt's intended to be a straight line, but that\n1:35\nwould be its x component.\n1:36\nAnd its x component, let's see, this is 30 degrees.\n1:42\nThis is 30 degrees right here.\n1:44\nAnd hopefully this is a bit second nature to you.\n1:47\nIf this value up here is T1, what is the\n1:49\nvalue of the x component?\n1:51\nIt's T1 cosine of 30 degrees.\n1:59\nAnd you could do your SOH-CAH-TOA.\n2:01\nYou know, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.\n2:04\nSo the cosine of 30 degrees is equal to-- This over T1 one is\n2:09\nequal to the x component over T1.\n2:10\nAnd if you multiply both sides by T1, you get this.\n2:14\nThis should be a little bit of second nature right now.\n2:15\nThat the x component is going to be the cosine of the angle\n2:20\nbetween the hypotenuse and the x component times the\n2:23\nhypotenuse.\n2:24\nAnd similarly, the x component here-- Let me\n2:27\ndraw this force vector.\n2:28\nSo if this is T2, this would be its x component.\n2:38\nAnd very similarly, this is 60 degrees, so this would be T2\n2:44\ncosine of 60.\n2:48\nNow what do we know about these two vectors?\n2:50\nWe know that their net force is 0.\n2:55\nOr that you also know that the magnitude of these two vectors\n2:57\nshould cancel each other out or that they're equal.\n2:59\nI mean, they're pulling in opposite directions.\n3:01\nThat's pretty obvious.\n3:04\nAnd so you know that their magnitudes need to be equal.\n3:05\nSo we know that T1 cosine of 30 is going to equal\n3:08\nT2 cosine of 60.\n3:10\nSo let's write that down.\n3:12\nT1 cosine of 30 degrees is equal to T2 cosine of 60.\n3:27\nAnd then we could bring the T2 on to this side.\n3:29\nAnd actually, let's also-- I'm trying to save as much space\n3:31\nas possible because I'm guessing this is going to take\n3:33\nup a lot of room, this problem.\n3:35\nWhat's the cosine of 30 degrees?\n3:38\nIf you haven't memorized it already, it's square\n3:39\nroot of 3 over 2.\n3:40\nSo this becomes square root of 3 over 2 times T1.\n3:45\nThat's the cosine of 30 degrees.\n3:47\nAnd then I'm going to bring this on to this side.\n3:49\nSo the cosine of 60 is actually 1/2.\n3:54\nYou could use your calculator if you forgot that.\n3:56\nSo this is 1/2 T2.\n3:58\nBring it on this side so it becomes minus 1/2.\n4:01\nI'm skipping more steps than normal just because I don't\n4:04\nwant to waste too much space.\n4:07\nAnd this equals 0.\n4:08\nBut if you seen the other videos, hopefully I'm not\n4:11\ncreating too many gaps.\n4:12\nAnd this is relatively easy to follow.\n4:14\nSo we have the square root of 3 times T1 minus 1/2 T2 is\n4:19\nequal to 0.\n4:19\nSo that gives us an equation.\n4:21\nOne equation with two unknowns, so it doesn't help\n4:24\nus much so far.\n4:25\nBut let's square that away because I have a feeling this\n4:29\nwill be useful.\n4:32\nNow what's going to be happening on the y components?\n4:34\nSo let's say that this is the y component of T1 and this is\n4:39\nthe y component of T2.\n4:42\nWhat do we know?\n4:42\nWhat what do we know about the two y components?\n4:44\nI could've drawn them here too and then just shift them over\n4:46\nto the left and the right.\n4:48\nWe know that their combined pull upwards, the combined\n4:52\npull of the two vertical tension components has to\n4:54\noffset the force of gravity pulling down because this\n4:57\npoint is stationary.\n4:59\nSo we know these two y components, when you add them\n5:02\ntogether, the combined tension in the vertical direction has\n5:05\nto be 10 Newtons.\n5:06\nBecause it's offsetting this force of gravity.\n5:09\nSo what's this y component?\n5:10\nWell, this was T1 of cosine of 30.\n5:12\nThis should start to become a little second nature to you\n5:15\nthat this is T1 sine of 30, this y component right here.\n5:19\nSo T1-- Let me write it here.\n5:23\nT1 sine of 30 degrees plus this vector, which is T2 sine\n5:34\nof 60 degrees.\n5:38\nYou could review your trigonometry and your\n5:39\nSOH-CAH-TOA.\n5:41\nFrankly, I think, just seeing what people get confused on is\n5:44\nthe trigonometry.\n5:45\nBut you can review the trig modules and maybe some of the\n5:48\nearlier force vector modules that we did.\n5:50\nAnd hopefully, these will make sense.\n5:52\nI'm skipping a few steps.\n5:53\nAnd these will equal 10 Newtons.\n5:58\nAnd let's rewrite this up here where I substitute the values.\n6:02\nSo what's the sine of 30?\n6:03\nActually, let me do it right here.\n6:06\nWhat's the sine of 30 degrees?\n6:07\nThe sine of 30 degrees is 1/2 so we get 1/2 T1 plus the sine\n6:15\nof 60 degrees, which is square root of 3 over 2.\n6:17\nSquare root of 3 over 2 T2 is equal to 10.\n6:22\nAnd then I don't like this, all these 2's\n6:23\nand this 1/2 here.\n6:25\nSo let's multiply this whole equation by 2.\n6:27\nSo 2 times 1/2, that's 1.\n6:30\nSo you get T1 plus the square root of 3 T2 is equal to, 2\n6:37\ntimes 10 , is 20.\n6:40\nSimilarly, let's take this equation up here and let's\n6:42\nmultiply this equation by 2 and bring it down here.\n6:46\nSo this is the original one that we got.\n6:47\nSo if we multiply this whole thing by 2-- I'll do it in\n6:50\nthis color so that you know that\n6:52\nit's a different equation.\n6:54\nSo if you multiply square root of 3 over 2 times 2-- I'm just\n6:56\ndoing this to get rid of the 2's in the denominator.\n6:58\nSo you get square root of 3 T1 minus T2 is equal to 0 because\n7:10\n0 times 2 is 0.\n7:12\nAnd let's see what we could do.\n7:13\nWhat if we take this top equation because we want to\n7:15\nstart canceling out some terms. Let's take this top\n7:18\nequation and let's multiply it by-- oh, I don't know.\n7:24\nLet's multiply it by the square root of 3.\n7:28\nSo you get the square root of 3 T1.\n7:36\nI'm taking this top equation multiplied by the\n7:37\nsquare root of 3.\n7:38\nThis is just a system of equations\n7:39\nthat I'm solving for.\n7:41\nAnd the square root of 3 times this right here.\n7:43\nSquare root of 3 times square root of 3 is 3.\n7:46\nSo plus 3 T2 is equal to 20 square root of 3.\n7:54\nAnd now what I want to do is let's-- I know I'm doing a lot\n7:59\nof equation manipulation here.\n8:01\nBut this is just hopefully, a review of algebra for you.\n8:04\nLet's subtract this equation from this equation.\n8:09\nSo you can also view it as multiplying it by negative 1\n8:11\nand then adding the 2.\n8:13\nSo when you subtract this from this, these two terms cancel\n8:15\nout because they're the same.\n8:17\nAnd so then you're left with minus T2 from here.\n8:22\nMinus this, minus 3 T2 is equal to 0 minus 20 square\n8:31\nroots of 3.\n8:33\nAnd so this becomes minus 4 T2 is equal to minus 20 square\n8:40\nroots of 3.\n8:42\nAnd then, divide both sides by minus 4 and you get T2 is\n8:46\nequal to 5 square roots of 3 Newtons.\n8:52\nSo that's the tension in this wire.\n8:54\nAnd now we can substitute and figure out T1.\n8:58\nLet's use this formula right here because it\n8:59\nlooks suitably simple.\n9:02\nSo we have the square root of 3 times T1 minus T2.\n9:08\nWell T2 is 5 square roots of 3.\n9:10\n5 square roots of 3 is equal to 0.\n9:14\nSo we have the square root of 3 T1 is equal to five square\n9:19\nroots of 3.\n9:21\nDivide both sides by square root of 3 and you get the\n9:23\ntension in the first wire is equal to 5 Newtons.\n9:28\nSo this is pulling with a force or tension of 5 Newtons.\n9:31\nOr a force.\n9:33\nAnd this is pulling-- the second wire --with a tension\n9:36\nof 5 square roots of 3 Newtons.\n9:39\nSo this wire right here is actually\n9:43\ndoing more of the pulling.\n9:45\nIt's actually more of the force of gravity is ending up\n9:48\non this wire.\n9:49\nThat makes sense because it's steeper.\n9:51\nSo since it's steeper, it's contributing\n9:54\nmore to the y component.\n9:56\nIt's good whenever you do these problems to kind of do a\n9:58\nreality check just to make sure your numbers make sense.\n10:01\nAnd if you think about it, their combined tension is\n10:05\nsomething more than 10 Newtons.\n10:07\nAnd that makes sense because some of the force that they're\n10:10\npulling with is wasted against pulling each other in the\n10:13\nhorizontal direction.\n10:15\nAnyway, I'll see you all in the next video.",

    "question_text": "Were there any previous assassination attempts on President Abraham Lincoln?",
    "question_type": "MCQ",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the video where I give an overview of American history\n0:03\nthrough the Civil War, I commented that it's unfortunate\n0:06\nthat Abraham Lincoln is assassinated shortly\n0:08\nbefore the end of the Civil War.\n0:11\nAnd although that is technically correct, what I want to do\n0:13\nis clarify that comment a little bit in this video.\n0:16\nBecause in actuality by the time he was assassinated,\n0:20\nLincoln knew that the Union was very, very, very likely\n0:24\nto win the war, that the major Confederate armies had already\n0:29\nsurrendered to the Union.\n0:31\nAlthough it wasn't formally done,\n0:32\nthere was still some fighting going\n0:34\non in some parts of the South.\n0:36\nSo if we go back to April 9, 1865\n0:40\nyou have the battle at Appomattox Courthouse,\n0:42\nand after that battle the Confederate army\n0:45\nis essentially routed.\n0:46\nIt has to surrender.\n0:47\nThis right here is Robert E. Lee.\n0:53\nAnd on April 9, 1865 after that battle,\n0:57\nhe surrenders to Ulysses S. Grant.\n1:02\nAnd one point of confusion some people often have, and I\n1:05\nhad this the first time I learned it,\n1:07\nis that Appomattox Courthouse is the name of the city,\n1:10\nthat the surrender actually did not take place\n1:12\nin the courthouse in that city.\n1:13\nAnd I actually shouldn't even call it a city.\n1:15\nIt's like a little town with a handful of buildings.\n1:18\nIt took place in this gentleman's house,\n1:20\nWilmer McLean.\n1:22\nAnd I'm showing his image because,\n1:24\nhis set of circumstances or how he is tied to the Civil War,\n1:28\nis frankly fascinating.\n1:30\nBecause in 1861 the first battle of the Civil War\n1:34\noccurred on his property in Manassas, Virginia.\n1:37\nThis is in northern Virginia.\n1:39\nHe was sympathetic with the Confederate army.\n1:43\nHe did not like that northern Virginia was\n1:45\nso close to the North-South border.\n1:50\nSo he picks up his bags and his family,\n1:52\nand he moves them down to the small town\n1:54\nof Appomattox Courthouse, which is in central Virginia.\n1:58\nSo the very first major land battle of the Civil War\n2:02\nliterally occurs on this guy's property.\n2:05\nAnd the last major or really the major surrender\n2:10\nof the Civil War occurs inside this guy's house\n2:13\nafter he moves.\n2:14\nAnd it's all coincidence.\n2:15\nHe just happens to have the nicest house\n2:17\nnear the battlefield where everyone\n2:19\nfelt that it was appropriate to have this kind of major end\n2:22\nto a major war.\n2:24\nBut regardless, that happens on April 9, 1865.\n2:28\nThe major Confederate army surrenders to the Union army.\n2:33\nThe reason why this is not the formal end of the Civil War\n2:36\nis that you still had 175,000 Confederate troops other places\n2:41\nin the south continuing to fight on.\n2:43\nYou have to remember that we didn't\n2:45\nhave a telephone at this point in time,\n2:47\nso we didn't have instant communication.\n2:49\nSo these people who were fighting, many of them\n2:52\ndid not even know that the Confederate army had already\n2:56\nsurrendered to the Union.\n2:58\nBut to some degree this major surrender\n3:01\nis what leads to Lincoln's assassination.\n3:04\nBecause for most people this tells you,\n3:08\nhey, there's a 99.9% chance that the Union has won.\n3:12\nIt just has to, either these people\n3:13\nneed to find out that their major army has surrendered,\n3:16\nor the Union has to go and essentially force\n3:20\nall of the rest of the armies to surrender.\n3:22\nSo you go to April 14, 1865.\n3:25\nLincoln already knows that Robert E. Lee's army\n3:28\nhas surrendered.\n3:29\nHe knows that victory is imminent.\n3:32\nBut you have this gentleman right over here, John Wilkes\n3:36\nBooth, who is sympathetic to the Confederate cause.\n3:46\nAnd in his mind all is not lost yet.\n3:50\nHe does see this as a major blow to the Confederate cause,\n3:53\nand he thinks that they need to do something desperate\n3:56\nif they want to have any chance of being able to come back,\n4:00\nbeing able to maintain their independence from the Union.\n4:04\nSo he coordinates with a couple of his buddies.\n4:07\nAnd he says, hey our only chance is\n4:09\nif we assassinate not only Abraham Lincoln, but also\n4:13\nAndrew Johnson who's the vice president, and Ulysses S Grant,\n4:18\nand we assassinate Seward, who was the Secretary of State.\n4:22\nAnd the idea there is if you assassinate everyone\n4:25\nwho is in line to become president,\n4:27\nthen it would just throw the entire Union leadership\n4:30\nin disarray, and maybe it would give these characters over here\n4:33\na fighting chance to maintain their independence\n4:36\nor maybe come back against the Union Army.\n4:38\nUnfortunately for John Wilkes Booth,\n4:40\nor I guess well you could take it either way,\n4:44\nthe other three people were not able to fully execute\n4:47\non their plan.\n4:48\nSeward was injured.\n4:51\nHe actually did get stabbed in the face and all that,\n4:53\nbut he was not assassinated.\n4:55\nAnd John Wilkes Booth was the only person\n4:57\nwho was able to carry out his assassination.\n5:00\nSo you have on April 14, 1865 shortly after 10:00 PM Abraham\n5:05\nLincoln is watching a play at Ford's Theater.\n5:08\nAnd his booth, the guy who was supposed to guard the booth,\n5:12\nwas out drinking with his buddies.\n5:14\nSo I guess the Secret Service really, the security\n5:18\nwas not back then what it is now, hopefully what it is now.\n5:21\nAnd John Wilkes Booth, who actually\n5:24\nused to act at this theater, he picked a time in the play\n5:27\nwhere everyone would laugh and clap.\n5:28\nAnd he said, hey, I'll just shoot right then.\n5:30\nPeople will think it's part of the play or something,\n5:32\nor they wouldn't notice as much, and then\n5:34\nI'll be able to run out.\n5:35\nAnd so he is able to, right in that moment shortly after 10:00\n5:39\nPM, shoot Abraham Lincoln and assassinate him\n5:43\non April 14, 1865.\n5:44\nBut the whole point here is to just understand\n5:47\nthat Lincoln did know that Robert E. Lee's army had\n5:53\nsurrendered at the time of his assassination.\n5:56\nSo he at least was feeling pretty\n5:57\ngood about the course of the war.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the last video, we left off with the assassination\n0:03\nof Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the heir\n0:08\nto the Austro-Hungarian empire.\n0:11\nAnd so you could imagine, the Austro-Hungarian empire\n0:15\ndid not take that well.\n0:16\nThey already did not enjoy the kingdom of Serbia trying to,\n0:21\nessentially, provoke this nationalistic movement.\n0:24\nAnd they viewed them as this small, little, weak country\n0:27\nright below them.\n0:29\nAnd so they use this to, essentially,\n0:31\nissue an ultimatum.\n0:32\nEssentially say, look, immediately\n0:34\nbring all the people who did this to justice,\n0:37\nall the people who might have conspired with the Gavrilo\n0:40\nPrincips to allow this assassination\n0:43\nattempt to occur, and do it or else,\n0:46\nand accept full responsibility.\n0:48\nAnd actually, the kingdom of Serbia\n0:51\nwas in no mood to get into a war with Austria-Hungary,\n0:55\nand so they tried their best to comply,\n0:57\nbut their best wasn't enough.\n0:59\nSo then July 28, a month later, you\n1:03\nhave the Austrians declaring war on the Serbians.\n1:15\nNow up until this point, the Austro-Hungarian empire\n1:19\nis thinking, OK, Serbia is a small, little kingdom here.\n1:21\nIt has some ties and obviously, it's a Slavic nation\n1:24\nso it has some linguistic ties with the Russian empire.\n1:27\nThe Russian empire also had some political ties to it,\n1:29\nbut Russia is not going to get into a war with us over this.\n1:32\nWe're justified in attacking them.\n1:33\nThey've just killed the heir to our throne.\n1:36\nSo we're going to go in there and Russia is probably not\n1:38\ninterested in actually creating a larger skirmish here.\n1:43\nThat was a severe miscalculation on the part of the Austrians.\n1:48\nThe Russians were not happy about this.\n1:50\nThey felt close ties to the Serbians\n1:52\nand they felt a need to protect the Serbians,\n1:55\nor you could argue, that maybe they\n1:57\nwanted to mobilize just to scare the Austrians.\n2:00\nWhatever it might be, whether it was Russia\n2:02\nwanted to get into a war, whether they were really\n2:03\nlooking to protect the Serbians, or whether they were looking\n2:06\nto mobilize to scare the Austrians from actually\n2:09\nattacking, the Russians began to mobilize.\n2:12\nSo the Russians began to gather their troops.\n2:16\nSo the Russians mobilize.\n2:23\nAnd now, this is where all of the alliances\n2:25\nstart to come into effect.\n2:28\nIf you remember about the alliances\n2:30\nwe talked about several videos ago, if you go to 1879,\n2:36\nyou have the Dual Alliance Treaty\n2:38\nbetween Germany and Austria-Hungary\n2:40\nto protect each other if Russia attacks and actually,\n2:42\nif Russia attacks or mobilizes.\n2:45\nSo now, Germany is like, hey, maybe I\n2:47\nam obligated to protect Austria-Hungary from Russia.\n2:50\nYou also have to remember in 1892, the Franco-Russian\n2:54\nMilitary Convention.\n2:55\nMilitary assistance both ways in the event of attack.\n2:59\nSo Germany is thinking, look, we signed this treaty\n3:02\nand we, to some degree, are maybe eager for war\n3:05\nbecause we've been militarizing so much.\n3:08\nAnd I can't just fight Russia.\n3:10\nI also know that France and Russia\n3:11\nhave this alliance right over here.\n3:14\nSo Germany in quite surprising quickness\n3:17\ndecides to declare war on both.\n3:19\nSo on August 1, Germany declares war on Russia.\n3:31\nAnd then on August 3, Germany declares war on France\n3:42\nbecause they know or at least they\n3:44\nfeel that they can't declare war on only one of them.\n3:46\nAnd they wanted to do it very quickly because they didn't\n3:48\nwant Russia a chance to mobilize too much.\n3:51\nAnd the fact that they were able to do this so quickly--\n3:53\nwe're talking three days after Austria declares war on Serbia\n3:57\nand then another two days declare war\n3:59\non France-- kind of shows that Germany was already\n4:01\nin a war footing.\n4:02\nIt's not a joke to all of a sudden invade\n4:04\nor declare war on countries.\n4:06\nSo Germany was, essentially, preparing for this.\n4:08\nAnd this right over here gave them\n4:11\nthe excuse to, essentially, declare war.\n4:15\nSo they declare war on both of these characters, Germany\n4:18\nagainst Russia.\n4:19\nGermany is declaring war on France.\n4:22\nNow, the easiest way for them to move into France--\n4:25\nso they're literally going on the offense\n4:27\nhere-- is for them to go through Belgium.\n4:34\nBut the Germans were aware.\n4:36\nThey're aware that there's this 75-year-old treaty, the Treaty\n4:39\nof London in 1839, Article 7 said\n4:42\nthat Britain was to protect the neutrality of Belgium.\n4:46\nAnd Germany was in no interest to get\n4:48\ninto a war with the British.\n4:49\nThe British had a powerful military,\n4:52\nespecially a very powerful navy.\n4:55\nThe Germans said, hey, let's just\n4:56\ntake on the Russians and the French for now.\n4:58\nAnd so they actually reached out to the British\n5:00\nand said, hey, this little treaty that you got here\n5:03\nfrom 1839, this 75-year-old treaty,\n5:04\nyou don't really take this seriously, right?\n5:06\nI mean if we have to go through Belgium,\n5:08\nyou're not really going to hold true to this treaty?\n5:11\nAnd the British said, no, we actually\n5:13\ntake that very seriously.\n5:15\nObviously, the British didn't want\n5:17\nthe Germans to be aggressive here.\n5:18\nThe British didn't want the Germans\n5:20\nto be able to invade France.\n5:22\nAnd so on August 4 when Germany, essentially,\n5:31\nrolls through Belgium, Germany invades\n5:33\nBelgium to get to France, this gave the legal justification\n5:40\nfor the British to declare war on Germany.\n5:52\nAnd so in a matter of only-- I mean not even, we're\n5:54\ntalking a few months here from the assassination of Franz\n5:58\nFerdinand of Austria, you essentially\n6:01\nhave all of the major powers of Europe.\n6:03\nAnd then as we'll see because they had these empires, in not\n6:07\ntoo long most of the world is at war with each other.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] As we exit 1917 and enter into 1918,\n0:04\nwe're getting into the final stages of World War I.\n0:08\nAnd let's just give ourselves a little bit of review,\n0:10\na little bit of background, a little bit of context.\n0:12\nThe war started off as\n0:14\na two-front war for the Central Powers.\n0:15\nYou have the Western Front,\n0:17\nyou have the Western Front right over here,\n0:20\nand you had the huge,\n0:22\nyou had the huge Eastern Front right over here.\n0:26\nBy 1917, the major conflict on the Eastern Front,\n0:29\nespecially with Russia, which was the major power there,\n0:33\nhad come to an end.\n0:34\nYou had a February Revolution in Russia.\n0:36\nThe czar had to abdicate the throne.\n0:39\nYou had a provisional government.\n0:41\nThen in November of 1917,\n0:43\nthe Bolsheviks have a coup, they take over.\n0:46\nThey have no interest in prosecuting World War I,\n0:48\nbecause they have their own civil war to worry about,\n0:51\nso they sign an armistice with the Central Powers,\n0:55\nby the end of 1917.\n0:58\nAnd then we get into 1918,\n1:00\njust let me write all this down,\n1:02\nso by the time we get into 1918,\n1:05\nthey're ready to sign a treaty in March,\n1:08\nin March, the Russians sign\n1:11\nthe Treaty of Brest-Litovsk,\n1:13\nLitovsk,\n1:15\nwhich cedes over all of this territory to the Germans\n1:18\nand takes the Russians out of World War I.\n1:21\nSo I'm not gonna, I've gone into detail in other videos,\n1:23\nbut a huge amount of territory,\n1:25\nand I'm gonna do it very informally right over here.\n1:27\nI'll give a rough sense of where that territory was.\n1:31\nAnd the treaty itself, its main significance,\n1:33\n'cause the treaty didn't last,\n1:35\nas you might already know,\n1:36\nthe Central Powers lost World War I,\n1:38\nso that treaty was later nullified.\n1:41\nBut the key importance of that treaty,\n1:43\nis one, it took Russia out of the war,\n1:45\nit allowed the Central Powers, especially Germany,\n1:48\nto focus on the Western Front.\n1:49\nBut the other element of it is,\n1:51\nby giving so much territory to the Germans,\n1:53\nthe Germans couldn't just leave that territory as is.\n1:56\nIf they wanted any claims to it,\n1:58\nthey had to devote some of their troops to occupy,\n2:01\nor at least attempt to occupy some of it.\n2:04\nSo even though it was a huge opportunity,\n2:05\nand the Germans were able to, after the treaty,\n2:08\nor even before the treaty, after the armistice,\n2:10\nthey were able to start bringing many more\n2:13\nof the Eastern-Front troops over to the Western Front.\n2:17\nThey didn't bring over as many as they could have,\n2:19\nbecause they left some to attempt to occupy\n2:22\nsome of the territory that had been gained\n2:24\non the Eastern Front.\n2:26\nBut if you view things from a German perspective,\n2:29\nat this point, March 1918,\n2:31\nyou're gonna be feeling pretty good.\n2:33\nYou are holding your own in a two-front war now,\n2:36\nand at one point you thought Russia\n2:39\nwas the major threat there.\n2:40\nThat threat is gone, you can now focus on a one-front war,\n2:43\nmaybe you should be able to kind of\n2:45\nput the decisive blow against the allies now.\n2:48\nAnd that is how the Germans felt.\n2:51\nBut they were worried about a couple of things.\n2:53\nThey were worried about the British industrial capacity,\n2:57\nand the Allied industrial capacity,\n2:58\nthat was stronger than the Central Powers,\n3:02\nand so the British could produce more tanks\n3:05\nand more guns and more weapons,\n3:06\nso it was a race against that,\n3:08\nand there was also a race against\n3:09\nsignificant American entry.\n3:11\nRemember, April 1917,\n3:13\nWoodrow Wilson gives a speech to Congress,\n3:16\nthey declare war on the Central Powers,\n3:19\nand so the Germans wanna get this thing over with\n3:22\nbefore the Americans have a chance\n3:24\nto send in significant number of fresh troops.\n3:27\nSo in March 1918, not only do you have\n3:30\nthe Treaty of Brest-Litovsk,\n3:32\nyou also have the beginning of Germany's attempt\n3:35\nto deal that decisive blow to the Allies,\n3:38\nand it's known as the Spring Offensive.\n3:41\nSo you have the Spring, the Spring Offensive.\n3:46\nAnd the goal of the Spring Offensive\n3:49\nwas to essentially try to end the war for the Germans.\n3:53\nAnd the goal was to separate\n3:55\nthe British from the French forces.\n3:57\nThe British, for the most part, were in control\n3:59\nof the line right over here, north of the Salm River,\n4:02\nwhile the French were in control south of it.\n4:05\nSo the Spring Offensive, especially the first phases\n4:07\nof the Spring Offensive, in March 1918,\n4:09\nfocused on this area, right over here.\n4:13\nAnd at first it was actually very successful.\n4:14\nThey were able to make huge territorial gains,\n4:17\ndrive through the lines,\n4:19\ndrive the Allied Powers back.\n4:21\nNow, the problem was is that it wasn't\n4:23\na real big strategic gain.\n4:25\nThe Germans were just hoping it would be such a demoralizer,\n4:28\nthat it would throw at least,\n4:29\nmaybe the French out of the war,\n4:31\nand then maybe they could take care of the British\n4:32\nor whatever else, but that didn't happen,\n4:35\nand all of a sudden they found themselves\n4:36\nwith these huge territorial gains,\n4:38\nin very short amount of time,\n4:40\nthey had to supply themselves,\n4:42\nand they didn't really quite,\n4:44\nand they had spread their troops thin,\n4:46\nand so it frankly just let the opportunity arise\n4:49\nfor the Allies, in August,\n4:51\nto lead a counteroffensive.\n4:53\nAnd this counteroffensive by the Allies,\n4:56\nis referred to as the 100 Days Offensive.\n4:58\nIt began in August, went roughly into November,\n5:01\nso 100 Days, 100 Days Offensive,\n5:06\nduring which the Allies, between August and November,\n5:09\nwere able to push the Germans, not only back\n5:11\nbeyond what they had captured during the Spring Offensive,\n5:14\nbut all the way well back of the front\n5:17\nthat was kind of the stalemate line\n5:19\nfor most of World War I.\n5:21\nAnd it was during this 100 Days Offensive,\n5:23\nthat to most objective observers,\n5:25\nit was clear that the Allies would win this war.\n5:29\nAnd it was clear to several of the Central Powers,\n5:31\nor those Allied with the Central Powers.\n5:33\nAs we go into September,\n5:36\nas we go into September of 1918,\n5:40\nBulgaria drops itself out of the war,\n5:43\njust to remind ourselves where, what we're talking about.\n5:46\nSo you have Bulgaria right over here.\n5:49\nIt, Bulgaria, right over here.\n5:51\nIt signs an armistice with the Allies,\n5:54\nso, let me just, you have armistice,\n5:58\nI'll use a little peace symbol for armistice,\n6:00\nthat's a, armistice is just the fighting has stopped,\n6:02\nyou still, in theory, could be at a state of war,\n6:05\nso maybe I shouldn't do the peace symbol,\n6:07\nI'll just write armistice.\n6:09\nArmistice, Armistice, with Bulgaria.\n6:15\nAnd this is really starting to tighten the noose\n6:17\naround the remaining Central Powers,\n6:19\nbecause this allowed the Allies to gain control\n6:23\nof Serbia and of Greece,\n6:26\nwhich essentially tied, removed the last source of food\n6:30\nfor Austria, Hungary and the German Empire.\n6:33\nThere was already a blockade,\n6:35\nthe kind of the harsh, British blockade\n6:37\nthat we've already talked about, up in the North Sea,\n6:39\nand so their last source of food was from the south,\n6:41\nbut now with Bulgaria signing an armistice,\n6:44\nand ceding over territory,\n6:46\nnow the strangle hold was really,\n6:49\nwas really, really coming into effect.\n6:52\nNow, by October, and remember,\n6:53\nat this point it was reasonably clear,\n6:56\nand even by this point, even clear to the German people\n6:59\nthat the war is pretty much done for,\n7:01\nand they're just waiting for their leaders\n7:03\nto make it official.\n7:06\nSo several of the leaders of the German Navy\n7:09\nwanted to do this last-ditch,\n7:11\nwhat could easily be considered suicidal,\n7:13\noffensive against the British Navy,\n7:16\nand as they're planning it and the sailors catch wind of it,\n7:19\nthey mutiny, they revolt.\n7:20\nThey say hey, look, the war is over.\n7:22\nWe're not gonna die in a futile attempt\n7:25\nto just kind of, for pride or whatever else,\n7:28\nand so you have a naval mutiny begins.\n7:31\nNaval mutiny, and eventually this spreads to the mainland\n7:35\nand leads to revolts and revolutions,\n7:38\nso revolution in Germany, in Germany.\n7:43\nAnd this culminates in November, in November,\n7:47\nNovember 9th, famous date in history,\n7:49\nNovember 9th, 1918.\n7:51\nYou essentially, Kaiser Wilhelm II,\n7:55\nright over here, let me make sure you see his picture,\n7:58\nthis is him right over here, Kaiser Wilhelm II,\n8:02\nis forced to abdicate, give up his throne.\n8:04\nHe flees to the Netherlands,\n8:07\nand on November 9th, 1918,\n8:09\nGermany is declared a republic.\n8:11\nSo Germany no longer has a king or emperor in charge.\n8:18\nGermany becomes a republic.\n8:22\nAnd a little bit before this, November 3rd,\n8:24\nthe writing was already clear to the Austrians,\n8:27\nin fact, they even, in 1917,\n8:29\nattempted to make some peace overtures,\n8:31\nthinking that they were pretty much done for,\n8:33\nbut by November 3rd, 1918,\n8:36\nthe Austrians also signed an armistice,\n8:39\narmistice, armistice,\n8:43\nwith the Austrians, with the Austrians,\n8:47\nand with the Kaiser Wilhelm II fleeing to the Netherlands,\n8:52\nGermany becoming a republic,\n8:54\nthis sets up the armistice, finally, with Germany\n8:58\non November 11th,\n9:00\nand this is one of the most famous dates in history,\n9:03\nknown for a long time in the US as Armistice Day,\n9:06\nand so it was November 11th, 1918,\n9:10\nand it was actually 11am, 11am,\n9:13\nso you might remember the famous,\n9:14\nthe 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month,\n9:18\nwar, or World War I, or the fighting in World War I,\n9:22\nwas over with the Allies victorious,\n9:25\nand the Central Powers losing it,\n9:27\nand the terms of what would happen for those that lost\n9:30\nand those that won would be dictated\n9:33\nby the Treaty of Versailles.\n9:34\nThe Treaty of Versailles in 1919.\n9:37\nThe terms of which

    "question_type": "open-ended",
    "source_material": "Currently I think there are eight intelligences\nthat I’m very confident about and a few\nmore that I’ve bene thinking about.\nI’ll share that with our audience.\nThe first two intelligences are the ones which\nIQ tests and other kind of standardized tests\nvalorize and as long as we know there are\nonly two out of eight it’s perfectly fine\nto look at them.\nLinguistic intelligence is how well you’re\nable to use language.\nIt’s a kind of skill that poets have, other\nkinds of writers, journalists tend to have\nlinguistic intelligence, orators.\nThe second intelligence is logical mathematical\nintelligence.\nAs the name implies logicians, mathematicians,\nscientists have that kind of intelligence.\nThey’re able to do mathematical proofs.\nThey’re able to do scientific reasoning\nand experimentation.\nAnd it’s great to have language and logical\nintelligence because most tests really focus\non that.\nAnd if you do well in those tests as long\nas you stay in school you think you’re smart.\nBut if you ever walk out into Broadway or\nthe highway or into the woods or into a farm\nyou then find out that other intelligences\nare at least this important.\nSo the third intelligence is musical intelligence\nand that’s the capacity to appreciate different\nkinds of musics, to produce the music by voice\nor by an instrument or to conduct music.\nAnd people say well music is a talent.\nIt’s not an intelligence.\nAnd I say well why if you’re good with words\nis that an intelligence but if you’re good\nwith tones and rhythms and timbres nobody’s\never given me a good answer which is why it\nmakes sense to talk about musical intelligence.\nAnd at certain cultures over history musical\nintelligence has been very important.\nThe fourth intelligence is spatial intelligence.\nThat’s the intelligence which allows us\nto handle and work in space that’s close\nby.\nA chess player would have spatial intelligence.\nA surgeon would have spatial intelligence.\nBut there’s another variety of spatial intelligence\nwhich we use for a much broader navigation.\nThat’s what an airplane pilot or a sea captain\nwould have.\nHow do you find your way around large territory\nand large space.\nSimilarly with the fifth intelligence bodily\nkinesthetic intelligence it comes in two flavors.\nOne flavor is the ability to use your whole\nbody to solve problems or to make things.\nAnd athletes and dancers would have that kind\nof bodily kinesthetic intelligence.\nBut another variety is being able to use your\nhands or other parts of your body to solve\nproblems or make things.\nA craft person would have bodily kinesthetic\nintelligence even if they weren’t particularly\na good athlete or dancer.\nThe sixth intelligence and seventh intelligence\nhave to do with human beings.\nInterpersonal intelligence is how you understand\nother people, how you motivate them, how you\nlead them, how you work with them, how you\ncooperate with them.\nAnybody at any workplace with other people\nneeds interpersonal intelligence.\nLeaders hopefully have a lot of interpersonal\nintelligence.\nBut any intelligence can be used in a pernicious\nway so the salesman that sells you something\nyou don’t want for a price you don’t want\nto pay, he or she has got interpersonal intelligence.\nIt’s just not being used in a way that we\nmight prefer.\nThe seventh kind of intelligence is difficult\nto assess but it’s very important.\nIt’s intrapersonal intelligence.\nIt’s the understanding yourself.\nIf we go back a way in history and prehistory\nknowledge of yourself probably wasn’t that\nimportant because people did what their parents\nor grandparents did whether they were hunters\nor fisherman or craftspeople.\nBut nowadays especially in developed society\npeople lead their own lives.\nWe follow our own careers.\nWe often switch careers.\nWe don’t necessarily live at home as we\nget older.\nAnd if you don’t have a good understanding\nof yourself you are in big trouble.\nSo that’s intrapersonal intelligence.\nThe eighth intelligence which I added some\nyears ago is the naturalist intelligence.\nAnd that’s the capacity to make important\nrelevant discriminations in the world of nature\nbetween one plant and another, between one\nanimal and another.\nIt’s the intelligence of the naturalist,\nthe intelligence of Charles Darwin.\nI missed it the first go around when I wrote\nabout it but I tried to atone by adding it\nto my list.\nAnd by the way you might say well but nature\nisn’t so important anymore.\nBut in fact everything we do in the commercial\nworld uses our naturalist intelligence.\nWhy do I buy this jacket rather than another\none?\nThis sweater rather than another one?\nOne hair style rather than another?\nThose all make just the naturalist intelligence\nbecause the brain is very adaptive.\nAnd when an old use of a brain center no longer\nis relevant it gets hijacked for something\nnew.\nSo we’re all using our naturalist intelligence\neven if we never walk out into the woods or\ninto the savannah of East Asia.\nThe two other intelligences which I’m interested\nin, one of them is called the teaching or\npedagogical intelligence.\nThe intelligence which allows us to be able\nto teach successfully to other people.\nNow you could have two people who have exactly\nthe same expertise and knowledge in the field\nbut one is a very good teacher and the other\nisn’t.\nThat probably doesn’t surprise individuals\nso much.\nBut what got me fascinated was as young as\ntwo or three kids already know how to teach.\nNow what does that mean?\nYou show a child how to do something let’s\nsay a three or four year old and then you\nask the child to explain it to an older person\nor to a younger person.\nAnd even the three or four year old will explain\nit very differently to a young person, will\ngo through details, point things and speak\nslowly.\nAnd with an older person it would be much\nmore elliptical and say well you do this and\nthat and then you can figure it out.\nSo that shows as young as three let’s say\nwe already have teaching intelligence.\nThe other one is one which I think is going\nto be difficult to prove to a skeptic but\nI call it existential intelligence.\nAnd existential intelligence is the intelligence\nof big questions.\nPhilosophical questions, artistic questions.\nWhat does it mean to love?\nWhy do we die?\nWhat’s going to be in the future?\nMy pet bird might have more musical intelligence.\nThe rats who are scurrying around the floor\nmight have more spatial intelligence.\nBut no other animals have existential intelligence.\nPart of the human condition is to think about\nquestions of existence.\nAnd I like to say every five year old has\nexistential intelligence because five year\nold are always asking why this, why that.\nBut the difference between a five year old\nand a philosopher is the five year old doesn’t\npay too much attention to the answer whereas\nphilosophers and other people who develop\nexistential intelligence are really very interested\nin how we attack questions like that.\nSo again where there’s eight intelligences\nor ten or twelve is less important to me than\nhaving broken the monopoly of a single intelligence\nwhich sort of labels you for all time.\nI think if we lived forever we could probably\ndevelop each intelligence to a very high degree.\nBut life is very short and if you devote too\nmuch attention to one intelligence you’re\nnot going to have much time to work on other\nkinds of intelligences.\nAnd so the big question is should you play\nto strength or should you bolster weakness?\nAnd that’s a value judgment.\nScientists cannot give you an answer to that.\nIf, for example, you want to be a jack of\nall trades and be very well rounded then probably\nyou’re going to want to nurture the intelligences\nwhich aren’t that strong.\nIf on the other hand you’re dead set on\nreally coming to the top of some particular\nheap then you’re probably going to find\nthe intelligences that you’re strongest\nat and really push those.\nAnd, you know, if a parent came to me and\nsaid well should we supplement or should we\naccentuate I would say well tell me what you\nwould like your child to do.\nOr better let the child tell you what he or\nshe wants to do rather than say well science\nsays you should do one or the other.\nI think it’s a question of values, not of\nscience.\nSome people think there’s such a thing as\nhumor intelligence.\nBut, in fact, I don’t.\nI think humor intelligence is simply the operation\nof a logical intelligence in some realm like\nhuman nature or physical nature or the workplace.\nAnd what happens is in humor there’s a certain\nexpectation and you flip that expectation\nso it’s logic but it’s logic that’s\nplayed out in different kinds of ways.\nPeople had mentioned there’s such a thing\nas a cooking intelligence, a humor intelligence\nand a sexual intelligence.\nAnd I quipped well that can’t be intelligences\nbecause I don’t have any of them.\n",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn this video, I want to talk about what is easily\n0:03\none of the most fundamental and profound concepts in statistics\n0:06\nand maybe in all of mathematics.\n0:08\nAnd that's the central limit theorem.\n0:16\nAnd what it tells us is we can start off\n0:18\nwith any distribution that has a well-defined mean and\n0:21\nvariance-- and if it has a well-defined variance,\n0:23\nit has a well-defined standard deviation.\n0:25\nAnd it could be a continuous distribution or a discrete one.\n0:27\nI'll draw a discrete one, just because it's easier\n0:29\nto imagine, at least for the purposes of this video.\n0:33\nSo let's say I have a discrete probability distribution\n0:36\nfunction.\n0:37\nAnd I want to be very careful not\n0:38\nto make it look anything close to a normal distribution.\n0:41\nBecause I want to show you the power of the central limit\n0:43\ntheorem.\n0:44\nSo let's say I have a distribution.\n0:45\nLet's say it could take on values 1 through 6.\n0:47\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n0:50\nIt's some kind of crazy dice.\n0:52\nIt's very likely to get a one.\n0:54\nLet's say it's impossible-- well,\n0:55\nlet me make that a straight line.\n0:56\nYou have a very high likelihood of getting a 1.\n0:58\nLet's say it's impossible to get a 2.\n1:00\nLet's say it's an OK likelihood of getting a 3 or a 4.\n1:03\nLet's say it's impossible to get a 5.\n1:04\nAnd let's say it's very likely to get a 6 like that.\n1:07\nSo that's my probability distribution function.\n1:10\nIf I were to draw a mean-- this the symmetric,\n1:12\nso maybe the mean would be something like that.\n1:14\nThe mean would be halfway.\n1:16\nSo that would be my mean right there.\n1:17\nThe standard deviation maybe would\n1:19\nlook-- it would be that far and that\n1:20\nfar above and below the mean.\n1:22\nBut that's my discrete probability distribution\n1:25\nfunction.\n1:26\nNow what I'm going to do here, instead of just taking\n1:28\nsamples of this random variable that's\n1:30\ndescribed by this probability distribution function,\n1:33\nI'm going to take samples of it.\n1:35\nBut I'm going to average the samples\n1:37\nand then look at those samples and see\n1:39\nthe frequency of the averages that I get.\n1:41\nAnd when I say average, I mean the mean.\n1:44\nLet me define something.\n1:45\nLet's say my sample size-- and I could put any number here.\n1:48\nBut let's say first off we try a sample size of n is equal to 4.\n1:57\nAnd what that means is I'm going to take four samples from this.\n2:00\nSo let's say the first time I take four samples--\n2:03\nso my sample sizes is four-- let's say I get a 1.\n2:05\nLet's say I get another 1.\n2:07\nAnd let's say I get a 3.\n2:09\nAnd I get a 6.\n2:10\nSo that right there is my first sample of sample size 4.\n2:14\nI know the terminology can get confusing.\n2:16\nBecause this is the sample that's made up of four samples.\n2:19\nBut then when we talk about the sample mean and the sampling\n2:23\ndistribution of the sample mean, which we're\n2:25\ngoing to talk more and more about over the next few videos,\n2:27\nnormally the sample refers to the set of samples\n2:32\nfrom your distribution.\n2:33\nAnd the sample size tells you how many you actually\n2:35\ntook from your distribution.\n2:37\nBut the terminology can be very confusing,\n2:39\nbecause you could easily view one of these as a sample.\n2:42\nBut we're taking four samples from here.\n2:44\nWe have a sample size of four.\n2:45\nAnd what I'm going to do is I'm going to average them.\n2:48\nSo let's say the mean-- I want to be very careful when\n2:50\nI say average.\n2:51\nThe mean of this first sample of size 4 is what?\n2:55\n1 plus 1 is 2.\n2:56\n2 plus 3 is 5.\n2:58\n5 plus 6 is 11.\n2:59\n11 divided by 4 is 2.75.\n3:06\nThat is my first sample mean for my first sample of size 4.\n3:11\nLet me do another one.\n3:12\nMy second sample of size 4, let's say that I get a 3, a 4.\n3:19\nLet's say I get another 3.\n3:20\nAnd let's say I get a 1.\n3:21\nI just didn't happen to get a 6 that time.\n3:23\nAnd notice I can't get a 2 or a 5.\n3:25\nIt's impossible for this distribution.\n3:27\nThe chance of getting a 2 or 5 is 0.\n3:28\nSo I can't have any 2s or 5s over here.\n3:31\nSo for the second sample of sample size 4,\n3:37\nmy second sample mean is going to be 3 plus 4 is 7.\n3:42\n7 plus 3 is 10 plus 1 is 11.\n3:46\n11 divided by 4, once again, is 2.75.\n3:49\nLet me do one more, because I really\n3:51\nwant to make it clear what we're doing here.\n3:53\nSo I do one more.\n3:53\nActually, we're going to do a gazillion more.\n3:55\nBut let me just do one more in detail.\n3:57\nSo let's say my third sample of sample size 4--\n4:01\nso I'm going to literally take 4 samples.\n4:03\nSo my sample is made up of 4 samples\n4:05\nfrom this original crazy distribution.\n4:08\nLet's say I get a 1, a 1, and a 6 and a 6.\n4:13\nAnd so my third sample mean is going to be 1 plus 1 is 2.\n4:18\n2 plus 6 is 8.\n4:20\n8 plus 6 is 14.\n4:21\n14 divided by 4 is 3 and 1/2.\n4:29\nAnd as I find each of these sample\n4:32\nmeans-- so for each of my samples of sample size 4,\n4:35\nI figure out a mean.\n4:36\nAnd as I do each of them, I'm going\n4:38\nto plot it on a frequency distribution.\n4:40\nAnd this is all going to amaze you in a few seconds.\n4:44\nSo I plot this all on a frequency distribution.\n4:46\nSo I say, OK, on my first sample,\n4:49\nmy first sample mean was 2.75.\n4:52\nSo I'm plotting the actual frequency of the sample\n4:54\nmeans I get for each sample.\n4:55\nSo 2.75, I got it one time.\n4:58\nSo I'll put a little plot there.\n4:59\nSo that's from that one right there.\n5:02\nAnd the next time, I also got a 2.75.\n5:04\nThat's a 2.75 there.\n5:06\nSo I got it twice.\n5:08\nSo I'll plot the frequency right there.\n5:10\nThen I got a 3 and 1/2.\n5:11\nSo all the possible values, I could have a three,\n5:13\nI could have a 3.25, I could have a 3 and 1/2.\n5:16\nSo then I have the 3 and 1/2, so I'll plot it right there.\n5:19\nAnd what I'm going to do is I'm going\n5:20\nto keep taking these samples.\n5:22\nMaybe I'll take 10,000 of them.\n5:25\nSo I'm going to keep taking these samples.\n5:27\nSo I go all the way to S 10,000.\n5:29\nI just do a bunch of these.\n5:31\nAnd what it's going to look like over time is each of these--\n5:33\nI'm going to make it a dot, because I'm\n5:35\ngoing to have to zoom out.\n5:37\nSo if I look at it like this, over time-- it still\n5:41\nhas all the values that it might be able to take on,\n5:43\n2.75 might be here.\n5:45\nSo this first dot is going to be-- this one\n5:48\nright here is going to be right there.\n5:50\nAnd that second one is going to be right there.\n5:52\nThen that one at 3.5 is going to look right there.\n5:56\nBut I'm going to do it 10,000 times.\n5:57\nBecause I'm going to have 10,000 dots.\n5:59\nAnd let's say as I do it, I'm going just keep plotting them.\n6:01\nI'm just going to keep plotting the frequencies.\n6:04\nI'm just going to keep plotting them\n6:05\nover and over and over again.\n6:08\nAnd what you're going to see is, as I take\n6:09\nmany, many samples of size 4, I'm\n6:12\ngoing to have something that's going\n6:14\nto start kind of approximating a normal distribution.\n6:18\nSo each of these dots represent an incidence of a sample mean.\n6:22\nSo as I keep adding on this column right here,\n6:24\nthat means I kept getting the sample mean 2.75.\n6:27\nSo over time.\n6:28\nI'm going to have something that's\n6:30\nstarting to approximate a normal distribution.\n6:32\nAnd that is a neat thing about the central limit theorem.\n6:39\nSo an orange, that's the case for n is equal to 4.\n6:42\nThis was a sample size of 4.\n6:45\nNow, if I did the same thing with a sample size of maybe\n6:48\n20-- so in this case, instead of just taking 4 samples\n6:51\nfrom my original crazy distribution, every sample\n6:55\nI take 20 instances of my random variable,\n6:58\nand I average those 20.\n7:00\nAnd then I plot the sample mean on here.\n7:02\nSo in that case, I'm going to have\n7:04\na distribution that looks like this.\n7:06\nAnd we'll discuss this in more videos.\n7:08\nBut it turns out if I were to plot 10,000 of the sample\n7:12\nmeans here, I'm going to have something\n7:14\nthat, two things-- it's going to even more closely approximate\n7:17\na normal distribution.\n7:18\nAnd we're going to see in future videos,\n7:20\nit's actually going to have a smaller-- well,\n7:22\nlet me be clear.\n7:23\nIt's going to have the same mean.\n7:25\nSo that's the mean.\n7:26\nThis is going to have the same mean.\n7:28\nSo it's going to have a smaller standard deviation.\n7:31\nWell, I should plot these from the bottom\n7:33\nbecause you kind of stack it.\n7:34\nOne you get one, then another instance and another instance.\n7:37\nBut this is going to more and more approach\n7:38\na normal distribution.\n7:40\nSo this is what's super cool about the central limit\n7:44\ntheorem.\n7:45\nAs your sample size becomes larger--\n7:53\nor you could even say as it approaches infinity.\n7:55\nBut you really don't have to get that close\n7:56\nto infinity to really get close to a normal distribution.\n7:58\nEven if you have a sample size of 10 or 20,\n8:01\nyou're already getting very close to a normal distribution,\n8:04\nin fact about as good an approximation\n8:06\nas we see in our everyday life.\n8:07\nBut what's cool is we can start with some crazy distribution.\n8:11\nThis has nothing to do with a normal distribution.\n8:15\nThis was n equals 4, but if we have a sample size of n\n8:17\nequals 10 or n equals 100, and we\n8:19\nwere to take 100 of these, instead of four here,\n8:22\nand average them and then plot that average,\n8:24\nthe frequency of it, then we take 100 again, average them,\n8:27\ntake the mean, plot that again, and if we\n8:28\ndo that a bunch of times, in fact,\n8:30\nif we were to do that an infinite time,\n8:32\nwe would find that we, especially\n8:33\nif we had an infinite sample size,\n8:35\nwe would find a perfect normal distribution.\n8:37\nThat's the crazy thing.\n8:39\nAnd it doesn't apply just to taking the sample mean.\n8:42\nHere we took the sample mean every time.\n8:44\nBut you could have also taken the sample sum.\n8:46\nThe central limit theorem would have still applied.\n8:48\nBut that's what's so super useful about it.\n8:51\nBecause in life, there's all sorts of processes out there,\n8:54\nproteins bumping into each other, people doing\n8:57\ncrazy things, humans interacting in weird ways.\n9:00\nAnd you don't know the probability distribution\n9:02\nfunctions for any of those things.\n9:04\nBut what the central limit theorem\n9:05\ntells us is if we add a bunch of those actions\n9:08\ntogether, assuming that they all have the same distribution,\n9:11\nor if we were to take the mean of all of those actions\n9:13\ntogether, and if we were to plot the frequency of those means,\n9:16\nwe do get a normal distribution.\n9:18\nAnd that's frankly why the normal distribution shows up\n9:22\nso much in statistics and why, frankly, it's\n9:25\na very good approximation for the sum\n9:28\nor the means of a lot of processes.\n9:31\nNormal distribution.\n9:33\nWhat I'm going to show you in the next video is I'm actually\n9:36\ngoing to show you that this is a reality, that as you increase\n9:39\nyour sample size, as you increase your n,\n9:41\nand as you take a lot of sample means,\n9:43\nyou're going to have a frequency plot that looks very, very\n9:45\nclose to a normal distribution.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Instructor] Okay, so we know that electrical charges\n0:02\ncreate electric fields in the region around them\n0:05\nbut people get confused by electric field problems\n0:07\nso you got to get good at at least two things here\n0:09\nif you wanna proficient at dealing with electrical field.\n0:13\nYou should get good at determining the direction\n0:16\nof the electric field that's created by a charge.\n0:19\nIf you've got some charge\n0:20\nand you wanna know which way does that charge\n0:22\ncreate an electric field,\n0:23\nyou should get really good at that.\n0:25\nAnd if you know the direction of the field,\n0:27\nyou should get good at finding the direction\n0:29\nof the electric force exerted on a charge.\n0:32\nIf there's some charge floating around\n0:34\nin an electric field,\n0:35\nyou should be able to say,\n0:36\noh, okay, I can determine the electric force.\n0:38\nNot too bad.\n0:39\nIf you get good at these two things,\n0:40\nthese problems are gonna be way easier\n0:42\nand the whole process is gonna make a lot more sense.\n0:45\nLet's figure out how to do this.\n0:46\nHow do you do these things?\n0:47\nWe'll do the first one first.\n0:48\nLet's try to tackle this one.\n0:49\nLet's try to figure out how do you determine\n0:51\nthe direction of the electric field\n0:52\nthat's created by a charge.\n0:54\nLet's say we didn't know, this is what the electric field\n0:56\nlook like around a positive charge.\n0:59\nI just gave this to you\n0:59\nbut how do we know that this is what the electric field's\n1:02\nsupposed to look like?\n1:03\nWhat we can do is this.\n1:04\nWe can say that we know the definition of electric field\n1:07\nis that it's the amount of electrical force\n1:10\nexerted per charge.\n1:12\nIn other words, if you took some test charge,\n1:14\nthink of this Q as the test charge\n1:16\nand we usually just make this a positive test charge\n1:19\nso this is easier to think about.\n1:20\nIf you took some positive test charge into some region\n1:23\nlet's do that, let's put some positive test charge in here.\n1:26\nWe take this test charge, we move it around.\n1:27\nAll we have to do to figure out\n1:29\nthe direction of the electric field,\n1:31\nsince this Q would be positive,\n1:32\nwe can just figure out what direction\n1:34\nis the electric force on that positive test charge.\n1:37\nIn other words, the direction of the electric field E\n1:40\nis gonna be the same direction as the electric force\n1:43\non a positive test charge.\n1:45\nBecause if you know about vector equations,\n1:47\nlook at this electric fields vector,\n1:49\nthis electric forces vector.\n1:50\nThis electric field is just gonna adopt\n1:52\nthe same direction as the electric force\n1:55\nas long as this Q is positive.\n1:56\nIf this Q were negative it would flip the sign\n1:59\nof this electric force\n2:00\nand then the E would point the opposite direction.\n2:02\nBut if we keep our test charge positive\n2:04\nthen we know, okay, the electric field's\n2:06\njust gonna point the same direction\n2:08\nas the electrical force on that positive test charge.\n2:11\nHere's what I mean.\n2:12\nWe take our positive test charge.\n2:14\nWe move it around.\n2:14\nIf I wanna know the electric field at this spot right here,\n2:17\nI just ask myself,\n2:19\nwhich way does the electrical force\n2:20\npoint on that test charge?\n2:22\nThe electric force would point to the right\n2:24\nsince it's being repelled\n2:26\nby this other positive charge over here.\n2:28\nI know that the electric force points to the right,\n2:30\nthese charges repel each other.\n2:32\nAnd since the electric force points to the right,\n2:33\nthat means the electric field in this region\n2:35\nalso points to the right.\n2:37\nIt might not have the same magnitude.\n2:39\nThe electric force might be 20 newtons\n2:41\nand the electric field might be 10 newtons per coulomb\n2:44\nbut they have the same direction.\n2:45\nAnd I can move this charge somewhere else,\n2:47\nlet's say I move it over here.\n2:48\nWhich way would the electric force point?\n2:50\nWell, these positive charges are still repelling.\n2:52\nI'd still have an electric force to the right.\n2:54\nThat electric force would be smaller\n2:56\nbut it would still point to the right\n2:57\nand that means the electric field\n2:59\nalso still points to the right,\n3:00\nit would be smaller as well\n3:02\nbut it would still point to the right.\n3:03\nAnd if we wanna determine the electric field elsewhere,\n3:05\nwe can move our positive test charge,\n3:06\nI'll move it over to here.\n3:08\nI'll ask which way is the electric force\n3:10\non this positive test charge?\n3:11\nThat would be in this direction\n3:13\nsince these positive charges are repelling each other,\n3:16\nthey're pushing each other away\n3:17\nso this positive always gets pushed away\n3:19\nfrom this other positive charge.\n3:21\nAnd so, that also means that the electric field\n3:23\nis pointing in that direction as well.\n3:25\nWe keep doing this.\n3:26\nI can move this somewhere else.\n3:27\nI can move this positive charge down here.\n3:29\nThe charges repel so the electric force\n3:30\nwould point downward.\n3:31\nAnd that means the electric field would also point down.\n3:34\nIf you keep doing this,\n3:35\nif you keep mapping what's the direction\n3:37\nof the electric force on a positive test charge?\n3:39\nEventually, you realize oh, it's always just gonna point\n3:42\nradially out away from this other positive charge.\n3:46\nAnd so we know the electric field\n3:47\nfrom a positive charge is just gonna point\n3:49\nradially outward, that's why we drew it like this.\n3:52\nBecause this positive charge would push\n3:54\nsome positive test charge radially away from it\n3:57\nsince it would be repelling it.\n3:59\nPositive charges create electric fields\n4:01\nthat point radially away from them.\n4:03\nNow what if the charge creating the field\n4:05\nwere a negative charge?\n4:07\nSo, let's try to figure that one out,\n4:08\nlet me get rid of this.\n4:09\nLet's say the charge creating the electric field\n4:11\nwere negative, a big negative charge,\n4:13\nhow do we determine the electric field\n4:14\ndirection around this negative charge?\n4:16\nWe're gonna do the same thing,\n4:17\nwe're gonna take our positive test charge\n4:19\nand we're gonna keep our test charge positive,\n4:21\nthat way we know that the direction\n4:24\nof the electric force on this positive test charge\n4:27\nis gonna be the same direction\n4:28\nas the electric field in that region.\n4:30\nIn other words, the positivity of this test charge\n4:33\nwill just make it so that the electric field\n4:34\nand electric force point in the same direction.\n4:37\nAnd if we do that, I'll move this around.\n4:38\nWe'll just put it at this point here,\n4:39\nwe'll move this test charge here.\n4:41\nWhich way is the force on that test charge?\n4:43\nThis time it's getting attracted to this negative charge.\n4:46\nOpposite charges attract\n4:47\nso the electric force would point this way\n4:49\nand since it's a positive test charge\n4:51\nand it preserve the direction in this equation,\n4:53\nthat means the electric field\n4:55\nalso points in that leftward direction.\n4:57\nAnd we can keep mapping the field\n4:58\nwe'll move the test charge over to here.\n5:00\nThe electric force this time is gonna point up\n5:02\nbecause this positive test charges\n5:03\nis attracted to this negative charge.\n5:05\nAnd if the electric force points up,\n5:07\nthat means the electric field also points up in that region.\n5:10\nAnd you'd realize the electric force\n5:12\nis always gonna pull a positive test charge\n5:15\ntoward this negative creating the field around it.\n5:17\nAnd because of that, the electric field\n5:19\ncreated by a negative charge points radially inward\n5:24\ntoward that negative charge.\n5:25\nThis is different.\n5:26\nPositive charge created a field that pointed\n5:28\nradially away from\n5:30\nbecause it always repelled the positive test charge.\n5:33\nBut a negative charge creates an electric field\n5:34\nthat points radially into\n5:37\nbecause it's always attracting a positive test charge.\n5:40\nBasically what I'm saying is\n5:41\nthat if we got rid of all these,\n5:42\nclean this up,\n5:43\nthe electric field from a positive charge\n5:44\npoints radially outward\n5:46\nbut if it were a negative charge,\n5:48\nyou'd have to erase all these arrowheads\n5:49\nand put them on the other end.\n5:51\nBecause the electric field from a negative charge\n5:53\npoints radially inward toward that negative charge.\n5:56\nIn other words, the electric field created by\n5:59\na negative charge at some point in space around it\n6:02\nis gonna point toward that negative charge\n6:04\ncreating that electric field.\n6:06\nAnd so, that's how you could determine\n6:07\nthe direction of the electric field created by a charge.\n6:09\nIf it's a positive charge you know\n6:11\nthe electric field points radially out from that positive.\n6:14\nAnd if it's a negative charge,\n6:16\nyou know the field points radially inward\n6:18\ntoward that negative charge.\n6:20\nOkay, so that was number one here.\n6:21\nWe found the direction\n6:23\nof the electric field created by a charge.\n6:25\nCheck, we've done this.\n6:26\nNow we should get good at finding\n6:28\nthe direction of the electric force\n6:29\nexerted on a charge in a field.\n6:32\nWhat does that mean?\n6:33\nLet's say you had a region of space\n6:34\nwith electric field pointing to the right.\n6:36\nWhat's creating this electric field?\n6:38\nI don't know.\n6:39\nIt doesn't even really matter.\n6:40\nThis is why the electric field is a cool idea.\n6:42\nI don't really need to know\n6:43\nwhat created this electric field.\n6:45\nI mean, it could be positive charges over here\n6:47\ncreating fields that point radially away from them.\n6:51\nBut it could also be negative charges over here\n6:53\ncreating fields that point radially toward them\n6:56\nor both, we don't really know.\n6:58\nIt doesn't really matter.\n6:58\nAs long as I now have an electric field\n7:00\nthat points to the right,\n7:01\nI can figure out the direction of the electric force\n7:03\non a charge in that field.\n7:05\nLet's put a charge in this field.\n7:06\nWe'll just start with a positive charge.\n7:08\nWe'll put this charge in here.\n7:09\nSince the electric field is equal to\n7:12\nthe electric force on a charge\n7:13\ndivided by that charge,\n7:15\nif this is a positive charge\n7:17\nand this charge we put down here is positive,\n7:20\nthen the electric force points in the same direction\n7:22\nas the electric field and vice versa.\n7:24\nThe electric field and electric force\n7:26\nwould point the same direction\n7:27\nif the charge feeling that force is a positive charge.\n7:30\nThis is just a long way of saying\n7:32\nthat the electric force on a positive charge\n7:34\nis gonna point in the same direction\n7:36\nas the electric field in that region.\n7:39\nIf there's an electric field that points to the right\n7:41\nlike we have in here\n7:42\nthen the electric force on a positive charge in that region\n7:45\nis also gonna point to the right.\n7:46\nAnd you might be thinking well,\n7:47\nduh, isn't that kind of obvious?\n7:49\nDoesn't this equation say\n7:50\nthat the electric force has to be\n7:52\nthe same direction as the electric field.\n7:54\nAlmost, not quite.\n7:55\nThere's one exception.\n7:56\nIf this charge in here were negative,\n7:59\nif you put a negative charge in here,\n8:00\nnow this force vector gets multiplied by a negative,\n8:04\nwell, divided by a negative but the same thing.\n8:06\nDividing by negative ones like multiplying by negative one.\n8:09\nYou would swap the direction of this force vector\n8:12\nand this electric field would point\n8:13\nthe opposite direction as the force\n8:15\non a negative charge in that region,\n8:17\nand that's confusing.\n8:18\nIn other words, check this out.\n8:19\nSay we took a negative charge in this region\n8:21\nand we wanted to know which way\n8:22\nwould the electric force be on this negative charge\n8:25\ndue to this electric field that points to the right.\n8:27\nWell, if the electric field points to the right\n8:29\nand this charge is negative,\n8:31\nthen the electric force has to point to the left.\n8:33\nAnd the reason is if this force vector is leftward\n8:36\nand we divide it by a negative sign,\n8:38\nthat's gonna take this force vector\n8:40\nand turn it from left to right.\n8:41\nThat means the electric field\n8:42\nwould be pointing to the right.\n8:44\nIf the charge experiencing the electric force is negative\n8:47\nbecause multiplying a vector by negative one\n8:49\nchanges its direction,\n8:51\nthe electric force and the electric field\n8:53\nare gonna have opposite directions.\n8:54\nA negative charge feels a force\n8:56\nin the opposite direction as the electric field\n8:59\nbut a positive charge feels a force\n9:01\nin the same direction as the electric field.\n9:03\nAnd I'll repeat that because it's important.\n9:05\nPositive charges experience an electric force\n9:08\nin the same direction as the electric field.\n9:11\nAnd negative charges experience an electric force\n9:14\nin the opposite direction as the electric field.\n9:17\nPeople mess this up all the time.\n9:18\nThis confuses people a lot\n9:20\nso here's a way that might make it seem a little simpler.\n9:23\nNotice that neither of these charges\n9:24\nare creating this electric field\n9:26\nthat's exerting the force on them\n9:28\nbut let's draw some possibilities\n9:29\nfor charges that might be creating this electric field.\n9:32\nOne way to create an electric field to the right\n9:34\nis by having a bunch of positive charges over here,\n9:37\ncreating electric fields that point radially away from them.\n9:41\nThat would create an electric field to the right.\n9:42\nAnd what would be the force on these charges then?\n9:45\nWell, we know positive charges repel other positive charges\n9:48\nso the electric forces to the right.\n9:50\nAnd positive charges attract negative charges\n9:52\nso the electric force would point to the left.\n9:54\nThis convention of electric forces pointing\n9:56\nin the same direction as the electric field\n9:59\nfor a positive charge\n10:00\nand electric forces pointing in the opposite direction\n10:02\nof the electric field for a negative charge\n10:04\nagrees with what we already know\n10:05\nabout opposites attracting and likes repelling.\n10:08\nIt's just that people get confused\n10:09\nwhen we don't draw these charges\n10:10\nthat are creating the electric field,\n10:12\nsometimes people forget how to find\n10:14\nthe direction of the force.\n10:15\nIf you want to, you can always draw them in there.\n10:17\nThe other possibility is that\n10:18\nto create fields to the right,\n10:20\nwe can put negative charges over here.\n10:22\nThese might be creating that electric field\n10:24\nbecause they'd create fields\n10:25\nthat point radially into them\n10:27\nbecause that's what negative charges do.\n10:29\nAnd which way will the forces be?\n10:30\nThese negatives would be attracting\n10:32\nthis positive to the right just like we said\n10:34\nin the same direction as the electric field.\n10:36\nWhether that electric field created by\n10:38\npositives or negatives, it doesn't matter.\n10:40\nIf the electric field points to the right,\n10:42\npositive charges feel the force to the right.\n10:44\nAnd then a negative charge in this region\n10:46\nwould be repelled by these negatives\n10:47\nor attracted by these positives\n10:49\nand it would feel a force to the left.\n10:51\nIt doesn't matter whether it was positives\n10:53\nor negatives creating the field.\n10:55\nIf the field points right,\n10:57\npositive charges are gonna feel a force\n10:59\nin that region to the right.\n11:00\nNegative charges are gonna feel a force\n11:01\nin that region to the left.\n11:03\nLet's do one more for practice.\n11:04\nLet's say you had this example.\n11:06\nLet's say you had a negative charge\n11:07\nand it was experiencing an electric force downward.\n11:10\nNow we wanna know what direction\n11:12\nis the electric field in this region?\n11:14\nWell, if the electric force\n11:15\non a negative charge is downward,\n11:17\nthe only way that happens is\n11:18\nfor there to be an electric field\n11:20\nin this region that points upward.\n11:22\nBecause negative charges are gonna feel\n11:23\nan electric force in the opposite direction\n11:26\nas the electric field.\n11:27\nThe direction of the E would be the opposite direction\n11:30\nas the direction of F\n11:31\nor it could just ask what charge would cause\n11:33\nan electric force downward on this negative charge?\n11:35\nA big positive charge down here would do it.\n11:37\nWell, positive charges create fields\n11:39\nthat point radially away from them.\n11:41\nSo in this region up here\n11:42\nit would have to point radially upward\n11:44\nsince that's a away from the positive charge.\n11:47\nOr you could say something else\n11:48\nthat would cause an electric force\n11:49\ndownward on this negative charge\n11:51\nwould be a big negative charge up here.\n11:53\nAnd negative charges always create fields\n11:55\nthat point radially into them.\n11:57\nWhat would the field be in this region down here,\n11:59\nit would still point upward\n12:01\nbecause upward would be radially in\n12:03\ntoward the negative charge creating that field.\n12:06\nRecapping, you can find the direction\n12:08\nof the electric field created by a charge\n12:10\nsince positive charges create fields\n12:12\nthat point radially away from them.\n12:14\nAnd negative charges create fields\n12:16\nthat point radially toward them.\n12:18\nAnd you can find the direction of\n12:19\nthe electric force on a charge\n12:21\nsince positive charges are gonna feel an electric force\n12:24\nin the same direction as the electric field in that region.\n12:27\nAnd negative charges are gonna feel an electric force\n12:29\nin the opposite direction\n12:31\nto the electric field in that region.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWe now know a little bit about inflation and deflation.\n0:03\nAnd now I want to introduce you to hyperinflation.\n0:07\nAnd as the word implies, it's inflation gone wild.\n0:13\nHow hyperinflation, or at least the cases\n0:15\nthat we've seen in modern times, how they've happened is you\n0:18\nhave some type of a government just going wild\n0:21\nwith the printing press.\n0:22\nThey're just printing a ton of money.\n0:24\nSo the general cycle is they print money,\n0:30\nthey print like mad, usually because they\n0:34\ndon't have any other way of getting revenue.\n0:37\nThey print like mad.\n0:39\nThat leads to prices going up.\n0:44\nAnd then because prices go up, they\n0:46\nhave to print more in order for them\n0:48\nto be able to get the same goods and services\n0:50\nor pay the government workers what they wanted\n0:52\nto pay the government workers, or pay the soldiers what\n0:55\nthey wanted to pay the soldiers.\n0:57\nThis by itself would probably drive the hyperinflation\n1:00\nin and of itself.\n1:02\nBut on top of this, we're used to thinking high inflation is\n1:06\n5% or 10%, but you could imagine what\n1:09\nhappens when inflation is 5% or 10% per hour.\n1:12\nBecause then there's no incentive\n1:14\nto be actually holding currency.\n1:16\nEvery second that you hold currency it\n1:18\nbecomes worth less and less and less.\n1:21\nAnd so what happens in a scenario like this is people\n1:23\nwant to hoard hard assets.\n1:25\nSo if the price of bread is going up by the minute\n1:28\nor by the hour, or the price of shoes\n1:30\nare going up by the minute or by the hour,\n1:33\nthe increase in prices is going to make people hoard things.\n1:40\nHoarding goes through the roof.\n1:43\nAnd you can imagine if hoarding goes through the roof,\n1:45\nif the shoe seller doesn't want to sell his shoes anymore,\n1:48\nor he wants the hold them a little bit longer,\n1:50\nthen the supply of shoes are going to go down,\n1:52\nand the prices are going to go up even higher.\n1:54\nSo hoarding leads even to higher prices.\n1:58\nWhen people go to the bread market,\n1:59\nand there's five loaves of bread, they buy all of them.\n2:02\nAnd then the next person can't buy any\n2:03\nbecause they know that the price of bread\n2:04\nis going through the roof.\n2:06\nSo it just keeps getting worse and worse.\n2:09\nAnd it's all started by the government just\n2:11\ngoing nuts with the printing press.\n2:14\nNow, the three most famous examples\n2:17\nof this happening-- probably the most famous one\n2:19\nis what happened in Weimar Germany\n2:22\nafter World War I. They had huge reparations to pay.\n2:26\nThat's what the Weimar government\n2:28\nwould have argued was their main cause.\n2:30\nBut they just printed money like crazy.\n2:32\nSome people said that they were almost\n2:34\ntrying to destroy the economy so that they wouldn't have\n2:36\nto pay reparations for what they did in World War I.\n2:40\nBut this just gives you a sense of how crazy it was.\n2:43\nHere's the end of World War I. And they just\n2:46\nprinted money like mad.\n2:50\nAnd isn't the rate of inflation.\n2:52\nThis is how much it was relative to a gold mark.\n2:56\nSo this is one gold mark over here.\n2:58\nSo only after about 2 and a half years it was over tenfold.\n3:02\nAnd this is a logarithmic scale.\n3:04\nEach slash year, this is a factor of 10.\n3:07\nSo after by the end of 1923, you're\n3:09\nlooking at-- This is what?\n3:10\nNot 100,000, not a million, not a billion.\n3:15\nThis is a trillion.\n3:16\nIt had gone up a trillion fold in the span of one, two, three,\n3:20\nfour, five, six years.\n3:23\nThe other famous examples of this,\n3:26\nZimbabwe from 1980 until 2009.\n3:29\nOnce again, printing money like mad.\n3:31\nAnd some of their productive capacity went away.\n3:34\nThis right here is a 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollar.\n3:39\nAnd this shows you the Zimbabwean dollar\n3:43\nrelative to the US dollar.\n3:44\nAnd once again, is a logarithmic scale.\n3:46\nThis is 10 to the 30th power.\n3:48\nAnd then the largest or the most extreme hyperinflation\n3:52\never was Hungary after World War II.\n3:55\nAnd this right here is a 10 million\n3:57\npengo note, just to give you an idea of what people\n3:59\nwere carrying around in their pockets.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nEntering into World War I, the British\n0:02\nhad the world's dominant navy.\n0:04\nAnd they use it immediately to their advantage.\n0:06\nYou might remember from previous videos,\n0:09\nBritain declared war on Germany because of their invasion\n0:12\ninto Belgium in early August of 1914.\n0:15\nAnd it was in November of 1914 that the British declared\n0:23\nthe entire North Sea area a war zone.\n0:31\nWhich essentially is telling any ship, come here\n0:34\nat your own risk.\n0:34\nYou might be destroyed, and especially you're\n0:36\nnot allowed to carry any contraband.\n0:38\nBut they included food as a contraband.\n0:41\nSo this essentially began the blockade\n0:43\nof Germany and Austria-Hungary.\n0:45\nSo this is the blockade of the Central Powers.\n0:53\nAnd this had major implications for the war.\n0:56\nIt continued throughout the entire war.\n0:59\nIt essentially caused the Germans, or the Central Powers,\n1:01\nespecially the Germans and the Austrians\n1:04\nto have to ration food.\n1:05\nWe're talking about 1,000 calories a day.\n1:08\nYou could look at the number of calories in your average Big\n1:11\nMac and think about how little food that was.\n1:13\nAnd there's many estimates of what that caused.\n1:15\nThat obviously made it hard for the Central Powers\n1:18\nto get war munitions and things like that.\n1:20\nBut it also made it very difficult for them to get food.\n1:22\nAnd there are estimates that this rationing, this inability\n1:26\nto get food, lead to malnutrition, even led\n1:29\nto starvation.\n1:30\nAnd there's estimates that this might\n1:32\nhave led to in excess of 400,000 civilian deaths\n1:39\neither directly or indirectly due to malnutrition\n1:41\nor starvation amongst the Central Powers.\n1:48\nSo this was a pretty serious tactic that was undertaken.\n1:52\nNow, the Germans did not have as dominant of a Navy.\n1:56\nMost of their Navy was actually focused right off\n1:58\nof the coast of Germany, right around there, in the North Sea.\n2:02\nBut they also wanted to disrupt trade with the British.\n2:05\nThey recognized the British Isles, they're islands.\n2:08\nThey're dependent on trade for food and for supplies.\n2:12\nSo in 1915 in February, the Germans declared the seas\n2:19\naround the British Isles, they declared this whole area,\n2:22\na war zone.\n2:32\nSimilarly, they declared that a war zone as well.\n2:38\nAnd because their surface fleet was concentrated\n2:40\nright over here, the way that they\n2:41\nwould enforce that, they would essentially\n2:43\ntry to keep people from trading with the British Isles\n2:48\nis through submarine warfare.\n2:50\nAnd World War I is the first time\n2:52\nthat submarine warfare becomes a significant factor.\n2:54\nWe're talking about very primitive submarines.\n2:56\nBut we are talking about these vessels that\n2:58\ncould go underwater and essentially\n3:00\nsend torpedoes into boats.\n3:02\nNow, thinking about that as a backdrop,\n3:06\nwe now forward to May of 1915.\n3:09\nSo let's go to May of 1915.\n3:14\nYou have the passenger liner, the RMS Lusitania.\n3:18\nAnd RMS literally stands for Royal Mail Ship\n3:20\nbecause it carried some mail.\n3:22\nIt's a big ship.\n3:23\nIf you've ever seen the movie Titanic,\n3:24\nthink of a ship like that.\n3:26\nAnd it was setting sail from New York to Liverpool, England.\n3:32\nAnd it was apparently a passenger ship,\n3:35\nbut it was also carrying cargo.\n3:37\nBut the Germans, they said, look,\n3:39\nthis could be fair game for us, especially if it's\n3:41\ncarrying munitions, especially if it's a British ship.\n3:44\nAnd in the advertisement that was\n3:46\nin New York for the Lusitania that\n3:48\nwas going to leave on May 1, 1915,\n3:58\nthe German embassy actually placed an advertisement.\n4:01\nAnd this is worth reading.\n4:03\nThey wrote, \"Notice, travelers intending\n4:06\nto embark on the Atlantic voyage are\n4:08\nreminded that a state of war exists\n4:10\nbetween Germany and her allies and Great\n4:14\nBritain and her allies.\n4:15\nThat the zone of war includes the water\n4:18\nadjacent to the British Isles.\n4:20\nThat in accordance with formal notice given\n4:23\nby the Imperial German government, vessels flying\n4:26\nthe flag of Great Britain, or any of her allies,\n4:30\nare liable to destruction in those waters.\n4:34\nAnd that travelers sailing in the war zone\n4:36\non ships of Great Britain or her allies do so at their own risk.\n4:41\nFrom the Imperial German embassy.\"\n4:43\nAnd this is dated April 1915.\n4:47\nSo that's the backdrop.\n4:49\nThe Lusitania sets sail May 1, 1915.\n4:56\nOn May 7, 1915-- the number 15 keeps\n4:59\njumping into my brain-- on May 7, 1915,\n5:06\nit's almost reached its destination of Liverpool.\n5:09\nThat's Liverpool right over here.\n5:13\nIt's around 10 or 15 miles off the coast of Ireland.\n5:17\nAnd right there it encounters a German U boat.\n5:21\nSo this right over here is a German U boat.\n5:24\nAnd that German U boat sends a torpedo into the Lusitania.\n5:29\nNow the torpedo, as you could imagine, rams into the ship.\n5:32\nAnd then shortly after the torpedo hits,\n5:34\nyou have this huge explosion.\n5:35\nAnd the huge explosion is actually\n5:37\none of those question marks of history.\n5:40\nNow, the ship goes down, taking down with it\n5:43\nmost of its passengers.\n5:45\nSo there were 1,959 total passengers and crew.\n5:55\nAnd 1,195 of them actually died.\n5:59\nNow there were other ships that went down due to German U\n6:03\nboats, but what was famous about this one,\n6:06\nat least from an American history point of view,\n6:08\nis that there were 128 Americans who also died on board.\n6:15\nAnd so you could imagine, this led to a lot of people\n6:20\nwere concerned on the American side.\n6:22\nWhy did this happen?\n6:23\nThese were American civilians.\n6:25\nAnd it essentially led to a harsh reprimand\n6:28\nfrom Woodrow Wilson.\n6:30\nAnd just as a little bit of context, once war broke out--\n6:33\nand war had broken not even a year\n6:35\nbefore the sinking of the Lusitania--\n6:37\nthe Americans' position was to be neutral.\n6:40\nIt did not want to enter into this European conflict.\n6:43\nWith that said, the Americans were disproportionately\n6:47\ntrading with the Allies not the Central Power.\n6:50\nThey were providing supplies, at a minimum, at a trading level.\n6:56\nAnd they were providing monetary support.\n6:58\nThey were providing loans to the Allies disproportional\n7:02\nto the Central Powers.\n7:03\nSo even though there was this formal neutrality,\n7:09\nthere was more implicit connection to the Allies.\n7:13\nSo Woodrow Wilson, he still wants to keep America out\n7:16\nof the war at this point.\n7:18\nSo we're talking about May 1915.\n7:20\nAnd so he essentially just sends a stern warning\n7:23\nto the German empire.\n7:25\nSays, you must apologize.\n7:27\nYou must take action to prevent this type of thing\n7:30\nhappening in the future.\n7:32\nAnd the German empire actually complies.\n7:34\nOn September 9-- let me write this on the timeline.\n7:40\nSo right over here.\n7:41\nSo in May, you have the Lusitania sunk.\n7:48\nAnd then in September, the Germans\n7:54\nagree to not attack passenger ships.\n8:08\nAnd so even though the sinking of the Lusitania,\n8:11\nespecially in a lot of American history classes,\n8:13\nis often given as a trigger for America entrance into war,\n8:17\nthis whole thing happened and America stayed neutral\n8:20\nthroughout this entire period.\n8:21\nAnd America wouldn't actually enter the war until April 1917.\n8:26\nSo the Lusitania was just one of many things\n8:28\nthat happened in the years running up to the war.\n8:31\nAnd if we fast forward a little bit,\n8:32\nin 1916 the next presidential election where Wilson\n8:36\nwon re-election, he ran on a platform of,\n8:39\nhe kept us out of war.\n8:48\nSo the sinking of the Lusitania was a significant event.\n8:51\nOne could argue because the Germans did not\n8:54\nwant the US to enter on the side of the Allies,\n8:57\nit was why the Germans agreed to loosen up,\n8:59\nat least for a couple of years, on their U boat campaigns.\n9:03\nAs we'll see, once we get into 1917, the Germans,\n9:06\nout of desperation, start to become\n9:07\nmore aggressive on their U boat attacks\n9:09\nagain, which is one of the catalysts\n9:11\nthat the US claims drove them into World War I.\n9:18\nBut with that said, just as a little bit\n9:20\nof context-- and oftentimes when we look back at history,\n9:23\nit seems very cut and dry.\n9:25\nIt seems obvious.\n9:25\nOh yes, we had to go to war, et cetera, et cetera.\n9:29\nI have a few quotes here from William Jennings Bryan,\n9:34\nwho was Woodrow Wilson's secretary of state.\n9:36\nAnd a few of these are pretty telling.\n9:40\nSo this first one is September 1914.\n9:42\nThis was before any of the stuff happened with Lusitania,\n9:44\nbut war had broken out in Europe.\n9:47\nAnd he had this message that he wrote\n9:49\nto Woodrow Wilson to essentially advocate\n9:51\nwhy we should stay out of the war\n9:53\nand why there should be some type of mediation\n9:55\nto try to get the war to end as opposed\n9:57\nto just letting it run its course.\n9:58\nAnd he wrote to Wilson, \"it is not likely\n10:01\nthat either side will win so complete a victory as\n10:04\nto be able to dictate terms.\n10:06\nAnd if either\"-- and this is interesting and strangely\n10:11\nforeshadowing-- \"and if either side does win such a victory,\n10:16\nit'll probably mean preparation for another war.\n10:19\nIt would seem better to look for a more rational basis\n10:24\nfor peace.\"\n10:25\nNow, the other quotes here-- and this is the question mark\n10:29\naround that second explosion-- William Jennings Bryan wrote,\n10:34\n\"ships carrying contraband should be prohibited\n10:36\nfrom carrying passengers.\n10:37\nIt would be like putting women and children\n10:39\nin front of an army.\"\n10:41\nAnd so this is one of those big questions of history.\n10:43\nIt was known that the Lusitania was carrying light ammunition.\n10:49\nSo it was carrying a light munitions.\n10:54\nNow, the Germans claimed that it was actually\n10:56\ncarrying heavy munitions.\n10:57\nAnd to some degree, that second explosion\n10:59\ntends to back that up.\n11:00\nAnd there was all sorts of shady things about a lot of the cargo\n11:03\nthat the Lusitania was carrying, even though they claimed\n11:06\nthat it was these perishable goods.\n11:07\nIt wasn't being stored in a refrigerated part of the ship.\n11:11\nAnd so there was reason to believe\n11:13\nthat it was carrying actually heavy munitions.\n11:16\nAnd that second explosion seems to point in that direction\n11:21\nas well.\n11:21\nAnd then even after World War I, the British Navy actually\n11:25\nspent multiple times trying to destroy\n11:27\nthe wreck of the Lusitania.\n11:29\nAnd some people say in order to maybe get rid of some evidence\n11:33\nthat it was actually carrying far more munitions\n11:35\nand maybe was, from the Germans' point of view,\n11:38\na fairer target than was actually made out.\n11:43\nSo regardless, it's a very interesting incident,\n11:45\nnot necessarily directly tied to America's entrance\n11:50\ninto World War I. But it is one of many events.\n11:53\nAnd this whole idea of blockades and German U boats\n11:56\nagainst civilians, this was something\n11:58\nthat was a cause of repeated concern for the Americans.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nThe word inequality, by its very nature,\n0:02\nat least sounds, sounds a little bit unfair.\n0:06\nObviously, everyone's not getting the same thing.\n0:09\nThey're not getting the same income,\n0:10\nor they don't have the same wealth,\n0:12\nbut a question needs to be asked is,\n0:14\nis this necessarily a bad thing,\n0:17\nand even if it is a bad thing,\n0:19\nare the ways of fixing it or trying to address it,\n0:23\ncould they make matters worse in some way,\n0:25\nespecially for the people that you're trying to help?\n0:28\nAnd, once again, my goal here is to not tell you\n0:30\none way or the other, but to at least give you\n0:32\nframeworks for thinking about this.\n0:34\nSo, let's just think about a world where we have\n0:38\nkind of a fixed-pie economy, and there,\n0:40\nincreasing inequality is clearly not doing good\n0:43\nfor the people who have less resources.\n0:48\nSo, let's imagine a fixed-pie economy.\n0:50\nSo, let's say this rectangle right over here\n0:55\nrepresents the total national income in a given period.\n1:01\nSo, year one, this is the total national income,\n1:05\ntotal national income, and let's say that in year one\n1:12\nthe top 10 percent of earners, the top 10 percent\n1:17\nof earners, make a third of the national income,\n1:21\nso, they make a third of the national income.\n1:24\nThis is the top 10 percent.\n1:26\nNow, let me be very clear.\n1:27\nThis area right over here is not 10 % of the whole rectangle.\n1:31\nThis is 35 percent, or actually this is a third,\n1:36\nso, this is going to be 33.\n1:38\nThis is one-third of the entire rectangle,\n1:41\nbut it's the income from the top 10 percent.\n1:45\nIncome from the top 10 percent.\n1:49\nNow, that would mean that the other 90 percent,\n1:52\nother 90 percent, is essentially splitting the remaining\n1:58\ntwo-thirds of national income between them.\n2:01\nSo, if you take this reality, and if the total pie,\n2:05\nso, let's do a static pie right over here,\n2:09\nso pie stays the same, so pie, and when I say pie,\n2:14\nI'm talking about this square thing here.\n2:15\nI guess it doesn't look too much like a pie,\n2:17\nso maybe I don't call it a pie.\n2:19\nSo, national income static.\n2:22\nSo, it's not changing right over here.\n2:24\nSo, then you have, let me try to draw\n2:26\na rectangle of the same size, of the same size,\n2:32\nand if you have increasing inequality in this situation,\n2:37\nthen you might have the top 10 percent of earners by,\n2:39\nlet's just say this is year 10, year 10 right over here,\n2:45\nmaybe instead of having one-third of the national income,\n2:47\nmaybe they have 50 percent of the national income,\n2:50\nand I'm just picking round numbers for simplicity.\n2:53\nSo, this right over here is one-half of\n2:55\nnational income now from the top 10 percent.\n2:58\nFrom the top 10 percent.\n3:03\nSo, clearly, if this happens, the other 90 percent\n3:06\nare now splitting only one-half of the national income.\n3:10\nSo, this is the other 90 percent right over here.\n3:15\nSo, here it's essentially a zero-sum game.\n3:17\nIf you had a static economy, if it was not growing at all,\n3:21\nthen, of course, rising inequality would mean\n3:24\nthat these people, right over, the other 90 percent,\n3:27\nare going to have lower per capita,\n3:30\nI guess you could say income, lower per capita GDP.\n3:34\nThey're going to have a lower standard of living.\n3:36\nSo, they're not doing good in this situation.\n3:39\nBut, let's think of the other way,\n3:40\nof where you do have economic growth,\n3:42\nand economic growth that's enough so even if you have\n3:46\nsome inequality, the growth more than offsets that,\n3:51\nso that these, the other 90 percent, is still better off.\n3:55\nSo, let's see if we can visualize that.\n3:56\nSo, economic growth, economic growth,\n4:06\nand let's say your pie has grown dramatically\n4:09\nover 10 years, and I'm just, maybe I'm exaggerating\n4:12\na little bit for the sake of discussion.\n4:15\nSo, let me draw it like this.\n4:17\nSo, I'll try to do about the same height,\n4:19\nbut now, our whole economy, let's say our whole economy\n4:24\nhas doubled, our whole economy has doubled here,\n4:30\nand now in this situation, let's say you still have\n4:33\nthis wealth inequality growing.\n4:35\nSo, the top 10 percent in year one\n4:37\nhaving one-third of national income.\n4:39\nLet's say that it still goes to one-half of national income\n4:42\nin year 10, so one-half of national income.\n4:47\nSo, I can draw that a little bit neater.\n4:49\nSo, half of national income right over there,\n4:54\nhalf of national income, so one-half of national income.\n4:58\nSo, this is still a situation where you've had\n5:00\ninequality increase, but the half of national income\n5:06\nthat's going to have to be split between the other\n5:09\n90 percent has still grown fairly dramatically,\n5:14\nif we assume that I've drawn it\n5:15\npretty close to proportional.\n5:18\nSo, let me just copy and paste this.\n5:19\nSo, copy and paste.\n5:23\nSo, this is how much was being split\n5:25\namongst the other 90 percent in year one,\n5:28\nand notice, it's much smaller than how much\n5:31\nis being split by the other 90 percent,\n5:33\nand actually, let me put it right over here,\n5:35\nthan the other 90 percent in year 10,\n5:38\nand if we assume that the population\n5:40\nhasn't grown by this amount, it's grown by\n5:42\nsomething smaller than this, or maybe the population\n5:44\nhas been relatively stable, then your per capita,\n5:47\nyour per capita GDP, your per capita income\n5:50\nis actually going to improve.\n5:52\nSo, this is a situation here where even though inequality\n5:56\nhas increased, because the pie has gotten bigger,\n6:00\nthese people are better off.\n6:02\nThese people are better off, and so, that leads to\n6:07\nreally one of the fundamental questions,\n6:10\nespecially when you're thinking about economic systems,\n6:12\nis that you have this market system,\n6:15\nthis capitalist system, this market economy,\n6:21\na market economy, and at least in the recent history,\n6:25\nit's shown us that, hey, this leads to growth,\n6:28\nwealth creation, so pie, so economic growth,\n6:32\neconomic growth, but it also leads to inequality.\n6:39\nIt also leads to Inequality.\n6:42\nInequality is an inevitable by-product.\n6:45\nInequality.\n6:47\nNow, the question you might have to ask is,\n6:49\nwell, look, is this necessarily bad?\n6:51\nIf this economic growth is enough, everyone is better off.\n6:55\nIt doesn't matter if some people are even more better off\n6:57\nthan other people, but everyone is better off,\n6:59\nand it's important to think about if you try to\n7:03\njust focus on inequality, just focus on inequality,\n7:07\nare you also going to stop this from happening?\n7:09\nAnother way of thinking about it, if you're one of\n7:11\nthe people in this situation right over here,\n7:15\nyou're the other 90 percent, would you rather\n7:17\nstay in this world, where you're in a static pie\n7:20\nand inequality is not increasing,\n7:22\nor would you rather go to this world right over here?\n7:26\nNow, once again, the point of my video isn't to say\n7:29\nthat this world is necessarily going to happen.\n7:31\nThere could be a world where your\n7:33\ntotal economic growth was less than this,\n7:35\nand the pie got bigger, and these people are not\n7:37\nas well off, but the whole point of this is just to highlight\n7:41\nthat inequality is not necessarily always going to lead\n7:44\nto the people, I guess who are getting less of the pie,\n7:49\nbeing worse off, if the pie grows fast enough,\n7:52\nand the other thing to realize is, well,\n7:55\nsometimes, in an attempt to lessen inequality,\n7:59\nyou might also stifle economic growth,\n8:02\nand that might keep everyone from being better off\n8:05\nin this scenario right over here.\n8:06\nSo, once again, it really depends on the context,\n8:09\nit really depends on the situation and the variables\n8:11\nand the numbers you're looking at,\n8:13\nbut I just really want to emphasize that\n8:15\nthere's no such thing as, hey, if there's rising inequality\n8:17\nit's going to hurt always the other 90 percent.\n8:20\nIt'll definitely benefit the people who are maybe\n8:23\nin the top 10 percent, but it also,\n8:25\nbecause that's a by-product of economic growth,\n8:27\nit might make these people better off as well.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nVoiceover: Let's think about the market for real estate\n0:03\nin a given city.\n0:04\nHere on the vertical axis\n0:05\nI have plotted rent in terms of dollars\n0:07\nper square foot per month.\n0:09\nHere on the horizontal axis,\n0:10\nis essentially the quantity of square foot\n0:13\nsquare foot per month available in millions.\n0:16\nThis is 1 million, 2 million, 3 million,\n0:18\n4 million, 5 million.\n0:20\nHere in blue we have the demand curve.\n0:23\nYou see as the price is high,\n0:28\none way to view it is that the demand\n0:30\nfor square footage is low and as the price\n0:33\nis low the demand for square footage is higher.\n0:35\nBut what I really want to focus on in this video,\n0:37\nis viewing the demand curve as the\n0:39\nmarginal benefit curve.\n0:41\nMarginal benefit curve.\n0:43\nWhen that first incremental square foot\n0:47\nthat is added to the market,\n0:49\nthat has a huge marginal benefit\n0:51\nwhere people are desperate to get an apartment.\n0:54\nTo get someplace where they could rent and they could live.\n0:57\nSo it has a huge marginal benefit.\n1:00\nThen the marginal benefit for every\n1:01\nincremental square foot starts to go down.\n1:06\nLikewise, we can look at the supply curve.\n1:08\nWe're going to look at this as the\n1:09\nmarginal cost curve.\n1:11\nThe marginal cost curve.\n1:13\nThe marginal cost of that very first\n1:16\nincremental square foot for the suppliers\n1:19\nfor the landlords in the city is $1\n1:21\nper square foot.\n1:22\nOne way to think about it,\n1:24\nthat very first square foot,\n1:25\nwe don't know what its price would have been,\n1:27\nbut let's say its price was at $3 if it was.\n1:31\nI'm just making that up.\n1:33\nIn that reality,\n1:34\nif that very first square foot's price was at $3,\n1:36\nthere is definitely an incentive for someone\n1:39\nto make that first square foot\n1:42\nbecause their marginal cost is only\n1:43\na dollar and they could rent it out at $3 per month.\n1:47\nThere is definitely an incentive for someone to rent it.\n1:51\nThe marginal benefit is $4 and they just have\n1:54\nto pay $3 for it.\n1:56\nIt could be rented out for anywhere\n1:58\nor it would exist,\n1:59\nor this kind of transaction would happen\n2:01\nas long as its price was between $1 and $4.\n2:06\nYou could imagine, based on how this is drawn,\n2:08\nwhere the actual equilibrium price is.\n2:10\nThe suppliers will keep adding more and more\n2:14\nsquare foot as long as they can actually rent it out,\n2:17\nall the way until the point that the marginal\n2:20\nbenefit is equal to the marginal cost.\n2:23\nRight over here marginal benefit is equal\n2:25\nto marginal cost.\n2:27\nIt wouldn't make sense for suppliers\n2:29\nto produce an incremental square foot right over here.\n2:32\nIf they produce an incremental square foot,\n2:33\ntheir marginal cost has gone beyond $3,\n2:37\nwhile the marginal benefit is below $3,\n2:39\nno one is going to rent that thing out.\n2:42\nWe reach an equilibrium point at 2 million\n2:49\nsquare feet per month on the market.\n2:51\nLet me make that line a little bit straighter.\n2:53\n2 million square foot per month on the market\n2:55\nand at a price of $3 per square foot per month.\n3:03\nYou can look at the total surplus here.\n3:05\nIn this equilibrium scenario,\n3:07\nwe can calculate the consumer surplus.\n3:10\nSo all of these folks,\n3:12\nfor this first incremental foot,\n3:15\nsomeone was willing to pay $4 per square foot.\n3:17\nThey only have to pay $3.\n3:18\nThe next one a little less than $4.\n3:20\nBenefit they only have to pay $3.\n3:21\nAll the way to this point right over here.\n3:23\nSo the area of this triangle right over here,\n3:27\nthis right over here is the consumer surplus.\n3:30\nSo that right over here is consumer surplus.\n3:33\nConsumer surplus.\n3:37\nWe can calculate it.\n3:38\nThis is a triangle.\n3:40\nI'm assuming actually both the supply and demand curves are lines.\n3:42\nSo let's see this has a height of 1\n3:44\nand it has a base of 2 so its area is going to be\n3:48\n1 times 2 times one-half.\n3:51\nThat is going to be equal to 1 million dollars.\n3:58\nWe are multiplying $1 times 2 million\n4:02\ntimes one-half.\n4:04\nThat's going to be 1 million dollars\n4:07\nof consumer surplus per month.\n4:09\nLet's think about the producer surplus.\n4:11\nThe producer surplus is going to be this area.\n4:14\nIt's going to be this area right over here.\n4:17\nThat first incremental foot it only cost\n4:19\nthose producers $1 but they are able\n4:21\nto rent it out for $3.\n4:25\nThen they will keep producing,\n4:27\nkeep producing all the way until they\n4:28\ndo 2 million square foot.\n4:30\nFor all of their square feet,\n4:32\nthey are able to rent it out for more\n4:34\nthan it was their cost to produce it.\n4:35\nSo the area of this triangle is the producer surplus.\n4:40\nThis is the producer surplus.\n4:44\nProducer surplus.\n4:49\nWe can calculate that as well.\n4:51\nThe height right over here is $2.\n4:54\n$2 times this width is 2 million square feet per month.\n4:59\n2 times 2 times one-half is 2.\n5:02\nThis is equal to 2 million dollars.\n5:06\nIf we were to talk about what the total surplus is,\n5:08\nit is 3 million dollars.\n5:14\nNow, this equilibrium rent,\n5:16\n$3 per square foot per month is actually quite a lot\n5:18\nfor 1,000 square foot apartment.\n5:21\nMy last apartment was a two bedroom,\n5:23\ntwo bath apartment.\n5:24\nIt was about 1,000 square foot.\n5:26\nSo that means you're going to be paying $3,000\n5:27\nper month for that.\n5:29\nThat's pretty high rent.\n5:30\nThat's the type of rent you might pay\n5:31\nin a city like San Francisco.\n5:34\nLet's say people start complaining about it.\n5:36\nSo the government says, \"Okay that rent is not fair.\n5:38\n\"It's too high.\n5:39\n\"We want to introduce some type of price control.\n5:43\n\"We want to introduce rent control.\"\n5:47\nI'm oversimplifying how this works,\n5:50\nbut just so that we can deal with this model right over here,\n5:53\nLet's say that the city just sets a ceiling\n5:56\non the price per square foot per month.\n6:00\nLet's just say they set a price ceiling,\n6:02\na price ceiling of $2 per square foot per month.\n6:09\n$2 per square foot.\n6:12\nLet me write it this way.\n6:14\n$2 per square foot per month.\n6:21\nSo they set a price ceiling right over here.\n6:26\nGiven that, what is going to happen?\n6:29\nWhat is going to happen?\n6:32\nWhat I really want to think about is what\n6:33\nis going to be the new consumer surplus\n6:35\nor the new producer surplus?\n6:37\nI encourage you to pause the video\n6:38\nand try to think about that on your own.\n6:40\nWell let's think about what's going to happen.\n6:42\nFrom the producers point of view,\n6:44\nit doesn't make sense for them to produce\n6:46\nmore than 1 million units.\n6:48\n1 million square feet per month.\n6:51\nI have to rent out more than a million\n6:53\nsquare feet per month\n6:54\nbecause that extra square foot above that,\n6:57\nits marginal cost is going to be more than\n6:58\nwhat they're going to get.\n7:00\nThe producers are just going to stop there.\n7:01\nThe producer surplus is going to be the area\n7:05\nof this triangle right over here.\n7:10\nLet's see, this is $1 times 1 million\n7:13\ntimes one-half.\n7:16\nThis is now a producer surplus.\n7:17\nProducer surplus.\n7:21\nA new producer surplus under the rent control\n7:22\nof $500,000, half a million, of $500,000.\n7:30\nSo we see that the rent control\n7:31\nimmediately hit the producers pretty hard.\n7:34\nThe producer surplus has gone down dramatically.\n7:36\nNow what about the consumer surplus?\n7:38\nWe're talking about a million units,\n7:40\nor a million square foot per month I should say.\n7:43\nSo now the new consumer surplus is the area,\n7:48\nis this entire area.\n7:52\nSo you see that at least for this first\n7:55\nincremental million square feet,\n7:57\nthe consumers have started to win out a little bit.\n8:00\nTo figure this out, what the total area is,\n8:03\nwe just need to figure out what we could break\n8:04\nthis up into two sections.\n8:06\nWe could break this up into two sections.\n8:09\nThis is the point,\n8:10\n1 million square feet at $3.50 dollars per square foot per month.\n8:14\nThis is right over here, the point, the 3.5.\n8:16\nWe could use that to figure out this new area.\n8:19\nActually let me do it in a different color,\n8:21\nin this green area right over here.\n8:25\nWhat is it going to be?\n8:26\nWell the area of this thing right over here\n8:30\nis one-half high.\n8:33\nOne-half times 1 times one-half.\n8:38\nThis right over here is 250K.\n8:41\nWe add that to this area right over here,\n8:45\nwhich is one and a half times 1.\n8:51\n$1.5 dollars per square foot per month\n8:54\ntimes 1 million.\n8:55\nDid I do that right? Yep.\n8:57\nSo that's going to be plus ... plus this,\n9:00\nwhich is 1.5 million.\n9:03\nYou add these two together.\n9:05\nThe total consumer surplus ...\n9:07\nSo the total consumer surplus is now 1.75 million.\n9:18\nSo the consumer surplus definitely\n9:20\ndid go up in total because it gained\n9:23\nall of this from the producer,\n9:26\nbut let's think about what has now\n9:28\nhappened in our society or in our city.\n9:30\nThe producers definitely don't want to put out\n9:33\nas many square foot per rent anymore.\n9:35\nIt does look like we have lost some\n9:37\ntotal surplus for our little city here.\n9:40\nWe have lost out on this entire area.\n9:44\nWe can calculate it by looking at what\n9:46\nthe total surplus was before the rent control\n9:49\nand what the total surplus was after the rent control.\n9:52\nThe total surplus before,\n9:54\nso before the total surplus was the 2 million\n9:59\nproducer surplus plus the 1 million consumer surplus,\n10:02\nso it was 3 million.\n10:05\nAfter, it is the 1.75 million consumer surplus\n10:12\nplus the $500,000 producer surplus,\n10:14\nwhich is 2.25 million.\n10:19\nWhat we've lost is the difference here,\n10:23\nwhich is $750,000.\n10:28\nSo this area right over here.\n10:30\nThis is per month.\n10:31\nThis right over here represents the lost total surplus.\n10:35\nThis lost total surplus of $750,000 per month\n10:40\nis referred to as the dead weight loss.\n10:46\nYou can debate about rent control.\n10:49\nIs it good? Is it bad?\n10:50\nIs it good for this kind of dynamic?\n10:52\nWho gets what share of the surplus?\n10:55\nThis of course is an oversimplification\n10:57\nof a market and even the way rent\n10:59\ncontrol would be instituted.\n11:00\nThis is a model for beginning to think\n11:02\nabout what happens to the total surplus\n11:05\nwhen these types of price controls are instituted.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nEverything we've talked about so far with this startup\n0:04\ncompany selling socks and all of that, has been raising\n0:06\nmoney from an equity.\n0:07\nWe raised private money-- when the company was private it\n0:10\nwent to VCs and it went to angel investors, and maybe you\n0:15\ncould go to your friends and family to raise money.\n0:17\nAnd then the company could go public and raise money from\n0:20\nthe public markets.\n0:21\nBut there's actually two ways that a\n0:23\ncompany can raise capital.\n0:26\nSo this is why this playlist is called capital markets, or\n0:29\nit's part of it, the name of raise capital.\n0:32\nCapital is just essentially-- I mean the easy way to think\n0:34\nabout it is you're raising cash that you want to invest\n0:38\nin some way to grow your business or to sustain your\n0:40\nbusiness or start your business.\n0:41\nSo everything we talked about so far was equity, and that's\n0:47\nessentially selling shares in your company to raise money.\n0:51\nAnd so that's all of those VC examples.\n0:54\nThe equity investor-- so when you sell equity, you're\n0:56\nessentially selling-- you're kind of making that person\n0:59\nwho's buying the stock-- you know, an equity is the same\n1:01\nthing as stock-- you're making the person who's buying a\n1:04\nstock kind of a partner in the company.\n1:06\nSo if the company-- let's say there's two situations-- if\n1:09\nthe company goes bankrupt-- and I'll talk a lot more about\n1:12\nwhat bankruptcy even means-- but if the company goes\n1:16\nbankrupt, all the shareholders end up with nothing.\n1:18\nThey end up with nil.\n1:20\nBut if the company has a lot of upside, the stock gets a\n1:25\nlot of upside.\n1:27\nBecause they're partners in it.\n1:28\nIf this was a company, that start-up that we talked about,\n1:31\nif it turns into Amazon.com and becomes a billion-dollar\n1:34\ncompany, everyone is going to do really well.\n1:35\nEveryone's going to share in that upside.\n1:38\nBut there's another way to raise money, and actually this\n1:40\nis probably something that's more familiar at\n1:43\nthe household level.\n1:44\nI mean at the household level you never raise equity.\n1:46\nYou never say, you know what-- well you can, but you're not\n1:49\ngoing to say hey, I need to buy a house, why don't I go to\n1:52\nmy rich friend and offer to sell 10% of the stake in my\n1:55\nhouse to him and he'll be kind of a partner in my house.\n1:59\nThat could happen but for the most part it doesn't.\n2:01\nUsually when you do something on a personal level you raise\n2:04\nmoney through debt.\n2:09\nAnd that's interesting.\n2:10\nSo what's good about debt is it's-- so let's think about it\n2:15\nfrom the point of view of the person who's lending\n2:18\nthe money to you.\n2:20\nDebt is just borrowing money.\n2:26\nI think all of us know what borrowing money is.\n2:29\nI go to my rich friend and I say hey, could I borrow $1 and\n2:32\nI'll give you $1.25 in a year?\n2:34\nAnd he says, OK, you're good for it.\n2:36\nBut I'm essentially promising I'm going to give the money\n2:38\nback at some future date.\n2:39\nIf I sell equity, I'm not promising anything.\n2:42\nI'm like hey, I got a great business, why don't you give\n2:45\n$1 and then you get a 20% cut of my business.\n2:47\nIf my business does awesome, you get 20% of all of the\n2:50\nprofits of my business.\n2:51\nIf my business does horrible, well you took a risk, you get\n2:54\nnothing and I get nothing.\n2:55\nDebt says regardless of how my business does, if it does\n2:59\nawesome all you're going to get is the interest.\n3:05\nThat's kind of the upside.\n3:05\nSo the upside's limited, right?\n3:07\nIf I borrow money at 9% interest, all that person's\n3:11\ngoing to get is 9%.\n3:12\nEven if my company becomes the next Google or Microsoft or\n3:17\nwhatever else, that person's just going to\n3:18\nget 9% on their money.\n3:20\nWhile this person might have gotten a hundred times their\n3:23\nmoney because they made a bet.\n3:24\nOn the other hand, this downside is much lower.\n3:28\nSo limited downside.\n3:30\nBecause they're going to get their money back at a\n3:32\ncertain-- you know, there's a certain payment schedule.\n3:35\nAnd they're going to get their money back before the\n3:38\nstockholders-- so let's say in a situation where the\n3:40\ncompany's going into difficulty-- and we'll do a\n3:43\nwhole playlist on bankruptcy-- the people who lend money to\n3:47\nthe company will see their money before the stockholders\n3:50\nsee anything.\n3:51\nSo how does all of this come out from the balance sheet?\n3:53\nSo let's say we have a public company.\n3:57\nIf you wonder what a CFO at a company does, this is really\n4:00\nthe main decision that they're always making.\n4:02\nDo we raise money-- well, how do we raise money if we need\n4:05\nit, and do we raise money from the equity markets or from the\n4:07\ndebt markets?\n4:08\nSo let's come up with a company again.\n4:12\nLet's say that that's its current assets.\n4:14\nNot current-- I don't want to say current assets, it's the\n4:18\nassets that it currently has.\n4:19\nCurrent assets means something different, and we'll talk\n4:21\nabout that in the future.\n4:23\nBut let's say, so that's its assets.\n4:29\nYou know it might have some cash here.\n4:33\nWe'll go into more detail.\n4:34\nWe'll actually look at real company balance sheets and\n4:37\ndecipher what all of the terms on the balance sheet mean.\n4:40\nBut that's its assets for now.\n4:41\nAnd let's say right now all of its money it's raised so far\n4:44\nhas been equity.\n4:46\nAnd let's say it's a publicly listed company.\n4:48\nIt doesn't have to be.\n4:50\nLet's say that's all of its equity, and let's say it has,\n4:59\nI don't know, 10 million shares.\n5:04\nAnd the other interesting thing about when a company's\n5:06\npublic-- remember, every time when a company was private and\n5:08\nit took an investor, when it took equity investors, they\n5:11\nhad to sit and have a negotiation saying what is\n5:13\nthis worth?\n5:14\nWhat are these assets worth?\n5:16\nBut what's cool is, is when you have a publicly traded\n5:18\ncompany, these shares are traded on an exchange, right?\n5:21\nThese shares are on, let's say it's on the\n5:24\nNew York Stock Exchange.\n5:27\nSo every day you could go to Yahoo!\n5:29\nFinance or wherever and you can look at a chart.\n5:33\nLet me draw a chart.\n5:35\nYou can draw a chart.\n5:41\nAnd we've all seen stock charts, I think.\n5:44\nSo let's say that this is this could have been its IPO date\n5:46\nor it could just be the start that we're looking at, and\n5:48\nlet's say the stock IPO went up, and then the whole market\n5:51\nwent down a little bit.\n5:52\nBut the stock-- maybe it's there, right?\n5:54\nBut on any given, really almost any given second,\n5:57\nthere's a price that somebody traded that stock at and it\n6:00\nmight not be the best price, but it is a price.\n6:03\nAnd we'll talk about why that happens, because you might\n6:05\nhave 10 million shares, and if only, I don't know, 100 shares\n6:09\nget traded at any second, or let's say only 100 shares get\n6:12\ntraded in the day, is that an indicative price?\n6:13\nBecause that's not a huge percentage\n6:15\nof all of the shares.\n6:16\nBut anyway, we'll talk more about what volume means\n6:20\nrelative to the total float and all of that.\n6:23\nBut let's say at this split second the company shares\n6:26\ntraded at $15 a share.\n6:29\nThis is $15, right, at this second in time.\n6:32\nThis is like right now.\n6:33\nTraded at $15 a share, and you could look it up on your\n6:36\nBloomberg terminal or whatever else.\n6:38\nSo essentially the market is providing us a\n6:41\nvalue for this company.\n6:43\nThe market is saying wow, the market is willing to trade the\n6:46\nshare at $15.\n6:47\nThere was a willing buyer and a willing seller at exactly\n6:49\n$15 a share.\n6:51\nSo that means that the market at that moment is valuing this\n6:54\ncompany at $15 per share times 10 million shares.\n6:57\nSo $15 per share times 10 million shares-- not\n7:05\nnecessarily a dollar sign.\n7:08\nSo the market is assigning a, 15 times 10 is 100.\n7:13\n$150 million market cap.\n7:17\nMarket capitalization for the company.\n7:22\nAnd you could look on the kind of, I think it's the key\n7:25\nstatistics tab on Yahoo!\n7:26\nFinance, and you'll see market capitalization for a company.\n7:29\nAnd it's just the number of shares times the\n7:33\nprice of the shares.\n7:34\nThis is essentially what the market's value\n7:37\nof the equity is.\n7:38\nThe market is saying that this piece right here\n7:40\nis worth $150 million.\n7:43\nAnd since this piece is the same size as the assets, we\n7:47\nhave nothing else on the right-hand side, the market's\n7:49\nessentially saying that the assets right now are worth\n7:52\n$150 million.\n7:53\nAnd these aren't always going to be equal.\n7:55\nWe'll see probably in a few videos when you start raising\n7:57\ndebt you have to do an extra calculation to figure out what\n8:01\nthe asset value or-- and I'll throw out a new term here, the\n8:03\nenterprise value of the firm is.\n8:06\nThe enterprise value's essentially the asset value\n8:09\nminus excess cash.\n8:12\nThe cash the company really doesn't need to operate.\n8:14\nAnd we'll go into more detail of that.\n8:16\nBut we'll just view it as the assets for now.\n8:18\nSo if I'm the CFO of this company, and let's say we need\n8:21\nto raise another, I don't know, $15 million.\n8:25\nI have two options.\n8:27\nI could say OK, the company is trading at $15 per share, I\n8:32\nneed to raise $15 million, so I could issue\n8:36\nanother million shares.\n8:38\nIt wouldn't be the initial public offering because I'm\n8:40\nalready public.\n8:41\nIt would be a follow-on offering, or sometimes it's\n8:43\ncalled a secondary offering.\n8:44\nAlthough the word secondary has kind of two connotations.\n8:47\nBut it would be a follow-on offering where I would issue,\n8:50\nI'd go to the board, we would essentially create another\n8:53\nmillion shares, and then sell them into the market, and\n8:56\nhopefully people will buy it at $15 a share or probably a\n8:59\nlittle bit less because we're kind of flooding the market\n9:01\nwith a ton of shares.\n9:02\nMaybe they buy it at $14 per share, and we\n9:04\nwould raise $14 million.\n9:08\nAnd that would be a follow-on offering.\n9:10\nSo we can always use the public markets as a way to\n9:12\nraise more money.\n9:13\nWe didn't have to go to all this-- I mean, for the most\n9:15\npart we didn't have to do this huge valuation exercise and\n9:17\nnegotiations and do all of this, hire banks and all that.\n9:22\nAlthough the banks will still collect fees.\n9:24\nWe actually would have to hire banks to do this.\n9:26\nSo that's one option.\n9:27\nOr the other option is we're an established company, we're\n9:30\ngenerating cash, we could make interest\n9:32\npayments if we want to.\n9:33\nWe could go to a bank.\n9:34\nAnd actually there's a lot of different ways to do this.\n9:36\nBut we could essentially borrow money.\n9:38\nAnd let's just say we do that.\n9:39\nInstead of doing this-- let's say we do both.\n9:41\nSo let's say we did a $1 million follow-on offering,\n9:43\nthat gave us $14 million.\n9:47\nAnd let's say we want another $2 million, but this time\n9:50\ninstead of selling shares-- so right now how many\n9:52\nshares do we have?\n9:52\nWe sold 1 million, we had 10 million, we\n9:53\nhave 11 million shares.\n9:57\nLet's say, you know what, let's say as a CFO I feel like\n10:00\nour shares are going to move up a lot more.\n10:02\nSo we don't like selling them at this low price.\n10:05\nAnd let's say interest rates are really low.\n10:08\nInstead we're going to borrow money.\n10:10\nThat's essentially raising debt.\n10:12\nSo let's say we borrow another $3 million because we need it.\n10:18\nSo actually this would be debt, $3 million of debt, and\n10:23\nwe would get $3 million of cash.\n10:32\nSo now our assets are all of this stuff on\n10:37\nthe left-hand side.\n10:40\nAnd what are our liabilities now?\n10:41\nNow, we didn't have liabilities before because\n10:43\neverything we had were equities.\n10:44\nBut now we do.\n10:45\nNow we owe somebody $3 million right here.\n10:49\nAnd I'll talk more about all the different ways to kind of\n10:51\nborrow money.\n10:52\nBut it's essentially, it could just literally be a bank loan.\n10:55\nThey might have just gone to Bank of America and said hey,\n10:57\nwe're a big company and we're good for the money, why don't\n11:00\nyou lend us $3 million.\n11:02\nAnd maybe it would be $3 million at a low interest\n11:06\nrate, at maybe 6% per year.\n11:08\nAnd Bank of America feels good because you have a high--\n11:11\nwe'll talk more about credit ratings and all of that-- but\n11:14\nthey say oh, you have essentially a good company\n11:16\ncredit score.\n11:18\nSo we'll give it to you at a low interest rate.\n11:19\nSo what happens in the future is, these assets are going to\n11:22\ngenerate, hopefully, some cash.\n11:24\nAnd before these guys see it-- let me do to it in the--\n11:28\nbefore these equity holders-- this is the equity holders\n11:31\nright now-- before the equity holders see anything, these\n11:33\nguys have to get paid their interest. And I'll show you\n11:36\nall of that on a line-by-line basis in an income statement.\n11:39\nEverything we've done so far has been a balance sheet.\n11:42\nBut something interesting is happening now.\n11:44\nNow all of a sudden your assets, which is that side-- I\n11:47\nknow I just keep writing over the same drawing-- your assets\n11:50\nare now larger than your equity.\n11:53\nI think now, and this is just kind of a review of the\n11:55\nbalance sheet video, you see that the assets are equal to\n12:02\nyour equity, which is this right here, your equity plus\n12:09\nyour liabilities.\n12:10\nYour liabilities now are $3 million.\n12:13\nPlus liabilities.\n12:14\nSo if you wanted to know what your assets are worth, because\n12:17\nyour assets are equal to your equity.\n12:21\nSo what's your market value of your equity?\n12:25\nWell, we figured that out already.\n12:26\nWe have 11 million shares now.\n12:28\nAnd let's say the stock plummets to $10 a share for\n12:32\nsome strange reason or for a not-strange reason.\n12:35\nSo what's the market cap? $10 a share, 11 million shares, we\n12:39\nhave a $110 million market cap.\n12:41\nWe're doing a market value.\n12:43\nAnd we'll talk more about the difference between market and\n12:44\nbook value.\n12:45\nBut this is the market value of your equity.\n12:47\nAnd then what is your liabilities?\n12:49\nWell we owe $3 million, so plus 3 million.\n12:55\nSo we could say that for the most part the market value of\n12:58\nour assets, the market thinks that this entire left-hand\n13:01\nside is going to be worth the value of our equity, the\n13:07\nmarket cap of the company, plus the amount of debt, which\n13:10\nis equal to $113 million.\n13:14\nSo the value of these assets are $113 million, and that for\n13:18\nthe most part is the enterprise\n13:20\nvalue of the company.\n13:21\nWhat is the company's assets worth?\n13:24\nAnd we'll talk-- there's a little bit of a tweak we'll do\n13:26\nin the future on enterprise value.\n13:28\nBut that's essentially how you kind of can value what the\n13:31\ncompany's worth.\n13:32\nA lot of people when they do a market capitalization\n13:35\ncalculation they say oh, that's what\n13:36\nthe company's worth.\n13:37\nWell no, that's what the equity is worth.\n13:39\nMarket cap is what the equity's worth.\n13:41\nIf you want to know what the company's worth, you have to\n13:43\ntake the market cap and then add the debt.\n13:48\nAnother way-- well, I won't get too complicated because I\n13:51\njust realized I've run out of time again.\n13:52\nSee you in the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nI think we're all reasonably familiar with the three states\n0:03\nof matter in our everyday world.\n0:05\nAt very high temperatures you get a fourth.\n0:07\nBut the three ones that we normally deal with are, things\n0:10\ncould be a solid, a liquid, or it could be a gas.\n0:22\nAnd we have this general notion, and I think water is\n0:25\nthe example that always comes to at least my mind.\n0:29\nIs that solid happens when things are\n0:30\ncolder, relatively colder.\n0:33\nAnd then as you warm up, you go into a liquid state.\n0:37\nAnd as your warm up even more you go into a gaseous state.\n0:40\nSo you go from colder to hotter.\n0:44\nAnd in the case of water, when you're a solid, you're ice.\n0:51\nWhen you're a liquid, some people would call ice water,\n0:55\nbut let's call it liquid water.\n0:58\nI think we know what that is.\n1:01\nAnd then when it's in the gas state, you're essentially\n1:04\nvapor or steam.\n1:12\nSo let's think a little bit about what, at least in the\n1:14\ncase of water, and the analogy will extend to\n1:17\nother types of molecules.\n1:19\nBut what is it about water that makes it solid, and when\n1:22\nit's colder, what allows it to be liquid.\n1:24\nAnd I'll be frank, liquids are kind of fascinating because\n1:28\nyou can never nail them down, I guess is the\n1:31\nbest way to view them.\n1:32\nOr a gas.\n1:34\nSo let's just draw a water molecule.\n1:39\nSo you have oxygen there.\n1:42\nYou have some bonds to hydrogen.\n1:47\nAnd then you have two extra pairs of valence electrons in\n1:50\nthe oxygen.\n1:51\nAnd a couple of videos ago, we said oxygen is a lot more\n1:55\nelectronegative than the hydrogen.\n1:58\nIt likes to hog the electrons.\n2:00\nSo even though this shows that they're sharing\n2:04\nelectrons here and here.\n2:06\nAt both sides of those lines, you can kind of view that\n2:08\nhydrogen is contributing an electron and oxygen is\n2:10\ncontributing an electron on both sides of that line.\n2:13\nBut we know because of the electronegativity, or the\n2:15\nrelative electronegativity of oxygen, that it's hogging\n2:18\nthese electrons.\n2:19\nAnd so the electrons spend a lot more time around the\n2:22\noxygen than they do around the hydrogen.\n2:24\nAnd what that results is that on the oxygen side of the\n2:27\nmolecule, you end up with a partial negative charge.\n2:32\nAnd we talked about that a little bit.\n2:33\nAnd on the hydrogen side of the molecules, you end up with\n2:35\na slightly positive charge.\n2:44\nNow, if these molecules have very little kinetic energy,\n2:51\nthey're not moving around a whole lot, then the positive\n2:56\nsides of the hydrogens are very attracted to the negative\n2:59\nsides of oxygen in other molecules.\n3:03\nLet me draw some more molecules.\n3:04\nWhen we talk about the whole state of the whole matter, we\n3:06\nactually think about how the molecules are interacting with\n3:10\neach other.\n3:10\nNot just how the atoms are interacting with each other\n3:13\nwithin a molecule.\n3:16\nI just drew one oxygen, let me copy and paste that.\n3:20\nBut I could do multiple oxygens.\n3:22\nAnd let's say that that hydrogen is going to want to\n3:26\nbe near this oxygen.\n3:28\nBecause this has partial negative charge, this has a\n3:30\npartial positive charge.\n3:32\nAnd then I could do another one right there.\n3:37\nAnd then maybe we'll have, and just to make the point clear,\n3:40\nyou have two hydrogens here, maybe an oxygen\n3:43\nwants to hang out there.\n3:45\nSo maybe you have an oxygen that wants to be here because\n3:49\nit's got its partial negative here.\n3:52\nAnd it's connected to two hydrogens right there that\n3:55\nhave their partial positives.\n3:57\nBut you can kind of see a lattice structure.\n4:00\nLet me draw these bonds, these polar bonds that start forming\n4:05\nbetween the particles.\n4:08\nThese bonds, they're called polar bonds because the\n4:10\nmolecules themselves are polar.\n4:14\nAnd you can see it forms this lattice structure.\n4:16\nAnd if each of these molecules don't have a\n4:19\nlot of kinetic energy.\n4:21\nOr we could say the average kinetic energy of this matter\n4:26\nis fairly low.\n4:27\nAnd what do we know is average kinetic energy?\n4:29\nWell, that's temperature.\n4:30\nThen this lattice structure will be solid.\n4:33\nThese molecules will not move relative to each other.\n4:37\nI could draw a gazillion more, but I think you get the point\n4:40\nthat we're forming this kind of fixed structure.\n4:44\nAnd while we're in the solid state, as we add kinetic\n4:48\nenergy, as we add heat, what it does to molecules is, it\n4:52\njust makes them vibrate around a little bit.\n4:57\nIf I was a cartoonist, they way you'd draw a vibration is\n4:59\nto put quotation marks there.\n5:01\nThat's not very scientific.\n5:03\nBut they would vibrate around, they would buzz around a\n5:05\nlittle bit.\n5:06\nI'm drawing arrows to show that they are vibrating.\n5:08\nIt doesn't have to be just\n5:09\nleft-right it could be up-down.\n5:10\nBut as you add more and more heat in a solid, these\n5:14\nmolecules are going to keep their structure.\n5:16\nSo they're not going to move around relative to each other.\n5:19\nBut they will convert that heat, and heat is just a form\n5:23\nof energy, into kinetic energy which is expressed as the\n5:27\nvibration of these molecules.\n5:29\nNow, if you make these molecules start to vibrate\n5:33\nenough, and if you put enough kinetic energy into these\n5:35\nmolecules, what do you think is going to happen?\n5:37\nWell this guy is vibrating pretty hard, and he's\n5:39\nvibrating harder and harder as you add more and more heat.\n5:42\nThis guy is doing the same thing.\n5:43\nAt some point, these polar bonds that they have to each\n5:46\nother are going to start not being strong enough to contain\n5:50\nthe vibrations.\n5:52\nAnd once that happens, the molecules-- let me draw a\n5:57\ncouple more.\n5:58\nOnce that happens, the molecules are going to start\n6:01\nmoving past each other.\n6:07\nSo now all of a sudden, the molecule will start shifting.\n6:13\nBut they're still attracted.\n6:14\nMaybe this side is moving here, that's moving there.\n6:17\nYou have other molecules moving around that way.\n6:19\nBut they're still attracted to each other.\n6:22\nEven though we've gotten the kinetic energy to the point\n6:25\nthat the vibrations can kind of break the bonds between the\n6:31\npolar sides of the molecules.\n6:34\nOur vibration, or our kinetic energy for each molecule,\n6:38\nstill isn't strong enough to completely separate them.\n6:40\nThey're starting to slide past each other.\n6:43\nAnd this is essentially what happens when you're in a\n6:44\nliquid state.\n6:46\nYou have a lot of atoms that want be touching each other\n6:49\nbut they're sliding.\n6:50\nThey have enough kinetic energy to slide past each\n6:53\nother and break that solid lattice structure here.\n6:57\nAnd then if you add even more kinetic energy, even more\n7:00\nheat, at this point it's a solution now.\n7:05\nThey're not even going to be able to stay together.\n7:07\nThey're not going to be able to stay near each other.\n7:08\nIf you add enough kinetic energy they're going to start\n7:11\nlooking like this.\n7:12\nThey're going to completely separate and then kind of\n7:15\nbounce around independently.\n7:17\nEspecially independently if they're an ideal gas.\n7:19\nBut in general, in gases, they're no longer touching\n7:22\neach other.\n7:22\nThey might bump into each other.\n7:25\nBut they have so much kinetic energy on their own that\n7:28\nthey're all doing their own thing\n7:29\nand they're not touching.\n7:31\nI think that makes intuitive sense if you just think about\n7:33\nwhat a gas is.\n7:36\nFor example, it's hard to see a gas.\n7:37\nWhy is it hard to see a gas?\n7:39\nBecause the molecules are much further apart.\n7:41\nSo they're not acting on the light in the way that a liquid\n7:46\nor a solid would.\n7:47\nAnd if we keep making that extended further, a solid--\n7:50\nwell, I probably shouldn't use the example with ice.\n7:53\nBecause ice or water is one of the few situations where the\n7:56\nsolid is less dense than the liquid.\n7:58\nThat's why ice floats.\n8:00\nAnd that's why icebergs don't just all fall to the\n8:02\nbottom of the ocean.\n8:03\nAnd ponds don't completely freeze solid.\n8:07\nBut you can imagine that, because a liquid is in most\n8:11\ncases other than water, less dense.\n8:13\nThat's another reason why you can see through it a little\n8:15\nbit better.\n8:15\nOr it's not diffracting-- well I won't go into that too much,\n8:18\nthan maybe even a solid.\n8:20\nBut the gas is the most obvious.\n8:21\nAnd it is true with water.\n8:23\nThe liquid form is definitely more dense than the gas form.\n8:27\nIn the gas form, the molecules are going to jump around, not\n8:31\ntouch each other.\n8:32\nAnd because of that, more light can\n8:35\nget through the substance.\n8:37\nNow the question is, how do we measure the amount of heat\n8:40\nthat it takes to do this to water?\n8:44\nAnd to explain that, I'll actually draw a\n8:47\nphase change diagram.\n8:49\nWhich is a fancy way of describing something fairly\n8:53\nstraightforward.\n8:54\nLet me say that this is the amount of heat I'm adding.\n8:57\nAnd this is the temperature.\n8:59\nWe'll talk about the states of matter in a second.\n9:02\nSo heat is often denoted by q.\n9:06\nSometimes people will talk about change in heat.\n9:09\nThey'll use H, lowercase and uppercase H.\n9:11\nThey'll put a delta in front of the H.\n9:13\nDelta just means change in.\n9:15\nAnd sometimes you'll hear the word enthalpy.\n9:17\nLet me write that.\n9:18\nBecause I used to say what is enthalpy?\n9:26\nIt sounds like empathy, but it's\n9:29\nquite a different concept.\n9:30\nAt least, as far as my neural connections could make it.\n9:33\nBut enthalpy is closely related to heat.\n9:36\nIt's heat content.\n9:45\nFor our purposes, when you hear someone say change in\n9:49\nenthalpy, you should really just be thinking\n9:51\nof change in heat.\n9:52\nI think this word was really just introduced to confuse\n9:56\nchemistry students and introduce a non-intuitive word\n10:00\ninto their vocabulary.\n10:02\nThe best way to think about it is heat content.\n10:04\nChange in enthalpy is really just change in heat.\n10:07\nAnd just remember, all of these things, whether we're\n10:09\ntalking about heat, kinetic energy,\n10:13\npotential energy, enthalpy.\n10:16\nYou'll hear them in different contexts, and you're like, I\n10:18\nthought I should be using heat and they're\n10:19\ntalking about enthalpy.\n10:21\nThese are all forms of energy.\n10:23\nAnd these are all measured in joules.\n10:26\nAnd they might be measured in other ways, but the\n10:28\ntraditional way is in joules.\n10:29\nAnd energy is the ability to do work.\n10:31\nAnd what's the unit for work?\n10:33\nWell, it's joules.\n10:34\nForce times distance.\n10:35\nBut anyway, that's a side-note.\n10:37\nBut it's good to know this word enthalpy.\n10:38\nEspecially in a chemistry context, because it's used all\n10:40\nthe time and it can be very confusing and non-intuitive.\n10:43\nBecause you're like, I don't know what enthalpy is in my\n10:46\neveryday life.\n10:47\nJust think of it as heat contact, because that's really\n10:50\nwhat it is.\n10:50\nBut anyway, on this axis, I have heat.\n10:55\nSo this is when I have very little heat and I'm\n10:57\nincreasing my heat.\n10:58\nAnd this is temperature.\n11:05\nNow let's say at low temperatures I'm here and as I\n11:09\nadd heat my temperature will go up.\n11:12\nTemperature is average kinetic energy.\n11:14\nLet's say I'm in the solid state here.\n11:16\nAnd I'll do the solid state in purple.\n11:21\nNo I already was using purple.\n11:23\nI'll use magenta.\n11:26\nSo as I add heat, my temperature will go up.\n11:29\nHeat is a form of energy.\n11:31\nAnd when I add it to these molecules, as I did in this\n11:36\nexample, what did it do?\n11:37\nIt made them vibrate more.\n11:38\nOr it made them have higher kinetic energy, or higher\n11:41\naverage kinetic engery, and that's what temperature is a\n11:43\nmeasure of; average kinetic energy.\n11:46\nSo as I add heat in the solid phase, my average kinetic\n11:50\nenergy will go up.\n11:51\nAnd let me write this down.\n11:52\nThis is in the solid phase, or the solid state of matter.\n11:58\nNow something very interesting happens.\n12:01\nLet's say this is water.\n12:03\nSo what happens at zero degrees?\n12:09\nWhich is also 273.15 Kelvin.\n12:14\nLet's say that's that line.\n12:15\nWhat happens to a solid?\n12:18\nWell, it turns into a liquid.\n12:19\nIce melts.\n12:20\nNot all solids, we're talking in particular about\n12:22\nwater, about H2O.\n12:25\nSo this is ice in our example.\n12:27\nAll solids aren't ice.\n12:29\nAlthough, you could think of a rock as solid magma.\n12:33\nBecause that's what it is.\n12:38\nI could take that analogy a bunch of different ways.\n12:41\nBut the interesting thing that happens at zero degrees.\n12:49\nDepending on what direction you're going, either the\n12:51\nfreezing point of water or the melting point of ice,\n12:53\nsomething interesting happens.\n12:55\nAs I add more heat, the temperature does not to go up.\n13:00\nAs I add more heat, the temperature does not go up for\n13:03\na little period.\n13:05\nLet me draw that.\n13:07\nFor a little period, the temperature stays constant.\n13:10\nAnd then while the temperature is constant, it stays a solid.\n13:14\nWe're still a solid.\n13:16\nAnd then, we finally turn into a liquid.\n13:22\nLet's say right there.\n13:23\nSo we added a certain amount of heat and it\n13:25\njust stayed a solid.\n13:26\nBut it got us to the point that the ice\n13:28\nturned into a liquid.\n13:29\nIt was kind of melting the entire time.\n13:31\nThat's the best way to think about it.\n13:32\nAnd then, once we keep adding more and more heat, then the\n13:36\nliquid warms up too.\n13:42\nNow, we get to, what temperature becomes\n13:45\ninteresting again for water?\n13:46\nWell, obviously 100 degrees Celsius or 373 degrees Kelvin.\n13:56\nI'll do it in Celsius because that's what\n13:57\nwe're familiar with.\n13:59\nWhat happens?\n13:59\nThat's the temperature at which water will vaporize or\n14:03\nwhich water will boil.\n14:05\nBut something happens.\n14:07\nAnd they're really getting kinetically active.\n14:13\nBut just like when you went from solid to liquid, there's\n14:16\na certain amount of energy that you have to contribute to\n14:19\nthe system.\n14:20\nAnd actually, it's a good amount at this point.\n14:23\nWhere the water is turning into vapor, but it's not\n14:26\ngetting any hotter.\n14:31\nSo we have to keep adding heat, but notice that the\n14:34\ntemperature didn't go up.\n14:35\nWe'll talk about it in a second what\n14:37\nwas happening then.\n14:38\nAnd then finally, after that point, we're completely\n14:43\nvaporized, or we're completely steam.\n14:46\nThen we can start getting hot, the steam can then get hotter\n14:48\nas we add more and more heat to the system.\n14:53\nSo the interesting question, I think it's intuitive, that as\n14:55\nyou add heat here, our temperature is going to go up.\n15:01\nBut the interesting thing is, what was going on here?\n15:03\nWe were adding heat.\n15:04\nSo over here we were turning our heat into kinetic energy.\n15:07\nTemperature is average kinetic energy.\n15:10\nBut over here, what was our heat doing?\n15:12\nWell, our heat was was not adding kinetic\n15:15\nenergy to the system.\n15:16\nThe temperature was not increasing.\n15:17\nBut the ice was going from ice to water.\n15:20\nSo what was happening at that state, is that the kinetic\n15:24\nenergy, the heat, was being used to essentially break\n15:29\nthese bonds.\n15:32\nAnd essentially bring the molecules into a\n15:34\nhigher energy state.\n15:35\nSo you're saying, Sal, what does that mean,\n15:37\nhigher energy state?\n15:38\nWell, if there wasn't all of this heat and all this kinetic\n15:42\nenergy, these molecules want to be very\n15:44\nclose to each other.\n15:46\nFor example, I want to be close to the\n15:49\nsurface of the earth.\n15:50\nWhen you put me in a plane you have put me in a\n15:52\nhigher energy state.\n15:53\nI have a lot more potential energy.\n15:56\nI have the potential to fall towards the earth.\n15:58\nLikewise, when you move these molecules apart, and you go\n16:02\nfrom a solid to a liquid, they want to fall\n16:05\ntowards each other.\n16:06\nBut because they have so much kinetic energy, they never\n16:08\nquite are able to do it.\n16:10\nBut their energy goes up.\n16:12\nTheir potential energy is higher because they want to\n16:14\nfall towards each other.\n16:15\nBy falling towards each other, in theory, they\n16:18\ncould do some work.\n16:21\nSo what's happening here is, when we're contributing heat--\n16:26\nand this amount of heat we're contributing, it's called the\n16:32\nheat of fusion.\n16:36\nBecause it's the same amount of heat regardless how much\n16:39\ndirection we go in.\n16:40\nWhen we go from solid to liquid, you view it as the\n16:43\nheat of melting.\n16:45\nIt's the head that you need to put in to melt\n16:48\nthe ice into liquid.\n16:49\nWhen you're going in this direction, it's the heat you\n16:51\nhave to take out of the zero degree water to\n16:55\nturn it into ice.\n16:58\nSo you're taking that potential energy and you're\n17:01\nbringing the molecules closer and closer to each other.\n17:05\nSo the way to think about it is, right here this heat is\n17:08\nbeing converted to kinetic energy.\n17:10\nThen, when we're at this phase change from solid to liquid,\n17:15\nthat heat is being used to add potential\n17:16\nenergy into the system.\n17:18\nTo pull the molecules apart, to give them\n17:21\nmore potential energy.\n17:22\nIf you pull me apart from the earth, you're giving me\n17:25\npotential energy.\n17:26\nBecause gravity wants to pull me back to the earth.\n17:29\nAnd I could do work when I'm falling back to the earth.\n17:32\nA waterfall does work.\n17:33\nIt can move a turbine.\n17:35\nYou could have a bunch of falling Sals move\n17:37\na turbine as well.\n17:39\nAnd then, once you are fully a liquid, then you just become a\n17:42\nwarmer and warmer liquid.\n17:43\nNow the heat is, once again, being used for kinetic energy.\n17:48\nYou're making the water molecules move past each other\n17:51\nfaster, and faster, and faster.\n17:53\nTo some point where they want to completely disassociate\n17:57\nfrom each other.\n17:58\nThey want to not even slide past each other, just\n18:00\ncompletely jump away from each other.\n18:03\nAnd that's right here.\n18:04\nThis is the heat of vaporization.\n18:13\nAnd the same idea is happening.\n18:15\nBefore we were sliding next to each other, now we're pulling\n18:17\napart altogether.\n18:19\nSo they could definitely fall closer together.\n18:22\nAnd then once we've added this much heat, now we're just\n18:27\nheating up the steam.\n18:28\nWe're just heating up the gaseous water.\n18:30\nAnd it's just getting hotter and hotter and hotter.\n18:33\nBut the interesting thing there, and I mean at least the\n18:35\ninteresting thing to me when I first learned this, whenever I\n18:41\nthink of zero degrees water I'll say, oh it must be ice.\n18:43\nBut that's not necessarily the case.\n18:45\nIf you start with water and you make it colder and colder\n18:48\nand colder to zero degrees, you're essentially taking heat\n18:52\nout of the water.\n18:53\nYou can have zero degree water and it hasn't\n18:57\nturned into ice yet.\n18:58\nAnd likewise, you could have 100 degree water that hasn't\n19:01\nturned into steam yeat.\n19:03\nYou have to add more energy.\n19:04\nYou can also have 100 degree steam.\n19:05\nYou can also have zero degree water.\n19:08\nAnyway, hopefully that gives you a little bit of intuition\n19:10\nof what the different states of matter are.\n19:12\nAnd in the next problem, we'll talk about how much heat\n19:15\nexactly it does take to move along this line.\n19:18\nAnd maybe we can solve some problems on how much ice we\n19:21\nmight need to make our drink cool.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the last video, we figured out what is the present value\n0:04\nof these three different payment timing choices.\n0:08\nIf we had a 5% risk-free rate, and if these payments were\n0:12\nrisk-free, instead of coming from -- you can almost view\n0:15\nthem as some type of government program, where\n0:17\nthey're asking you to choose which of these three payment\n0:20\nstreams from the government do you want?\n0:22\nAnd so we'll use the same rate that the government would pay\n0:25\nyou, if you lent them money.\n0:28\nAnd that's given by the treasury rate.\n0:30\nAnd in the first case we assumed a 5% treasury rate.\n0:34\nAnd if you watched the first present value video, I think\n0:37\nyou understand why compounding going forward is the same\n0:41\nthing as discounting that rate by going backwards.\n0:45\nIf you want to know how much $100 is a year from now, you\n0:47\nmultiply that times one plus the interest rate, right?\n0:54\nSo if it's 5%, you multiply that times 1.05.\n0:57\nIf you're taking $110 and going a year back,\n0:59\nyou divide by 1.05.\n1:01\nSo it's just the same operation.\n1:02\nYou're just going forward or back.\n1:03\nForward is multiplication, backwards is division.\n1:07\nBut anyway, the result that we got in the last video is that\n1:11\nthe present value -- let me do this in a different color.\n1:13\nAnd I'll introduce my notation.\n1:16\nThe present value, if we assume a 5% rate, no matter\n1:22\nhow long-- how far away the money is given to you.\n1:26\nAnd you'll see what I mean because I'll change that\n1:28\nassumption in a second.\n1:29\nBut if we assume that the risk-free rate is 5%, then the\n1:34\npresent value of $100 today, well that was just $100.\n1:39\n$110 in two years, we got that by doing 110 divided by 1.05\n1:48\nsquared, right?\n1:49\nYou divide by 1.05 there, and then you divide by 1.05 again.\n1:53\nAnd then you get $99.77.\n2:01\nI don't want to run out of too much space.\n2:02\nI could have probably done this whole thing\n2:03\na little bit bigger.\n2:05\nAnd then choice number three.\n2:08\nHow did we get that?\n2:08\nWell, we said -- let me do that in a different color.\n2:11\nThat was the present value of the $20 today, plus $50 in one\n2:17\nyear, divided by that, discounted to the present day.\n2:22\nSo divided by 1.05 plus $35 divided by 1.05 squared.\n2:31\nAnd we had gotten $99.36.\n2:35\nAnd that's what that should be worth to you today, if you\n2:39\nassume that these payments are risk-free, and you use a 5%\n2:42\ndiscount rate.\n2:44\nFair enough.\n2:45\nAnd based on these calculations, choice number\n2:48\none was the best, choice number two was second best,\n2:50\nchoice number three was third best. Fair enough.\n2:53\nNow what happens -- after I pose the question, you might\n2:57\nwant to think about it before I show you the answer -- what\n2:59\nhappens if I don't assume a 5% discount rate?\n3:02\nWhat happens if I assume a 2% discount rate?\n3:08\nThis is just my notation.\n3:09\nWhat is the present value of these if I assume a 2%\n3:13\nrisk-free rate, or a 2% discount rate?\n3:17\nWell $100, I'm getting that today, so\n3:19\nthat's still worth $100.\n3:20\nYou could even do that as -- let me do that in a more\n3:23\nvibrant color -- as 100 divided by 1.02 to the 0\n3:27\npower, because we're getting it today.\n3:29\nBut that's just 1.02 divided by 1, which is just $100.\n3:33\n$100 today.\n3:33\nWhat's the present value?\n3:34\nIt's $100.\n3:36\nNow what's the $110 two years out going to be worth?\n3:41\nSo this is interesting.\n3:42\nWhen the interest rate goes down, from 5% to 2%, I'm going\n3:47\nto be dividing by a smaller number.\n3:49\n1.02 squared is a smaller number than 1.05 squared.\n3:54\nSo the present value of this payment should go up.\n3:59\nInteresting.\n3:59\nThis is something to keep in mind for later, when we start\n4:01\nthinking about bonds.\n4:03\nWhen you lower the interest rate, the present value of\n4:05\nthis future payment goes up.\n4:07\nAnd it just falls out of the math.\n4:08\nYou're discounting by a smaller number.\n4:11\nLet's figure out what that is.\n4:12\nSo if I take $110 and I divide it by 1.02 squared, right?\n4:20\nDiscounted twice.\n4:22\nI get $105.72.\n4:32\nOh, and how did I get that?\n4:33\nThat was equal to -- I'm doing it in reverse here -- that was\n4:35\nequal to 110 divided by 1.02 squared.\n4:41\nAnd our intuition was correct.\n4:43\nJust by the interest rate going from 5% to 2%, the\n4:47\npresent value of this payment two years out -- it's in year\n4:51\nthree, but it's two years out.\n4:53\nActually I should re-label this.\n4:54\nI should call this now, the present.\n4:58\nI should call this year one.\n5:00\nI was calling this year two, one year out.\n5:03\nBut I think that makes it confusing.\n5:04\nI called this year two, so this is now.\n5:06\nSo you could call this year zero.\n5:09\nThis is year one.\n5:10\nAnd this is year two.\n5:12\nAnyway.\n5:13\nThe present value of this is -- it increased by $6 just by\n5:18\nthe discount rate going down by 3%.\n5:22\nFascinating.\n5:23\nNow let's see what happens to choice number three.\n5:25\nChoice number three, the $20 today, the $20 now, well\n5:28\nthat's just worth $20.\n5:29\nIts present value is 20 plus 50 divided by 1.02, plus the\n5:38\n35 divided by 1.02 squared.\n5:43\nLet's see what this adds up.\n5:47\n20 plus 50 divided by 1.02 plus 35\n5:58\ndivided by 1.02 squared.\n6:02\n$102.66.\n6:11\nNow there's a couple of really interesting things.\n6:13\nAnd this is a really good time to kind of let it all sink in.\n6:16\nAll of a sudden we lowered the interest rate.\n6:18\nAnd now choice number two is the best, followed by choice\n6:22\nnumber three, followed by choice number one.\n6:25\nSo it almost -- choice number one was the best when we had a\n6:28\n5% discount rate.\n6:29\nNow at a 2% discount rate, choice number two is all of a\n6:32\nsudden the best.\n6:33\nAnd there's something else interesting here.\n6:35\nChoice number two improved by a lot more when we lowered the\n6:38\ninterest rate, than choice number three did.\n6:41\nIts present value went from $99.77 to $105.70,\n6:46\nso it's almost $6.\n6:47\nWhile here it only improved by less than $3, right?\n6:51\nSo why is that?\n6:53\nWell, when you lower the interest rate, the terms that\n6:56\nare using that discount rate the most, benefit the most. So\n7:00\nall of this payment was two years out, right?\n7:03\nSo it benefited the most by decreasing the discount rate,\n7:08\nthe 1.02 squared.\n7:10\nIt changed this value the most.\n7:12\nThese payments are spread out.\n7:13\nOnly some of its payment is two years out.\n7:15\nThen some of its payment is one year out, and that's going\n7:18\nto benefit less.\n7:19\nAnd then some of its payment is today.\n7:21\nSo it will benefit, because you are discounting some of\n7:24\nthe cash payments.\n7:25\nBut it's going to benefit by less.\n7:28\nAnyway, I'll leave you there in this video.\n7:30\nAnd in the next video, we're going to see what happens when\n7:33\nwe have different discount rates for\n7:36\ndifferent amounts of time.\n7:38\nSee you in the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn this video, I want to talk a little bit\n0:02\nabout Newton's First Law of Motion.\n0:06\nAnd this is a translation from Newton's Principia from Latin\n0:09\ninto English.\n0:10\nSo the First Law, \"Every body persists\n0:13\nin a state of being at rest, or moving uniformly\n0:20\nstraightforward, except insofar as it is compelled\n0:24\nto change its state by force impressed.\"\n0:27\nSo another way to rephrase what they're saying\n0:30\nis, that if there's something-- every body persists--\n0:33\nso everything will stay at rest, or\n0:35\nmoving with a constant velocity, unless it\n0:39\nis compelled to change its state by force.\n0:42\nUnless it's acted on by a force, especially an unbalanced force.\n0:45\nand I'll explain that in a second.\n0:47\nSo if I have something that's at rest, so completely at rest.\n0:50\nSo I have-- and this is something\n0:53\nthat we've seen before.\n0:56\nLet's say that I have a rock.\n0:59\nLet's say that I have a rock someplace\n1:03\nand it's laying on a field of grass,\n1:08\nI can keep observing that rock.\n1:10\nAnd it is unlikely to move, assuming\n1:11\nthat nothing happens to it.\n1:13\nIf there's no force applied to that rock,\n1:15\nthat rock will just stay there.\n1:17\nSo the first part is pretty obvious.\n1:20\nSo, \"Every body persists in a state of being at rest\"--\n1:23\nI'm not going to do the second part--\n1:25\n\"except insofar as there's some force being applied to it.\"\n1:28\nSo clearly a rock will be at rest,\n1:30\nunless there's some force applied to it, unless someone\n1:33\nhere tries to push it or roll it or do something to it.\n1:37\nWhat's less intuitive about the first law is the second part.\n1:41\n\"Every body persists in,\" either, \"being in a state\n1:44\nof rest or moving uniformly straight forward,\n1:48\nexcept insofar as it is compelled\n1:50\nto change its state by force impressed.\"\n1:52\nSo this Newton's first law-- and I\n1:55\nthink I should do a little aside here,\n1:56\nbecause, this right here is Newton.\n2:00\nAnd if this is Newton's first law,\n2:01\nwhy do I have this huge picture of this guy over here?\n2:04\nWell, the reason is is because Newton's first law is really\n2:07\njust a restatement of this guy's law of inertia.\n2:10\nAnd this guy, another titan of civilization\n2:14\nreally, this is Galileo Galilei.\n2:19\nAnd he is the first person to formulate the law of inertia.\n2:22\nAnd Newton just rephrased it a little bit and packaged it\n2:25\nwith his other laws.\n2:26\nBut he did many, many, many other things.\n2:28\nSo you really have to give Galileo\n2:30\ncredit for Newton's first law.\n2:32\nSo that's why I made him bigger than here.\n2:34\nBut I was in the midst of a thought.\n2:36\nSo we understand if something is at rest,\n2:38\nit's going to stay at rest, unless there's\n2:39\nsome force that acts on it.\n2:41\nAnd in some definitions, you'll see\n2:42\nunless there's some unbalanced force.\n2:44\nAnd the reason why they say unbalanced\n2:46\nis, because you could have two forces that act on something\n2:49\nand they might balance out.\n2:50\nFor example, I could push on this side of the rock\n2:53\nwith a certain amount of force.\n2:55\nAnd if you push on this side of the rock\n2:56\nwith the exact same amount of force, the rock won't move.\n3:00\nAnd the only way that it would move if there's a lot more\n3:03\nforce on one side than on the other side,\n3:05\nso if you have an unbalanced force.\n3:07\nSo if you have a ton of-- and maybe the rock\n3:09\nis a bad analogy.\n3:10\nLet's take ice, because ice is easier to move, or ice on ice.\n3:14\nSo there's ice right here.\n3:16\nAnd then, I have another block of ice\n3:17\nsitting on top of that ice.\n3:19\nSo once again, we're familiar with the idea,\n3:21\nif there's no force acting on it that ice won't move.\n3:25\nBut what happens if I'm pushing on the ice\n3:29\nwith a certain amount of force on that side,\n3:31\nand you're pushing on the ice on that side\n3:32\nwith the same amount of force?\n3:34\nThe ice will still not move.\n3:36\nSo this right here, this would be a balanced force.\n3:41\nSo the only way for the ice to change its condition, to change\n3:47\nits restful condition is if the force is unbalanced.\n3:50\nSo if we add a little bit of force on this side,\n3:53\nso it more than compensates the force pushing it this way,\n3:57\nthen you're going to see the ice block start to move,\n4:00\nstart to really accelerate in that direction.\n4:04\nBut I think this part is obvious.\n4:05\nThis, you know, something that's at rest\n4:07\nwill stay at rest, unless it's being acted on\n4:09\nby an unbalanced force.\n4:11\nWhat's less obvious is the idea that something\n4:14\nmoving uniformly straightforward, which\n4:16\nis another way of saying something\n4:18\nhaving a constant velocity.\n4:22\nWhat he's saying is, is that something\n4:24\nthat has a constant velocity will continue\n4:26\nto have that constant velocity indefinitely,\n4:29\nunless it is acted on by an unbalanced force.\n4:33\nAnd that's less intuitive.\n4:34\nBecause everything in our human experience--\n4:37\neven if I were to push this block of ice,\n4:41\neventually it'll stop.\n4:42\nIt won't just keep going forever, even\n4:44\nassuming that this ice field is infinitely long, that ice\n4:47\nwill eventually stop.\n4:48\nOr if I throw a tennis ball.\n4:54\nThat tennis ball will eventually stop.\n4:59\nIt'll eventually grind to a halt.\n5:01\nOr if I roll a bowling ball, or if I, anything.\n5:04\nWe've never seen, at least in our human experience,\n5:06\nit looks like everything will eventually stop.\n5:09\nSo this is a very unintuitive thing to say,\n5:11\nthat something in motion will just\n5:12\nkeep going in motion indefinitely.\n5:14\nEverything in human intuition says if you want something\n5:17\nto keep going in motion, you have to keep\n5:19\nputting more force, keep putting more energy into it\n5:22\nfor it to keep going.\n5:23\nYour car won't go forever, unless you keep,\n5:25\nunless the engine keeps burning fuel to drive and consuming\n5:29\nenergy.\n5:30\nSo what are they talking about?\n5:31\nWell, in all of these examples-- and I\n5:33\nthink this is actually a pretty brilliant insight from all\n5:36\nof these fellows is that-- all of these things\n5:39\nwould have gone on forever.\n5:41\nThe ball would keep going forever.\n5:42\nThis ice block would be going on forever,\n5:44\nexcept for the fact that there are unbalanced\n5:47\nforces acting on them to stop them.\n5:50\nSo in the case of ice, even though ice on ice\n5:52\ndoesn't have a lot of friction, there\n5:54\nis some friction between these two.\n5:56\nAnd so you have, in this situation,\n5:58\nthe force of friction is going to be\n6:00\nacting against the direction of the movement of the ice.\n6:03\nAnd friction really comes from, at an atomic level--\n6:06\nso if you have the actual water molecules in a lattice\n6:10\nstructure in the ice cube, and then here are\n6:12\nthe water molecules in a lattice structure on the ice,\n6:17\non the actual kind of sea of ice that it's traveling on--\n6:20\nthey do kind of bump and grind into each other.\n6:22\nAlthough they're both smooth, there are imperfections here.\n6:25\nThey bump and grind.\n6:26\nThey generate a little bit of heat.\n6:28\nAnd they'll, essentially, be working against the movement.\n6:32\nSo there's a force of friction that's being applied to here.\n6:34\nAnd that's why it's stopping.\n6:35\nNot only a force of friction, you also\n6:37\nhave some air resistance.\n6:38\nThe ice block is going to be bumping\n6:40\ninto all sorts of air particles.\n6:42\nIt might not be noticeable at first,\n6:44\nbut it's definitely going to keep it from going on forever.\n6:47\nSame thing with the ball being tossed to the air.\n6:49\nObviously, at some point, it hits\n6:51\nthe ground because of gravity.\n6:52\nSo that's one force acting on it.\n6:54\nBut even once it hits the ground,\n6:55\nit doesn't keep rolling forever, once again,\n6:57\nbecause of the friction, especially if there's grass\n7:01\nhere.\n7:02\nThe grass is going to stop it from going.\n7:04\nAnd even while it's in the air, it's going to slow down.\n7:06\nIt's not going to have a constant velocity.\n7:08\nBecause you have all of these air particles\n7:10\nthat are going to bump into it and exert\n7:15\nforce to slow it down.\n7:17\nSo what was really brilliant about these guys\n7:19\nis that they could imagine a reality where\n7:22\nyou didn't have gravity, where you did not\n7:24\nhave air slowing things down.\n7:27\nAnd they could imagine that in that reality,\n7:30\nsomething would just keep persisting in its motion.\n7:33\nAnd the reason why Galileo, frankly, was probably good\n7:36\nat thinking about that is that he\n7:37\nstudied the orbits of planets.\n7:41\nAnd he could, or at least he's probably\n7:43\ntheorized that, hey, maybe there's no air out there.\n7:45\nAnd that maybe that's why these planets can just\n7:47\nkeep going round and round in orbit.\n7:49\nAnd I should say their speed, because their direction is\n7:54\nchanging, but their speed never slows down,\n7:56\nbecause there's nothing in the space\n7:58\nto actually slow down those planets.\n8:01\nSo anyway, hopefully you found that as fascinating as I do.\n8:04\nBecause on some level, it's super-duper obvious.\n8:06\nBut on a whole other level, it's completely not obvious,\n8:08\nespecially this moving uniformly straightforward.\n8:10\nAnd just to make the point clear,\n8:12\nif gravity disappeared, and you had no air,\n8:16\nand you threw a ball, that ball literally\n8:18\nwould keep going in that direction\n8:20\nforever, unless some other unbalanced force acted\n8:24\nto stop it.\n8:26\nAnd another way to think about it-- and this\n8:28\nis an example that you might see in everyday life-- is,\n8:32\nif I'm in an airplane that's going at a completely\n8:38\nconstant velocity and there's absolutely\n8:40\nno turbulence in the airplane.\n8:42\nSo if I'm sitting in the airplane right over here.\n8:45\nAnd it's going at a constant velocity, completely smooth,\n8:51\nno turbulence.\n8:52\nThere's really no way for me to tell whether that airplane is\n8:55\nmoving without looking out the window.\n8:57\nLet's assume that there's no windows in that airplane.\n8:59\nIt's going at a constant velocity.\n9:01\nAnd there's no turbulence.\n9:02\nAnd let's say, I can't hear anything.\n9:06\nSo I can't even hear the engines.\n9:07\nThere's no way for me to sense that the plane is moving.\n9:10\nBecause from my frame of reference,\n9:12\nit looks completely identical to if I\n9:15\nwas in that same plane that was resting on the ground.\n9:18\nAnd that's another way to think about it.\n9:20\nThat it's actually very intuitive\n9:22\nthat they're similar states, moving at a constant velocity\n9:25\nor being at rest.\n9:27\nAnd you really can't tell whether you\n9:29\nare one or the other.",

    "question_text": "Why will the Hydrogen atoms be attracted towards the center of mass if they are being attracted by each other's gravitational pull?",
    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's imagine we have a huge cloud\n0:02\nof hydrogen atoms floating in space.\n0:05\nHuge, and when I say huge cloud, huge both in distance\n0:08\nand in mass.\n0:09\nIf you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,\n0:11\nit would just be this really, really massive thing.\n0:15\nSo you have this huge cloud.\n0:16\nWell, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually\n0:20\nattracted to each other.\n0:21\nIt's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.\n0:25\nBut it would slowly affect these atoms.\n0:27\nAnd they would slowly draw close to each other.\n0:30\nIt would slowly condense.\n0:31\nThey'd slowly move towards the center\n0:34\nof mass of all of the atoms.\n0:37\nThey'd slowly move in.\n0:39\nSo if we fast forward, this cloud's\n0:42\ngoing to get denser and denser.\n0:46\nAnd the hydrogen atoms are going to start\n0:48\nbumping into each other and rubbing up against each other\n0:51\nand interacting with each other.\n0:53\nAnd so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.\n0:56\nNow remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.\n0:58\nSo the temperature is going up.\n1:03\nAnd it'll-- they'll keep condensing.\n1:05\nThey'll just keep condensing and condensing\n1:07\nuntil something really interesting happens.\n1:09\nSo let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here\n1:12\nin the center.\n1:16\nAnd there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.\n1:19\nIt's really dense.\n1:20\nI could never draw the actual number of atoms here.\n1:22\nThis is really to give you an idea.\n1:24\nThere's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,\n1:28\nfrom everything that wants to get\n1:29\nto that center of mass of our entire cloud.\n1:32\nThe temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.\n1:38\nAnd at that point, something neat happens.\n1:40\nAnd to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,\n1:43\nlet's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.\n1:46\nA hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just\n1:48\ngoing to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.\n1:49\nSo the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.\n1:50\nIf you want to think about a hydrogen atom,\n1:52\nit also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.\n1:57\nAnd let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.\n1:59\nAnd obviously this distance isn't to scale.\n2:02\nThis distance is also not to scale.\n2:04\nAtoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms\n2:05\nare actually much, much, much, much smaller\n2:07\nthan the actual radius of an atom.\n2:10\nAnd so is the electron.\n2:11\nBut anyway, this just gives you an idea.\n2:13\nSo we know from the Coulomb forces,\n2:14\nfrom electromagnetic forces, that these two positively\n2:17\ncharged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere\n2:20\nnear each other.\n2:22\nBut we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four\n2:25\nforces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,\n2:28\nthat if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures\n2:31\nand huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close\n2:35\nenough to each other, then all of a sudden,\n2:37\nthe strong force will overtake.\n2:39\nIt's much stronger than the Coulomb force.\n2:41\nAnd then these two hydrogens will actually--\n2:43\nthese nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?\n2:48\nWell, anyway, they would actually fuse together.\n2:50\nAnd so that is what actually happens\n2:53\nonce this gets hot and dense enough.\n2:57\nYou now have enough pressure and enough temperature\n2:59\nto overcome the Coulomb force and bring\n3:02\nthese protons close enough to each other for fusion\n3:05\nto occur, for fusion ignition.\n3:12\nAnd the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.\n3:14\nIt's not ignition.\n3:15\nIt's not combustion in the traditional sense.\n3:16\nIt's not like you're burning a carbon molecule\n3:20\nin the presence of oxygen.\n3:22\nIt's not combustion.\n3:23\nIt's ignition.\n3:24\nAnd the reason why it's called ignition\n3:25\nis because when two of these protons,\n3:27\nor two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus\n3:32\nhas a slightly smaller mass.\n3:35\nAnd so in the first stage of this,\n3:36\nyou actually have two protons under enough pressure--\n3:42\nobviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--\n3:44\nwith enough pressure they get close enough.\n3:46\nAnd then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.\n3:51\nOne of these guys degrades into a neutron.\n3:56\nAnd the resulting mass of the combined protons\n3:59\nis lower than the mass of each of the original.\n4:01\nBy a little bit, but that little bit of mass\n4:04\nresults in a lot of energy-- plus energy.\n4:11\nAnd this energy is why we call it ignition.\n4:13\nAnd so what this energy does is it provides\n4:16\na little bit of outward pressure,\n4:17\nso that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.\n4:21\nSo once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.\n4:24\nAnd then that energy provides outward pressure\n4:26\nto balance what is now a star.\n4:30\nSo now we are at where we actually\n4:32\nhave the ignition at the center.\n4:35\nWe have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying\n4:39\nto get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.\n4:43\nNow, what is the hydrogen being fused into?\n4:46\nWell, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just\n4:50\nkind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens\n4:54\nin stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.\n5:00\nI have trouble spelling.\n5:01\nWhich is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.\n5:03\nThis is still hydrogen because it\n5:04\nhas one proton and one neutron now.\n5:07\nIt is not helium yet.\n5:08\nThis does not have two-- it does not have two protons.\n5:12\nBut then the deuterium keeps fusing.\n5:14\nAnd then we eventually end up with helium.\n5:19\nAnd we can even see that on the periodic table.\n5:21\nOh, I lost my periodic table.\n5:22\nWell, I'll show you the next video.\n5:23\nBut we know hydrogen in its atomic state\n5:30\nhas an atomic number of 1.\n5:32\nAnd it also has a mass of 1.\n5:34\nIt only has one nucleon in its nucleus.\n5:38\nBut it's being fused.\n5:39\nIt goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,\n5:42\nwhich is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.\n5:46\nAnd then that eventually gets fused--\n5:48\nand I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--\n5:50\ninto helium.\n5:51\nAnd by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.\n5:56\nSo it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,\n5:58\nin particular, that isotope of helium--\n6:00\nit has an atomic mass of 4.\n6:03\nAnd this process releases a ton of energy.\n6:06\nBecause the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced\n6:09\nis slightly lower than four times the atomic mass\n6:15\nof each of the constituent hydrogens.\n6:17\nSo all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it\n6:21\nneeds super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--\n6:24\nkeeps the star from collapsing.\n6:28\nAnd once a star is in this stage,\n6:31\nonce it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen\n6:35\nin its core, where the pressure and the temperature\n6:37\nis the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.\n6:41\nThis is now a main sequence star.\n6:48\nAnd that's actually where the sun is right now.\n6:50\nNow there's questions of, well, what if there just\n6:53\nwasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?\n6:56\nAnd there actually are things that\n6:57\nnever get to quite that threshold\n6:59\nto fuse all the way into helium.\n7:00\nThere are a few things that don't quite\n7:02\nmake the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.\n7:05\nSo they are generating some of their heat.\n7:06\nOr there are even smaller objects\n7:08\nthat just get to the point there's\n7:10\na huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually\n7:13\noccurring inside of the core.\n7:15\nAnd something like Jupiter would be an example.\n7:17\nAnd you could go several masses above Jupiter\n7:20\nwhere you get something like that.\n7:21\nSo you have to reach a certain threshold\n7:23\nwhere the mass, where the pressure and the temperature\n7:25\ndue to the heavy mass, get so large that you\n7:27\nstart this fusion.\n7:28\nAnd-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,\n7:31\nthe slower the fusion will occur.\n7:33\nBut if you're super massive, the fusion\n7:35\nwill occur really, really fast.\n7:37\nSo that's the general idea of just how stars get formed\n7:40\nand why they don't collapse on themselves\n7:43\nand why they are these kind of balls\n7:45\nof fusion reactions existing in the universe.\n7:48\nIn the next few videos, we'll talk\n7:50\nabout what happens once that hydrogen fuel in the core\n7:54\nstarts to run out.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nAt the beginning of the week, Stewart's checking account\n0:03\nhad a balance of negative $15.08.\n0:07\nOn Monday morning, he deposited a check for $426.90.\n0:12\nOn Tuesday morning, he deposited another check for $100.\n0:17\nHow much was in Stewart's checking account\n0:19\nafter the second deposit, so after both of these deposits\n0:23\nright over here.\n0:25\nSo he starts off with a negative balance.\n0:27\nSo a negative balance means that he's\n0:28\noverdrawn his checking account.\n0:30\nHe actually owes the bank money now.\n0:32\nLuckily, he's now going to put some money in his bank account.\n0:35\nSo he'll actually have a positive balance\n0:37\nin his checking account.\n0:38\nSo he's starts off with the negative $15.08.\n0:43\nAnd then to that, he adds $426.90.\n0:50\nAnd then he adds another $100.\n0:55\nSo he started off with negative $15.08.\n0:59\nAnd then to that, he adds $426.90 and $100.\n1:04\nSo that's $526.90.\n1:09\nAnd so how much is going to have in his bank account?\n1:11\nHe started owing $15.08, and then he's going to add $526.90.\n1:18\nSo one way to visualize it is, if you think\n1:21\nabout it on a number line, if this is 0 right over here,\n1:27\nhe's going to start off at negative $15.08.\n1:30\nBut then he's going to add $526.\n1:35\nSo this right over here, this is $15.08 to the left.\n1:40\nThat's how much he owes.\n1:42\nAnd to that, he's going to add $526.\n1:45\nSo I'm not drawing this to scale.\n1:47\nBut to that, he is going to add $526.90.\n1:53\nSo the amount that he's going to be in the positive is going\n1:56\nto be $526.90 minus the $15.08.\n2:01\nIt's essentially going to be this length right over here.\n2:07\nThat's how much he's going to be in the positive.\n2:09\nAnd that's going to be $526.90 minus $15.08.\n2:16\nSo that's going to be, and we can even just rewrite this\n2:20\nso it actually looks exactly like that.\n2:22\nThat's exactly the same thing as $526.90 minus--\n2:29\nadding a negative is the same thing as subtracting\n2:31\na positive-- minus $15.08.\n2:34\nAnd this is-- I will do this in another color--\n2:37\n$526.90 minus $15.08.\n2:44\nLet's see, 0 is less than 8.\n2:46\nLet's make that a 10 and borrow from this 9.\n2:49\nSo that becomes an 8, or I guess you could say we're regrouping.\n2:51\nNow, everything up here is larger than everything there.\n2:54\nSo 10 minus 8 is 2.\n2:56\n8 minus 0 is 8.\n2:58\nWe have our decimal.\n2:59\n6 minus 5 is 1.\n3:01\n2 minus 1 is 1.\n3:03\nAnd then you have 5 minus nothing.\n3:06\nSo he is left with $511.82 after his second deposit.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWhat I want to do is give you a broad overview of all of the\n0:02\nwars that France was in at this time.\n0:05\nAnd then talk about in a little bit more detail exactly\n0:08\nwhat Napoleon was up to.\n0:09\nAnd his role in either beginning or ending many of\n0:13\nthese wars.\n0:14\nSo you might remember from 1792 to 1797, you had your war\n0:22\nof the First Coalition.\n0:27\nAnd the players there were Prussia,\n0:33\nAustria, and Great Britain.\n0:37\nI'll just write Britain for short.\n0:41\nAnd this was essentially started by the French.\n0:43\nYou might remember, King Louis XVI was alive then.\n0:46\nHe supported the war, because he thought that they would\n0:49\nlose and maybe reinstate him.\n0:51\nOr that it would make him popular.\n0:53\nThe revolutionaries liked the war because they wanted to\n0:55\nspread the Revolution.\n0:57\nAnd you might remember it ended at the Treaty of Campo\n1:00\nFormio in 1797, due mainly to Napoleon's victories in Italy.\n1:14\nAt that time, he was in charge of the Italian campaign.\n1:17\nAnd the government of France at that\n1:20\ntime was the Directory.\n1:22\nIn power to a large degree because of Napoleon's ability\n1:26\nto defend them.\n1:27\nThen from 1798-- let me do this in a different color--\n1:33\nfrom 1798 to 1802, you have the Second Coalition.\n1:42\nNow you might immediately see, Napoleon took power\n1:44\nat the end of 1799.\n1:46\nSo this war spanned some of the Directory being in control\n1:50\nand some of Napoleon as First Consul being in control.\n1:55\nAnd here the players-- once again you have Austria and\n2:01\nGreat Britain-- they tend to be always at war with France\n2:05\nat this period, especially Great Britain.\n2:07\nAnd instead of Prussia, you have Russia.\n2:10\nAnd actually, just to help you visualize what the Austrian\n2:14\nEmpire looked like at this time-- and the Prussian\n2:15\nEmpire, this map doesn't do it justice.\n2:18\nLet me go down to this map.\n2:21\nThat's in 1810.\n2:22\nLet me go a little bit earlier here.\n2:25\nThis is in 1805.\n2:27\nAnd I'll draw the boundaries a little bit\n2:28\nbolder than they did.\n2:30\nSo this is France.\n2:32\nThese are the boundaries of France.\n2:35\nActually, it was able to take some territory\n2:39\nin what is now Italy.\n2:44\nI could do the whole boundary if you like, but I think you\n2:47\nget the idea.\n2:48\nBut the one empire that existed then that doesn't\n2:51\nexist in its current form, was Prussia.\n2:53\nDoesn't even exist at all.\n2:54\nThere is no Prussian Empire, or Prussian nation, or the\n2:57\ncountry of Prussia anymore.\n3:00\nYou can see there it had some overlap with Germany, some\n3:03\noverlap with Poland, some other countries, won't go into\n3:06\ndetail there.\n3:06\nThen you have the Austrian Empire.\n3:12\nAustrian Empire is right over there.\n3:16\nAs you can see, it encompasses much more than just the modern\n3:22\nnation or country of Austria.\n3:24\nThen you have the Russian Empire, which, give or take,\n3:27\nlooks not too different than Russia today.\n3:30\nBut the big difference between the world-- there's many\n3:33\ndifferences-- between the world now and the world then\n3:36\nwas that there was no nation of Germany.\n3:39\nYou had a bunch of people speaking German, but they were\n3:42\ndivided into a bunch of small little states.\n3:44\nThis map doesn't show it.\n3:45\nSome of them were under Austrian control, some of them\n3:47\nwere under Prussian control.\n3:49\nAnd this loose confederation of German kingdoms and states,\n3:54\nthis was called the Holy Roman Empire.\n3:57\nLet me write that down.\n4:04\nAnd as Voltaire famously said, they were neither holy, nor\n4:08\nRoman-- they didn't speak Latin, they weren't Italian,\n4:10\nthey were German.\n4:11\nIt wasn't holy, this wasn't controlled\n4:14\nby a religious figure.\n4:16\nAnd it wasn't an empire, it wasn't a tightly-controlled\n4:19\nstate that was kind of expanding its boundaries.\n4:21\nIt was just a loose confederation of kingdoms.\n4:23\nSo that gives you a visualization of what the\n4:25\nworld looked like right then.\n4:28\nSo with that in mind, let me go back to my overview.\n4:35\nRight there.\n4:36\nAnd then the Second Coalition, in 1801 you had\n4:45\nthe Treaty of Luneville.\n4:48\nOnce again, this was a defeat of the Austrians, mainly due\n4:55\nto the military capabilities.\n4:56\nNapoleon was now in charge of France.\n4:59\nBut he led once again, an Italian\n5:01\ncampaign against the Austrians.\n5:06\nThis is his victory in Marengo right there.\n5:09\nI'll go into a little more detail on that.\n5:10\nAnd that essentially declared victory on Austria, allowed\n5:13\nNapoleon to take more territory\n5:18\nalong the Italian peninsula.\n5:20\nYou can see it right there.\n5:24\nAnd then later he had the Treaty of Amiens with the\n5:29\nBritish in 1802.\n5:31\nAnd that really ended the coalition.\n5:33\nI guess you could say the coalition ended in 1801,\n5:35\nbecause Austria was out of it.\n5:36\nRussia was kind of just passively observing.\n5:38\nThey participated.\n5:39\nBut they didn't really give or take or lose anything.\n5:42\nAnd then I could say at this point the United Kingdom,\n5:47\nessentially I guess the best explanation of why that it was\n5:50\nwar fatigue.\n5:51\nBut we'll see that they weren't tired for long.\n5:53\nBecause then in May of 1803, you have the beginning of your\n5:59\nThird Coalition .\n6:00\nAnd then I'll go to a little bit more detail about this.\n6:03\nThe Third Coalition, Britain declares war on what we could\n6:07\ncall the French Empire.\n6:09\nAnd this isn't going to end until 1805.\n6:12\nSo you can see, Great Britain is essentially at war almost\n6:17\ncontinuously.\n6:19\nThere's a few gaps give or take.\n6:20\nBut there's always this tension.\n6:22\nThis is the Third Coalition.\n6:27\nAnd once again, I could write the United Kingdom if you\n6:31\nlike, because they actually now are the United Kingdom of\n6:34\nGreat Britain and Ireland.\n6:37\nYou have the United Kingdom in there, we\n6:38\nhave Russia in there.\n6:42\nAnd once again, we have Austria.\n6:43\nAnd there were other players.\n6:45\nThere was Portugal.\n6:45\nBut these were the prime players.\n6:48\nAnd we'll see in this video that this, the war of the\n6:52\nThird Coalition, really ended with Napoleon being the\n6:56\ndominant power in Europe.\n6:58\nAnd ended with him essentially thinking that he is\n7:01\nunstoppable.\n7:02\nSo I'll do a little bit more detail on that.\n7:04\nThis resulted in 1805, with the then Emperor Napoleon.\n7:09\nAnd we'll talk about how he became emperor.\n7:11\nBut in 1805, Napoleon-- maybe I should say 1806, because\n7:16\nthis ended at the end of 1805-- Napoleon views himself\n7:21\nas unstoppable, as invincible.\n7:27\nHe got some good victories that fed his\n7:30\nalready large ego.\n7:32\nSo with this as an overview, let's review a little bit of\n7:36\nthe life of Napoleon and the roles that he directly played\n7:39\nin pretty much all of these conflicts.\n7:43\nSo the first time we heard about Napoleon was in 1793.\n7:47\nAnd I'll just draw it right here.\n7:48\nYou're might remember, there were all of these Royalist\n7:51\ninsurrections going on against the revolutionary government.\n7:54\nAnd they had this bright artillery captain in Toulon\n7:58\nwho put down an uprising there in 1793.\n8:01\nHe got some, I guess you could say, France-wide, or\n8:06\nnationwide fame from doing that.\n8:09\nThen in 1795, you might remember, the Directory was\n8:14\ntrying to get formed in Paris.\n8:16\nSo this is 1793.\n8:19\nThen in 1795-- let me do a better color than that.\n8:24\nThat's hard to read.\n8:26\nIn 1795, he defended the Tuileries by essentially\n8:31\nsending out that grapeshot and mowing down people to keep the\n8:36\nRoyalists from taking out the revolutionary government.\n8:39\nSo once again, hugely, hugely popular.\n8:44\nSo all of that was occurring during the war\n8:46\nof the First Coalition.\n8:48\nAnd then Napoleon was made the general in charge of the\n8:53\nItalian campaign.\n8:54\nAnd in 1797, he was essentially able to end the\n9:00\nwar of the First Coalition in a victorious way for France by\n9:04\ndefeating Austria and Italy.\n9:05\nAnd that ended the First Coalition\n9:07\nwith the Campo Formio.\n9:08\nThis was Napoleon.\n9:15\nThen, you might remember, OK, he's this hugely popular guy.\n9:19\nHe actually started publishing some newspapers.\n9:22\nAnd he actually sent some military generals to put down\n9:25\nfurther counter revolutions on the part of the Royalists.\n9:29\nSo he became even more and more popular.\n9:32\nAnd the Directory was a little bit afraid\n9:34\nof him at this point.\n9:35\nSo they said, hey why don't you go do whatever you want.\n9:37\nAnd that's when Napoleon left from Toulon\n9:40\nand he went to Egypt.\n9:43\nHe went to Egypt with his visions of grandeur, where he\n9:47\ndid all of the damage down there.\n9:49\nAnd killed and won multiple wars against the Ottomans in\n9:55\nboth Egypt and Syria.\n9:56\nBut unfortunately for him, his good friend Horatio Nelson\n10:01\ndestroyed his whole fleet in the Battle of the Nile.\n10:04\nHoratio-- let me draw that in a darker color.\n10:08\nSo that is Horatio Nelson destroyed his\n10:13\nentire fleet there.\n10:14\nSo they were stranded.\n10:15\nIn 1799, Napoleon was essentially able to abandon\n10:21\nall of his troops and then come back to\n10:23\nFrance on his own.\n10:25\nSo this is in 1799, Napoleon makes his way back to France.\n10:34\nAnd then we saw in the last video, he takes power with two\n10:37\nof the directors as the three consuls of France.\n10:41\nBut in short order, he is able to declare himself as First\n10:45\nConsul in 1799.\n10:48\nThis is hard to read.\n11:00\nAnd is essentially the dictator, or the authoritarian\n11:05\nruler, of France.\n11:07\nBut all of while this was happening, remember, this was\n11:09\nall during this war of the Second Coalition.\n11:12\nIn 1798, he wasn't much help in that war, he was out in\n11:16\nEgypt doing all of these silly things.\n11:18\nThey were at war with Britain, that's why Horatio Nelson went\n11:21\nand destroyed his fleet.\n11:24\nBut even after he takes power at the end of 1799 or early\n11:28\n1800, they're still at war.\n11:31\nSo Napoleon, he decides to take charge.\n11:34\nSo he leads the troops across the Alps into Italy.\n11:40\nAnd once again, this pattern is emerging.\n11:44\nAnd this one actually wasn't very clear in the beginning\n11:46\nthat it was going to go his way.\n11:47\nThe Italian campaign, it started very badly.\n11:50\nBut eventually, he was able to win against, once again, the\n11:53\nAustrians at the Battle of Marengo and Hohenlinden.\n11:57\nI know I'm probably not saying all of these well.\n12:00\nBut once again, through Napoleon directly leading the\n12:04\ntroops, he was able to end the war of the Second Coalition.\n12:08\nAnd then the United Kingdom, or Great Britain, however you\n12:11\nwant to call it-- many times when people use the word Great\n12:17\nBritain it's referring to the entire United Kingdom of Great\n12:21\nBritain and Ireland.\n12:22\nIf you wanted to be formal, Great Britain refers just to\n12:24\nthe island of Great Britain that has England and Scotland\n12:27\nand Wales on it, while this is Ireland.\n12:30\nBut I don't feel like keep repeatedly saying United\n12:33\nKingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which was now united\n12:37\nin the early 1800s.\n12:38\nI'll just keep saying Great Britain.\n12:41\nBut there was just fatigue.\n12:42\nSo the war essentially ended with Great Britain as well.\n12:46\nThis is, as we said before, this was the Treaty of Amiens.\n12:51\nBut very, very, very, short-lived peace.\n12:55\nBecause in 1803, with Napoleon still in power, the Third\n13:02\nCoalition formed.\n13:03\nAnd in the next video, we're going to see exactly how\n13:06\nNapoleon was able to once again be victorious over these\n13:11\npowers to become essentially, in his mind, invincible.",

magnetic field.\n0:12\nSo there is some type of symmetry here.\n0:15\nAnd as we'll learn later when we learn our calculus and we\n0:18\ndo this in a slightly more rigorous way, we'll see that\n0:25\nmagnetic fields and electric fields are actually two sides\n0:29\nof the same coin, of electromagnetic fields.\n0:32\nBut anyway, we won't worry about that now.\n0:33\nAnd I think it's enough to ponder right now that a\n0:36\ncurrent can actually induce a magnetic field.\n0:39\nAnd actually, just a moving electron\n0:40\ncreates a magnetic field.\n0:42\nAnd it does it in a surface of a sphere-- I won't go into all\n0:45\nthat right now.\n0:45\nBecause the math gets a little bit fancy there.\n0:47\nBut what you might encounter in your standard high school\n0:50\nphysics class-- that's not getting deeply into vector\n0:52\ncalculus-- is that if you just have a wire--\n0:57\nlet me draw a wire.\n0:58\nThat's my wire.\n1:00\nAnd it's carrying some current I, it turns out that this wire\n1:10\nwill generate a magnetic field.\n1:12\nAnd the shape of that magnetic field is going to be\n1:14\nco-centric circles around this wire.\n1:19\nLet me see if I can draw that.\n1:22\nSo here I'll draw it just like how I do when I try to do\n1:25\nrotations of solids in the calculus video.\n1:29\nSo the magnetic field would go behind and in front and it\n1:34\ngoes like that.\n1:37\nOr another way you can think about it is if-- let's go down\n1:40\nhere-- is on the left side of this wire.\n1:42\nIf you say that the wire's in the plane of this video, the\n1:45\nmagnetic field is popping out of your screen.\n1:52\nAnd on this side, on the right side, the magnetic field is\n1:55\npopping into the screen.\n1:57\nIt's going into the screen.\n2:00\nAnd you could imagine that, right?\n2:01\nYou could imagine if, on this drawing up here, you could say\n2:04\nthis is where it intersects the screen.\n2:06\nAll of this is kind of behind the screen.\n2:09\nAnd all of this is in front of the screen.\n2:11\nAnd this is where it's popping out.\n2:13\nAnd this is where it's popping into the screen.\n2:15\nHopefully that makes a little bit of sense.\n2:16\nAnd how did I know that it's rotating this way?\n2:20\nWell, it actually does come out of the cross product when\n2:22\nyou do it with a regular charge and all of that.\n2:24\nBut we're not going to go into that right now.\n2:26\nAnd so there's a different right hand rule\n2:28\nthat you can use.\n2:29\nAnd it's literally you hold this wire, or you imagine\n2:34\nholding this wire, with your right hand with your thumb\n2:37\ngoing in the direction of the current.\n2:39\nAnd if you hold this wire with your thumb going in the\n2:42\ndirection of the current, your fingers are going to go in the\n2:44\ndirection of the magnetic field.\n2:47\nSo let me see if I can draw that.\n2:51\nI will draw it in blue.\n2:52\nSo if this is my thumb, my thumb is going along the top\n2:58\nof the wire.\n3:00\nAnd then my hand is curling around the wire.\n3:06\nThose are my knuckles.\n3:06\nThose are the veins on my hand.\n3:09\nThis is my nail.\n3:12\nSo as you can see, if I was holding that same wire-- let\n3:16\nme draw the wire.\n3:17\nSo if I was holding that same wire, we see that my thumb is\n3:21\ngoing in the direction of the current.\n3:22\nSo this is a slightly new thing to memorize.\n3:25\nAnd what is the magnetic field doing?\n3:27\nWell, it's going in the direction of my fingers.\n3:30\nMy fingers are popping out on this side of the wire.\n3:33\nThey're coming out on this side of the wire.\n3:35\nAnd they're going in, or at least my hand is\n3:37\ngoing in, on that side.\n3:39\nIt's going into the screen.\n3:42\nHopefully that makes sense.\n3:44\nNow, how can we quantify?\n3:46\nWell, before we quantify, let's get a little bit more of\n3:48\nthe intuition of what's happening.\n3:49\nIt turns out that the closer you get to the wire, the\n3:52\nstronger the magnetic field, and the further you get out,\n3:56\nthe weaker the magnetic field.\n3:57\nAnd that kind of makes sense if you imagine the magnetic\n4:00\nfield spreading out.\n4:04\nI don't want to go into too sophisticated analogies.\n4:06\nBut if you imagine the magnetic field spreading out,\n4:08\nand as it goes further and further out it kind of gets\n4:10\ndistributed over a wider and wider circumference.\n4:12\nAnd actually the formula I'm going to give you kind of has\n4:15\na taste for that.\n4:16\nSo the formula for the magnetic field-- and it really\n4:20\nis defined with a cross product and things like that,\n4:23\nbut for our purposes we won't worry about that.\n4:25\nYou'll just have to know that this is the shape if the\n4:29\ncurrent is going in that direction.\n4:30\nAnd, of course, if the current was going downwards then the\n4:33\nmagnetic field would just reverse directions.\n4:35\nBut it would still be in co-centric\n4:36\ncircles around the wire.\n4:38\nBut anyway, what is the magnitude of that field?\n4:42\nThe magnitude of that magnetic field is equal to mu-- which\n4:49\nis a Greek letter, which I will explain in a second--\n4:52\ntimes the current divided by 2 pi r.\n4:58\nSo this has a little bit of a feel for what\n5:00\nI was saying before.\n5:01\nThat the further you go out-- where r is how far you are\n5:04\nfrom the wire-- the further you go out, if r gets bigger,\n5:09\nthe magnitude of the magnetic field is going to get weaker.\n5:12\nAnd this 2 pi r, that looks a lot like the\n5:14\ncircumference of a circle.\n5:16\nSo that gives you a taste for it.\n5:17\nI know I haven't proved anything rigorously.\n5:20\nBut it at least gives you a sense of, look there's a\n5:22\nlittle formula for\n5:23\ncircumference of a circle here.\n5:24\nAnd that kind of makes sense, right?\n5:25\nBecause the magnetic field at that point\n5:27\nis kind of a circle.\n5:29\nThe magnitude is equal at an equal radius around that wire.\n5:33\nNow what is this mu, this thing that looks like a u?\n5:36\nWell, that's the permeability of the material\n5:39\nthat the wire's in.\n5:40\nSo the magnetic field is actually going to have a\n5:41\ndifferent strength depending on whether this wire is going\n5:44\nthrough rubber, whether it's going through a vacuum, or\n5:48\nair, or metal, or water.\n5:50\nAnd for the purposes of your high school physics class, we\n5:54\nassume that it's going through air normally.\n5:56\nAnd the value for air is pretty close to\n6:01\nthe value for a vacuum.\n6:03\nAnd it's called the permeability of a vacuum.\n6:05\nAnd I forget what that value is.\n6:07\nI could look it up.\n6:08\nBut it actually turns out that your\n6:09\ncalculator has that value.\n6:11\nSo let's do a problem, just to put some\n6:12\nnumbers to the formula.\n6:14\nSo let's say I had this current and it is-- I don't\n6:19\nknow, the current is equal to-- I'm going\n6:22\nto make up a number.\n6:22\n2 amperes.\n6:25\nAnd let's say that I just pick a point right here that is--\n6:33\nlet's say that that's 3 meters away\n6:36\nfrom the wire in question.\n6:37\nSo my question to you is what is the magnitude in the\n6:39\ndirection of the magnetic field right there?\n6:43\nWell, the magnitude is easy.\n6:45\nWe just substitute in this equation.\n6:46\nSo the magnitude of the magnetic field at this point\n6:50\nis equal to-- and we assume that the wire's going through\n6:53\nair or a vacuum-- the permeability of free space--\n6:57\nthat's just a constant, though it looks fancy-- times the\n6:59\ncurrent times 2 amperes divided by 2 pi r.\n7:04\nWhat's r?\n7:05\nIt's 3 meters.\n7:07\nSo 2 pi times 3.\n7:09\nSo it equals the permeability of free space.\n7:13\nSo let's see.\n7:13\nThe 2 and the 2 cancel out over 3 pi.\n7:16\nSo how do we calculate that?\n7:18\nWell, we get out our trusty TI-85 calculator.\n7:24\nAnd I think you'll be maybe pleasantly surprised or\n7:28\nshocked to realize that-- I deleted everything just so you\n7:31\ncan see how I get there-- that it actually has the\n7:34\npermeability of free space stored in it.\n7:36\nSo what you do is you go to second and you press constant,\n7:39\nwhich is the 4 button.\n7:41\nIt's in the built-in constants.\n7:43\nLet's see, it's not one of those.\n7:44\nYou press more.\n7:46\nIt's not one of those, press more.\n7:48\nOh look at that.\n7:49\nMu not.\n7:50\nThe permeability of free space.\n7:52\nThat's what I need.\n7:54\nAnd I have to divide it by 3 pi.\n7:57\nDivide it by 3-- and then where is pi?\n8:00\nThere it is.\n8:01\nIt's over the power sign.\n8:03\nDivided by 3 pi.\n8:05\nIt equals 1.3 times 10 to the negative seventh.\n8:10\nIt's going to be teslas.\n8:11\nThe magnetic field is going to be equal to 1.3 times 10 to\n8:17\nthe minus seventh teslas.\n8:20\nSo it's a fairly weak magnetic field.\n8:23\nAnd that's why you don't have metal objects being thrown\n8:27\naround by the wires behind your television set.\n8:31\nBut anyway, hopefully that gives you a little bit-- and\n8:33\njust so you know how it all fits together.\n8:36\nWe're saying that these moving charges, not only can they be\n8:40\naffected by a magnetic field, not only can a current be\n8:42\naffected by a magnetic field or just a moving charge, it\n8:45\nactually creates them.\n8:47\nAnd that kind of creates a little bit of symmetry in your\n8:49\nhead, hopefully.\n8:50\nBecause that was also true of electric field.\n8:52\nA charge, a stationary charge, is obviously pulled or pushed\n8:57\nby a static electric field.\n8:58\nAnd it also creates its own static electric field.\n9:01\nSo it's always in the back of your mind.\n9:03\nBecause if you keep studying physics, you're going to\n9:05\nactually prove to yourself that electric and magnetic\n9:09\nfields are two sides of the same coin.\n9:11\nAnd it just looks like a magnetic field when you're in\n9:14\na different frame of reference, When something is\n9:15\nwhizzing past you.\n9:17\nWhile if you were whizzing along with it, then that thing\n9:19\nwould look static.\n9:20\nAnd then it might look a little bit more like an\n9:21\nelectric field.\n9:22\nBut anyway, I'll leave you there now.\n9:25\nAnd in the next video I will show you what happens when we\n9:29\nhave two wires carrying current\n9:33\nparallel to each other.\n9:34\nAnd you might guess that they might actually attract or\n9:37\nrepel each other.\n9:38\nAnyway, I'll see you in the next video.",

    "question_type": "MCQ",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n(piano playing)\n0:04\nSteven: We're looking at one of the single canvases from a series of canvases\n0:08\nof the Campbell Soup Cans by Andy Warhol from 1962\n0:12\nat the Museum of Modern Art.\n0:13\nAnd one of the really important questions that comes up about,\n0:16\nespecially modern art, is well, why is this art?\n0:21\nSal: When you ask me that a bunch of things kind of surface in my brain.\n0:24\nIt does evoke something in me so I'm inclined to say yes,\n0:28\nbut then there's a bunch of other things that say well,\n0:30\nif I didn't see this in a museum and if I just saw this\n0:32\nin the marketing department of Campbell's Soup,\n0:35\nwould you be viewing it differently?\n0:37\nSteven: Because it's advertising then. Sal: Yes.\n0:38\nSteven: But in the context of the museum or in the context\n0:41\nof Andy Warhol's studio, it's not quite advertising, right?\n0:44\nSal: Even if it's the exact same thing. Steven: Yeah.\n0:47\nSal: And the idea here is by putting it in the museum\n0:50\nit's saying look at this in a different way.\n0:52\nSteven: Well that's right, it really does relocate it,\n0:54\nit does change the meaning, it does transform it,\n0:57\nand that's really one of the central ideas of modern art\n1:00\nis that you can take something that's not necessarily based\n1:03\nin technical skill, because I don't think you would say\n1:05\nthat this is beautifully rendered. Sal: Right.\n1:08\nSteven: But it relocates it and makes us think about it in a different way.\n1:11\nSal: And so, I guess he would get credit for taking something\n1:14\nthat was very, almost mundane, something you see in everyone's cupboard,\n1:19\nand making it a focal point like you should pay attention to this thing.\n1:23\nSteven: I think that's exactly right and I think that he's doing it\n1:26\nabout a subject that was about as low a subject as one could go.\n1:31\nI mean cheap advertising art was something that was so far away\n1:34\nfrom fine art from the great masters and then to focus on something\n1:38\nas lowly as a can of soup, and cream of chicken no less, right? (laughs)\n1:44\nSal: A lot of it is, if he did it 50 years earlier,\n1:47\npeople would have thought this guy's a quack\n1:49\nand if he did it now they'd think he was just derivative and...\n1:52\nIt was really just that time where people happened to think this was art.\n1:57\nSteven: I think that that's right.\n1:59\nIn 1962, what Warhol is doing is he's saying\n2:02\nwhat is it about our culture that is really authentic and important?\n2:06\nAnd it was about mass production, it was about factories.\n2:09\nHe in a sense said let's not be looking at nature\n2:13\nas if we were still an agrarian culture, we're now an industrial culture.\n2:16\nWhat is the stuff of our visual world now?\n2:19\nSal: I think I'm 80 percent there.\n2:21\nI remember in college there was a student run art exhibit\n2:24\nand as a prank a student actually put a little podium there\n2:28\nand put his lunch tray.\n2:30\nHe put a little placard next to it, you know, lunch tray on Saturday\n2:33\nor something is what he called it.\n2:34\nSo he did it as a prank and everyone thought it was really funny\n2:37\nbut to some degree it's kind of a sign that maybe what he did was art.\n2:40\nSteven: Well I think that's why it was funny\n2:42\nbecause it was so close, right?\n2:43\nSal: And to some degree when someone took a lunch tray\n2:45\nand gave it the proper lighting and gave it a podium to look at it\n2:49\nand wrote a whole description about it, I did view the lunch tray\n2:51\nin a different way.\n2:52\nThat's kind of the same idea, that something\n2:54\nthat's such a mundane thing but you use it everyday.\n2:56\nI mean, what would you say to that?\n2:58\nWas that a prank or was that art?\n3:00\nSteven: I think it is a prank but it's also very close\n3:02\nto some important art that had been made earlier in the century.\n3:04\nHe had license to do that because of somebody named Marcel Duchamp.\n3:08\nIn fact, Warhol had in a sense the same kind of license\n3:11\nto not focus on the making of something, not focus on the brushwork,\n3:15\nnot focus on the composition, not focus on the color,\n3:18\nbut focus on the refocusing of ideas.\n3:21\nSal: And the reason why we talk about Warhol or Duchamp\n3:25\nor any of these people is that, as you said,\n3:27\nit's not that they did something technically profound.\n3:29\nObviously Campbell Soup's marketing department had already done\n3:32\nsomething as equally as profound, it's more that they were the people\n3:37\nwho looked at the world in a slightly different way and highlighted that.\n3:41\nSteven: Well I think that that's right.\n3:42\nWarhol is also very consciously working towards\n3:46\nasking the same questions that the prankster at your school was asking.\n3:49\nHe's saying can this be art?\n3:52\nAnd in fact he's really pushing it.\n3:54\nLook at the painting closely for a moment.\n3:55\nThis is one of the last paintings that he's actually painted.\n3:58\nHe's really defined the calligraphy of this Campbell's,\n4:01\nhe's really sort of rendered the reflection of the tin at the top.\n4:05\nBut then he stopped and he said, I don't want to paint the fleur de lis.\n4:08\nYou see those little fleur de lis down at the bottom.\n4:11\nI don't want to paint those.\n4:12\nSo he actually had a little rubber stamp made of them\n4:14\nand actually sort of placed them down mechanically.\n4:17\nWhat does that mean for an artist then,\n4:19\nto say I don't even want to bother to paint these?\n4:21\nI'm just going to find a mechanical process to make this easier.\n4:24\nWarhol is doing something I think which is important\n4:26\nwhich is reflecting the way that we manufacture,\n4:29\nthe way that we construct our world.\n4:31\nThink about the things that we surround ourselves with,\n4:35\nalmost everything was made in a factory.\n4:37\nAlmost nothing is singular in the world anymore.\n4:40\nIt's not a world that we would normally find beautiful.\n4:43\nSal: I don't know, sometimes I feel and correct me if I'm wrong,\n4:45\nthat a decision was made that Warhol was interesting or great\n4:49\nand then people will interpret his stuff to justify his greatness.\n4:53\nThat oh look, he used a printer instead of drawing it\n4:58\nwhich shows that he was reflecting the industrial or whatever,\n5:01\nbut if he had done it the other way, if he had hand drawn it\n5:04\nor hand drawn it with his elbow you know, or finger painted it or something\n5:08\npeople would say oh isn't this tremendous because we normally\n5:10\nwould see this thing printed by a machine and now he did it with his hands.\n5:13\nHow much do you think that is the case or am I just being cynical?\n5:16\nSteven: Well no, I think that there's value in a certain degree of cynicism\n5:20\nand I think that in some ways what we're really talking about here\n5:24\nis what does it mean to be an avant-garde artist?\n5:26\nWhat does it mean to sort of change the language of art\n5:29\nand to try to find ways that art relates to our historical moment\n5:33\nin some really direct and authentic way?\n5:36\nSal: And maybe it's easy for me to say this because\n5:38\nI remember looking at this when I took 5th grade art class,\n5:43\nAndy Warhol and all of that, so now it seems almost not that unique\n5:47\nbut in '62 what I'm hearing is that Warhol was really noteworthy\n5:51\nbecause he really did push people's thinking.\n5:53\nSteven: I think that Warhol was looking for, in 1962, a kind of subject matter\n5:58\nthat was completely outside of the scope of that we could consider fine art.\n6:02\nOne of his contemporaries, Roy Lichtenstein,\n6:04\nwas asked what pop art was and he said,\n6:06\n\"Well we were looking for subject matter that was so despicable,\n6:10\n\"that was so low, that nobody could possibly believe that it was really art.\"\n6:14\nAnd I think you're right, I think now we look at it\n6:16\nand it's so much a part of our visual culture that we immediately accept it.\n6:20\nBut I think that it's really interesting to retrieve\n6:22\njust how shocking and radical that was.\n6:25\nSal: This is fascinating.\n6:26\nIt seems like there's a lot of potential there,\n6:29\nthat stuff that's pseudo-art made for other purposes,\n6:32\nfor commercial purposes but if you kind of shine a light on it,\n6:35\nin the way that a light has been shone on this, that it does...\n6:39\nIn your mind would that cross the barrier into being art?\n6:43\nSteven: Well I think that, you mentioned before,\n6:45\nthat if somebody was doing this now it would feel really derivative.\n6:48\nAnd I think that that's right.\n6:49\nI think it underscores just how hard it is to find in our culture now,\n6:54\nways of making us see the world in new ways.\n6:57\nSal: Fascinating.\n6:59\n(piano playing)",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWhere we left off in the last video,\n0:02\nI think we were getting a reasonably good appreciation\n0:04\nfor how huge the sun is, especially\n0:07\nrelative to the Earth, and how far the Earth is away\n0:12\nfrom the sun.\n0:12\nThat most of these diagrams that we see in science textbooks--\n0:16\nthey don't give justice.\n0:17\nIn fact, when I showed this sun over here\n0:20\nthat was about five or six inches across,\n0:22\nI said Earth would be just this little speck, about 40 feet.\n0:27\nIt wouldn't be this distance.\n0:28\nIt would be about 40 feet to the left or the right.\n0:30\nOr its orbit would have a radius of about 40 feet.\n0:35\nYou wouldn't even notice it if you\n0:36\nwere looking at this thing over here.\n0:38\nIt would be this little speck orbiting\n0:39\nat this huge, huge distance.\n0:42\nIf you look at this sun over here,\n0:44\nif I were to draw the whole sun, it\n0:46\nlooks like it would have a diameter of about 20 inches.\n0:49\nSo in this situation, this Earth right here-- and this\n0:53\nis drawn to scale-- this Earth would not\n0:55\nbe anywhere near this close.\n0:56\nIt would be about 200 feet that way, or about 60\n1:02\nor 70 meters, 60 meters.\n1:06\nSo you can imagine if the sun was this size, sitting\n1:08\non something like a football field,\n1:10\nthis little speck of an Earth, this little thing right here,\n1:13\nwould be sitting on the other 40-yard line, 60 meters away.\n1:19\nSo you wouldn't even notice it.\n1:21\nYou might notice this from a distance,\n1:23\nbut you wouldn't even see this thing over here.\n1:25\nAnd the other planets are even further.\n1:26\nWell, not all of the other planets.\n1:27\nObviously, you have Mercury.\n1:31\nI think most of us are familiar with these.\n1:33\nBut I'll just list them here, just in case.\n1:35\nThat's Mercury.\n1:37\nThis is Venus.\n1:38\nMercury is the smallest of the planets where it's not\n1:40\ndebated whether it's a planet.\n1:41\nPluto is the smallest, but some people\n1:44\ndebate whether it's really a planet or just\n1:46\na large solar body or a dwarf planet\n1:48\nor any of those type of things.\n1:50\nBut then you have Venus, probably the closest in size\n1:53\nto the Earth.\n1:54\nOr it is the closest in size to the Earth.\n1:56\nAnd then you have Mars.\n1:59\nAnd then you have Jupiter.\n2:00\nAnd just to give a sense of, once again,\n2:02\nhow far these things are, if I were to go back\n2:05\nto the analogy of this being the size of the sun,\n2:08\nthen Jupiter is five times further than Earth.\n2:11\nSo this would be-- If I were to actually do the scale distance,\n2:15\nthis would be 300 meters away.\n2:19\nSo if I had a nice, big, maybe medicine-balled-size sun\n2:23\nright over here, maybe basketball-sized.\n2:25\nA little bit bigger than a basketball,\n2:27\nthis looks on my screen-- then this little thing\n2:31\nthat's smaller than a ping pong ball,\n2:33\nI would put this three football fields away.\n2:36\nThat's how far Jupiter is.\n2:38\nAnd then Saturn's about twice as far as that.\n2:40\nSaturn is about nine times the distance.\n2:42\nSo let me make it clear.\n2:45\nThe Earth is one astronomical unit away from the sun,\n2:48\nroughly.\n2:48\nIts distance changes.\n2:49\nIt's not a perfectly circular orbit.\n2:53\nJupiter is approximately a little bit--\n2:55\n5 plus astronomical units-- a little bit\n2:58\nmore than five times the distance\n3:00\nof the sun to the Earth.\n3:02\nAnd Saturn is approximately nine astronomical units,\n3:07\nor nine times the distance from the sun to the Earth.\n3:11\nSo once again, this would be nine football fields away.\n3:13\nOr another way to think about it would be, essentially,\n3:16\na kilometer away.\n3:16\nIf we had kind of a medicine-ball-size sun,\n3:20\nthis little smaller than a ping pong\n3:22\nballed Saturn would be a kilometer away.\n3:26\nAnd I just want to really reiterate\n3:27\nthat because you never visualize it that way.\n3:30\nBecause just for the sake of being\n3:31\nable to draw it on a page, you see\n3:32\ndiagrams that look like this.\n3:35\nAnd they really don't give you a sense of how small\n3:38\nthese planets are relative to the sun,\n3:40\nand especially relative to their distance from the sun.\n3:45\nAnd then after Saturn, you have Uranus and then Neptune.\n3:58\nAnd obviously, these guys are even further.\n3:59\nAnd just to give you a sense, it's\n4:01\nvery easy to start talking about galaxies and universes and all\n4:05\nof the-- or the universe.\n4:07\nBut I really just want to get-- already,\n4:09\nwhat we've talked about, we're talking about huge distances,\n4:12\nhuge scale.\n4:14\nWe already talked about that it would take a jet plane 17 years\n4:17\nto travel from the Earth to the sun.\n4:19\nMultiply that by five, about 100 years\n4:22\nto go from Jupiter to the sun, 200 years\n4:24\nto go from Saturn to the sun.\n4:27\nSo you could have had Abraham Lincoln get into a jet plane,\n4:31\nand if he left from Saturn, he still\n4:34\nwould not have gotten to the sun.\n4:36\nSo these are huge, huge distances.\n4:37\nBut we're not done with the solar system, there.\n4:39\nJust to give a sense of scale-- so this right here,\n4:44\nthat's the sun.\n4:45\nAnd each of these planets are actually\n4:47\nnarrower than these orbits.\n4:48\nSo they just draw these orbits here,\n4:50\nbut you wouldn't actually even see the actual planets\n4:52\nhere at this type of a scale.\n4:54\nBut this is one astronomical unit right over here,\n4:56\nthe distance from the sun to the Earth.\n4:59\nThen you have Mars.\n5:00\nThen you have the asteroid belt.\n5:02\nThere you have the asteroid belt,\n5:06\nwhich also has some pretty big things in it, itself.\n5:08\nAnd it has these things that are kind of considered almost\n5:11\ndwarf planets, things like Ceres.\n5:13\nYou could look those type things up.\n5:14\nAnd then you have Jupiter out here.\n5:16\nAnd once again, we said it would take 100 years, or roughly\n5:19\n100 years, for a jet plane to get from Jupiter to the sun.\n5:23\nBut even if you take this whole box\n5:25\nhere-- which is a huge amount of distance, of roughly about\n5:28\nfive astronomical units-- it would take about 40 minutes\n5:33\nfor light to get from the sun to Jupiter.\n5:37\nSo this is a huge, huge distance.\n5:40\nBut even this huge distance-- we can put it\n5:42\ninto this little box right over here.\n5:46\nSo this whole box right over there can be fit into this box.\n5:55\nAnd you need to do that in order to appreciate\n5:57\nthe orbits of the outer planets.\n5:59\nAnd so on this scale, Earth and Venus and Mercury and Mars,\n6:03\ntheir orbits look pretty much-- you can't even\n6:05\ndifferentiate them from the sun.\n6:07\nThey look so close.\n6:08\nThey almost look like they're part\n6:09\nof the sun when you look at it on this scale.\n6:11\nAnd then you have you have the outer planets--\n6:13\nSaturn, Uranus, Neptune.\n6:15\nAnd they we have a Kuiper belt.\n6:17\nAnd this is more asteroids, but these are kind of more frozen.\n6:21\nAnd when we think of ice, you always think of water ice.\n6:24\nBut out here, it's so cold.\n6:25\nAnd it's relatively getting dark, now,\n6:27\nbecause we're pretty far from the sun\n6:29\nthat things that we normally associate as gases are going\n6:31\nto be in their solid form out here.\n6:33\nSo this isn't just rocky elements.\n6:36\nThis will also be things that we normally associate as gases,\n6:39\nlike methane, frozen methane.\n6:41\nBut even here, we're not done.\n6:42\nWe're not even out of the solar system yet.\n6:46\nAnd actually, just to give you a sense of the scale we're\n6:49\noperating right here, I have this chart right here\n6:52\nfrom the Voyager mission.\n6:53\nSo the Voyager missions-- Voyager 1 and 2-- actually,\n6:55\nVoyager 2 left a little bit earlier, a month earlier.\n6:58\nVoyager 1 is just traveling faster.\n7:00\nThey left about a year after I was born\n7:04\nAnd their current velocity, just to give you\n7:06\na sense of how fast-- Voyager 1 right here is right\n7:12\nnow traveling at 61,000 kilometers per hour.\n7:19\nThat's about 17 kilometers per second.\n7:23\nThe size of a city every second-- it's going that fast.\n7:25\nThat's, at least in my mind, an unfathomably fast velocity.\n7:31\nThis thing has been traveling roughly that fast.\n7:33\nIt's been going around planets and gaining acceleration\n7:36\nas it went around orbits.\n7:37\nBut for most of the time, it's been\n7:38\ngoing at a pretty fast speed.\n7:39\nAnd just to translate it to people\n7:42\nwho don't relate to kilometers, that's\n7:43\nabout 38,000 miles per hour, so this huge, huge unfathomably\n7:50\nfast speed.\n7:51\nAnd it's been doing it since 1977.\n7:55\nI was learning to walk.\n7:57\nAnd when I was learning to walk, it\n7:58\nwas traveling at this super fast speed.\n8:00\nAnd then when I was learning to talk-- our whole lives,\n8:04\nwhen we're sleeping, everything, we're eating,\n8:06\nI'm in elementary school-- it's still rocketing out\n8:09\nof the solar system at roughly this speed.\n8:11\nIts velocity has changed, but especially,\n8:13\nonce it got outside of the planets,\n8:15\nit's been roughly at this velocity.\n8:17\nSo it's just been rocketing out.\n8:19\nAnd I don't want to say only, but it's gotten this far.\n8:24\nIf we look at it on this scale, it's\n8:25\ngotten about that far right there.\n8:28\nIt's about 115, 116 astronomical units.\n8:32\nAnd to give a sense-- so there's two ways to think about it.\n8:34\nOne says, like, wow, that's really far.\n8:36\nBecause we know that even on this scale,\n8:39\nyou can't even see Earth's orbit.\n8:40\nSo this looks like it's a pretty, pretty far distance.\n8:43\nAnd just to give you a sense of how far 116 astronomical units\n8:47\nare, if 2,000 years ago, Jesus got on a plane--\n8:52\nI actually cut and pasted a copy of Jesus,\n8:54\njust for visualization purposes--\n8:56\nbut if he'd got on a jet liner at 1,000 kilometers per hour\n8:59\nand went straight in that direction,\n9:01\nin the direction that Voyager, Voyager would only just now be\n9:05\ncatching up to Jesus.\n9:06\nSo this is a huge, huge, huge, huge distance.\n9:09\nBut at the same time, even though it's\n9:11\na huge distance, especially relative to everything\n9:13\nelse we've talked about, relative to just even\n9:15\nthe outer reaches of the solar system,\n9:18\nwe're still talking in terms of a small scale.\n9:21\nSo that's how far Voyager is.\n9:24\nAnd just to give a sense, on this scale-- so this whole box\n9:27\nover here can be contained in this box.\n9:32\nAnd when you look at this box, Voyager's\n9:34\nonly gotten about that far after traveling\n9:39\nat this unbelievable velocity for over 30 years,\n9:44\nfor about 33 years.\n9:45\nAnd just to give you an idea of these other things, Sedna,\n9:47\nright here, is a reasonably large-sized outer solar system\n9:53\nobject.\n9:54\nIt's one of the furthest objects that we\n9:56\nknow of in the solar system.\n9:58\nAnd it has this very eccentric orbit.\n10:00\nSo it gets-- I don't want to say relatively close, but not\n10:02\nunreasonably far away.\n10:05\nAnd then it gets really far away from the sun.\n10:09\nBut even Sedna's orbit-- so if I were to look at this,\n10:11\nso this whole box over here can be contained right over here.\n10:17\nSo in this diagram right here, you\n10:19\nwouldn't even be able to see.\n10:20\nIt would be like a speck how far Voyager\n10:22\nhas traveled in 33 years at 38,000 miles per hour.\n10:27\nYou would not even be able to notice.\n10:30\nYou wouldn't even notice that distance.\n10:33\nAnd even though you can't even notice that distance,\n10:35\nwe still have the sun's influence.\n10:39\nThe gravitational pull is still attracting things to it.\n10:42\nAnd this right here, we speculate\n10:45\nthat there is the Oort cloud.\n10:46\nAnd this is where the comets originate from.\n10:48\nAnd this is just a bunch of frozen gases\n10:51\nand ice particles and things like that.\n10:54\nBut we're starting to get to the outer reaches\n10:57\nof the solar system.\n10:58\nAnd this distance right here is about 50,000 astronomical\n11:04\nunits.\n11:07\nAnd just to give a scale-- because you\n11:09\nhear a lot about light years and all of that-- light years\n11:11\nare about 63,000 astronomical units.\n11:14\nSo if you go a light year out from the sun,\n11:19\nyou'll end up in the Oort cloud, the hypothesized Oort cloud.\n11:24\nAnd just to give a sense, another scale,\n11:26\nthe Oort cloud is actually-- most of the planets' orbits\n11:30\nare roughly in the same plane.\n11:32\nBut this right here is the orbit of the planets.\n11:34\nAnd once again, these lines are drawn too thick.\n11:36\nThey're just drawn the thinnest possible so\n11:38\nthat you can see them, but they're still drawn too thick.\n11:40\nAnd this gets us all the way to the Kuiper belt.\n11:42\nBut all of this over here, so all the way\n11:45\nout to the Kuiper belt, all the way out\n11:46\nto all of the major planets-- this\n11:48\nis Pluto's orbit right over here.\n11:52\nThis whole diagram is only sitting in right over there.\n11:56\nYou can barely see it.\n11:57\nThis whole diagram is just that dot in this.\n12:00\nAnd then you can see the Oort cloud all around it.\n12:02\nAnd it's more of a spherical cloud.\n12:04\nAnd we think it exists.\n12:05\nObviously, it's hard to observe things at that distance.\n12:08\nSo hopefully, that gives you a beginning sense\n12:11\nof the scale of the solar system.\n12:12\nAnd what's really going to blow your mind-- if this hasn't\n12:14\nblown your mind already-- is that this whole thing's\n12:17\ngoing to start looking like a speck.\n12:19\nWhen you even just look at the local area around our galaxy,\n12:21\nmuch less the galaxy, much less the universe as a whole.\n12:25\nAnyway, I don't want to get-- well, anyway.\n12:27\nThis is starting to get crazy.",

It's a victory for The US.\n3:27\nAnd it ends up really, really\n3:31\nhurting Japanese ability\n3:35\nto field carriers,\n3:36\nhave air warfare from carriers\n3:40\nbecause so much of their\n3:42\ncarrier capability\n3:44\nwas damaged in The Battle of Philippine Sea.\n3:47\nSo, The Battle of\n3:52\nPhilippine\n3:59\nBattle of the Philippine Sea\n4:00\nthis occurs in June\n4:04\n1944.\n4:05\nAnd along with that, in the summer,\n4:08\nthe Allies are able to take several islands\n4:12\nin The Mariana Islands.\n4:14\nOnce again, this is gonna be super important\n4:16\nbecause from The Marianas, they're able to launch\n4:18\nB-29 bombing attacks on the mainland in Japan.\n4:22\nAnd so over that summer the Allies,\n4:24\nthe Americans in particular, are able to take Saipan,\n4:28\nthey are able to take Guam,\n4:33\nthey are able to take Tinian,\n4:35\nwhich is this little island right over here.\n4:37\nSome of these islands are quite hard to find.\n4:39\nThey're super small, in fact,\n4:40\neven these little dots exaggerate their size,\n4:43\nif you were to actually go onto Google Maps or Google Earth\n4:45\nyou'll see how small these are.\n4:46\nAnd I encourage you to look at them\n4:47\nit's really fascinating to see how small\n4:49\nsome of these islands are.\n4:50\nThey're really atolls, a lot of these are\n4:52\nmore atolls then islands.\n4:53\nNot all of them are atolls.\n4:55\nBut you see, they barely have enough space\n4:57\nfor a landing strip for planes, especially the B-29s.\n5:02\nAnd then as we go further into the summer\n5:04\nand we start entering kind of later in the year,\n5:08\nthe Americans are able to take,\n5:10\nat the time what was called Peleliu, now it's Palu.\n5:14\nSo Peleliu, they're able to take Morotai,\n5:20\nand then perhaps most importantly in 1944,\n5:23\nthis might be the biggest deal out of all of these\n5:27\npacific battles that occur and all of these\n5:28\nnaval battles that occur,\n5:30\nis The Battle of Leyte an The Battle of Leyte Gulf.\n5:35\nBecause The Battle of Leyte was important\n5:37\nbecause in the process of taking Leyte\n5:41\nThe United States essentially is able to knock out\n5:44\nthe Japanese's ability to further defend,\n5:48\nI mean they will continue,\n5:49\nbut realistically defend the rest of The Philippines.\n5:52\nSo once Leyte is taken by the Allies\n5:57\nthe odds of the Japanese being able to hold\n6:00\nthe rest of The Philippines becomes very low.\n6:03\nAnd maybe even more important,\n6:04\nThe Battle of Leyte Gulf, which occurs right around there,\n6:08\nit's an incredibly decisive battle for the American Navy.\n6:12\nThe Japanese go all in, and that bet is not a good one.\n6:16\nThe Japanese Navy is pretty much destroyed\n6:19\nin The Battle of Leyte Gulf.\n6:22\nAnd so 1944, once again,\n6:25\nvery good year for the Allies.\n6:27\nVery bad year for the Japanese.\n6:30\nNow the Allies are in control of\n6:34\nthey're in control of air strips,\n6:36\nfrom which they can take B-29 raids\n6:39\nto the mainland of Japan.\n6:42\nSo air strips,\n6:43\nthey can now, they're now within range\n6:45\nto do bombing attacks on the mainland of Japan,\n6:48\nand they now are very likely to control The Philippines\n6:53\nand control the shipping lanes from Indonesia to Japan\n6:57\nand they've all but destroyed the Japanese Navy.\n7:01\nSo, once again, things are not looking very good for Japan.\n7:05\nAnd as we go into 1945, we'll see the Allies\n7:09\nget closer and closer and get more intense\n7:13\nbombing raids on Japan.\n7:15\nAnd every time they get closer,\n7:16\nthe battles to take these islands,\n7:18\nIwo Jima, Okinawa,\n7:20\nincredibly incredibly bloody\n7:22\nand The United States says,\n7:24\n'Well what do we have to do to get\n7:25\nthe Japanese to surrender?'\n7:27\nAnd we'll see what, at least in the mind of Truman,\n7:31\nneeds to happen.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWelcome back.\n0:01\nSo I was trying to rush and finish a problem in the last\n0:05\ntwo minutes of the video, and I realize that's just bad\n0:08\nteaching, because I end up rushing.\n0:09\nSo this is the problem we were going to work on, and you'll\n0:11\nsee a lot of these.\n0:12\nThey just want you to become familiar with the variables in\n0:17\nNewton's law of gravitation.\n0:19\nSo I said that there's two planets, one is Earth.\n0:23\nNow I have time to draw things, so that's Earth.\n0:27\nAnd then there's Small Earth.\n0:28\nAnd Small Earth-- well, maybe I'll just call it the small\n0:32\nplanet, so we don't get confused.\n0:34\nIt's green, showing that there's probably\n0:37\nlife on that planet.\n0:40\nLet's say it has 1/2 the radius, and 1/2 the mass.\n0:45\nSo if you think about it, it's probably a\n0:46\nlot denser than Earth.\n0:48\nThat's a good problem to think about.\n0:49\nHow much denser is it, right?\n0:51\nBecause if you have 1/2 the radius, your volume is much\n0:55\nless than 1/2.\n0:56\nI don't want to go into that now, but that's something for\n0:58\nyou to think about.\n0:58\nBut my question is what fraction, if I'm standing on\n1:01\nthe surface of this-- so the same person, so Sal, if I'm on\n1:06\nEarth, what fraction is the pull when I'm on this small\n1:13\ngreen planet?\n1:15\nSo what is the pull on me on Earth?\n1:18\nWell, it's just going to be-- my weight on Earth, the force\n1:23\non Earth, is going to be equal to the gravitational constant\n1:28\ntimes my mass, mass of me.\n1:35\nSo m sub m times the mass of Earth divided by what?\n1:41\nWe learned in the last video, divided by the distance\n1:44\nbetween me and the center of the mass of Earth.\n1:45\nReally, my center of mass and the center of mass of Earth.\n1:49\nBut this is between the surface of the Earth, and I'd\n1:52\nlike to think that I'm not short, but it's negligible\n1:56\nbetween my center of mass and the surface, so we'll just\n1:58\nconsider the radius of the Earth.\n2:00\nSo we divide it by the radius of the Earth squared.\n2:08\nUsing these same variables, what's going to be the force\n2:11\non this other planet?\n2:13\nSo the force on the other planet, this green planet--\n2:16\nI'll do it in green-- and we're calling it the small\n2:20\nplanet, it equals what?\n2:23\nIt equals the gravitational constant again.\n2:26\nAnd my mass doesn't change when I go from one planet to\n2:29\nanother, right?\n2:31\nIts mass now is what?\n2:33\nWe would write it m sub s here, right?\n2:37\nThis is the small planet.\n2:39\nAnd we wrote right here that it's 1/2 the mass of Earth, so\n2:41\nI'll just write that.\n2:42\nSo it's 1/2 the mass of Earth.\n2:48\nAnd what's its radius?\n2:49\nWhat's the radius now?\n2:51\nI could just write the radius of the small planet squared,\n2:54\nbut I'll say, well, we know.\n2:54\nIt's 1/2 the radius of Earth, so let's put that in there.\n2:57\nSo 1/2 radius of Earth.\n3:00\nWe have to square it.\n3:02\nLet's see what this simplifies to.\n3:04\nThis equals-- so we can take this 1/2 here-- 1/2G mass of\n3:12\nme times mass of Earth over-- what's 1/2 squared?\n3:18\nIt's 1/4.\n3:19\nOver 1/4 radius of Earth squared.\n3:26\nAnd what's 1/2 divided by 1/4?\n3:30\n1/4 goes into 1/2 two times, right?\n3:32\nOr another way you can think about it is if you have a\n3:33\nfraction in the denominator, when you put it in the\n3:35\nnumerator, you flip it and it becomes 4.\n3:38\nSo 4 times 1/2 is 2.\n3:39\nEither way, it's just math.\n3:41\nSo the force on the small planet is going to be equal to\n3:45\n1/2 divided by 1/4 is 2 times G, mass of me, times mass of\n3:53\nEarth, divided by the radius of Earth squared.\n3:56\nAnd if we look up here, this is the same\n4:01\nthing as this, right?\n4:05\nIt's identical.\n4:07\nSo we know that the force that applied to me when I'm on the\n4:10\nsurface of the small planet is actually two times the force\n4:15\napplied on Earth, when I go to Earth.\n4:19\nAnd that's something interesting to think about,\n4:20\nbecause you might have said initially, wow, you know, the\n4:24\nmass of the object matters a lot in gravity.\n4:27\nThe more massive the object, the more it's\n4:29\ngoing to pull on me.\n4:31\nBut what we see here is that actually, no.\n4:33\nWhen I'm on the surface of this smaller planet, it's\n4:36\npulling even harder on me.\n4:37\nAnd why is that?\n4:38\nWell, because I'm actually closer to its center of mass.\n4:41\nAnd as we talked about earlier in this video, this object is\n4:45\nprobably a lot denser.\n4:46\nYou could say it's only 1/2 the mass, but it's much less\n4:50\nthan 1/2 of the volume, right?\n4:51\nBecause the volume is the cube of the radius and all of that.\n4:55\nI don't want to confuse you, but this is just something to\n4:56\nthink about.\n4:57\nSo not only does the mass matter, but the\n4:59\nradius matters a lot.\n5:01\nAnd the radius is actually the square, so it actually\n5:03\nmatters even more.\n5:06\nSo that's something that's pretty\n5:09\ninteresting to think about.\n5:10\nAnd these are actually very common problems when they just\n5:14\nwant to tell you, oh, you go to a planet that is two times\n5:16\nthe mass of another planet, et cetera, et cetera, what is the\n5:21\ndifference in force between the two?\n5:23\nAnd one thing I want you to realize, actually, before I\n5:25\nfinish this video since I do have some extra time, when we\n5:29\nthink about gravity, especially with planets and\n5:30\nall of that, you always feel like, oh, it's\n5:33\nEarth pulling on me.\n5:36\nLet's say that this is the Earth, and the Earth is huge,\n5:41\nand this is a tiny spaceship right here.\n5:45\nIt's traveling.\n5:48\nYou always think that Earth is pulling on\n5:50\nthe spaceship, right?\n5:51\nThe gravitational force of Earth.\n5:53\nBut it actually turns out, when we looked at the formula,\n5:57\nthe formula is symmetric.\n5:57\nIt's not really saying one is pulling on the other.\n5:59\nThey're actually saying this is the force\n6:01\nbetween the two objects.\n6:03\nThey're attracted to each other.\n6:04\nSo if the Earth is pulling on me with the force of 500\n6:13\nNewtons, it actually turns out that I am pulling on the Earth\n6:16\nwith an equal and opposite force of 5 Newtons.\n6:18\nWe're pulling towards each other.\n6:20\nIt just feels like the Earth is, at least from my point of\n6:23\nview, that the Earth is pulling to me.\n6:25\nAnd we're actually both being pulled towards the combined\n6:29\ncenter of mass.\n6:30\nSo in this situation, let's say the Earth is pulling on\n6:33\nthe spaceship with the force of-- I don't know.\n6:37\nI'm making up numbers now, but let's say\n6:40\nit's 1 million Newtons.\n6:43\nIt actually turns out that the spaceship will be pulling on\n6:46\nthe Earth with the same force of 1 million Newtons.\n6:51\nAnd they're both going to be moved to the combined system's\n6:55\ncenter of mass.\n6:56\nAnd the combined system's center of mass since the Earth\n7:00\nis so much more massive is going to be very close to\n7:02\nEarth's center of mass.\n7:03\nIt's probably going to be very close to\n7:05\nEarth's center of mass.\n7:06\nIt's going to be like right there, right?\n7:07\nSo in this situation, Earth won't be doing a lot of\n7:12\nmoving, but it will be pulled in the direction of the\n7:15\nspaceship, and the spaceship will try to go to Earth's\n7:18\ncenter of mass, but at some point, probably the\n7:20\natmosphere, or the rock that it runs into, it won't be able\n7:24\nto go much further and it might crash\n7:27\nright around there.\n7:28\nAnyway, I wanted just to give you the sense that it's not\n7:31\nnecessarily one object just pulling on the other.\n7:33\nThey're pulling towards each other to their\n7:35\ncombined center of masses.\n7:36\nIt would make a lot more sense if they had just two people\n7:40\nfloating in space, they actually would have some\n7:42\ngravity towards each other.\n7:43\nIt's almost a little romantic.\n7:47\nThey would float to each other.\n7:48\nAnd actually, you could figure it out.\n7:52\nI don't have the time to do it, but you could use this\n7:55\nformula and use the constant, and you could figure out,\n7:58\nwell, what is the gravitational attraction\n8:00\nbetween two people?\n8:01\nAnd what you'll see is that between two people floating in\n8:04\nspace, there are other forms of attraction that are\n8:06\nprobably stronger than their\n8:09\ngravitational attraction, anyway.\n8:11\nI'll let you ponder that and I will see\n8:13\nyou in the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nUnderstanding the ethnic and religious commonalities\n0:03\nand differences in the state or the region that\n0:06\nused to be Yugoslavia can be quite confusing.\n0:08\nWhat I want to do in this video is try to give a primer on it.\n0:10\nIt's really key to understanding some of the triggers of World\n0:14\nWar I. And to, obviously, understand the breakup\n0:16\nof Yugoslavia which was quite ugly during the fall\n0:21\nof Communism in the late '80s and early '90s.\n0:24\nSo first of all, it's a good idea\n0:25\nto just understand where the word Yugoslavia comes from.\n0:30\nIt's literally referring to the southern Slavic states.\n0:34\nSo Yugo- is referring to southern.\n0:36\nAnd -slavia, we're talking about the Slavic states.\n0:38\nAnd when people talk about Slavic languages,\n0:40\nthey're talking about the languages that\n0:42\nare spoken in this region, but also much of Eastern Europe,\n0:45\nand in what is now Russia.\n0:49\nNow, what we have here in blue is,\n0:52\nwe have shaded in where Serbo-Croatian\n0:56\nis spoken, which is the dominant Slavic language in this region.\n1:05\nAnd there are multiple dialects.\n1:07\nSome people will say, oh, it's Croatian or Montenegrin\n1:10\nor Serbian or whatever it might be.\n1:12\nBut mostly, linguists say, well, they're\n1:13\npretty close to each other.\n1:15\nAnd you can categorize them as one language as Serbo-Croatian.\n1:20\nAnd you see that it's now spoken in modern day Croatia, Bosnia\n1:24\nand Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro.\n1:28\nAnd that is the commonality here,\n1:31\nthe thing that ties together this region.\n1:33\nNow on top of that, the Slovenian language\n1:36\nis also Slavic language that is closely related\n1:39\nto Serbo-Croatian.\n1:40\nIn Macedonia, they also speak a Slavic language.\n1:43\nIt's closer to Bulgarian.\n1:44\nBut it has some close ties.\n1:46\nIt's not completely different than Serbo-Croatian.\n1:48\nSo you have this linguistic connection\n1:51\nthroughout this area.\n1:53\nNow, what divides this area is really religion and history.\n1:57\nSo this area, if you look, go back hundreds of years,\n2:01\nit was under the control of various empires,\n2:03\nthe Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire.\n2:06\nDifferent-- the Austro-Hungarian Empire,\n2:08\nyou're dealing with the Roman Catholic Empire.\n2:10\nWhen you're talking about the Ottomans,\n2:11\nyou're dealing with the Muslim Empire.\n2:13\nAnd they held in different parts of this territory\n2:16\nfor hundreds of years.\n2:18\nAnd so what you end up, is really a mix of religions.\n2:22\nAnd that often gets tied to people's-- what they perceive\n2:26\nas also their ethnicities.\n2:28\nAnd so what I have here is a break down,\n2:31\nthe religious breakdown of the state,\n2:34\nthe former state of Yugoslavia.\n2:36\nSo in this pinkish color right over here,\n2:38\nI have the areas that are predominately Roman Catholic.\n2:41\nAnd I say, predominantly, because it really is all mixed\n2:44\ntogether.\n2:44\nSo Slovenia, Croatia, primarily Roman Catholic.\n2:48\nIf you look at Serbia and Montenegro,\n2:51\nprimarily Eastern Orthodox.\n2:54\nKosovo, you have a strong Muslim majority right over there.\n3:00\nAnd it really gets-- and Kosovo, before its break up,\n3:04\nwas kind of part of Serbia and Montenegro.\n3:07\nDespite it having this very different religious makeup.\n3:10\nAnd then, Bosnia and Herzegovina is\n3:12\nwhere things get really, really mixed up.\n3:14\nRoughly half of the population, and it's\n3:16\nbeen moving over the centuries.\n3:19\nBut the dominant religion there is Islam.\n3:23\nAnd in general, and this is where it can be confusing,\n3:25\nwhen people talk about a Bosniak,\n3:28\nwhen they're talking about a Bosniak,\n3:30\nthey're talking about a Bosnian Muslim.\n3:36\nBut Bosnia and Herzegovina also has significant fractions\n3:40\nof Serbs who are Eastern Orthodox.\n3:44\nSo that's why I put the brown here as well.\n3:45\nIt's about a third of the population.\n3:47\nAnd it also has a pretty sizable Roman Catholic population.\n3:50\nOr we could say Bosnian Croats.\n3:53\nSo just to be clear here, it can be very confusing.\n3:55\nEven when you when you hear history of it\n3:56\nor when you've heard it on the news.\n3:58\nI remember the '90s hearing this on the news\n4:00\nand getting very confused.\n4:02\nIf someone's referring to a Bosnian Muslim or Bosniak,\n4:04\nthat's a Muslim living in Bosnia.\n4:06\nThat's they tend to be referring to.\n4:09\nIf they say a Bosnian Croats, this\n4:16\nwould be an ethnically Croat who is living in Bosnia.\n4:20\nAnd they are-- it would tend to be Roman Catholic.\n4:24\nAnd then if you have a Bosnian Serb,\n4:29\nthis is someone who ethnically identifies themselves\n4:32\nas a Serbian or as a Serb who lives\n4:35\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n4:38\nBut is probably going to be Eastern Orthodox.\n4:42\nSo you can imagine, you have the strong linguistic and even\n4:46\nethnic ties.\n4:48\nBut at some point, because of the religion and dialect\n4:52\nchanges, there's also significant amount\n4:54\nof differences here.\n4:55\nEspecially when things got ugly, as you\n4:57\nhave the fall of Communism.\n4:58\nSo hopefully, this lays the groundwork\n5:00\nof the commonalities and the differences here.\n5:03\nAnd it'll help us understand what got us into World War I,\n5:06\nor at least what triggered World War I. And also some\n5:08\nof the ugliness that was seen in the early '90s.\n5:12\nAnd just to finish up with a little bit of context,\n5:15\nthis was not a unified state until-- World War\n5:19\nI, to some degree, was precipitated by a desire\n5:21\nto make this a unified state.\n5:24\nThis ethnic grouping, this linguistic grouping\n5:28\ntended to be broken up with the Austro-Hungarian Empire,\n5:31\nthe Ottoman Empire.\n5:32\nEntering into a World War I, you started\n5:34\nto have the decline of the Ottoman Empire\n5:35\nwhich started to allow these people to start\n5:39\nto have more energy behind their desire to form a unified state.\n5:43\nWorld War I was essentially the catalyst\n5:45\nthat allowed the state of Yugoslavia to unify.\n5:49\nAnd in different forms, it stayed\n5:51\nunified until the fall of Communism.\n5:54\nAnd even though it was a socialist state,\n5:56\na communist state during the Cold War,\n5:59\nit actually always had a strange and distant relationship\n6:03\nwith the Soviet Union.\n6:04\nBut after the fall of Communism, that\n6:06\nwas kind of holding it together, these, especially\n6:09\nthese religious differences, frankly,\n6:11\nand these ethnic and religious differences broke it apart.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] Hey Kim.\n0:01\n- [Kim] Hey, Becca.\n0:02\nSo, we've been talking about Uncle Tom's Cabin,\n0:05\npublished in 1852 by Harriet Beecher Stowe,\n0:08\nand said to have been one of the main causes\n0:10\nof the American Civil War.\n0:13\nSo, remind me again of what Uncle Tom's Cabin\n0:15\nwas actually about.\n0:16\n- [Becca] So Uncle Tom's Cabin was about\n0:18\nthe horrors of slavery in the deep south\n0:21\nand also appealed to a lot of American's Christian values\n0:25\nand tried to point out these fundamental contradictions\n0:28\nbetween Christian faith and slavery.\n0:31\n- [Kim] So, it was published in 1852.\n0:33\nHow did people receive this book?\n0:34\n- [Becca] So there was a lot of mixed reactions.\n0:36\nBut, it was the most read book of the 19th century,\n0:40\nso there were a lot of reactions.\n0:42\n(laughing)\n0:43\nIn the north, mostly, people were reading this all the time,\n0:47\nno matter if you were an intellectual\n0:50\nor just kind of a 17 year old picking up a book off a shelf,\n0:54\nyou were going to read Uncle Tom's Cabin.\n0:55\nAnd a lot of the people that actually read the book\n0:57\nwere young men that would later fight in the Civil War.\n1:01\n- [Kim] How interesting.\n1:02\nOkay, so, like this would be our book club book of the month\n1:05\nexcept everybody was,\n1:06\nthis was like the Oprah's book club choice of 1852.\n1:11\n- [Becca] Exactly. - [Kim] Everybody was\n1:12\nreading it.\n1:13\n- [Becca] Yeah, there's really almost nothing like it.\n1:15\nNot even Harry Potter.\n1:17\nBut it did have the same international scope\n1:19\nthat Harry Potter does today.\n1:20\n- [Kim] So, it was popular in the northern United States,\n1:23\nand elsewhere in the world.\n1:25\nSo, where else was it popular?\n1:26\n- [Becca] Mostly in Europe.\n1:28\nBut it was translated into over 60 languages.\n1:31\n- [Kim] Wow.\n1:32\n- [Becca] And, this also kind of put the spotlight\n1:34\non American slavery.\n1:36\nSo, there was all this international attention.\n1:39\nWhat is going on in America,\n1:41\nand what's going to happen?\n1:42\n- [Kim] That's so interesting.\n1:43\nIt reminds me of The King and I.\n1:45\nIf you've seen that she, the woman goes to Siam,\n1:49\nand shows people\n1:52\nthe book Uncle Tom's Cabin\n1:54\nand they put on a version of a play\n1:56\nbased on Uncle Tom's Cabin\n1:58\nin what would be Thailand.\n2:00\n- [Becca] So yeah, so this makes it this kind of\n2:02\ninternational spectacle.\n2:04\nThe fate of slavery had to be somehow figured out,\n2:07\nand everyone was watching.\n2:09\n- [Kim] That's so interesting.\n2:10\nSo, I'm imagining that white southerners\n2:12\nwere not big fans of this book.\n2:14\n- [Becca] So, white southerners were definitely\n2:15\nnot a fan of Uncle Tom's Cabin.\n2:18\nAnd in response, there was this movement of these things\n2:21\ncalled anti-Tom novels.\n2:23\nHere's an anti-Tom novel right next to us,\n2:25\nright over here,\n2:26\nAunt Phillis's Cabin.\n2:28\n(Kim laughing)\n2:28\n- [Kim] Creative name. - [Becca] Aunt Phillis' Cabin,\n2:30\nyes (laughing), very creative name.\n2:32\nThese anti-Tom novels aimed to point out that\n2:35\nmaybe Harriet Beecher Stowe didn't know\n2:36\nwhat she was actually talking about.\n2:38\nThey also accused Harriet Beecher Stowe\n2:40\nof not actually even living in the deep south,\n2:42\nso she didn't even know what slavery was like.\n2:44\nThey wanted to paint southern slave society\n2:47\nin this really positive light.\n2:49\nThey wanted to show all the ways that it actually\n2:51\nmaintains social order,\n2:53\nand promoted economic welfare,\n2:55\nso this was kind of this response from the south,\n2:58\nalso in novel form.\n2:59\n- [Kim] So, it's this big kind of cultural battle\n3:01\nover the interpretation of slavery.\n3:04\nYou have people on one hand saying\n3:05\nslavery is destructive to families,\n3:08\nslavery is incompatible with Christianity.\n3:11\nAnd then, responses from the white south,\n3:14\nsaying, oh no, actually slavery is great,\n3:16\nit helps everybody.\n3:18\n- [Becca] Right, so there was this kind of battle\n3:20\nwithin the literary community\n3:22\nabout the peculiar institution of slavery.\n3:24\nWhich one was it?\n3:25\n- [Kim] So what if, I'm illiterate, right.\n3:28\nI mean, not everybody in 19th century America\n3:31\nwas a New England intellectual\n3:33\nwho was reading Christian novels.\n3:37\nHow would I have heard about Uncle Tom's Cabin?\n3:39\n- [Becca] That's a really good point, Kim.\n3:40\nSo, Tom Shows were depictions of Uncle Tom's Cabin\n3:44\nin theaters around the world.\n3:46\nAnd so, they were often times put on by abolitionist people\n3:49\ntrying to point out the issues with slavery today\n3:53\nand end slavery immediately.\n3:56\n- [Kim] So, this is before there's copyright law, right,\n3:58\nso you can just put on a show of anybody's novel\n4:01\nif you feel like it.\n4:02\n- [Becca] Exactly, but often times,\n4:03\nthey really misconstrued the novel.\n4:06\nAnd actually, now are remembered as contributing\n4:09\nto the problem of racism in America.\n4:12\n- [Kim] Racial stereotypes, too, I would imagine,\n4:14\nbecause we still have this phrase Uncle Tom\n4:17\nkind of to mean\n4:18\nan African-American who is a martyr to the status quo\n4:23\nas opposed to someone who might fight against racism.\n4:26\nIt seems like they might have borrowed\n4:28\na lot of these stereotypes from minstrel shows\n4:30\nwhich were also very popular in this time period.\n4:33\n- [Becca] And some of the characters\n4:34\nwithin these minstrel shows\n4:35\nturned into the character that was remembered as Jim Crow,\n4:39\nwhich became the dominating racial order\n4:41\nafter the Civil War.\n4:43\nSo, in the Civil Rights era in the mid-1950's,\n4:47\nlots of activists actually wanted to completely reject\n4:49\nthe progress that Uncle Tom's Cabin and these Tom Shows\n4:52\nhad made because they actually reduced African Americans\n4:55\nto this terrible stereotype.\n4:58\nAnd so, later on, this kind of idea that\n5:01\nsomeone was an Uncle Tom became a racial slur, really,\n5:04\nand they then rejected Uncle Tom's Cabin\n5:07\nas being a tool towards racial equality\n5:11\nand more saw it as a part of the problem.\n5:14\n- [Kim] So, I think, the most important thing\n5:16\nabout Uncle Tom's Cabin is that it's this catalyst\n5:19\nof really intense emotions about slavery\n5:24\nwhich in the 1850's will lead eventually to the Civil War.\n5:28\nAnd, following the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin,\n5:31\nyou'll see more and more violence\n5:33\non both sides of this issue.\n5:35\nFor example, John Brown, this famous abolitionist\n5:38\nactually goes out to Kansas and murders people.\n5:41\n- [Becca] And I think that Lincoln was very astute\n5:44\nin pointing out that Uncle Tom's Cabin\n5:46\nreally catalyzed a lot of this violence.\n5:49\nAnd he even met with Harriet Beecher Stowe,\n5:51\nso she earned herself a little meeting with\n5:54\nAbraham Lincoln.\n5:55\n(Kim laughing)\n5:56\n- [Kim] And he said,\n5:57\n\"So you're the little lady that started this great war.\"\n6:03\nI'm trying to think of another book that has started a war.\n6:07\n- [Becca] I think we would probably remember that.\n6:10\nBut I do think Lincoln was really astute in pointing out\n6:13\njust how impactful this cultural phenomenon,\n6:16\nthis Tom-mania was on the question of slavery\n6:19\nand on the fate of the American people.\n6:22\nAnd really, it just begged the question in a new way,\n6:25\nin this kind of public setting.\n6:28\nI mean, I just think that the book itself,\n6:30\nthe way that the book could just travel\n6:32\nall around the United States\n6:33\nand so many different kinds of people\n6:35\nwere able to read it and get their hands on it.\n6:37\nThis really was just this movement of people\n6:40\njust thinking a lot about slavery,\n6:42\nreading a lot about slavery.\n6:43\n- [Kim] Yeah, well, I think after Uncle Tom's Cabin,\n6:47\nI don't think there was a way to not have an opinion\n6:49\non the slavery issue.\n6:51\nEither you were for it,\n6:53\nor you were against it.\n6:54\nAnd that divisiveness would lead to the Civil War.\n6:57\n- [Becca] And again, there's this international focus.\n6:59\nThere's a deeper, sectional divide\n7:01\nbetween the north and the south,\n7:03\nand there was this kind of sorting over the slavery question\n7:06\nthat Uncle Tom's Cabin really promoted.",

Hello Paige.\n0:02\n- [Paige] Hi, David.\n0:03\n- [Dave] So we have three different sentence\n0:05\nvarieties that we're going to talk about today.\n0:07\n- [Paige] Okay.\n0:08\n- [Dave] Here are their three flavors.\n0:10\nFlavor number one, declarative sentences.\n0:16\nFlavor number two, interrogative sentences.\n0:24\nAnd flavor number three, imperative sentences.\n0:29\nThose are all pretty long and wibbly words.\n0:32\n- [Paige] Seriously.\n0:32\n- [Dave] But we will address each one of them in turn.\n0:36\nPaige, if you please, what is a declarative sentence?\n0:40\n- [Paige] A declarative sentence is a type\n0:42\nof sentence that just states a fact or an opinion,\n0:47\nI suppose, but it just makes a statement.\n0:52\nSo that would be something like\n0:53\nit is a beautiful day.\n0:57\n- [Dave] It is a beautiful day, Paige.\n0:59\nWe can also use declarative sentences\n1:01\nto get across any kind of information.\n1:05\nThis is what we call exposition in writing.\n1:07\n- [Paige] Righ. Yeah.\n1:08\n- [Dave] So we can say Lavender hated baseball.\n1:12\nYou know, you could start a short story with that.\n1:14\n- [Paige] Right, that's- - [Dave] I challenge you to.\n1:16\n- [Paige] Just a fact about Lavender.\n1:18\n- [Dave] That's a fact about Lavender.\n1:19\nSo a declarative sentence is a statement.\n1:22\nJust straight up.\n1:23\n- [Paige] Yep.\n1:24\n- [Dave] An interrogative sentence is a question.\n1:28\nSo it asks a question.\n1:30\n- [Paige] It's just a fancy word for a question.\n1:32\n- [Dave] Right. - [Paige] Okay.\n1:33\n- [Dave] So an example of an interrogative sentence\n1:36\nwould be where did you go last night?\n1:38\n- [Paige] Right.\n1:41\n- [Dave] Or how is he still singing that note?\n1:43\n- [Paige] I have no idea.\n1:44\n- [Dave] Incredible breath control\n1:45\nSo that's what an interrogative question is.\n1:48\n- [Paige] Right.\n1:49\nIt's like being interrogated.\n1:50\nThat's, like, a similar word to interrogative,\n1:52\nis just having a lot of questions asked.\n1:54\n- [Dave] Like really aggressively.\n1:56\n- [Paige] Yeah, it's not a very positive thing.\n1:57\n- [Dave] Paige, what did you do with the cheese?\n1:59\n- [Paige] I don't know. (laughs)\n2:00\n- [Dave] Paige, why are you still eating the cheese?\n2:01\n- [Paige] I'm not.\n2:02\n- [Dave] Paige, I know you stole the cheese.\n2:03\nFinally, the third kind of sentence\n2:05\nwe want to talk about today is the imperative.\n2:08\nAn imperative is a command.\n2:12\n- [Paige] Right, so when you tell someone to do something.\n2:14\n- [Dave] So a command like, Paige, follow that bunny!\n2:18\n(laughs)\n2:20\n- [Paige] And the bunny stole the cheese.\n2:22\n- [Dave] Yeah.\n2:22\nSo this is one of those sentences that doesn't\n2:25\nhave a subject that is literally spoken out loud.\n2:29\n- [Paige] Right, it's just implied.\n2:30\nYou know, if you're saying that to me,\n2:33\nI know that I am the subject.\n2:35\n- [Dave] Right. So it's you follow that bunny.\n2:37\n- [Paige] Right.\n2:38\n- [Dave] But the you is just not spoken.\n2:40\nOr, if you're not into bunny following, you know,\n2:43\nsomething like remember to wash the dishes,\n2:45\nyou're still being commanded to remember.\n2:48\n- [Paige] Yeah, yeah.\n2:49\n- [Dave] So, yeah, that's our, those are our\n2:51\nthree sentence types.\n2:52\n- [Paige] Yeah.\n2:53\nDeclarative is a statement.\n2:55\nInterrogative is a question,\n2:56\nand imperative is a command.\n2:58\n- [Dave] So, Paige, I think we can recast our slogan\n3:01\nin each of these three types of sentence.\n3:03\n- [Paige] Okay.\n3:04\n- [Dave] So, okay, so declarative, right?\n3:06\nThat's what it usually is, declarative form is\n3:09\nyou can learn anything.\n3:11\n- [Paige] Okay.\n3:12\n- [Dave] We can make it a question, so interrogative's\n3:14\ncan you learn anything?\n3:16\n- [Paige] Right.\n3:17\n- [Dave] The answer is yes. - [Paige] Yes.\n3:18\n- [Dave] And the imperative, we wanna make it a command,\n3:20\nwould be what, Paige?\n3:21\n- [Paige] Learn anything!\n3:22\n- [Dave] Yeah!\n3:24\nSo you can do any of those three.\n3:26\n- [Paige] Sure.\n3:27\n- [Dave] David out.\n3:28\n- [Paige] Paige out.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nUse the associative law of multiplication to write-- and\n0:04\nhere they have 12 times 3 in parentheses, and then they\n0:07\nwant us to multiply that times 10-- in a different way.\n0:11\nSimplify both expressions to show they\n0:13\nhave identical results.\n0:16\nSo the way that they wrote it is-- let me just rewrite it.\n0:19\nSo they have 12 times 3 in parentheses, and then they\n0:24\nmultiply that times 10.\n0:26\nNow whenever something is in parentheses, that means do\n0:28\nthat first. So this literally says let's do the 12 times 3\n0:33\nfirst. Now, what is 12 times 3?\n0:35\nIt's 36.\n0:37\nSo this evaluates to 36, and then we still have that times\n0:40\n10 over there.\n0:44\nAnd we know the trick.\n0:44\nWhenever we multiply something times a power of ten, we just\n0:48\nadd the number of zeroes that we have at the back of it, so\n0:51\nthis is going to be 360.\n0:54\nThis is going to be equal to 360.\n0:59\nNow, the associative law of multiplication, once again, it\n1:03\nsounds like a very fancy thing.\n1:04\nAll that means is it doesn't matter how we associate the\n1:08\nmultiplication or it doesn't matter how we put the\n1:11\nparentheses, we're going to get the same answer, so let me\n1:14\nwrite it down again.\n1:15\nIf we were to do 12 times 3 times 10, if we just wrote it\n1:22\nlike this without parentheses, if we just went left to right,\n1:24\nthat would essentially be exactly what we just did here\n1:27\non the left.\n1:27\nBut the associative law of multiplication\n1:29\nsays, you know what?\n1:30\nWe can multiply the 3 times 10 first and then multiply the\n1:34\n12, and we're going to get the exact same answer as if we\n1:38\nmultiplied the 12 times the 3 and then the 10.\n1:40\nSo let's just verify it for ourselves.\n1:43\nSo 3 times 10 is 30, and we still want to multiply the 12\n1:50\ntimes that.\n1:51\nNow, what's 12 times 30?\n1:53\nAnd we've seen this several times before.\n1:55\nYou can view it as a 12 times 3, which is 36, but we still\n1:59\nhave this 0 here.\n2:00\nSo that is also equal to 360.\n2:03\nSo it didn't matter how we associated the multiplication.\n2:06\nYou can do the 12 times 3 first or you can do the 3\n2:09\ntimes 10 first.

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWhen you look at footage or photographs of astronauts\n0:03\nin space, it doesn't look like there's any gravity at work\n0:06\nhere.\n0:07\nEverything is not falling down in one direction.\n0:10\nIn fact, it's not even clear what up or down is.\n0:12\nEverything just floats around.\n0:14\nIf I were to push off of this wall,\n0:15\nI would just float in that direction.\n0:17\nSo it doesn't look like there's this overarching influence\n0:22\nlike gravity that's trying to pull everything down.\n0:26\nBut the question is that these astronauts are still\n0:29\nnot too far away from a supermassive body.\n0:32\nIn fact, the space shuttle gets up only a couple\n0:36\nof hundred miles above the surface of the Earth.\n0:38\nSo the space shuttle, if I were to draw it to scale,\n0:41\nwould probably be right about there.\n0:43\nAnd we know that the force of gravity between two objects\n0:47\nis equal to big G, the gravitational constant, times\n0:51\nthe mass of the first object, times the mass\n0:55\nof the second object over the distance between the two\n0:59\nobjects squared.\n1:00\nAnd if the space shuttle is right here,\n1:02\nonly a few hundred miles above the surface of the Earth,\n1:06\nthis r isn't that different.\n1:08\nIt's a little bit further than if you\n1:10\nwere at the surface of the Earth.\n1:11\nRemember that r is measured from wherever you are to the center,\n1:16\nfrom the center of the Earth, or really\n1:17\nthe center of the object to the center of the Earth.\n1:20\nThe center of the Earth represents most of the distance\n1:22\nhere.\n1:23\nSo if I'm at the surface of the Earth\n1:25\nor if I'm just a few hundred miles above the surface\n1:27\nof the Earth, it's not going to change r that dramatically,\n1:30\nespecially in terms of percentage.\n1:33\nSo when you look at it this way, it seems pretty clear\n1:35\nthat the force of gravity for someone who\n1:38\nis in space only a few hundred miles above the Earth\n1:42\nshould not be that different than the force of gravity\n1:46\nfor someone who is on the surface of the Earth.\n1:48\nSo my question to you is, what gives?\n1:51\nIf there should be gravity in space,\n1:53\nhow can we see all of these pictures\n1:55\nof people floating around like this?\n1:58\nAnd the answer is that there is gravity in space,\n2:02\nand that these people actually are falling.\n2:05\nThey're just moving fast enough relative to the Earth\n2:08\nthat they keep missing it.\n2:09\nAnd let me show you what I'm talking about there.\n2:16\nLet's say I'm sitting here in Africa,\n2:18\nand I were to shoot something, if maybe I\n2:20\nhave a really good sling shot, and I\n2:22\nwere to sling something super fast and maybe at a 45 degree\n2:25\nangle, it might take off a little bit\n2:27\nand eventually hit another point.\n2:29\nAnd this would actually already be a super duper slingshot.\n2:32\nI just made it travel a couple of thousand miles or at least\n2:34\nover 1,000 miles.\n2:36\nIf I make it go a little bit faster,\n2:38\nif I put a little bit more force on,\n2:40\nif I just propelled the projectile a little bit faster,\n2:43\nit might go a little bit further,\n2:45\nbut it will eventually fall back to the Earth.\n2:47\nLet's try to propel it a little bit faster than that.\n2:50\nThen it'll still fall to the Earth.\n2:52\nLet's propel it even faster than that.\n2:54\nWell then, it's still eventually going to fall to the Earth.\n2:57\nI think you might see where this is going.\n2:59\nLet's go even faster than that.\n3:01\nSo if we go even faster than that,\n3:02\neventually it'll fall to the Earth.\n3:04\nEven faster than that, so if you were\n3:07\nto throw an object even faster than that,\n3:10\nit would then go really far and then fall to the Earth.\n3:14\nI think you see what's happening.\n3:15\nEvery time you go faster and faster,\n3:17\nyou throw this projectile faster and faster,\n3:20\nit gets further and further, up to some velocity\n3:24\nthat you release this projectile,\n3:27\nand whenever it's trying to fall to the Earth,\n3:30\nit's going so fast that it keeps missing the Earth.\n3:32\nSo it'll keep going around and around and around the Earth,\n3:36\nand a projectile like that would essentially be in orbit.\n3:40\nSo what's happening is if there was\n3:42\nno gravity for that projectile, if there was no gravity,\n3:46\nthe projectile would just go straight away into space.\n3:51\nBut because there's gravity, it's constantly pulling it\n3:54\ntowards the center of the Earth, or the center\n3:57\nof that projectile and the center of the Earth\n4:00\nare being pulled towards each other,\n4:01\nI guess is a better way to think about it.\n4:03\nThe force of gravity is doing that.\n4:05\nAnd so it's curving its path.\n4:07\nAnd if it's going fast enough, if the projectile or whatever\n4:10\nobject we're talking about is going fast enough,\n4:12\nit'll just keep going round and round the Earth.\n4:15\nAnd since there is almost, pretty much, for most purposes\n4:20\nno air if you go high enough, especially the altitude\n4:24\nthat the space shuttle is, no noticeable drag,\n4:28\nthis thing can just keep on going\n4:29\nfor a substantial amount of time.\n4:31\nAlthough there is just a little bit of drag,\n4:33\nand that's why over time you do have satellites slow down,\n4:37\nbecause there is just a little bit of air resistance.\n4:39\nSo the answer to this conundrum is\n4:42\nthat there actually is gravity.\n4:45\nIt's not a gravity-free environment.\n4:47\nIt's just that the astronauts and the space shuttle\n4:50\nand everything else that's in the space shuttle,\n4:52\nit's all falling, but it's moving\n4:55\nfast enough that it never hits the Earth.\n4:57\nIt keeps missing the Earth.\n4:58\nIt keeps going round and round and round,\n5:01\nbut it is completely under the influence of gravity.\n5:04\nIf they were to just slow themselves down,\n5:07\nif they were to just brake relative to the Earth,\n5:11\nand if they were to just put their brakes on right\n5:14\nover there, they would all just plummet to the Earth.\n5:17\nSo there's nothing special about going 300 or 400 miles up\n5:21\ninto space, that all of a sudden gravity disappears.\n5:24\nThe influence of gravity, actually on some level,\n5:26\nit just keeps going.\n5:27\nYou can't, it might become unnoticeably\n5:29\nsmall at some point, but definitely\n5:31\nfor only a couple of hundred miles up in the air,\n5:33\nthere is definitely gravity there.\n5:35\nIt's just they're in orbit, they're going fast enough.\n5:38\nSo if they just keep falling, they're\n5:39\nnever going to hit the Earth.\n5:41\nAnd if you want to simulate gravity,\n5:42\nand this is actually how NASA does simulate gravity,\n5:45\nis that they will put people in a plane,\n5:47\nand they call it the vomit rocket\n5:49\nbecause it's known to make people sick,\n5:51\nand they'll make them go in a projectile motion.\n5:54\nSo if this is the ground, in a projectile path\n5:57\nor in a parabolic path I should say,\n5:59\nso the plane will take off, and it\n6:02\nwill do a path exactly the same as something in free fall\n6:07\nor in a parabolic path.\n6:09\nAnd so anyone who's sitting in that plane\n6:11\nwill experience free fall.\n6:13\nSo if you've ever been in, if you've ever right\n6:16\nwhen you jump off of a or if you've ever bungee\n6:18\njumped or skydived or even the feeling\n6:21\nwhen a roller coaster is going right over the top,\n6:23\nand it's pulling you down, and your stomach\n6:25\nfeels a little ill, that feeling of free fall, that's\n6:28\nthe exact same feeling that these astronauts feel\n6:31\nbecause they're in a constant state of free fall.\n6:34\nBut that is an indistinguishable feeling from,\n6:37\nif you were just in deep space and you weren't anywhere close\n6:40\nany noticeable mass, that is an identical feeling that you\n6:45\nwould feel to having no gravitational force around you.\n6:50\nSo hopefully that clarifies things a little bit.\n6:52\nTo someone who's just sitting in the space shuttle,\n6:54\nand if they had no windows, there's\n6:56\nno way of them knowing whether they\n6:58\nare close to a massive object and they're just\n7:00\nin free fall around it, they're in orbit, or whether they're\n7:03\njust completely far away from any massive object,\n7:06\nand they really are in a state of or in a place\n7:09\nwhere there's very little gravity.",

maybe not as famous,\n0:11\nbut maybe should be, famous German philosopher\n0:14\nand mathematician, and he was a contemporary of Isaac Newton.\n0:17\nThese two gentlemen together were really\n0:19\nthe founding fathers of calculus.\n0:22\nAnd they did some of their-- most of their major work\n0:25\nin the late 1600s.\n0:27\nAnd this right over here is Usain Bolt, Jamaican sprinter,\n0:31\nwhose continuing to do some of his best work in 2012.\n0:35\nAnd as of early 2012, he's the fastest human alive,\n0:38\nand he's probably the fastest human that has ever lived.\n0:41\nAnd you might have not made the association with these three\n0:45\ngentleman.\n0:45\nYou might not think that they have a lot in common.\n0:48\nBut they were all obsessed with the same fundamental question.\n0:52\nAnd this is the same fundamental question\n0:54\nthat differential calculus addresses.\n0:56\nAnd the question is, what is the instantaneous rate\n1:00\nof change of something?\n1:01\nAnd in the case of Usain Bolt, how fast is he going right now?\n1:05\nNot just what his average speed was for the last second,\n1:08\nor his average speed over the next 10 seconds.\n1:10\nHow fast is he going right now?\n1:14\nAnd so this is what differential calculus is all about.\n1:17\nInstantaneous rates of change.\n1:19\nDifferential calculus.\n1:23\nNewton's actual original term for differential calculus\n1:26\nwas the method of fluxions, which\n1:28\nactually sounds a little bit fancier.\n1:31\nBut it's all about what's happening in this instant.\n1:37\nAnd to think about why that is not a super easy problem\n1:40\nto address with traditional algebra, let's\n1:42\ndraw a little graph here.\n1:44\nSo on this axis I'll have distance.\n1:49\nI'll say y is equal to distance.\n1:51\nI could have said d is equal to distance,\n1:53\nbut we'll see, especially later on in calculus,\n1:55\nd is reserved for something else.\n1:57\nWe'll say y is equal to distance.\n1:59\nAnd in this axis, we'll say time.\n2:01\nAnd I could say t is equal to time,\n2:02\nbut I'll just say x is equal to time.\n2:07\nAnd so if we were to plot Usain Bolt's distance\n2:09\nas a function of time, well at time zero\n2:12\nhe hasn't gone anywhere.\n2:13\nHe is right over there.\n2:16\nAnd we know that this gentleman is\n2:17\ncapable of traveling 100 meters in 9.58 seconds.\n2:23\nSo after 9.58 seconds, we'll assume\n2:25\nthat this is in seconds right over here,\n2:27\nhe's capable of going 100 meters.\n2:32\nAnd so using this information, we\n2:33\ncan actually figure out his average speed.\n2:37\nLet me write it this way, his average speed\n2:41\nis just going to be his change in distance\n2:46\nover his change in time.\n2:50\nAnd using the variables that are over here,\n2:52\nwe're saying y is distance.\n2:53\nSo this is the same thing as change\n2:54\nin y over change in x from this point to that point.\n2:59\nAnd this might look somewhat familiar to you\n3:01\nfrom basic algebra.\n3:02\nThis is the slope between these two points.\n3:05\nIf I have a line that connects these two points,\n3:11\nthis is the slope of that line.\n3:13\nThe change in distance is this right over here.\n3:15\nChange in y is equal to 100 meters.\n3:19\nAnd our change in time is this right over here.\n3:22\nSo our change in time is equal to 9.58 seconds.\n3:27\nWe started at 0, we go to 9.58 seconds.\n3:30\nAnother way to think about it, the rise over the run you might\n3:33\nhave heard in your algebra class.\n3:34\nIt's going to be 100 meters over 9.58 seconds.\n3:37\nSo this is 100 meters over 9.58 seconds.\n3:43\nAnd the slope is essentially just rate of change,\n3:45\nor you could view it as the average rate\n3:47\nof change between these two points.\n3:49\nAnd you'll see, if you even just follow the units,\n3:51\nit gives you units of speed here.\n3:54\nIt would be velocity if we also specified the direction.\n3:57\nAnd we can figure out what that is,\n3:58\nlet me get the calculator out.\n4:02\nSo let me get the calculator on the screen.\n4:06\nSo we're going 100 meters in the 9.58 seconds.\n4:13\nSo it's 10.4, I'll just write 10.4, I'll round to 10.4.\n4:17\nSo it's approximately 10.4, and then the units\n4:20\nare meters per second.\n4:23\nAnd that is his average speed.\n4:26\nAnd what we're going to see in a second\n4:28\nis how average speed is different\n4:31\nthan instantaneous speed.\n4:32\nHow it's different than what the speed\n4:34\nhe might be going at any given moment.\n4:36\nAnd just to have a concept of how fast this is,\n4:38\nlet me get the calculator back.\n4:40\nThis is in meters per second.\n4:41\nIf you wanted to know how many meters he's going in an hour,\n4:43\nwell there's 3,600 seconds in an hour.\n4:48\nSo he'll be able to go this many meters 3,600 times.\n4:51\nSo that's how many meters he can,\n4:53\nif he were able to somehow keep up that speed in an hour.\n4:56\nThis is how fast he's going meters per hour.\n4:58\nAnd then, if you were to say how many miles per hour,\n5:01\nthere's roughly 1600-- and I don't know the exact number,\n5:03\nbut roughly 1600 meters per mile.\n5:06\nSo let's divide it by 1600.\n5:08\nAnd so you see that this is roughly a little over 23,\n5:11\nabout 23 and 1/2 miles per hour.\n5:14\nSo this is approximately, and I'll\n5:16\nwrite it this way-- this is approximately 23.5 miles\n5:28\nper hour.\n5:29\nAnd relative to a car, not so fast.\n5:31\nBut relative to me, extremely fast.\n5:34\nNow to see how this is different than instantaneous velocity,\n5:38\nlet's think about a potential plot of his distance\n5:41\nrelative to time.\n5:42\nHe's not going to just go this speed immediately.\n5:44\nHe's not just going to go as soon as the gun fires,\n5:46\nhe's not just going to go 23 and 1/2 miles per hour all the way.\n5:49\nHe's going to accelerate.\n5:51\nSo at first he's going to start off going a little bit slower.\n5:54\nSo the slope is going to be a little bit lot lower\n5:56\nthan the average slope.\n5:57\nHe's going to go a little bit slower,\n5:58\nthen he's going to start accelerating.\n6:00\nAnd so his speed, and you'll see the slope here\n6:02\nis getting steeper and steeper and steeper.\n6:05\nAnd then maybe near the end he starts tiring off a little bit.\n6:09\nAnd so his distance plotted against time\n6:11\nmight be a curve that looks something like this.\n6:14\nAnd what we calculated here is just\n6:15\nthe average slope across this change in time.\n6:20\nWhat we could see at any given moment\n6:21\nthe slope is actually different.\n6:23\nIn the beginning, he has a slower rate\n6:26\nof change of distance.\n6:28\nThen over here, then he accelerates over here,\n6:30\nit seems like his rate of change of distance, which\n6:32\nwould be roughly-- or you could view it\n6:34\nas the slope of the tangent line at that point,\n6:36\nit looks higher than his average.\n6:38\nAnd then he starts to slow down again.\n6:40\nWhen you average it out, it gets to 23 and 1/2 miles per hour.\n6:43\nAnd I looked it up, Usain Bolt's instantaneous velocity,\n6:46\nhis peak instantaneous velocity, is actually\n6:49\ncloser to 30 miles per hour.\n6:51\nSo the slope over here might be 23 whatever miles per hour.\n6:54\nBut the instantaneous, his fastest point\n6:57\nin this 9.58 seconds is closer to 30 miles per hour.\n7:01\nBut you see it's not a trivial thing to do.\n7:03\nYou could say, OK, let me try to approximate the slope right\n7:06\nover here.\n7:07\nAnd you could do that by saying, OK, well,\n7:09\nwhat is the change in y over the change of x right around this?\n7:13\nSo you could say, well, let me take some change of x,\n7:18\nand figure out what the change of y is around it,\n7:20\nor as we go past that.\n7:23\nSo you get that.\n7:23\nBut that would just be an approximation,\n7:25\nbecause you see that the slope of this curve\n7:27\nis constantly changing.\n7:28\nSo what you want to do is see what\n7:30\nhappens as your change of x gets smaller\n7:32\nand smaller and smaller.\n7:33\nAs your change of x get smaller and smaller and smaller,\n7:35\nyou're going to get a better and better approximation.\n7:37\nYour change of y is going to get smaller\n7:39\nand smaller and smaller.\n7:40\nSo what you want to do, and we're\n7:41\ngoing to go into depth into all of this,\n7:43\nand study it more rigorously, is you\n7:44\nwant to take the limit as delta x approaches\n7:49\n0 of your change in y over your change in x.\n7:57\nAnd when you do that, you're going\n8:00\nto approach that instantaneous rate of change.\n8:02\nYou could view it as the instantaneous slope\n8:04\nat that point in the curve.\n8:06\nOr the slope of the tangent line at that point in the curve.\n8:08\nOr if we use calculus terminology,\n8:10\nwe would view that as the derivative.\n8:12\nSo the instantaneous slope is the derivative.\n8:17\nAnd the notation we use for the derivative is a dy over dx.\n8:22\nAnd that's why I reserved the letter y.\n8:24\nAnd then you say, well, how does this\n8:25\nrelate to the word differential?\n8:28\nWell, the word differential is relating--\n8:30\nthis dy is a differential, dx is a differential.\n8:33\nAnd one way to conceptualize it, this\n8:35\nis an infinitely small change in y\n8:37\nover an infinitely small change in x.\n8:40\nAnd by getting super, super small changes in y\n8:42\nover change in x, you're able to get your instantaneous slope.\n8:46\nOr in the case of this example, the instantaneous speed\n8:49\nof Usain Bolt right at that moment.\n8:53\nAnd notice, you can't just put a 0 here.\n8:55\nIf you just put change in x is zero,\n8:56\nyou're going to get something that's undefined.\n8:58\nYou can't divide by 0.\n9:00\nSo we take the limit as it approaches 0.\n9:02\nAnd we'll define that more rigorously\n9:04\nin the next few videos.",

For example, Baptist is currently the largest denomination in the United States but there are many dozens more. How did this happen? Where did they all begin? To understand the Protestant Reform movement, we need to go back in history to the early 16th century when there was only one church in Western Europe - what we would now call the Roman Catholic Church - under the leadership of the Pope in Rome. Today, we call this \"Roman Catholic\" because there are so many other types of churches (ie Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, Calvinist, Anglican - you get the idea).\n\n###The Church and the State\nSo, if we go back to the year 1500, the Church (what we now call the Roman Catholic Church) was very powerful (politically and spiritually) in Western Europe (and in fact ruled over significant territory in Italy called the Papal States). But there were other political forces at work too. There was the Holy Roman Empire (largely made up of German speaking regions ruled by princes, dukes and electors), the Italian city-states, England, as well as the increasingly unified nation states of France and Spain (among others). The power of the rulers of these areas had increased in the previous century and many were anxious to take the opportunity offered by the Reformation to weaken the power of the papacy (the office of the Pope) and increase their own power in relation to the Church in Rome and other rulers.\n\nKeep in mind too, that for some time the Church had been seen as an institution plagued by internal power struggles (at one point in the late 1300s and 1400s church was ruled by three Popes simultaneously). Popes and Cardinals often lived more like kings than spiritual leaders. Popes claimed temporal (political) as well as spiritual power. They commanded armies, made political alliances and enemies, and, sometimes, even waged war. Simony (the selling of Church offices) and nepotism (favoritism based on family relationships) were rampant. Clearly, if the Pope was concentrating on these worldly issues, there wasn't as much time left for caring for the souls of the faithful. The corruption of the Church was well known, and several attempts had been made to reform the Church (notably by John Wyclif and Jan Hus), but none of these efforts successfully challenged Church practice until Martin Luther's actions in the early 1500s.\n\n![Lucas Cranach the Elder, Martin Luther, Bust in Three-Quarter View, 1520](http://khan.smarthistory.org/assets/images/images/LutherCranach-sm.jpeg)  \nLucas Cranach the Elder, *Martin Luther,* Bust in Three-Quarter View, 1520\n\n###Martin Luther\nMartin Luther was a German monk and Professor of Theology at the University of Wittenberg. Luther sparked the Reformation in 1517 by posting, at least according to tradition, his \"95 Theses\" on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany - these theses were a list of statements that expressed Luther's concerns about certain Church practices - largely the sale of indulgences, but they were based on Luther's deeper concerns with Church doctrine. Before we go on, notice that the word Protestant contains the word \"protest\" and that reformation contains the word \"reform\" - this was an effort, at least at first, to protest some practices of the Catholic Church and to reform that Church,\n\n###Indulgences\nThe sale of indulgences was a practice where the church acknowledged a donation or other charitable work with a piece of paper (an indulgence), that certified that your soul would enter heaven more quickly by reducing your time in purgatory. If you committed no serious sins that guaranteed your place in hell, and you died before repenting and atoning for all of your sins, then your soul went to Purgatory - a kind of way-station where you finished atoning for your sins before being allowed to enter heaven.\n\nPope Leo X had granted indulgences to raise money for the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. These indulgences were being sold by Johann Tetzel not far from Wittenberg, where Luther was Professor of Theology. Luther was gravely concerned about the way in which getting into heaven was connected with a financial transaction. But the sale of indulgences was not Luther's only disagreement with the institution of the Church.\n\n###Faith Alone\nMartin Luther was very devout and had experienced a spiritual crisis. He concluded that no matter how \"good\" he tried to be, no matter how he tried to stay away from sin, he still found himself having sinful thoughts. He was fearful that no matter how many good works he did, he could never do enough to earn his place in heaven (remember that, according to the Catholic Church, doing good works, for example commissioning works of art for the Church, helped one gain entrance to heaven). This was a profound recognition of the inescapable sinfulness of the human condition. After all, no matter how kind and good we try to be, we all find ourselves having thoughts which are unkind and sometimes much worse. Luther found a way out of this problem when he read St. Paul, who wrote \"The just shall live by faith\" (Romans 1:17). Luther understood this to mean that those who go to heaven (the just) will get there by faith alone - not by doing good works. In other words, God's grace is something freely given to human beings, not something we can earn. For the Catholic Church on the other hand, human beings, through good works, had some agency in their salvation.\n\n###Scripture Alone\nLuther (and other reformers) turned to the Bible as the only reliable source of instruction (as opposed to the teachings of the Church). The invention of the printing press in the middle of the 15th century (by Gutenberg in Mainz, Germany) together with the translation of the Bible into the vernacular (the common languages of French, Italian, German, English, etc.) meant that it was possible for those that could read to learn directly from Bible without having to rely on a priest or other church officials. Before this time, the Bible was available in Latin, the ancient language of Rome spoken chiefly by the clergy. Before the printing press, books were handmade and extremely expensive. The invention of the printing press and the translation of the bible into the vernacular meant that for the first time in history, the Bible was available to those outside of the Church. And now, a direct relationship to God, unmediated by the institution of the Catholic Church, was possible.\n\nWhen Luther and other reformers looked to the words of the Bible (and there were efforts at improving the accuracy of these new translations based on early Greek manuscripts), they found that many of the practices and teachings of the Church about how we achieve salvation didn't match Christ's teaching. This included many of the Sacraments, including Holy Communion (also known as the Eucharist). According to the Catholic Church, the miracle of Communion is transubstantiation - when the priest administers the bread and wine, they change (the prefix \"trans\" means to change) their substance into the body and blood of Christ. Luther denied that anything changed during Holy Communion. Luther thereby challenged one of the central sacraments of the Catholic Church, one of its central miracles, and thereby one of the ways that human beings can achieve grace with God, or salvation.\n\n###The Counter-Reformation\nThe Church initially ignored Martin Luther, but Luther's ideas (and variations of them, including Calvinism) quickly spread throughout Europe. He was asked to recant (to disavow) his writings at the Diet of Worms (an unfortunate name for a council held by the Holy Roman Emperor in the German city of Worms). When Luther refused, he was excommunicated (in other words, expelled from the church). The Church's response to the threat from Luther and others during this period is called the Counter-Reformation (\"counter\" meaning against).\n\n###The Council of Trent\nIn 1545 the Church opened the Council of Trent to deal with the issues raised by Luther. The Council of Trent was an assembly of high officials in the Church who met (on and off for eighteen years) principally in the Northern Italian town of Trent for 25 sessions.\n\n##Selected Outcomes of the Council of Trent:\n1. The Council denied the Lutheran idea of justification by faith. They affirmed, in other words, their Doctrine of Merit, which allows human beings to redeem themselves through Good Works, and through the sacraments.\n\n2. They affirmed the existence of Purgatory and the usefulness of prayer and indulgences in shortening a person's stay in purgatory.\n\n3. They reaffirmed the belief in transubstantiation and the importance of all seven sacraments\n\n4. They reaffirmed the authority of both scripture the teachings and traditions of the Church\n\n5. They reaffirmed the necessity and correctness of religious art (see below)\n\n###The Council of Trent on Religious Art\nAt the Council of Trent, the Church also reaffirmed the usefulness of images - but indicated that church officials should be careful to promote the correct use of images and guard against the possibility of idolatry. The council decreed that images are useful \"because the honour which is shown them is referred to the prototypes which those images represent\" (in other words, through the images we honor the holy figures depicted). And they listed another reason images were useful, \"because the miracles which God has performed by means of the saints, and their salutary examples, are set before the eyes of the faithful; that so they may give God thanks for those things; may order their own lives and manners in imitation of the saints; and may be excited to adore and love God, and to cultivate piety.\"\n\n###Violence\nThe Reformation was a very violent period in Europe, even family members were often pitted against one another in the wars of religion. Each side, both Catholics and Protestants, were often absolutely certain that they were in the right and that the other side was doing the devil's work.\n\nThe artists of this period - Michelangelo in Rome, Titian in Venice, Durer in Nuremberg, Cranach in Saxony - were impacted by these changes since the Church had been the single largest patron for artists. And now art was now being scrutinized in an entirely new way. The Catholic Church was looking to see if art communicated the stories of the Bible effectively and clearly (see Veronese's Feast in the House of Levi for more on this). Protestants on the other hand, for the most part lost the patronage of the Church and religious images (sculptures, paintings, stained glass windows etc) were destroyed in iconoclastic riots.\n\n###Other developments\nIt is also during this period that the Scientific Revolution gained momentum and observation of the natural world replaced religious doctrine as the source of our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Copernicus up-ended the ancient Greek model of the heavens by suggesting that the sun was at the center of the solar system and that the planets orbited around it.\n\nAt the same time, exploration, colonization and (the often forced) Christianization of what Europe called the \"new world\" continued. By the end of the century, the world of the Europeans was a lot bigger and opinions about that world were more varied and more uncertain than they had been for centuries. \n\nPlease note, this tutorial focuses on Western Europe. There are other forms of Christianity in other parts of the world including for example the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nText by Dr. Steven Zucker & Dr. Beth Harris",
