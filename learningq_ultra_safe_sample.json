    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:01\n- [Instructor] We've already seen that the change\n0:02\nin free energy, delta G,\n0:05\ncan be related to the cell potential E, by this equation.\n0:09\nUnder standard state conditions,\n0:11\nthis would be the standard change in free energy,\n0:13\nso delta G zero which is related to the\n0:15\nstandard cell potential E zero, right,\n0:18\nby the same equation.\n0:20\nThis equation down here comes from thermodynamics,\n0:23\nand we're going to plug in for delta G and delta G zero,\n0:27\nso we're going to plug this in for delta G,\n0:31\nand we're going to plug this in for delta G zero.\n0:34\nSo that gives us negative nFE is equal to,\n0:39\nnegative nFE zero, plus RT,\n0:45\nnatural log of Q,\n0:47\nwhere Q is the reaction quotient.\n0:50\nLet's divide everything by negative nF,\n0:53\nso we're going to divide everything\n0:55\nin here by negative nF,\n0:57\nand let's see what cancels out.\n1:00\nSo all of this would cancel out,\n1:02\nall of that would cancel out,\n1:04\nand we get the Nernst equation.\n1:07\nSo let me go ahead and write it,\n1:08\nthe cell potential E,\n1:11\nis equal to the standard cell potential, E zero,\n1:15\nminus RT over nF,\n1:20\ntimes the natural log of Q,\n1:23\nwhere Q is the reaction quotient.\n1:26\nSo this is the Nernst equation,\n1:29\nalright, we'll talk about why the Nernst equation\n1:32\nis so important, we'll talk more about that\n1:33\nat the end of the video.\n1:35\nRight now, let's go ahead and derive\n1:38\nanother form of the Nernst equation,\n1:40\nI should say, the form when you're talking\n1:41\nabout a certain temperature.\n1:43\nSo at 25 degrees C, right,\n1:46\nmost of our reactions take place at 25 degrees C,\n1:50\nwell, temperature, right,\n1:52\ntemperature in here, this in the temperature in Kelvin,\n1:54\nso we need to convert to Kelvin.\n1:57\nSo if you add 273.15, alright,\n2:01\nyou get your temperature in Kelvin,\n2:03\nso that would be 298.15,\n2:08\nso what we're going to do is solve for RT over F,\n2:12\nto write a different form of the Nernst equation.\n2:15\nAnd so the temperature is 298.15 Kelvin,\n2:18\nso let's write that in,\n2:20\nso 298.15 Kelvin.\n2:24\nR is the gas constant,\n2:26\nso remember, the gas constant is 8.314, 8.314,\n2:31\njoules over mole Kelvin.\n2:35\nAnd F is Faraday's constant,\n2:38\nremember Faraday's constant from an earlier video, right,\n2:40\nthat's 96,500 coulombs per mole.\n2:45\nSo Faraday's constant is the\n2:48\ncharge of one mole of electrons.\n2:52\nAlright, so let's solve for\n2:53\nwhat all this is equal to,\n2:55\nso let's get some more space,\n2:57\nand let's get out the calculator.\n3:00\nSo we've already done this calculation\n3:02\nin an earlier video,\n3:03\nbut I'm going to go ahead and do it again,\n3:05\nfor this Nernst equation video.\n3:06\nSo 8.314 times 289.15,\n3:14\nwe need to divide that by Faraday's constant, 96,500.\n3:19\nSo that gives us 0.0257, alright,\n3:24\nso this is equal to,\n3:26\nthis is equal to 0.0257,\n3:31\nand for units, Kelvin would cancel out,\n3:33\nmoles would cancel out,\n3:35\nthat gives us joules over coulombs,\n3:37\nwhich is equal to volts, alright.\n3:40\nSo this is equal to volts,\n3:42\nand we can write another form of the Nernst equation.\n3:46\nSo if your reaction is at 25 degrees C,\n3:50\nyou can write the Nernst equation this way,\n3:52\nyou could say that the cell potential E,\n3:54\nis equal to the standard cell potential E zero, minus,\n3:59\nso all that RT over F is equal to this, 0.0257, right.\n4:05\nSo 0.0257 volts,\n4:09\nwe still have n,\n4:11\nremember n is the number of moles\n4:14\nI'm going to use green for that,\n4:15\nn is the number of moles\n4:17\nof electrons that are transferred\n4:19\nin your redox reaction, right.\n4:21\nSo we're going to put n in here,\n4:23\nand we still have the natural log of Q,\n4:26\nthe reaction quotient, right.\n4:28\nSo here is another form of the Nernst equation,\n4:33\nalright, so at 25 degrees, you can use this form,\n4:36\nand then we can also write this\n4:40\ninto base 10 logarithms that have natural logs.\n4:43\nSo we can do that conversion, right.\n4:45\nSo we also did that in an earlier video,\n4:47\nbut if you're trying to convert this 0.0257,\n4:52\nyou need to multiply by the natural log of 10.\n4:56\nSo when we do that,\n4:58\nso we have 0.0257 times the natural log of 10,\n5:05\nthat gives us 0.0592,\n5:08\nso this is equal to 0.0592.\n5:14\nSo we can write the Nernst equation once again,\n5:18\nalright, so E, or the cell potential,\n5:20\nis equal to the standard cell potential E zero,\n5:22\nminus 0.0592 over n.\n5:29\nAnd we essentially just change this\n5:32\nfrom natural logarithm to base 10 logarithm,\n5:34\nso this would be log of Q, log of the reaction quotient.\n5:39\nSo here is just another form of the Nernst equation.\n5:44\nSo why is the Nernst equation important\n5:47\nand why is it useful?\n5:48\nIt's useful, because it allows us to calculate\n5:51\na cell potential under non-standard state conditions,\n5:56\nso think about this cell potential\n5:59\nas being the instantaneous cell potential,\n6:02\nand you can relate that\n6:03\nto the progress of the reaction, right.\n6:05\nSo as you change concentrations,\n6:07\nthe reaction quotient Q changes, right,\n6:10\nand that means that the\n6:12\ninstantaneous cell potential changes,\n6:15\nalright, so if you change if the concentrations,\n6:17\nif you change the concentrations,\n6:19\nyou're changing the cell potential.\n6:21\nAnd so we'll see more about that in the next video,\n6:23\nso I think that the Nernst equation makes much more\n6:26\nsense when you do some problems with it,\n6:29\nand then you can understand better what it means.",

One mole of sulfur.\n4:27\nSo sulfur's atomic mass is\n4:32\n32 atomic mass units per sulfur atom.\n4:36\nSo a whole mole of it is going to have a mass of 32 grams.\n4:41\nSo a mole of sulfur-- not a mule.\n4:45\nMaybe I should invent a new unit called the mule.\n4:48\nSo a mole of sulfur is 32 grams.\n4:51\nSo how many moles do we have?\n4:53\nWe have a little bit more than one,\n4:54\nbut let's be precise here,\n4:56\nbecause everything else is a little bit of a decimal.\n4:58\nSo if we have 32.65 grams of sulfur\n5:07\nand we divide by the number of grams per mole\n5:10\n-- divided by 32 grams per mole\n5:13\nwe have 1.02 moles of sulfur.\n5:25\nThis was hydrogen up here.\n5:27\nSo here, you should hopefully see a pretty good ratio, here.\n5:30\nFor every one sulfur atom--\n5:32\nI mean, the ratio worked exactly out\n5:33\nand that's because I did this problem before.\n5:36\nI actually made up this problem before we worked,\n5:38\nso I made it so the numbers worked out.\n5:39\nBut one mole of sulfur, for every mole of sulfur,\n5:42\nso for every 6.02 times 10 to the 23 sulphur atoms,\n5:46\nyou have two moles of hydrogen, right?\n5:48\nThis ratio is 1:2.\n5:49\nTwo times 1.02 is 2.04.\n5:52\nAnd then, for every one mole of sulfur,\n5:54\nyou have four moles of oxygen. Right?\n5:56\nLiterally, if you multiply this times four you get 4.08.\n5:59\nSo the ratio of hydrogen to sulfur to oxygen\n6:08\nis for every one sulfur,\n6:11\nwe have two hydrogens and we have four oxygens.\n6:15\nSo the empirical formula of this is H2.\n6:25\nAnd then we have one sulfur.\n6:28\nAnd then we have four oxygens.\n6:30\nAnd this is sulfuric acid, one of the things\n6:33\nyou would least like poured\n6:35\non you most of the time.\n6:37\nAnyway, hope you found that useful.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWe left off in the last video in the Archean Eon.\n0:03\nAnd \"arche\" comes from ancient Greek.\n0:05\nIt means beginning or origin.\n0:08\nAnd it's the eon in which either life first started to exist\n0:11\nor at least it first start to somewhat flourish.\n0:13\nIt's possible that maybe life first\n0:16\nstarted to exist at the end of the Hadeon Eon.\n0:18\nAnd, of course, this boundary is vague.\n0:20\nAnd the Archean Eon is also the first eon\n0:23\nwhere we still have rocks from that time.\n0:26\nSo we are able to find rocks that we can date\n0:28\nto be roughly 3.8 billion years.\n0:31\nNow, the other really interesting thing\n0:33\nthat happened in the Archean Eon,\n0:34\nand it really has pretty profound effects\n0:37\nonce we get into the Proterozoic Eon,\n0:40\nis that you started to have cyanobacteria produce oxygen.\n0:45\nAnd we said in the last video that they were producing\n0:48\noxygen, but most of that oxygen was\n0:50\nbeing absorbed by iron in the oceans.\n0:53\nBut what happens is we enter into the Proterozoic Eon.\n0:57\nAnd Proterozoic Eon, it's right over here.\n0:59\nI don't know if you can see it .\n1:01\nI'll rewrite it, Proterozoic.\n1:06\nWe're now in the Proterozoic Eon that\n1:11\nstarts up about 2.5 billion years ago.\n1:15\nAnd \"proterozoic\" comes from the Greek for earlier life.\n1:22\nAnd I'm not a Greek scholar.\n1:23\nSo any of you Greeks out there, forgive me\n1:26\nif I'm not getting the translation exactly right.\n1:28\nBut what's really interesting about the Proterozoic Eon\n1:33\nis that that oxygen that was being produced\n1:35\nby the cyanobactera, and at some point\n1:38\nbegins to saturate the iron and any other molecule that\n1:42\ncould have absorbed it before.\n1:43\nAnd once it saturates, it starts to get\n1:46\nreleased into the atmosphere.\n1:49\nSo the oxygen starts to get released\n1:51\nand accumulate in the atmosphere.\n1:52\nAnd we think this started to happen\n1:55\nabout 2.4 billion years ago.\n1:58\nSo 2.4 billion years ago, oxygen begins\n2:02\nto accumulate in the atmosphere.\n2:03\nAnd, of course, these dates, they\n2:05\nmight be moved around a few hundred million years\n2:08\nas we get more and more data.\n2:09\nBut this is the current understanding\n2:11\nof when things happened.\n2:13\nAnd maybe we'll look at the geological record,\n2:15\nor the fossil record, and we'll move these things around\n2:17\nin the future.\n2:18\nI can only imagine that 50 years from now,\n2:19\nor 100 years from now, if someone is still\n2:21\nwatching this video, a lot of this\n2:23\nmight say, hey, we found out later\n2:24\nthat oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere\n2:27\nearlier or later or that eukaryotes\n2:29\noccurred earlier or later.\n2:30\nBut this, as far as I can tell, is\n2:31\nour best current understanding.\n2:33\nBut the 2.4 billion years ago, oxygen\n2:39\nbegins to accumulate in the atmosphere.\n2:45\nAnd what's interesting about this is once it accumulates\n2:49\nand once it gets kind of a critical amount of oxygen\n2:52\nin the atmosphere-- and I touched\n2:54\non this in the last video-- about 2.3 billion years ago,\n2:57\nwe have something called the Great Oxygenation Event,\n3:01\nsometimes called the Oxygen Catastrophe.\n3:05\nAnd this is right here.\n3:06\nThey marked it this right here, 2.3 billion years ago\n3:09\nor 2,300 million years ago, atmosphere becomes oxygen rich.\n3:13\nAnd it's not as oxygen rich as our current atmosphere.\n3:17\nBut it becomes oxygen rich enough\n3:20\nthat at least the environment becomes\n3:22\nsuitable for eurkaryotic organisms or eukaryotic cells.\n3:27\nNow the other interesting thing, and we might not\n3:29\ncare so much about it because we needed the oxygen,\n3:31\nis that we think that this was actually\n3:33\nthe greatest extinction event in the history of Earth.\n3:37\nThat's why it's called the Oxygen Catastrophe.\n3:40\nSo this right over here, 2.3 billion years ago-- I\n3:42\nshouldn't giggle about it-- this is a serious matter.\n3:45\nThis is the greatest extinction event in Earth's history,\n3:55\nin History.\n3:56\nAnd I'll do history with a capital H,\n3:59\nin the history of the Earth.\n4:01\nAnd that's because the cyanobacteria\n4:03\nis producing all this oxygen.\n4:05\nIt eventually saturates the iron.\n4:07\nIt accumulates in the air.\n4:08\nOnce it gets to enough concentration,\n4:10\nit begins to actually suffocate.\n4:11\nIt's poisonous.\n4:12\nIt's poisonous to most of the other organisms\n4:16\non the planet that were anaerobic,\n4:18\nthat did not need oxygen, that actually\n4:22\nfound oxygen poisonous.\n4:24\nBut since we have oxygen, there's\n4:26\ntwo interesting things that happened once that oxygen\n4:29\naccumulated, other than causing this mass extinction\n4:32\nevent-- actually three interesting things.\n4:33\nTwo of them are crucial to us eventually\n4:38\nshowing up on this planet.\n4:40\nThe first is is that it became suitable now for eukaryotes\n4:44\nto exist.\n4:45\nEukaryotic organisms, remember, these\n4:46\nare organisms that have nuclear membranes around their DNA.\n4:51\nMost eukaryotes have other organelles, like mitochondria.\n4:55\nThey need oxygen.\n5:02\nYou can go to the biology playlist.\n5:04\nWe actually talk about respiration\n5:05\nthat occurs in the mitochondria.\n5:07\nAnd that's obviously a process that needs oxygen.\n5:11\nSo one, we have, now that oxygen is in the atmosphere,\n5:13\nwe're starting to have an environment where\n5:15\neukaryotes could at least exist.\n5:17\nAnd based on the fossil records, and when\n5:19\nwe look at how the DNA has changed over time--\n5:22\nand we'll do multiple videos of that-- we\n5:25\nthink that the first eukaryotes showed up\n5:27\nabout 2.2 billion years ago.\n5:30\nAlthough there's some debate here.\n5:31\nThere's some evidence it might have been a little earlier,\n5:33\nsome evidence it might have a little later.\n5:35\nI'm sure that number will be refined.\n5:37\nBut give or take a few hundred millions\n5:40\nof years, one prokaryote got engulfed by another prokaryote,\n5:45\nand said, hey, we do pretty well living together.\n5:47\nI mean the current theory is that mitochondria is actually\n5:55\ndescended from kind of an ancient prokaryotic cell,\n5:58\nan ancient bacteria.\n5:59\nIt actually has its own DNA.\n6:02\nAnd actually, your mitochondrial DNA\n6:04\nis passed down from your mother, and your mother's mother,\n6:06\nand your mother's mother, so on and so forth.\n6:08\nSo it's kind of like another little animal\n6:10\nliving inside of a larger cell.\n6:12\nAnd we are eukaryotes.\n6:13\nWe needed this to happen.\n6:16\nThe human body, we're not just one eukaryotic cell.\n6:18\nWe're made up of trillions.\n6:19\nThe estimates are 50 to 100 trillion eukaryotic cells.\n6:24\nSo these are our ancestors that had\n6:27\nto come into being at that time.\n6:30\nAnd once again, all of this is happening inside of the oceans.\n6:34\nNow, the other interesting thing that happened--\n6:36\nremember, we're being bombarded with UV radiation from the Sun.\n6:40\nSo if you're on the land-- let me draw the land and the ocean.\n6:45\nSo here is the ocean and then here is the land.\n6:51\nHere is the land, right over there in yellow, constantly\n6:55\nbeing bombarded with UV radiation.\n6:58\nAnd \"UV\" stands for ultraviolet.\n6:59\nSo I'm drawing it in purple.\n7:00\nBut it's even more violet than purple.\n7:03\nSo it's constantly being bombarded\n7:05\nby with ultraviolet radiation from the Sun,\n7:08\nwhich is very inhospitable to DNA and to life.\n7:12\nAnd so the only life at this point\n7:14\ncould occur in the ocean, where it was protected\n7:16\nto some degree from the ultraviolet radiation.\n7:20\nThe land was just open to it.\n7:22\nAnything on the land would have just gotten irradiated.\n7:24\nIt's DNA would get mutated.\n7:25\nIt just would not be able to live.\n7:28\nSo what happened, and what I guess has to happen,\n7:31\nand the reason why we are able to live on land\n7:33\nnow is that we have an ozone layer.\n7:36\nWe have an ozone layer up in the upper atmosphere\n7:40\nthat helps absorb, that blocks most of the UV radiation\n7:46\nfrom the Sun.\n7:47\nAnd now that oxygen began to accumulate,\n7:50\nwe have the Oxygen Catastrophe.\n7:51\nOxygen accumulates in the atmosphere.\n7:54\nSome of that oxygen goes into the upper atmosphere.\n7:57\nSo we're now in this time period right over here.\n7:59\nIt goes into the upper atmosphere.\n8:01\nIt actually really reacts with the UV light\n8:03\nto turn into ozone, which then can help actually\n8:07\nblock the UV light.\n8:08\nAnd I'll do another video maybe on the ozone/oxygen cycle.\n8:13\nSo this oxygen production, it's crucial,\n8:16\none, to having an ozone layer so that eventually life\n8:19\ncan exist on the land.\n8:21\nAnd it's also crucial because eukaryotic organisms\n8:24\nneed that oxygen.\n8:25\nNow, the third thing that happened,\n8:27\nand this is also pretty significant event,\n8:30\nwe believe that that oxygen that started\n8:33\nto accumulate in the atmosphere, reacted with methane\n8:36\nin the atmosphere.\n8:37\nSo it reacted with methane.\n8:39\nAnd methane is an ozone-- not an ozone.\n8:43\nIt's a greenhouse gas.\n8:45\nIt helps retain heat in the atmosphere.\n8:47\nAnd once it reacts with the oxygen\n8:49\nand starts dropping out of the atmosphere as methane,\n8:52\nwe believe the Earth cooled down.\n8:54\nAnd it entered its first, and some people\n8:56\nbelieve it's longest, snowball period.\n8:59\nSo that's what they talk about right here\n9:01\non this diagram, the first snowball Earth.\n9:06\nIt's sometimes called the Huronic glaciation.\n9:08\nAnd that happened because we weren't\n9:10\nable to retain our heat, if that theory is correct.\n9:13\nAnd so the whole-- as the theory goes-- the whole Earth\n9:16\nessentially just iced over.\n9:20\nSo as we go through the Proterozoic Eon,\n9:24\nI guess the big markers of it is it's the first time that we now\n9:28\nhave an oxygen-rich atmosphere.\n9:30\nIt's the first time that eukaryotes can now\n9:34\ncome into existence because they now\n9:36\nhave oxygen to, I guess we could say, breathe.\n9:39\nAnd the other big thing is now this is where the ozone forms.\n9:43\nSo this kind of sets the stage for in the next eon,\n9:46\nfor animals or living things, to eventually get on to the land.\n9:52\nAnd we'll talk about that in the next video.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn this video, we're going to talk about the law of demand,\n0:04\nwhich is one of the core ideas of microeconomics.\n0:07\nAnd lucky for us, it's a fairly intuitive idea.\n0:10\nIt just tells us that if we raise the price of a product,\n0:16\nthat will lower the quantity demanded for the product.\n0:20\nQuantity demanded will go down.\n0:23\nAnd you could imagine the other side of that.\n0:25\nIf we lower the price of a product,\n0:30\nthat will raise the quantity demanded of that product.\n0:36\nAnd the law of demand says this just kind of generally.\n0:39\nWhat we'll see in a few videos from now\n0:41\nis that there are some exceptions to this.\n0:44\nBut to make this little concrete,\n0:46\nlet's think about the demand for a certain product.\n0:49\nAnd one thing I want to clear here,\n0:51\nand I'm going to go through great pains\n0:53\nto not mess this up, is that when\n0:55\nwe talk about the word demand in a formal economic sense,\n0:59\nwe're not talking about a quantity.\n1:01\nWe're actually going to talk, all\n1:02\nelse equal, ceteris paribus, the relationship\n1:07\nbetween price and quantity demanded.\n1:10\nIf we talk about an actual quantity,\n1:11\nwe should say the quantity demanded.\n1:13\nSo demand versus quantity demanded.\n1:17\nThese are two different things.\n1:19\nAnd if it's a little confusing to you\n1:21\nright now, hopefully by the end of this video,\n1:23\nthe difference between demand and quantity\n1:25\ndemanded will become a little bit clearer.\n1:27\nAnd definitely over the next few videos, because in this video,\n1:30\nwe're going to focus on how the quantity demanded changes\n1:33\nrelative to the price.\n1:34\nIn future videos, we'll talk about how\n1:36\nthe entire relationship, how demand changes\n1:39\nbased on different factors.\n1:41\nBut to make things concrete, let's\n1:42\nsay I'm about to release my science fiction\n1:47\nbook, Space Whatever.\n1:48\nI don't know, the book that I want to release.\n1:50\nSo I'm going to release some ebook.\n1:54\nAnd we've done some market study,\n1:56\nor we just know how the demand is related to price\n2:00\nor the price is related to demand.\n2:02\nAnd we're going to show that in a demand schedule, which\n2:06\nis really just a table that just shows how the price-- and,\n2:12\nactually I just made my first mistake.\n2:14\nI just said how price relates to demand.\n2:17\nI should say how price relates to quantity demanded\n2:20\nand how quantity demanded relates to price.\n2:23\nSo demand schedule, it shows a relationship between price\n2:27\nand quantity demanded, all else equal.\n2:32\nSo we're going to have multiple scenarios here.\n2:36\nSo this column, let me do my scenarios.\n2:38\nIn this column, let me put my price.\n2:41\nIn this column, I put my quantity demanded.\n2:50\nSo scenario, let's call this scenario A.\n2:54\nI could price my book at $2.\n2:59\nAnd I'll get a ton of people downloading it at that price.\n3:02\nSo I will get 60,000 people download my book\n3:07\nat that price, my ebook.\n3:09\nScenario B, I could raise the price by $2.\n3:12\nSo it's now $4.\n3:14\nAnd that kills off a lot of the demand.\n3:17\nNow the quantity demanded goes down\n3:18\nto 40,000 people downloading it.\n3:21\nThen I can go to scenario C, if I raise it by another $2.\n3:24\nSo now I'm at $6.\n3:26\nNow that lowers the quantity demanded to 30,000.\n3:32\nI'll do a couple more of these.\n3:33\nScenario D, I raise another $2.\n3:37\nSo I get to $8 now.\n3:39\nNow the quantity demanded goes down to 25,000.\n3:43\nAnd I'll do one more of these.\n3:46\nLet me see, what color have I not used yet.\n3:48\nI haven't used yellow yet.\n3:49\nScenario E, if I raise it to $10,\n3:53\nnow the quantity demanded, let's just say, is 23,000.\n3:59\nSo this relationship shows the law of demand right over here.\n4:05\nAnd this table that shows how the quantity demanded\n4:07\nrelates to price and vice versa, this\n4:09\nis what we call a demand schedule.\n4:11\nNow we can also, based on this demand schedule,\n4:14\ndraw a demand curve.\n4:15\nAnd really, we're just going to plot these points\n4:17\nand draw the curve the connects them.\n4:20\nBecause these aren't the only scenarios.\n4:23\nAnything in between is possible.\n4:24\nWe could charge $2.01 for the book.\n4:26\nWe could charge for $4.50 for the book.\n4:28\nAnd so that's what the demand curve captures a little bit\n4:30\nbetter, because it's a continuous curve, not just\n4:32\nfive points.\n4:34\nSo let's do that.\n4:35\nLet's graph it.\n4:37\nAnd this is one of those conventions of economics\n4:39\nthat I am not a fan of.\n4:40\nBecause people often talk about changing the price,\n4:45\nand how the quantity demanded changes from that.\n4:48\nAnd in traditional-- in most of math and science, the thing\n4:51\nthat you're changing, you normally\n4:52\nput on the horizontal axis.\n4:54\nSo if I was in charge of the convention of economics,\n4:58\nI would plot price on the horizontal axis\n5:01\nright over here.\n5:02\nBut the way it's done typically is\n5:04\nthat price is done on the vertical axis.\n5:06\nAnd so you're used to seeing it in kind of a traditional class\n5:08\nenvironment.\n5:09\nI'll do the same.\n5:10\nSo we'll put price in the vertical axis,\n5:13\nand we'll put quantity demanded in the horizontal axis.\n5:21\nAnd our quantity demanded goes all the up to 60,000.\n5:23\nSo let's see, that's 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.\n5:29\nSo that's 10-- this is in thousands-- 20, 30, 40-- sorry,\n5:34\nnot 45-- 40, 50, and 60.\n5:38\nAnd this is in thousands.\n5:41\nAnd then the price goes up to $10, from $2 to $10.\n5:45\nSo let's say this is 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.\n5:55\nSo let's plot the scenarios.\n5:57\nSo scenario A, price is $2, 60,000 units are demanded.\n6:02\nThat is scenario A right over there.\n6:05\nScenario B, when the price is $4, 40,000 units are demanded.\n6:13\nAnd that's right over there.\n6:14\nThat's scenario B.\n6:16\nScenario C, $6, 30,000 units.\n6:22\nRight over there, scenario C. Scenario D, $8, 25,000 units.\n6:29\n$8, 25 is right about there.\n6:32\nThat looks like 25,000, right in between.\n6:34\nThat's close enough.\n6:36\nSo that right over there is scenario D.\n6:39\nAnd then finally scenario E, $10, 23,000 units.\n6:46\nSo it might be something like that.\n6:48\nThat is scenario E.\n6:50\nAnd so we could actually have prices\n6:52\nanywhere in between that.\n6:53\nAnd maybe we could even go further.\n6:55\nSo this right over here.\n6:56\nSo if I were to draw the demand curve,\n6:58\nit could look something like this.\n7:00\nThe demand curve would look something--\n7:03\nI'm trying to do my best to draw it\n7:04\nas a straight continuous line-- could look something like that.\n7:08\nAnd it could keep going on and on.\n7:11\nAnd so these are two ways to show demand.\n7:13\nSo just going back to what I said earlier,\n7:16\nthe quantity demanded is, all else\n7:17\nequal for a given price, how many units people are\n7:22\nwilling to download or buy of my ebook.\n7:25\nWhen we talk about the demand itself,\n7:30\nwe're talking about this entire relationship.\n7:33\nSo this demand itself is this entire demand schedule.\n7:36\nOr another way to think of it is this entire demand curve.\n7:39\nIf demand were to change, we would actually\n7:43\nhave a different curve.\n7:44\nThis curve would shift, or the entries in this table\n7:48\nwould shift.\n7:49\nIf the quantity of demand changes--\n7:51\nso we move along this curve when you hold everything else equal\n7:55\nand you only change price.\n7:57\nSo hopefully that makes it clear.\n7:58\nWhen everything else is equal, and you're only changing price,\n8:02\nyou're not changing demand, you're\n8:04\nchanging the quantity demanded.\n8:05\nThe demand, because everything else is equal,\n8:07\nis this relationship.\n8:09\nIn the next few videos, we'll think\n8:10\nabout what does happen when you do\n8:12\nchange some of those other factors.",

Optics Project Laboratory,\n0:27\nand this is Young's Double Slit Experiment,\n0:28\nan important experiment from around 1800.\n0:32\nWe have a laser shining light onto a pair of identical slits.\n0:35\nThese are rectangular openings in a transparency.\n0:39\nAfter shining through slits, light propagates some distance\n0:41\nto a screen where we can observe the resulting pattern.\n0:44\nWe have a webcam set up so you can see\n0:46\nwhat's happening on the screen.\n0:48\nRight now, we have blocked one of the two slits.\n0:50\nSo light is propagating through a single slit,\n0:53\nand this is the pattern that results.\n0:56\nLet's see what happens when we open the second slit.\n1:01\nThe pattern changes significantly.\n1:03\nYou should be asking yourself why has the pattern changed\n1:06\nand why is this experiment important?\n1:08\nThe answers to those two questions are related.\n1:11\nTo understand why this experiment is important\n1:13\nand what we are observing, you have\n1:15\nto go back to the days of Sir Isaac Newton.\n1:18\nAt that time, people were debating\n1:19\nthe basic nature of light.\n1:21\nOne group of people held that light\n1:23\nwas a particle traveling like a projectile from a source\n1:26\nto an observer.\n1:28\nAnother group of people held that light propagate more\n1:30\nlike a wave, sort of like the waves\n1:32\nyou see moving along the surface of the body of water.\n1:35\nBased on his own experiments and extensive observations,\n1:38\nSir Isaac Newton decided that light was most like a particle.\n1:42\nNewton was quite brilliant in advanced science\n1:44\nin a number of fields.\n1:45\nSo for many people, because Newton says so,\n1:48\nwas solid evidence that light was a particle,\n1:50\nand Newton's corpuscular theory of light was widely accepted.\n1:55\nAbout seven years after Newton's death,\n1:57\nanother scientist, Thomas Young, was working with light\n2:00\nand he came to believe that light behaved like a wave.\n2:03\nYoung's double slit experiment attempts\n2:05\nto address the nature of light by looking\n2:07\nat what happens when light passes through a pair of slits.\n2:10\nIf light behaved like a particle,\n2:12\nfor the double slit experiment, we\n2:14\nwould expect to see two overlapping copies\n2:16\nof the single slit pattern.\n2:18\nThis did not match our own observation.\n2:21\nOn the other hand, if light behaves like a wave,\n2:23\nwe expect to see the two waves interfere,\n2:26\nadding together in some directions\n2:28\nand canceling each other in others.\n2:30\nIf we make some assumptions about how light propagates,\n2:33\nwe can predict that the intensity\n2:34\npattern on a screen placed far from the slits\n2:37\nwill be a proportional product of a sinc-squared term\n2:40\ndue to the width of a single slit,\n2:42\nand a cosine-squared term due do the separation\n2:44\nof the two slits.\n2:46\nThis is an excellent match for what we observe in lab,\n2:48\nand is good evidence that light behaves like a wave.\n2:51\nSo the pattern that we observed was\n2:53\ndue to the interference of light that passed through one slit\n2:55\nwith light that was passing through the other slit,\n2:57\nand it looks as though light is propagating as a wave.\n3:00\nDoes that mean that we could shine any light\n3:02\nthrough this system and expect to see an interference pattern?\n3:04\nFor instance, can we shine the light from this flashlight\n3:06\nthrough the double slit and see an interference pattern?\n3:09\nIt turns out the answer is no and it's\n3:10\na problem of spatial coherence, which\n3:12\nis the ability of light from one point on a wave front\n3:15\nto interfere with light from another point on the wave\n3:17\nfront.\n3:18\nThis laser has a lot of spatial coherence,\n3:20\nbut a flashlight and most other sources have very little.\n3:23\nSo how did Thomas Young do his experiment?\n3:25\nAfter all, they didn't have lasers in the 1800s.\n3:28\nWell, it turns out it is possible to get\n3:30\nthese interference patterns to form even when\n3:32\nusing a source normally considered incoherent,\n3:34\nit just takes a little planning and some more work.\n3:38\nThomas Young recognized that not just any light\n3:40\ncould be used to see interference effects.\n3:42\nIn this quote from his lecture on the nature of light\n3:45\nand colors, he lays out the conditions\n3:47\non the interfering portions of light\n3:49\nas deriving from the same origin,\n3:51\narriving at the same point in different paths,\n3:54\nand traveling in similar directions.\n3:57\nThis suggests two possible approaches to the experiment.\n4:00\nOne approach is to mask your source down to a point.\n4:03\nThis is probably the technique that Young\n4:05\nused as he mentions using a pinhole and a shuttered window\n4:08\nin his other publications.\n4:10\nIt has the advantage of being simple with the disadvantage\n4:13\nof wasting much of the source light.\n4:16\nAnother approach is to simply place a source\n4:18\nfar away from double slits.\n4:20\nThis approach allows astronomers to perform\n4:22\nstellar interferometry experiments,\n4:24\nand will allow you to view interference patterns\n4:26\nusing street lights at night as a light source.\n4:30\nA double pinhole system is quite easy to construct at home,\n4:33\nand can produce striking interference patterns\n4:35\nusing street lights as a light source.\n4:38\nTo build the system, you'll need a piece of pipe, some cardboard\n4:42\nto block most of one end of the pipe,\n4:44\nand the pair of pinholes in a piece of opaque material.\n4:47\nFor my system, I used a piece of stainless steel shim stock,\n4:50\nbut good results can be had with the material from a soda can.\n4:54\nTo make the pinholes, the basic technique\n4:56\nis to dimple the material with a pen,\n4:58\nand then sand away the protruding material\n5:00\non the other side until you have two nice pinholes.\n5:03\nMore detailed instructions can be\n5:05\nfound online from the do-it-yourself pinhole camera\n5:07\ncrowd.\n5:09\nKeep in mind that you want your pinholes\n5:10\nto be small and close together.\n5:12\nAim for 1/4 to 1/2 millimeter separation\n5:15\nand a similar pinhole diameter.\n5:17\nSmaller would be better.\n5:20\nThe assembly of the system is straightforward.\n5:22\nStart by mounting the panels to the cardboard so the hole's\n5:25\nunobstructed, then mount the cardboard in the tube,\n5:28\nand finally, tape everything together.\n5:30\nOne trick that I found helpful was\n5:32\nto use aluminum foil to make the joint between the cardboard\n5:35\nand the tube light tight.\n5:36\nTo use the system, stand somewhere safe,\n5:40\nhold the open end of the tube close to one eye,\n5:42\nand look at a street light or stoplight\n5:44\nat least 10 to 20 meters away.\n5:47\nThis is a picture I took of a car\n5:48\nat a stoplight using the double pinhole\n5:50\nsystem pictured earlier.\n5:52\nNotice the strong dark bands in the stoplights and the car\n5:55\nheadlights.\n5:56\nThe pattern is even more impressive in person.\n5:59\nWarning-- do not use this system to observe\n6:02\nlaser light or the sun.\n6:03\nYou may damage your eyesight.\n6:06\nOK, so the experiment shows interference\n6:07\nand we can even build one of these widgets\n6:09\nif we want to see it for ourselves at home.\n6:12\nBut does light always behave like a wave?\n6:14\nWhat about Einstein and photons?\n6:16\nWe know that at least in some circumstances,\n6:18\nlight has to behave like a particle.\n6:20\nWell, it turns out something interesting\n6:22\nwould happen if you did this experiment one\n6:24\nphoton at a time.\n6:25\nWe don't have the equipment to do it for you,\n6:27\nbut we can show you a simulation of what you would see.\n6:30\nRight now, you are watching an animation\n6:32\nshowing what we would expect to see\n6:34\nif we could do the double slit experiment with only\n6:36\na small number of photons in a system at a time.\n6:39\nThe top half of the screen showing the photon impacts\n6:41\nat each stage, and the bottom half\n6:43\nis showing the accumulated pattern\n6:45\nthat we would get if we were exposing\n6:46\nthe photographic plate.\n6:48\nFor this animation, we are also assuming very narrow and very\n6:51\nshort slits.\n6:52\nSo the expected pattern is a cosine-squared variation\n6:55\nin the horizontal direction, and uniform\n6:57\nin the vertical direction.\n6:59\nThis animation is based on the results\n7:01\nof two historic double slit experiments--\n7:03\na 1909 experiment which used very low, but not quite single\n7:06\nphoton levels of light, and a 1973 experiment showing\n7:11\ndouble slit interference in a system launching\n7:13\nsingle electrons.\n7:15\nWhile we wait for the pattern to finish building,\n7:17\nI want to thank you for watching and encourage\n7:19\nyou to investigate further if you\n7:20\nhave found the material presented here interesting.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the last video, we had a large cloud\n0:03\nof hydrogen atoms eventually condensing\n0:06\ninto a high pressure, high mass, I guess you could say,\n0:11\nball of hydrogen atoms.\n0:13\nAnd when the pressure and the temperature\n0:16\ngot high enough-- and so this is what we saw the last video--\n0:19\nwhen the pressure and temperature got high enough,\n0:22\nwe were able to get the hydrogen protons,\n0:25\nthe hydrogen nucleuses close enough\n0:27\nto each other, or hydrogen nuclei\n0:29\nclose enough to each other, for the strong force to take over\n0:32\nand fusion to happen and release energy.\n0:35\nAnd then that real energy begins to offset\n0:40\nthe actual gravitational force.\n0:43\nSo the whole star-- what's now a star--\n0:45\ndoes not collapse on itself.\n0:47\nAnd once we're there, we're now in the main sequence of a star.\n0:50\nWhat I want to do in this video is\n0:51\nto take off from that starting point\n0:53\nand think about what happens in the star next.\n0:56\nSo in the main sequence, we have the core of the star.\n0:59\nSo this is the core-- star's core.\n1:02\nAnd you have hydrogen fusing into helium.\n1:11\nAnd it's releasing just a ton of energy.\n1:18\nAnd that energy is what keeps the core from imploding.\n1:21\nIt's kind of the outward force to offset\n1:23\nthe gravitational force that wants to implode everything,\n1:26\nthat wants to crush everything.\n1:28\nAnd so you have the core of a star, a star like the sun,\n1:31\nand that energy then heats up all of the other gas\n1:34\non the outside of the core to create that really bright\n1:38\nobject that we see as a star, or in our case, in our sun's case,\n1:43\nthe sun.\n1:44\nNow, as the hydrogen is fusing into helium,\n1:47\nyou could imagine that more and more helium\n1:49\nis forming in the core.\n1:51\nSo I'll do the helium as green.\n1:53\nSo more, more, and more helium forms in the core.\n1:57\nIt'll especially form-- the closer you get to the center,\n2:00\nthe higher the pressures will be,\n2:01\nand the faster that this fusion, this ignition, will happen.\n2:05\nIn fact, the bigger the mass of the star,\n2:07\nthe more the pressure, the faster the fusion occurs.\n2:11\nAnd so you have this helium building up inside of the core\n2:16\nas this hydrogen in the core gets fused.\n2:19\nNow what's going to happen there?\n2:20\nHelium is a more dense atom.\n2:24\nIt's packing more mass in a smaller space.\n2:27\nSo as more and more of this hydrogen\n2:29\nhere turns into helium, what you're\n2:31\ngoing to have is the core itself is going to shrink.\n2:39\nSo let me draw a smaller core here.\n2:43\nSo the core itself is going to shrink.\n2:47\nAnd now it has a lot more helium in it.\n2:54\nAnd let's just take it to the extreme point\n2:56\nwhere it's all helium, where it's depleted.\n2:58\nBut it's much denser.\n3:00\nThat same amount of mass that was in this sphere\n3:03\nis now in a denser sphere, in a helium sphere.\n3:06\nSo it's going to have just as much attraction to it,\n3:08\ngravitational attraction.\n3:10\nBut things can get even closer to it.\n3:12\nAnd we know that the closer you are to a mass,\n3:16\nthe stronger the pull of gravity.\n3:18\nSo then instead of having just the hydrogen fusion occurring\n3:25\nat the core, you're now going to have\n3:27\nhydrogen fusion in a shell around the core.\n3:33\nSo now you're going to have hydrogen fusing\n3:38\nin a shell around the core.\n3:44\nLet me just be clear.\n3:45\nThis isn't just happens all of a sudden.\n3:46\nIt is a gradual process.\n3:48\nAs we have more and more helium in the core,\n3:51\nthe core gets denser and denser and denser.\n3:54\nAnd so the pressures become even larger and larger near the core\n3:59\nbecause you're able to get closer to a more massive core\n4:04\nsince it is now more dense.\n4:05\nAnd as that pressure near the core\n4:08\nincreases even more and more, the fusion reaction\n4:10\nhappens faster and faster and faster\n4:13\nuntil you get to this point.\n4:14\nSo here, let me be clear.\n4:16\nYou have a helium core.\n4:17\nAll of the hydrogen in the core has been used up.\n4:21\nAnd then you have the hydrogen right outside\n4:23\nof the core is now under enormous pressure.\n4:25\nIt's actually under more pressure\n4:26\nthan it was when it was just a pure hydrogen core.\n4:29\nBecause it's-- there's so much mass on the outside here,\n4:36\ntrying to, I guess you could say, exerting downwards,\n4:39\nor gravitational force trying to get to that even denser helium\n4:46\ncore because everything is able to get closer in.\n4:48\nAnd so now you have fusion occurring even faster.\n4:55\nAnd it's occurring over a larger radius.\n5:00\nSo this faster fusion over a larger radius,\n5:05\nthe force is now going to expel-- the energy that's\n5:07\nreleased from this fusion is now going\n5:09\nto expel these outer layers of the star even further.\n5:14\nSo the whole time, this gradual process\n5:16\nas the hydrogen turns into helium, or fuses\n5:19\ninto helium in the core, the hydrogen right\n5:21\noutside of the core, right outside that area,\n5:24\nstarts to burn faster and faster.\n5:27\nI shouldn't say burn.\n5:28\nIt starts to fuse faster and faster\n5:30\nand over a larger and larger radius.\n5:34\nThe unintuitive thing is the fusion\n5:36\nis happening faster over a larger radius.\n5:38\nAnd the reason that is is because you have even a denser\n5:40\ncore that is causing even more gravitational pressure.\n5:44\nAnd as that's happening, the star's getting brighter.\n5:47\nAnd it's also-- the fusion reactions, since they're\n5:50\nhappening in a more intense way and over a larger radius,\n5:54\nare able to expel the material of the star even larger.\n5:59\nSo the radius of the star itself is\n6:01\ngetting bigger and bigger and bigger.\n6:04\nSo if this star looked like this-- maybe\n6:07\nlet me draw it in white-- That's not white.\n6:16\nNow what's happening to my color changer?\n6:18\nThere you go.\n6:19\nOK, this star looked like this right over here.\n6:25\nNow, this star over here, since a faster fusion reaction\n6:29\nis happening over a larger radius,\n6:30\nis going to be far larger.\n6:32\nAnd I'm not even drawing it to scale.\n6:34\nIn the case of our sun, when it gets to this point,\n6:36\nit's going to be 100 times the diameter.\n6:39\nAnd at this point, it is a red giant.\n6:44\nAnd the reason why it's redder than this one over here\n6:47\nis that even though the fusion is happening more furiously,\n6:51\nthat energy is being dissipated over a larger surface area.\n6:55\nSo the actual surface temperature of the red giant,\n7:00\nat this point, is actually going to be cooler.\n7:04\nSo it's going to emit a light at a larger wavelength, a redder\n7:10\nwavelength than this thing over here.\n7:12\nThis thing, the core, was not burning as furiously\n7:15\nas this thing over here.\n7:17\nBut that energy was being dissipated\n7:19\nover a smaller volume.\n7:21\nSo this has a higher surface temperature.\n7:28\nThis over here, the core is burning more-- sorry,\n7:31\nthe core is no longer burning.\n7:32\nThe core is now helium that's not burning.\n7:35\nIt's getting denser and denser as the helium packs in\n7:39\non itself.\n7:40\nBut the hydrogen fusion over here\n7:41\nis occurring more intensely.\n7:43\nIt's occurring in a hotter way.\n7:45\nBut the surface here is less hot because it's just\n7:49\na larger surface area.\n7:50\nSo it doesn't make-- the increased heat\n7:52\nis more than mitigated by how large the star has become.\n7:56\nNow, this is going to keep happening.\n7:58\nAnd this core is keep-- the pressures\n8:00\nkeep intensifying because more and more helium is getting\n8:03\nproduced.\n8:03\nAnd this core keeps collapsing.\n8:07\nAnd the temperature here keeps going up.\n8:13\nSo we said that the first ignition, the first fusion,\n8:15\noccurs at around 10 million Kelvin.\n8:20\nThis thing will keep heating up until it\n8:22\ngets to 100 million Kelvin.\n8:24\nAnd now I'm talking about a star that's\n8:26\nabout as massive as the sun.\n8:27\nSome stars will never even be massive enough\n8:29\nto condense the core so that its temperature reaches\n8:33\n100 million.\n8:33\nBut let's just talk about the case in which it does.\n8:36\nSo eventually, you'll get to a point--\n8:38\nso we're still sitting in the red giant phase,\n8:40\nso we're this huge star over here.\n8:45\nWe have this helium core.\n8:46\nAnd that helium core keeps getting\n8:48\ncondensed and condensed and condensed.\n8:50\nAnd then we have a shell of hydrogen\n8:53\nthat keeps fusing into helium around it.\n8:56\nSo this is our hydrogen shell.\n8:59\nHydrogen fusion is occurring in this yellow shell over here\n9:02\nthat's expelling, that's allowed--\n9:04\nthat's causing the radius of the star to get bigger and bigger,\n9:09\nto expand.\n9:11\nBut when the temperature get sufficiently hot--\n9:13\nand now I think you're going to get a sense of how\n9:15\nheavier and heavier elements form in the universe, and all\n9:18\nof the heavy elements that you see around us, including\n9:20\nthe ones that are in you, were formed\n9:22\nit this way from, initially, hydrogen--\n9:26\nwhen it gets hot enough at 100 million Kelvin, in this core,\n9:32\nbecause of such enormous pressures, then the helium\n9:36\nitself will start to fuse.\n9:38\nSo then we're going to have a core in here\n9:41\nwhere the helium itself will start to fuse.\n9:47\nAnd now we're talking about a situation.\n9:49\nYou have helium, and you had hydrogen.\n9:51\nAnd all sorts of combinations will form.\n9:53\nBut in general, the helium is mainly\n9:55\ngoing to fuse into carbon and oxygen.\n9:58\nAnd it'll form into other things.\n10:00\nAnd it becomes much more complicated.\n10:01\nBut I don't want to go into all of the details.\n10:04\nBut let me just show you a periodic table.\n10:06\nI didn't have this in the last one.\n10:07\nI had somehow lost it.\n10:09\nBut we see hydrogen here has one proton.\n10:11\nIt actually has no neutrons.\n10:13\nIt was getting fused in the main sequence\n10:15\ninto helium, two protons, two neutrons.\n10:18\nYou need four of these to get one of those.\n10:20\nBecause this actually has an atomic mass of 4\n10:23\nif we're talking about helium-4.\n10:24\nAnd then the helium, once we get to 100 million Kelvin,\n10:27\ncan start being fused.\n10:28\nIf you get roughly three of them--\n10:30\nand there's all of these other things that\n10:32\nare coming and leaving the reactions--\n10:33\nyou can get to a carbon.\n10:35\nYou get four of them, four of them\n10:37\nat least as the starting raw material.\n10:38\nYou get to an oxygen.\n10:39\nSo we're starting to fuse heavier and heavier elements.\n10:43\nSo what happens here is this helium\n10:46\nis fusing into carbon and oxygen.\n10:48\nSo you start building a carbon and oxygen core.\n10:51\nSo I'm going to leave you there.\n10:53\nI realize I'm already past my self-imposed limit of 10\n10:56\nminutes.\n10:57\nBut what I want you to think about\n10:58\nis what is likely to happen.\n10:59\nWhat is likely to happen here if this star will never\n11:02\nhave the mass to begin to fuse this carbon and oxygen?\n11:06\nIf it does have the mass, if it is a super massive star,\n11:10\nit eventually will be able to raise even\n11:12\nthis carbon and oxygen core to 600 million Kelvin\n11:16\nand begin to fuse that into even heavier elements.\n11:18\nBut let's think about what's going\n11:20\nto happen for something like the sun, where it'll never\n11:22\nhave the mass, it'll never have the pressure,\n11:24\nto start to fuse carbon and oxygen.\n11:26\nAnd that'll be the topic of the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nIn order to transfer energy to an object,\n0:04\nyou've got to exert a force on that object.\n0:06\nThe amount of energy transferred by a force\n0:09\nis called the work done by that force.\n0:12\nThe formula to find the work done\n0:14\nby a particular force on an object\n0:16\nis W equals F d cosine theta.\n0:20\nW refers to the work done by the force F. In other words,\n0:24\nW is telling you the amount of energy\n0:26\nthat the force F is giving to the object.\n0:29\nF refers to the size of the particular force doing\n0:33\nthe work.\n0:33\nd is the displacement of the object, how far it moved\n0:37\nwhile the force was exerted on it.\n0:39\nAnd the theta and cosine theta refers\n0:42\nto the angle between the force doing\n0:44\nthe work and the displacement of the object.\n0:47\nYou might be wondering what this cosine theta is doing in here.\n0:51\nThis cosine theta is in this formula\n0:53\nbecause the only part of the force that does work\n0:56\nis the component that lies along the direction\n0:59\nof the displacement.\n1:01\nThe component of the force that lies perpendicular\n1:04\nto the direction of motion doesn't actually do any work.\n1:08\nWe notice a few things about this formula.\n1:10\nThe units for work are Newton's times meters,\n1:13\nwhich we called joules.\n1:15\nJoules are the same unit that we measure energy in,\n1:18\nwhich makes sense because work is telling you\n1:20\nthe amount of joules given to or taken away\n1:23\nfrom an object or a system.\n1:25\nIf the value of the work done comes out\n1:27\nto be positive for a particular force,\n1:29\nit means that that force is trying\n1:31\nto give the object energy.\n1:33\nThe work done by a force will be positive\n1:36\nif that force or a component of that force\n1:39\npoints in the same direction as the displacement.\n1:42\nAnd if the value of the work done comes out to be negative,\n1:45\nit means that that force is trying to take away energy\n1:48\nfrom the object.\n1:49\nThe work done by a force will be negative\n1:52\nif that force or a component of that force\n1:55\npoints in the opposite direction as the displacement.\n1:57\nIf a force points in a direction that's\n1:59\nperpendicular to the displacement,\n2:02\nthe work done by that force is 0,\n2:04\nwhich means it's neither giving nor taking away energy\n2:07\nfrom that object.\n2:08\nAnother way that the work done by a force could be 0\n2:12\nis if the object doesn't move, since the displacement\n2:15\nwould be 0.\n2:16\nSo the force you exert by holding a very heavy weight\n2:19\nabove your head does not do any work on the weight\n2:22\nsince the weight is not moving.\n2:24\nSo this formula represents the definition\n2:26\nof the work done by a particular force.\n2:29\nBut what if we wanted to know the net work or total\n2:32\nwork done on an object?\n2:34\nWe could just find the individual amounts\n2:36\nof work done by each particular force and add them up.\n2:39\nBut there's actually a trick to figuring out\n2:42\nthe net work done on an object.\n2:44\nTo keep things simple, let's assume that all the forces\n2:47\nalready lie along the direction of the displacement.\n2:50\nThat way we can get rid of the cosine theta term.\n2:53\nSince we're talking about the net work done on an object,\n2:56\nI'm going to replace F with the net force on that object.\n3:00\nNow, we know that the net force is always\n3:02\nequal to the mass times the acceleration.\n3:05\nSo we replace F net with m times a.\n3:08\nSo we find that the net work is equal to the mass\n3:12\ntimes the acceleration times the displacement.\n3:15\nI want to write this equation in terms of the velocities\n3:18\nand not the acceleration times the displacement.\n3:21\nSo I'm going to ask you recall a 1-D kinematics\n3:24\nequation that looked like this.\n3:26\nThe final velocity squared equals the initial velocity\n3:29\nsquared plus 2 times the acceleration\n3:32\ntimes the displacement.\n3:34\nIn order to use this kinematic formula,\n3:36\nwe've got to assume that the acceleration is constant,\n3:39\nwhich means we're assuming that the net force on this object\n3:42\nis constant.\n3:43\nEven though it seems like we're making a lot of assumptions\n3:45\nhere, getting rid of the cosine theta\n3:47\nand assuming the forces are constant,\n3:50\nnone of those assumptions are actually\n3:51\nrequired to derive the result we're going to attain.\n3:55\nThey just make this derivation a lot simpler.\n3:57\nSo looking at this kinematic formula,\n3:59\nwe see that it also has acceleration times\n4:02\ndisplacement.\n4:03\nSo I'm just going to isolate the acceleration\n4:05\ntimes the displacement on one side of the equation\n4:09\nand I get that a times d equals v final squared\n4:13\nminus v initial squared divided by 2.\n4:16\nSince this is what a times d equals,\n4:19\nI can replace the a times d in my net work formula.\n4:22\nAnd I find that the net work is equal to the mass\n4:25\ntimes the quantity v final squared minus v\n4:28\ninitial squared divided by 2.\n4:31\nIf I multiply the terms in this expression,\n4:33\nI get that the net work is equal to 1/2 mass times\n4:37\nthe final velocity squared minus 1/2\n4:40\nmass times the initial velocity squared.\n4:43\nIn other words, the net work or total work\n4:45\nis equal to the difference between\n4:47\nthe final and initial values of 1/2 mv squared.\n4:52\nThis quantity 1/2 m times v squared\n4:55\nis what we call the kinetic energy of the object.\n4:58\nSo you'll often hear that the net work done on an object\n5:01\nis equal to the change in the kinetic energy of that object.\n5:05\nAnd this expression is often called the work energy\n5:08\nprinciple, since it relates the net work done on an object\n5:12\nto the kinetic energy gained or lost by that object.\n5:16\nIf the net work done is positive,\n5:19\nthe kinetic energy is going to increase\n5:21\nand the object's going to speed up.\n5:23\nIf the net work done on an object is negative,\n5:26\nthe kinetic energy of that object\n5:27\nis going to decrease, which means it's going to slow down.\n5:30\nAnd if the net work done on an object is 0,\n5:33\nit means the kinetic energy of that object\n5:35\nis going to stay the same, which means the object maintains\n5:38\na constant speed.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:02\n- Let's take a look at a segment of DNA\n0:04\nthat's in the process of being replicated.\n0:07\nI want to focus in particular\n0:08\non the enzyme that replicates DNA.\n0:11\nThat enzyme is DNA polymerase.\n0:16\nActually there are a few different types\n0:18\nof DNA polymerases, and the one\n0:19\nthat we're looking at right now is DNA polymerase III.\n0:23\nDNA polymerase III synthesizes new DNA,\n0:27\nand it also has the ability to proofread,\n0:30\nor kind of check the DNA it's putting together\n0:33\nand make sure there are no mistakes in it.\n0:35\nBut before we get into that, let's just orient ourselves\n0:38\nand quickly summarize the diagram\n0:39\nthat we're looking at.\n0:41\nThis enzyme over here is DNA helicase.\n0:45\nThat's the enzyme that unwinds\n0:47\nthe double-stranded DNA,\n0:48\nso that DNA polymerase can then come in\n0:50\nand started replicating.\n0:52\nRight over here you can see\n0:54\nI drew the backbone in a different color.\n0:55\nThat's the RNA primer.\n1:00\nLet's just label the DNA strand that's being synthesized,\n1:03\nit's synthesized from 5 prime to 3 prime.\n1:10\nActually, the bottom strand of DNA\n1:12\nis synthesized in the same time as the top strand,\n1:15\nbut I just left that out of the drawing\n1:17\nto keep things simple.\n1:19\nLet's say that the yellow bases represent\n1:21\nthe nitrogen base thymine.\n1:25\nLet's say that the orange bases represent cytosine.\n1:30\nThe green ones represent adenine.\n1:34\nAnd the blue ones represent guanine.\n1:38\nThymine and cytosine are the pyramidines.\n1:44\nThey are composed of a single ring structure,\n1:46\nso they're made up of one ring\n1:48\nthat has six sides to it.\n1:50\nThen adenine and guanine are the purines.\n1:54\nThey are a double-ringed structure.\n1:56\nThey're composed of one ring with six sides to it,\n2:00\nand then that ring is attached to another ring\n2:02\nthat has five sides to it.\n2:04\nActually, these structures are a little bit more complex.\n2:06\nThere are other atoms in it,\n2:08\nand there are some double bonds,\n2:09\nbut we're just going to keep things simple for now\n2:11\nand leave it at that.\n2:13\nLet's get back to our DNA that's being replicated.\n2:16\nRight over here I left a space.\n2:18\nI didn't put the nucleotide in.\n2:19\nLet's say that by accident,\n2:20\ninstead of it being paired up\n2:22\nwith the proper base, which is adenine,\n2:25\nit accidentally gets paired up with a guanine.\n2:29\nThat's a mistake.\n2:31\nDNA polymerase III actually has the ability\n2:34\nto sense if it made a mistake,\n2:37\nand if it does realize that it's going to go backwards.\n2:42\nIt's going to actually remove the incorrect base\n2:45\nand replace it with the correct base.\n2:47\nSo let's do that.\n2:48\nIt's going to remove the incorrect base\n2:52\nand replace it with the correct one.\n2:55\nOf course, remember the nitrogen base\n2:58\nis attached to the sugar backbone.\n3:00\nThis activity that I just described to you\n3:02\nis called exonuclease activity.\n3:10\nNuclease, that tells us that means the ability\n3:13\nto remove a nucleotide.\n3:16\nExo, just going to underline that.\n3:19\nExo tells us that it can remove a nucleotide,\n3:21\nbut only from the end of a DNA strand.\n3:25\nIt was able to remove the nucleotide\n3:26\nbecause it was at the end of a strand.\n3:28\nThis is in contrast to endonuclease activity.\n3:35\nAn endonuclease can actually remove\n3:38\na nucleotide from the middle of a DNA strand.\n3:40\nSo it would be able to remove a nucleotide\n3:43\nfrom right over here, for example.\n3:45\nJust keep that in mind because we're going to\n3:47\ncome across some endonucleases as well.\n3:49\nAnyway, back to our exonuclease activity.\n3:51\nIf we want to be more specific,\n3:53\nthe exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase III\n3:56\nis actually 3 prime to 5 prime\n3:59\nexonuclease activity.\n4:02\nThe reason it's called 3 prime to 5 prime\n4:05\nexonuclease is because\n4:07\nwhen DNA polymerase 3 makes that correction\n4:10\nit has to move backwards in the\n4:11\n3 prime to 5 prime direction\n4:13\nin order to do that.\n4:16\nThere's another enzyme, DNA polymerase I.\n4:21\nI'm just going to abbreviate polymerase with POL.\n4:23\nDNA polymerase I also has exonuclease activity.\n4:32\nDNA polymerase I is actually the enzyme\n4:35\nthat will remove the RNA primer\n4:37\nat the end of replication.\n4:39\nJust as a side fact, the exonuclease activity\n4:41\nof DNA polymerase I is actually\n4:43\nin the 5 prime to 3 prime direction.\n4:46\nIf you want, you can just keep that in mind.\n4:49\nDNA polymerase III and DNA polymerase I\n4:55\nare both able to repair or fix mistakes\n4:59\nthat happen during DNA replication.\n5:02\nJust to give you some perspective\n5:04\nas to how often this occurs with and without repairs,\n5:07\nnormally we'll have a mistake happening in replication\n5:11\nbetween 1 in 100,000 bases to 1 in 1 million bases.\n5:20\nThat's normally the amount of mistakes that would occur.\n5:23\nBut, with the repair mechanisms\n5:25\nof DNA polymerase III and DNA polymerase I,\n5:28\nthis is reduced to a mistake that happens\n5:31\nonce in about 100 million bases.\n5:36\nThey are very, very effective at lowering\n5:38\nthe error rate in DNA replication.\n5:43\nThe next question I want to ask is\n5:45\nwhat if this mistake over here\n5:48\nwas somehow not corrected during replication?\n5:52\nMaybe there was something wrong\n5:53\nwith one of the enzymes, something happened\n5:56\nand that mistake was actually sustained.\n6:01\nLet's take a look at that.\n6:03\nHere is a piece of DNA with our mistake\n6:06\nincorporated into it.\n6:08\nBefore we discuss if this mistake\n6:09\ncan be corrected or not,\n6:11\nlet's see what happens if this mistake is not corrected.\n6:16\nRight here we have our original DNA.\n6:23\nWe're replicating it.\n6:25\nLet's just say that this strand over here\n6:28\nis the same as that strand.\n6:30\nLet's say that the bottom strand\n6:31\nin our original DNA is the same as this strand.\n6:34\nLet's look first at the newly replicated DNA on the left.\n6:41\nWe have right over here a thymine base.\n6:44\nAssuming DNA was replicated properly,\n6:48\nit's going to have an adenine complementary to it.\n6:53\nNow let's take a look at the DNA on the right.\n6:55\nOn the bottom we had a guanine,\n6:58\nand it's going to be paired up, hopefully,\n7:00\nwith the correct base, which is a cytosine.\n7:04\nNow, let's just quickly look back at our original DNA.\n7:10\nWe were supposed to have a thymine\n7:12\nwith it's complementary adenine,\n7:15\nand actually, that's exactly what we got over here.\n7:21\nJust going to circle it.\n7:23\nSo this DNA is actually in the correct sequence.\n7:26\nBut look at the DNA over here on the right.\n7:29\nThis is not correct.\n7:30\nThis is a mutation.\n7:34\nThis is an example of how mutations can occur\n7:37\nif the DNA repair mechanisms are not working properly.\n7:41\nLet's go back to our original question.\n7:44\nCan we fix the original mistake\n7:46\nso that this mutation does not occur.\n7:49\nThe answer to that question is yes.\n7:52\nFortunately, our cells have what's called\n7:56\nthe mismatch repair mechanism.\n8:06\nThe mismatch repair mechanism is composed\n8:08\nof a number of proteins.\n8:15\nThe first thing these proteins are going to do is\n8:17\nthey're going to recognize if there's a problem.\n8:23\nThe reason that they're able to recognize the problem,\n8:25\nis that when you have a mismatch in DNA\n8:27\nit tends to distort the sugar backbone a little bit.\n8:31\nThey are going to mark the area with a cut.\n8:37\nThey are going to cut the incorrect base\n8:41\nor mark it with a cut.\n8:42\nThe next thing that's going to happen\n8:45\nis an exonuclease is going to remove\n8:52\nthe incorrect nucleotide.\n8:58\nSo we're going to remove the incorrect nucleotide.\n9:07\nThe next step is one of the DNA polymerases\n9:11\nis going to insert the correct nucleotide.\n9:17\nSo we're going to pair our thymine up with adenine.\n9:23\nThe last step is a DNA ligase is going to\n9:31\nconnect the new nucleotide\n9:33\nto the nucleotides on its sides,\n9:36\nand also to its complementary nucleotide\n9:39\non the other strand.\n9:40\nI'm actually going to just correct\n9:42\nthat distorted sugar backbone.\n9:48\nHere's our repaired DNA.\n9:52\nJust to clarify, the mismatch repair mechanism\n9:55\nthat we're talking about here\n9:56\nhappens after replication.\n9:59\nThe repairs done by DNA polymerase III\n10:01\nand DNA polymerase I that we discussed before,\n10:04\nthat happens during replication\n10:06\nor at the end of replication.\n10:08\nOne thing you might be wondering is\n10:11\nhow does the mismatch repair mechanism\n10:15\nknow to distinguish between the original parental strand\n10:19\nand the newly synthesized strand\n10:21\nthat has the mistake on it?\n10:23\nIn other words, how does it know\n10:24\nwhich base over here is correct,\n10:27\nin our case that's the thymine,\n10:28\nand which one is incorrect,\n10:30\nin our case, well, it was a guanine.\n10:35\nWe know the answer to that question in bacteria.\n10:37\nIn bacteria, the parental strand will have\n10:40\nadenines that are methylated.\n10:43\nI'm just going to draw some methyl groups\n10:45\non all the adenines.\n10:50\nThat allows the mismatch repair mechanism\n10:53\nto kind of recognize and distinguish between\n10:57\nthe original strand that has the correct base on it,\n10:59\nand the new strand that has the incorrect base on it.\n11:02\nBut we're not quite sure how\n11:04\nthe mismatch repair mechanism in eukaryotic cells\n11:07\nand in other prokaryotic cells\n11:09\nknows to distinguish between\n11:10\nthe strand that has the correct nucleotide\n11:12\nand the strand that has the incorrect nucleotide.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nThe purpose of this video is to just begin\n0:03\nto appreciate how vast and enormous the universe is.\n0:06\nAnd frankly, our brains really can't grasp it.\n0:09\nWhat we'll see in this video is that we can't even\n0:11\ngrasp things that are actually super small compared\n0:13\nto the size of the universe.\n0:14\nAnd we actually don't even know what\n0:16\nthe entire size of the universe is.\n0:17\nBut with that said, let's actually\n0:19\njust try to appreciate how small we are.\n0:21\nSo this is me right over here.\n0:24\nI am 5 foot 9 inches, depending on whether I'm wearing shoes--\n0:28\nmaybe 5 foot 10 with shoes.\n0:30\nBut for the sake of this video, let's just roughly\n0:32\napproximate around 6 feet, or around roughly--\n0:35\nI'm not to go into the details of the math-- around 2 meters.\n0:40\nNow, if I were to lie down 10 times in a row,\n0:43\nyou'd get about the length of an 18-wheeler.\n0:46\nThat's about 60 feet long.\n0:48\nSo this is times 10.\n0:49\nNow, if you were to put an 18-wheeler-- if you were\n0:53\nto make it tall, as opposed to long-- somehow stand it up--\n0:56\nand you were to do that 10 times in a row,\n0:58\nyou'll get to the height of roughly a 60-story skyscraper.\n1:03\nSo once again, if you took me and you piled me up 100 times,\n1:07\nyou'll get about a 60-story skyscraper.\n1:09\nNow, if you took that skyscraper and if you\n1:12\nwere to lie it down 10 times in a row,\n1:15\nyou'd get something of the length of the Golden Gate\n1:18\nBridge.\n1:19\nAnd once again, I'm not giving you the exact numbers.\n1:21\nIt's not always going to be exactly 10.\n1:23\nBut we're now getting to about something that's\n1:25\na little on the order of a mile long.\n1:28\nSo the Golden Gate Bridge is actually longer than a mile.\n1:30\nBut if you go within the twin spans, it's roughly about\n1:33\na mile.\n1:33\nIt's actually a little longer than that.\n1:35\nBut that gives you a sense of a mile.\n1:37\nNow, if you multiply that by 10, you\n1:40\nget to the size of a large city.\n1:43\nAnd this right here is a satellite photograph\n1:45\nof San Francisco.\n1:47\nThis is the actual Golden Gate Bridge here.\n1:49\nAnd when I copy and pasted this picture,\n1:51\nI tried to make it roughly 10 miles by 10 miles\n1:54\njust so you appreciate the scale.\n1:56\nAnd what's interesting here-- and this picture's interesting.\n1:58\nBecause this is the first time we can relate to cities.\n2:02\nBut when you look at a city on this scale,\n2:04\nit's starting to get larger than what\n2:06\nwe're used to processing on a daily basis.\n2:09\nA bridge-- we've been on a bridge.\n2:11\nWe know what a bridge looks like.\n2:12\nWe know that a bridge is huge.\n2:14\nBut it doesn't feel like something\n2:15\nthat we can't comprehend.\n2:17\nAlready, a city is something that we\n2:19\ncan't comprehend all at once.\n2:20\nWe can drive across a city.\n2:21\nWe can look at satellite imagery.\n2:23\nBut if I were to show a human on this,\n2:26\nit would be unbelievably, unbelievably small.\n2:28\nYou wouldn't actually be able to see it.\n2:30\nIt would be less than a pixel on this image.\n2:32\nA house is less than a pixel on this image.\n2:35\nBut let's keep multiplying by 10.\n2:38\nIf you multiply by 10 again, you get to something\n2:41\nroughly the size of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n2:44\nThis whole square over here is roughly that square right\n2:47\nover there.\n2:48\nLet's multiply by 10 again.\n2:52\nSo this square is about 100 miles by 100 miles.\n2:55\nSo this one would be about 1,000 miles by 1,000 miles.\n2:57\nAnd now you're including a big part of the Western United\n3:00\nStates.\n3:01\nYou have California here.\n3:03\nYou Nevada here.\n3:04\nYou have Arizona and New Mexico--\n3:06\nso a big chunk of a big continent we're\n3:08\nalready including.\n3:09\nAnd frankly, this is beyond the scale\n3:11\nthat we're used to operating.\n3:13\nWe've seen maps, so maybe we're a little used to it.\n3:15\nBut if you ever had to walk across this type of distance,\n3:18\nit would take you a while.\n3:19\nTo some degree, the fact that planes goes so fast-- almost\n3:22\nunimaginably fast for us-- that it's\n3:25\nmade it feel like things like continents aren't as big.\n3:28\nBecause you can fly across them in five or six hours.\n3:30\nBut these are already huge, huge, huge distances.\n3:33\nBut once again, you take this square\n3:35\nthat's about 1,000 miles by 1,000 miles,\n3:38\nand you multiply that by 10.\n3:40\nAnd you get pretty close-- a little bit\n3:42\nover-- the diameter of the Earth-- a little bit\n3:46\nover the diameter of the Earth.\n3:47\nBut once again, we're on the Earth.\n3:49\nWe kind of relate to the Earth.\n3:52\nIf you look carefully at the horizon,\n3:54\nyou might see a little bit of a curvature,\n3:56\nespecially if you were to get into the plane.\n3:58\nSo even though this is, frankly, larger\n4:01\nthan my brain can really grasp, we\n4:03\ncan kind of relate to the Earth.\n4:06\nNow you multiply the diameter of Earth times 10.\n4:10\nAnd you get to the diameter of Jupiter.\n4:13\nAnd so if you were to sit Earth right next to Jupiter--\n4:17\nobviously, they're nowhere near that close.\n4:19\nThat would destroy both of the planets.\n4:21\nActually, it would definitely destroy Earth.\n4:23\nIt would probably just be merged into Jupiter.\n4:26\nSo if you put Earth next to Jupiter,\n4:30\nit would look something like that right over there.\n4:34\nSo I would say that Jupiter is definitely-- on this diagram\n4:38\nthat I'm drawing here-- is definitely\n4:39\nthe first thing that I have I can't comprehend.\n4:43\nThe Earth, itself, is so vastly huge.\n4:45\nJupiter is-- it's 10 times bigger in diameter.\n4:49\nIt's much larger in terms of mass, and volume,\n4:52\nand all the rest.\n4:53\nBut just in terms of diameter, it is 10 times bigger.\n4:56\nBut let's keep going.\n4:57\n10 times Jupiter gets us to the sun.\n5:02\nThis is times 10.\n5:04\nSo if this is the Sun-- and if I were to draw Jupiter,\n5:07\nit would look something like-- I'll\n5:08\ndo Jupiter in pink-- Jupiter would be around that big.\n5:13\nAnd then the Earth would be around that big\n5:17\nif you were to put them all next to each other.\n5:19\nSo the Sun, once again, is huge.\n5:21\nEven though we see it almost every day,\n5:24\nit is unimaginably huge.\n5:26\nEven the Earth is unimaginably huge.\n5:28\nAnd the Sun is 100 times more unimaginably bigger.\n5:33\nNow we're going to start getting really, really, really wacky.\n5:36\nYou multiply the diameter of the Sun, which is already\n5:40\n100 times the diameter of the Earth-- you\n5:43\nmultiply that times 100.\n5:44\nAnd that is the distance from the Earth to the Sun.\n5:47\nSo I've drawn the Sun here as a little pixel.\n5:52\nAnd I didn't even draw the Earth as a pixel.\n5:53\nBecause a pixel would be way too large.\n5:55\nIt would have to be a hundredth of a pixel\n5:57\nin order to draw the Earth properly.\n5:59\nSo this is a unbelievable distance\n6:02\nbetween the Earth and the Sun.\n6:04\nIt's 100 times the distance of the diameter of the Sun itself.\n6:10\nSo it's massive, massive.\n6:11\nBut once again, these things are relatively close\n6:15\ncompared to where we're about to go.\n6:17\nBecause if we want to get to the nearest star-- so remember,\n6:21\nthe Sun is 100 times the diameter of the Earth.\n6:24\nThe distance between the Sun and the Earth is 100 times that.\n6:29\nOr you could say it's 10,000 times the diameter\n6:32\nof the Earth.\n6:33\nSo these are unimaginable distances.\n6:35\nBut to get to the nearest star, which is 4.2 light years away,\n6:40\nit's 200,000 times-- and once again, unimaginable.\n6:45\nIt's 200,000 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun.\n6:51\nAnd to give you a rough sense of how far apart these things are,\n6:59\nif the Sun was roughly the size of a basketball--\n7:02\nif the average star was about the size of a basketball--\n7:04\nin our part of the galaxy in a volume the size of the Earth--\n7:09\nso if you had a big volume the size of the Earth,\n7:13\nif the stars were the sizes of basketballs,\n7:16\nin our part of the galaxy, you would only\n7:18\nhave a handful of basketballs per that volume.\n7:22\nSo unbelievably sparse.\n7:26\nEven though, when you look at the galaxy--\n7:28\nand this is just an artist's depiction of it--\n7:30\nit looks like something that has the spray of stars,\n7:33\nand it looks reasonably dense, there\n7:35\nis actually a huge amount of space\n7:37\nthat the great, great, great, great, great majority\n7:40\nof the volume in the galaxy is just empty, empty space.\n7:46\nThere's no stars, no planets, no nothing.\n7:49\nI mean, this is a huge jump that I'm talking about.\n7:52\nAnd then if you really want to realize\n7:55\nhow large a galaxy, itself, can be,\n7:57\nyou take this distance between the Sun,\n8:00\nor between our solar system and the nearest star--\n8:02\nso that's 200,000 times the distance between the Earth\n8:07\nand the Sun-- and you multiply that distance by 25,000.\n8:10\nSo if the Sun is right here, our nearest star\n8:16\nwill be in that same pixel.\n8:18\nThey'll actually be within-- you'd actually\n8:20\nget a ton of stars within that one pixel,\n8:22\neven though they're so far apart.\n8:24\nAnd then this whole thing is 100,000 light years.\n8:28\nIt's 25,000 times the distance than the distance\n8:33\nbetween the Sun and the nearest star.\n8:35\nSo we're talking about unimaginable, unfathomable\n8:39\ndistances, just for a galaxy.\n8:42\nAnd now we're going to get our-- frankly,\n8:44\nmy brain is already well beyond anything\n8:48\nthat it can really process.\n8:49\nAt this point, it almost just becomes abstract thinking.\n8:52\nIt just becomes playing with numbers and mathematics.\n8:55\nBut to get a sense of the universe, itself,\n8:58\nthe observable universe-- and we have to be clear.\n9:00\nBecause we can only observe light\n9:02\nthat started leaving from its source 13.7 billion years ago.\n9:06\nBecause that's how old the universe is.\n9:08\nThe observable universe is about 93 billion light years across.\n9:13\nAnd the reason why it's larger than 13.7 billion\n9:16\nis that the points in space that emitted\n9:20\nlight 13.7 billion years ago, those\n9:22\nhave been going away from us.\n9:24\nSo now they're on the order of 40 billion light years away.\n9:27\nBut this isn't about cosmology.\n9:29\nThis is just about scale and appreciating\n9:31\nhow huge the universe is.\n9:33\nJust in the part of the universe that we can theoretically\n9:36\nobserve, you have to get-- and that we can observe,\n9:43\njust because we're getting electromagnetic radiation\n9:47\nfrom those parts of the universe--\n9:50\nyou would have to multiply this number.\n9:52\nSo let me make this clear.\n9:53\n100,000 light years-- that's the diameter of the Milky Way.\n10:01\nYou would have to multiply not by 1,000.\n10:04\n1,000 would get you to 100 million light years.\n10:10\nThis is 100,000 times 1,000 is 100 million.\n10:13\nYou have to multiply by 1,000 again\n10:18\nto get to 100 billion light years.\n10:21\nAnd the universe, for all we know,\n10:22\nmight be much, much, much, much, larger.\n10:24\nIt might even be infinite.\n10:26\nWho knows?\n10:27\nBut to get from just the diameter of the Milky Way\n10:32\nto the observable universe, you have to multiply by a million.\n10:35\nAnd already, this is an unfathomable distance.\n10:38\nSo in the whole scheme of things,\n10:42\nnot only are we pretty small, and not only are the things\n10:46\nwe build pretty small, and not only is our planet ultra small,\n10:51\nand not only is our Sun ultra small,\n10:54\nand our solar system ultra small,\n10:56\nbut our galaxy is really nothing compared\n10:59\nto the vastness of the universe.",

So these are called Schwann cells and\n4:17\nthey're covering-- they make up the myelin sheath.\n4:20\nSo this covering, this insulation, at different\n4:23\nintervals around the axon, this is\n4:24\ncalled the myelin sheath.\n4:26\nSo Schwann cells make up the myelin sheath.\n4:29\nI'll do one more just like that.\n4:40\nAnd then these little spaces between the myelin sheath--\n4:42\njust so we have all of the terminology from-- so we know\n4:46\nthe entire anatomy of the neuron-- these are called the\n4:50\nnodes of Ranvier.\n4:56\nI guess they're named after Ranvier.\n4:57\nMaybe he was the guy who looked and saw they had these\n4:59\nlittle slots here where you don't have myelin sheath.\n5:02\nSo these are the nodes of Ranvier.\n5:05\nSo the general idea, as I mentioned, is that you get a\n5:07\nsignal here.\n5:08\nWe're going to talk more about what the signal means-- and\n5:11\nthen that signal gets-- actually, the signals can be\n5:13\nsummed, so you might have one little signal right there,\n5:16\nanother signal right there, and then you'll have maybe a\n5:19\nlarger signal there and there-- and that the combined\n5:23\neffects of these signals get summed up and they travel to\n5:26\nthe hillock and if they're a large enough, they're going to\n5:30\ntrigger an action potential on the axon, which will cause a\n5:34\nsignal to travel down the balance of the axon and then\n5:38\nover here it might be connected via synapses to\n5:42\nother dendrites or muscles.\n5:44\nAnd we'll talk more about synapses and those might help\n5:46\ntrigger other things.\n5:47\nSo you're saying, what's triggering these things here?\n5:49\nWell, this could be the terminal end of other neurons'\n5:54\naxons, like in the brain.\n5:57\nThis could be some type of sensory neuron.\n5:58\nThis could be on a taste bud someplace, so a salt molecule\n6:02\nsomehow can trigger it or a sugar molecule-- or this might\n6:06\nbe some type of sensor.\n6:07\nIt could be a whole bunch of different things and we'll\n6:09\ntalk more about the different types of neurons.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's have a little bit of a primer\n0:02\non weight and mass, especially if we start talking\n0:04\nabout atomic weight and atomic mass.\n0:07\nIf we're sitting in a physics class,\n0:08\nweight and mass mean something very, very ...\n0:13\nwell, they mean different things.\n0:14\nIt might be a discovery,\n0:16\nor a new learning, for some of you,\n0:18\nbecause in everyday life,\n0:20\nwhen we say something's mass, we think,\n0:22\n\"Well, the more mass it has, the more weight it has.\"\n0:24\nOr, if we think something has more or less weight,\n0:26\nwe think, \"Okay, that relates to its mass.\"\n0:29\nBut in physics class, we see that these actually represent\n0:32\ntwo different ideas, albeit related ideas.\n0:35\nMass is a notion of how much of something there is,\n0:40\nor you could say, how hard is it to accelerate\n0:42\nor decelerate it.\n0:44\nOr you could view it as a measure of an object's inertia.\n0:47\nWe typically, it, kind of a human scale,\n0:49\nmight measure mass in terms of grams or kilograms.\n0:53\nWhat's confusing is, if you go to Europe,\n0:56\nand you ask someone their weight,\n0:58\nthey'll often give you their weight in terms of kilogram,\n1:01\neven though that is a unit of mass.\n1:04\nNow weight, on the other hand, is not ...\n1:07\nit's different than mass.\n1:09\nWeight is a force, it's how much the Earth,\n1:12\nor whatever planet you happen to be on,\n1:14\nis pulling on you.\n1:16\nThis right over here is a force.\n1:18\nAnd, in the metric system, you measure weight,\n1:21\nnot with grams or kilograms, but with Newtons.\n1:24\nNewtons.\n1:26\nReally, when you ask someone their weight in Europe,\n1:29\nthey should give it to you in Newtons.\n1:31\nIf you ask them their mass,\n1:33\nwhat they're telling you is actually their mass.\n1:35\nThey should say, \"My mass is 60 kilograms,\"\n1:38\nor, \"70 kilograms,\" or whatever they might be.\n1:40\nIt's a very important difference in physics.\n1:42\nIf I go from Earth to the Moon, my mass does not change,\n1:48\nbut my weight does change because the force\n1:51\nwith which the Moon is pulling on me,\n1:54\nor that we're pulling on each other,\n1:55\nis less than it would be on Earth.\n1:57\nIn fact, even on the surface of the Earth,\n1:58\nif you were to even go to the top of a building,\n2:01\nyou're just so ...\n2:02\nYeah, it would be very hard to measure it,\n2:04\nbut you're just slightly further\n2:05\nfrom the center of the Earth,\n2:07\nso there's a different gravitational force.\n2:09\nYour weight will change ever so slightly,\n2:11\nbut your mass does not change.\n2:13\nYou go to deep space,\n2:15\nand there's very little gravitational influence,\n2:17\nyou have pretty much, or close to, zero weight.\n2:20\nBut you're in deep space, and if there's no planets nearby,\n2:25\nbut your mass is still going to be\n2:26\nwhatever your mass happens to be.\n2:28\nThat's a primer on mass and weight.\n2:31\nNow, with that out of the way,\n2:33\nI might confuse you because,\n2:35\nas we go into a chemistry context,\n2:36\nit starts getting a little bit more muddled again.\n2:41\nLet me go to chemistry, chemistry.\n2:45\nAnd in any science, if people just talk generally\n2:48\nabout mass or weight, this is what they're talking about.\n2:50\nThey're talking about a measure of inertia for mass,\n2:53\nand they're talking about a force\n2:54\nwhen they're talking about weight.\n2:55\nBut in chemistry, we start thinking about things\n2:58\non an atomic scale.\n3:00\nYou'll hear ...\n3:02\nYou'll hear the term \"Atomic,\"\n3:04\n\"Atomic mass.\"\n3:07\nAtomic mass is, literally, a measure of mass.\n3:11\nIt is measured in atomic mass units.\n3:14\nAtomic mass units, which is,\n3:16\nand we'll talk in the future videos,\n3:18\na very, very, very, very, small fraction.\n3:22\nOne atomic mass unit is a very, very, very, very, very,\n3:26\nvery small fraction of a gram.\n3:29\nIt is actually defined\n3:31\nusing the most common isotope of carbon.\n3:37\nIt's defined using carbon-12.\n3:39\nThe current definition is carbon-12.\n3:43\nCarbon-12 has a mass,\n3:47\nhas a mass,\n3:49\nhas a mass of exactly,\n3:53\nexactly,\n3:56\nexactly 12\n3:58\natomic mass units.\n3:59\nSo they can then,\n4:01\nyou or chemists, use that as the benchmark\n4:05\nto figure out what the atomic mass,\n4:07\nor the mass of any other atom.\n4:10\nAnd you might say, \"Oh, why didn't they just do a hydrogen,\n4:12\n\"and just say that's one atomic mass unit, and all that,\"\n4:14\nand actually, they had started there.\n4:16\nThey had been there at an earlier stage,\n4:18\nbut for a whole set of reasons,\n4:20\ncarbon-12 is kind of being the benchmark,\n4:22\nas having 12 atomic mass units, is what people went with.\n4:27\nNow, what is atomic weight, then?\n4:30\nAtomic weight.\n4:31\nLet me write this in a different color.\n4:34\nI'll do it in blue.\n4:36\nAtomic weight.\n4:41\nSo if you draw the same analogy that we did up here,\n4:43\nyou might say, \"Okay, this must be a ...\n4:45\n\"This must be a force.\n4:47\n\"It should maybe, you know,\n4:49\n\"an atomic weight unit would be a small fraction of,\n4:52\n\"very small fraction of a unit.\"\n4:55\nBut it turns out in chemistry,\n4:57\nwhen we talk about atomic weight,\n4:58\nwe're still measuring in atomic mass units.\n5:01\nThis is still a mass.\n5:03\nAtomic mass units.\n5:05\nBut it's not the mass of just one atom or just one molecule.\n5:09\nIt's a weighted average across many, many ...\n5:12\nof how typically, what you would see,\n5:16\nor the makeup of what you would see on Earth.\n5:18\nWhat do I mean by that?\n5:19\nWell, on Earth, there are two ...\n5:21\nThe primary isotope of carbon is carbon-12.\n5:26\nCarbon-12, which is defined as having a mass\n5:30\nof exactly 12 atomic mass units.\n5:33\nBut there's also some carbon-14.\n5:36\nCarbon-14.\n5:39\nWhat do these numbers mean, just as a reminder?\n5:42\nWell, carbon-12 has six protons,\n5:45\nand the six protons are what make it carbon.\n5:48\nCarbon-14 is also going to have six protons.\n5:53\nBut carbon-12, carbon-12 also has six neutrons.\n5:58\nSix neutrons.\n6:01\nWhile carbon-14 has eight neutrons.\n6:05\nI know what you're already thinking.\n6:06\nYou're, like, \"Well, wait.\n6:07\n\"Why don't we say that a proton or a neutron\n6:09\n\"weighs one atomic mass unit?\n6:11\n\"Because it looks like this is 12,\n6:13\n\"and I'm guessing that this,\n6:14\n\"that this, the mass of this is going to be\n6:15\n\"pretty close to 14.\"\n6:17\nIf you're thinking that way, that's not an unreasonable way to think.\n6:20\nIn fact, when I'm kind of just working through chemistry,\n6:22\nthat is how I think about it.\n6:24\nBut they don't weigh exactly one atomic mass unit\n6:26\nby this definition.\n6:27\nRemember, the electron is ever so small,\n6:29\nit has very small mass, but it is contributing,\n6:33\nor the electrons are contributing, something to the mass.\n6:36\nSo, a proton or a neutron have very, very, very close ...\n6:40\nThey are close to one atomic mass unit.\n6:43\nLet me write this down.\n6:44\nOne proton, one proton,\n6:49\nor one neutron,\n6:51\none neutron,\n6:53\nvery close to one atomic mass unit,\n6:57\nbut not exactly.\n7:00\nBut anyway, going back to what atomic weight is,\n7:02\nright over here,\n7:03\nthe most common isotope of carbon ...\n7:05\nRemember, when we're saying \"isotopes,\"\n7:06\nwe're saying the same element,\n7:07\nwe have the same number of protons,\n7:09\nbut we have different number of neutrons.\n7:11\nThe most common isotope on Earth is carbon-12,\n7:13\nbut there's also some carbon-14.\n7:16\nIf you were to take a weighted average,\n7:18\nas found on the Earth,\n7:19\nof all the carbon-12 and all of the carbon-14,\n7:23\nthe weighted average of the atomic masses\n7:27\nis the atomic weight.\n7:29\nAnd the atomic weight of carbon ...\n7:31\nAnd you'll see this on a periodic table.\n7:32\nIn fact, I have one right over here.\n7:34\nNotice, the six protons,\n7:35\nthis is what defines it to be carbon.\n7:38\nBut then they write 12.011,\n7:40\nwhich is the weighted average of the masses\n7:42\nof all of the carbons.\n7:43\nNow, it's very close to 12,\n7:44\nas opposed to being closer to 14,\n7:46\nbecause most of the carbon on Earth is carbon-12.\n7:50\nWe could write this down.\n7:52\nThis is the atomic weight.\n7:53\nThis is the atomic weight of carbon on Earth.\n7:57\nThis is 12.011.\n8:03\nTypically, if people are telling you,\n8:06\n\"Hey, I'm talking about the isotope.\n8:09\n\"I am talking about the isotope carbon-12,\"\n8:11\nyou say, \"Okay, if you're talking about a particular atom\n8:16\n\"of carbon-12,\" you would say,\n8:18\n\"Okay, that's going to be 12 atomic mass units.\"\n8:22\nBut then if you said, \"Hey, you know,\n8:23\n\"I'm randomly ...\n8:24\n\"If I have a big bag of carbon, you could say,\n8:28\n\"on average, the weighted average of those carbon atoms,\n8:33\n\"they're going to have an atomic mass,\n8:35\n\"or a weighted average atomic mass,\"\n8:38\nwhich is atomic weight,\n8:39\n\"of 12.011 atomic mass units.\"\n8:45\nAMU.\n8:47\nHopefully, this clarified it more than it confused.\n8:50\nAll right, see you in the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.\n0:01\nWelcome to the English parts of speech.\n0:04\nWe're gonna begin with the noun,\n0:06\nthe lovely wonderful noun, your friend and mine.\n0:09\nThey're mostly what you're gonna encounter in sentences.\n0:12\nMost sentences in English contain at least one noun\n0:15\nor a pronoun, but we'll get to pronouns later.\n0:18\nA noun is basically anything.\n0:24\nAnd I know that's not an especially helpful definition,\n0:28\nbut we'll get more specific in a minute.\n0:31\nA noun is basically anything at all.\n0:34\nNow the way this is taught in traditional grammar\n0:36\nis to say that a noun is a person, place or thing,\n0:39\nwhich is fine, I think we can make that a little bit sharper\n0:44\nand expand that out by saying that they are,\n0:47\nthat nouns are people or living things,\n0:51\nplaces,\n0:55\nthings, or ideas.\n1:00\nI think ideas is the one that usually gets left out.\n1:03\nSo nouns can be people, places, things and ideas.\n1:07\nLet's put that in action.\n1:10\nSo, this is Raul.\n1:13\nHe is from Argentina.\n1:15\nHe is a penguin.\n1:17\nRaul has big dreams.\n1:19\nNow, okay.\n1:20\nSo, I wanna take these three sentences\n1:22\nand find the noun in them using the test.\n1:26\nSo the test is, is it a person\n1:30\nor a living thing, a place,\n1:33\na thing, or an idea?\n1:37\nAnd if it's any of those things,\n1:39\nthen it falls into the category of words in English\n1:42\nwhich we call nouns.\n1:44\nSo, sentence number one.\n1:45\nThis is Raul.\n1:48\nWhat is Raul?\n1:50\nWell, Raul is a person or a living thing\n1:52\nso we're just gonna say person so noun.\n1:57\nNext sentence.\n1:59\nHe is from Argentina.\n2:01\nNow Argentina happens to be a place\n2:04\nso therefore, it is also a noun.\n2:06\nIt's a kind of noun called a proper noun,\n2:08\njust like Raul is but we'll get to that later.\n2:10\nSo, Argentina is a noun.\n2:12\nArgentina incidentally is a country\n2:15\nand the word country is also a noun\n2:19\nbecause it is a thing.\n2:23\nSo, sentence the third.\n2:24\nHe is a penguin.\n2:27\nNow, a penguin is a living being or a thing\n2:30\nso we can say oh yes, penguin, that is a noun as well.\n2:35\nSo, you've noticed I'm not circling he or this.\n2:39\nThese words are pronouns, relative pronouns,\n2:42\nand they can sometimes behave like nouns,\n2:45\nbut I wouldn't call them nouns.\n2:48\nThat'll just get confusing.\n2:49\nSo, these are pronouns and we'll get to them later.\n2:53\nSentence number four.\n2:54\nRaul has big dreams.\n2:56\nSo, here we have Raul again.\n2:58\nWe know from the first sentence that it's a person's name.\n3:01\nSo, we're just gonna say this is also a noun again.\n3:04\nAnd dreams.\n3:06\nNow, dreams isn't a person, a place.\n3:08\nIt's a thing, sure.\n3:12\nThe reason I put in idea as a fourth category is\n3:14\nto get it stuff that you can't pick up.\n3:17\nLike for example, so dream, yes, dream is a noun.\n3:23\nDream is maybe a little tangible\n3:24\n'cause it's something you can imagine,\n3:27\nbut the idea of like a word like bigness.\n3:32\nOr if you prefer, you know, size.\n3:40\nThe size of Raul's plumage was astonishing.\n3:46\nLook at that gorgeous plumage.\n3:48\nIt's a little penguin mohawk.\n3:50\n(high-pitched murmurs)\n3:52\nThe size of Raul's plumage was astounding.\n3:55\nNow in that sentence, size is a noun,\n3:58\nbut it's not a physical thing,\n4:00\nit's not a person, it's not a place,\n4:02\nit's not something you can pick up.\n4:04\nIt's an idea.\n4:05\nSo, that's why I include this fourth category.\n4:08\nSo, if you're trying to figure out\n4:10\nwhether or not a word is a noun,\n4:12\njust apply this test.\n4:14\nAsk yourself, is it a person, a place,\n4:17\na thing, or an idea?\n4:21\nAnd you, my friend, will be golden.\n4:24\nYou can learn anything.\n4:25\nDavid out.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the video on black hole several people\n0:03\nasked what is actually a pretty good question, which\n0:05\nis if the mass of say a black hole is only two or three\n0:10\nsolar masses, why is the gravity so strong?\n0:13\nObviously the sun's gravity isn't so strong\n0:16\nthat it keeps light from escaping, so why would\n0:18\nsomething, or even a star that's two or three solar masses--\n0:21\nits gravity isn't so strong that it keeps light from escaping.\n0:24\nWhy would a black hole that has the same mass, why would that\n0:28\nkeep light from escaping?\n0:30\nAnd to understand that, I'll just\n0:33\ndo Newtonian classical physics right here.\n0:36\nI won't get into the whole general relativity of things.\n0:39\nAnd this really will just give us\n0:40\nthe intuition of why a smaller, denser thing of the same mass\n0:45\ncan exert a stronger gravitational pull.\n0:48\nSo let's take two examples.\n0:51\nLet's say I have some star here that has a mass m1.\n1:02\nAnd let's say that its radius, let's just call this r.\n1:10\nAnd let's say that I have some other mass right\n1:15\nat the surface of the star, somehow\n1:17\nable to survive those surface temperatures.\n1:19\nAnd this mass over here has a mass of m2.\n1:24\nThe universal law of gravitation tells us\n1:30\nthat the force between these two masses\n1:35\nis going to be equal to the gravitational constant times\n1:38\nthe product of the masses.\n1:41\nSo m1 times m2, all of that over the square of the distance r\n1:53\nsquared.\n1:53\nNow, let me be very clear.\n1:54\nYou might say, wait, this magenta mass right here\n1:57\nis touching this larger mass.\n1:59\nIsn't the distance 0?\n2:00\nAnd you have to be very careful.\n2:02\nThis is the distance between their center of masses.\n2:06\nSo the center of mass of this large mass over here\n2:08\nis r away from this mass that's on the surface.\n2:13\nNow, with that said, let's take another example.\n2:17\nLet's say that this large massive star, or whatever\n2:20\nit might be, eventually condenses\n2:22\ninto something 1,000 times smaller.\n2:26\nSo let me draw it like this.\n2:28\nAnd obviously I'm not drawing it to scale.\n2:30\nSo let's say we have another case like this.\n2:34\nAnd I'm not drawing it to scale.\n2:36\nSo this object, maybe it's the same object\n2:38\nor maybe it's a different object, that\n2:40\nhas the exact same mass as this larger object,\n2:43\nbut now it has a much smaller radius.\n2:48\nNow the radius is 1/1,000 of this radius over here.\n2:57\nSo maybe I'll just call it r/1,000.\n3:00\nSo if this had a million kilometer radius,\n3:04\nso that would make it roughly about twice the radius\n3:07\nof the sun, if this was a million kilometer radius right\n3:10\nover here, this would be 1,000 kilometer radius.\n3:14\nSo maybe we're talking about something\n3:16\nthat's approaching a neutron star.\n3:18\nBut we don't have to think about what it actually is.\n3:20\nLet's just think about the thought experiment here.\n3:22\nSo let's say I have this thing over here.\n3:23\nAnd let's say I have something on the surface of this.\n3:26\nSo let's say I have that same mass that's\n3:29\non the surface of this thing.\n3:31\nSo this is m2 right over here.\n3:34\nSo what is going to be the force between these two masses?\n3:39\nHow strong are they going to want\n3:41\nto-- What's the force pulling them together?\n3:44\nSo let's just do the universal law of gravitation again.\n3:48\nLet's just call this force one, and let's call this force two.\n3:52\nOnce again, it's going to be the gravitational constant times\n3:54\nthe product of their masses.\n3:56\nSo the big m1 times the smaller mass, m2,\n4:02\nall of that over this distance squared, this radius squared.\n4:06\nRemember, it's the distance to the center of masses.\n4:08\nThis center of mass here, we're considering m2\n4:11\nto kind of be just a point mass right over there.\n4:13\nSo what's the radius squared?\n4:15\nIt's going to be r/1,000 squared.\n4:22\nOr if we simplify this what will this be?\n4:24\nThis is the same thing.\n4:27\nAnd I'll just write it in one color,\n4:29\njust because it takes less time.\n4:31\nGravitational constant m1 m2 over r\n4:36\nsquared over 1,000 squared, or over 1 million.\n4:44\nThat's just 1,000 squared.\n4:46\nOr we can multiply the numerator and the denominator\n4:49\nby 1 million, and this is going to be equal to 1 million--\n4:55\nI'm going to write it out, 1 million.\n4:56\nLet me scroll to the right a little bit--\n4:59\ntimes the gravitational constant, times m1 m2,\n5:03\nall of that over r squared.\n5:05\nNow, what is this thing right over here?\n5:09\nThat's the same thing as this F1.\n5:11\nSo this is going to be 1 million times F1.\n5:18\nSo even though the masses involved are the same,\n5:21\nthis yellow object right here is the same mass\n5:24\nas this larger object over here.\n5:26\nIt's able to exert a million times the gravitational force\n5:31\non this point mass.\n5:32\nAnd actually vice versa.\n5:33\nThey're both being attracted.\n5:34\nThey're both exerting this on each other.\n5:37\nAnd the reality is, because this thing is smaller,\n5:40\nbecause this m1 on the right here, this one I'm coloring in,\n5:44\nbecause this one is smaller and denser,\n5:46\nthis particle is able to get closer to its center of mass.\n5:50\nNow, you might be saying, OK, well, I can buy that.\n5:53\nThis just comes straight from the universal law\n5:56\nof gravitation.\n5:56\nBut wouldn't something closer to this center of mass\n5:59\nexperience that same thing?\n6:00\nIf this was a star, wouldn't photons that are over here,\n6:06\nwouldn't this experience the same force?\n6:09\nIf this distance right here is r/1,000 wouldn't some photon\n6:16\nhere, or atom here, or molecule, or whatever it's over here,\n6:20\nwouldn't that experience the same force,\n6:22\nthis million times the force as this thing?\n6:25\nAnd you've got to remember, all of a sudden\n6:27\nwhen this thing is inside of this larger mass, what's\n6:29\nhappening?\n6:31\nThe entire mass is no longer pulling on it\n6:35\nin that direction.\n6:36\nIt's no longer pulling it in that inward direction.\n6:39\nYou now have all of this mass over here.\n6:43\nLet me think of the best way that's doing it.\n6:45\nSo you can think of it all of this mass over here\n6:48\nis pulling it in an outward direction.\n6:53\nIt's not telling.\n6:55\nWhat that mass out there is doing,\n6:56\nsince that mass itself is being pulled inward,\n7:02\nit is pushing down on this.\n7:04\nIt is exerting pressure on that point.\n7:06\nBut the actual gravitational force\n7:09\nthat that point is experiencing is actually going to be less.\n7:12\nIt's actually going to be mitigated by the fact\n7:14\nthat there's so much mass over here\n7:19\npulling in the other direction.\n7:22\nAnd so you could imagine if you were\n7:23\nin the center of a really massive object--\n7:29\nso that's a really massive object.\n7:30\nIf you were in the center, there would\n7:32\nbe no net gravitational force being pulled on you,\n7:35\nbecause you're at its center of mass.\n7:37\nThe rest of the mass is outward.\n7:40\nSo at every point it will be pulling you outward.\n7:44\nAnd so that's why if you were to enter the core of a star,\n7:47\nif you were to get a lot closer to its center of mass,\n7:49\nit's not going to be pulling on you with this type of force.\n7:52\nAnd the only way you can get these types of forces\n7:55\nis if the entire mass is contained in a very\n8:00\ndense region, in a very small region.\n8:02\nAnd that's why a black hole is able to exert\n8:05\nsuch strong gravity that not even light can escape.\n8:09\nHopefully that clarifies things a little bit.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nYou'll hear people talking about different ways of looking at GDP and in general they will talk about the expenditure view of GDP.\n0:07\nThe expenditure view of GDP vs. the income view of GDP and to realize why these get you to the same number for GDP\n0:17\nBut why you're kind of conceptually looking at 2 different things, we're gonna revisit a very very simple economy- maybe slightly more complicated than that one island economy.\n0:25\nSo in this economy, we have some households, and that's why it's slightly more complicated, because I am talking about households, not just one house on an island.\n0:34\nYou have some households and you have some firms. And for the sake of simplicity, we're going to assume that households own all the factors of production.\n0:45\nAnd they essentially rent them out to firms to produce all the goods and services. The firms, and this is another assumption, produce all the goods and services.\n0:58\nThese are two very strong assumptions and these really are not true in the real world. This just helps me draw the diagram.\n1:10\nObviously in the real world, households do not own all the factors of production.\n1:14\nMany, if not most of the factors of production the factories and the ships and whatever else are actually owned by firms in the real world\n1:22\nbut this is not that crazy an assumption because those firms, at the end of the day are owned by people, they are owned by households.\n1:28\nSo in theory, that they could have been transferred to the households and then the households just rent the factors of production to the firms.\n1:34\nAnd this is also a hugely simplifying assumption because we know that in the real world, we know that firms don't produce all the goods and services, households also produce goods and services,\n1:43\nsome of which, never get measured. The service for me taking the trash out at night, or doing the lawn, or making dinner\n1:52\nor the service of parents taking care of their children. None of that gets accounted for.\n1:57\nBut for this, just for simplicity, we're going to make these two assumptions. All the factors of production and the system. The labor, the land, the capital, and if we wanna throw it in, the entrepreneurship, it's all loaned by households\n2:14\nand all goods and services are produced by firms.\n2:17\nSo just like we saw with that first example of the island, the households do all of the expenditures, and these ends up being all of the revenue for the firms.\n2:28\nAnd then the firms spend a lot take that revenue and then spend it to rent many of these factors of production or some or all of these factors of production\n2:38\nso they hire the people, which is essentially they're renting labor, they might rent the land, they might rent the capital, so all of that ends up becoming income for the households.\n2:49\nAnd whatever else is left over, so this is expenses. So if we take this revenue, what it turns into is expenses and profit. Whatever's leftover after expenses is profit.\n3:03\nWe're assuming all the firms are also owned by all the households so the expenses plus the profit end up all going to the households and becoming income, which then becomes expenditures for the households, which then become revenue for the firms.\n3:19\nSo when people say the expenditure vs. the income view of GDP, they're saying \"look, I can measure GDP at any one of these points.\" I could measure the expenditures at a time period by households, in this very simple model which would be the same as the revenue of firms\n3:36\nin this very simple model, which is the same as expenses plus profit of the firms in this simple model, which is same as the income of the household.\n3:45\nand so, the expenditure view of GDP would be looking in this very simple model, you see, it gets very complicated very fast, especially when we start thinking about expenditures, not just coming from households, but this is simplifying,\n3:58\nhugely simplified model to show you that these are the same thing, and say \"hey, look at GDP at this point, maybe at that point\".\n4:06\nIf you wanna look at the income model, you can look at GDP at that point.\n4:11\nWhat we'll see as we go into future videos, as we break things between consumption and investment and government spending and net exports,\n4:17\nthat it isn't quite this simple to diagram out, but when we do think about that, we are thinking when we are thinking about consumption and investment and government,\n4:28\nwe are thinking about it from the expenditure point of view. There's another way of thinking about it, where you could have looked at the aggregate income in that country's point of view\n4:34\nmaking some adjustments for things like exports and imports and things like that.\n4:38\nBut hopefully at least this clarifies why these come up with the same number from what you can see in this very simple model\n4:44\nand that there are two slightly different lenses on the same thing.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:02\nVoiceover: So the job of our lungs\n0:04\non a pretty general level\n0:06\nis to take blood, that's without oxygen\n0:09\nthat our bodies have used up.\n0:10\nSo I'm going to use blue here to represent that.\n0:12\nTo take that blood and to put oxygen in it,\n0:15\nand it comes out as oxygenated,\n0:17\nwhich is red blood.\n0:19\nI mean blood without oxygen gets a little darker,\n0:22\nthat's why conventionally\n0:23\nwe think of it as blue versus red.\n0:25\nAnd from there the heart\n0:27\npumps this blood to the rest of the body.\n0:29\nSo in a nutshell, that's what the lungs do.\n0:32\nAnd to do that,\n0:33\nthey grab oxygen from the atmosphere\n0:36\nand take the carbon dioxide from the blood\n0:40\nand blow it out.\n0:41\nCo2, carbon dioxide.\n0:44\nAnd this exchange really is a full picture\n0:46\nof what you do with every breath.\n0:49\nNow in terms of how the lungs do this,\n0:51\nlet's talk about the structure first for a bit.\n0:54\nI think it looks kind of like an upside down tree,\n0:56\njust because all these branches keep getting\n0:59\nsmaller and smaller as we reached\n1:01\nthe terminal branches.\n1:03\nI mean there's 20 or 30 levels here,\n1:05\nI can't draw them all,\n1:06\nbut you get the idea, they keep branching off.\n1:08\nAnd at the end,\n1:09\nwe've reached this units called alveoli.\n1:12\nLet me write that word for you, alveoli.\n1:15\nWhich is plural for alveolus.\n1:17\nAnd what that is essentially an air sac.\n1:20\nLet's blow that up down here.\n1:22\nSo the alveolus looks kind of like a bulb,\n1:27\nis an air sac, it has very thin walls,\n1:29\nand laying along the walls,\n1:32\nalmost, almost in contact but not quite,\n1:34\nis the blood supply.\n1:36\nThis is how things get from our blood\n1:39\nto the lungs and back and forth.\n1:41\nSo I'm going to draw a blue here to begin with\n1:43\nbecause there's no oxygen to begin with.\n1:45\nAs it travels and that the air goes back and forth\n1:48\nbetween the blood supply and the alveolus,\n1:52\nit becomes red as it leaves,\n1:55\nbecause there's oxygen.\n1:56\nYou can think of it as inhale,\n1:58\noxygen goes in,\n2:00\nfrom here it goes to the blood supply.\n2:03\nIt makes you exhale,\n2:04\nthe carbon dioxide is going the opposite way.\n2:07\nWhen we exhale it can just leave the lungs.\n2:10\nAnd now the reason this exchange takes place\n2:12\nis just a simple loss of air pressure in physics.\n2:16\nSo if there's more oxygen in here,\n2:18\nrelatively more compare to the blood supply,\n2:20\nthen the oxygen wants to escape to the blood supply.\n2:23\nAnd if there's relatively more\n2:24\ncarbon dioxide in the blood,\n2:26\nthen it also wants to escape to\n2:28\nwhere there's less of it,\n2:29\nwhich is into the air sac.\n2:31\nSo conveniently this allows us to take what we want\n2:34\nand get rid of or it don't want anymore.\n2:37\nOkay, so there's your bird eye view of\n2:39\nhow the lungs work in a nutshell.\n2:41\nAnd there's a lot of problems that can arise\n2:44\nin this whole system.\n2:46\nBut I think a better way to understand it\n2:47\nis to break it down by the different players,\n2:49\nthe different areas that can go wrong.\n2:52\nSo again we think of lung problems as categories.\n2:55\nNow, the first one,\n2:57\nthe first problem I can think of\n2:58\nis oxygen not coming in.\n3:00\nAnd so on the flip side of that,\n3:02\nnumber two would be carbon dioxide not escaping.\n3:05\nAll right to keep going, let's go further into the lungs.\n3:08\nHere at the alveolus,\n3:09\nI would say number three\n3:11\nis something going on with this exchange process\n3:13\nwhere between the air sac and the blood supply,\n3:16\nsomething is not working there,\n3:18\nso that's number three, that's the exchange.\n3:21\nAnd lastly, if something is wrong with the blood supply,\n3:24\nblood cannot get to the lungs and come out,\n3:27\nthat would be number four.\n3:29\nSo I think these are the four\n3:30\nbig categories of lung diseases.\n3:33\nAnd let's go through them one by one.\n3:34\nNow problems number one and two here,\n3:37\nwe actually think of them as a pair of diseases,\n3:39\nthere's restrictive and obstructive.\n3:42\nLet's start with restrictive.\n3:45\nAnd this just describes the fact that the lungs\n3:47\nwhich are suppose to expand when you take air in\n3:50\nto make room for the air,\n3:51\nfor some reason it's not expanding properly.\n3:54\nSo this is an intake in respiration problem.\n3:57\nAnd since oxygen is the main point of taking air in,\n4:01\nin restrictive diseases we lack oxygen.\n4:04\nSo what happens is,\n4:06\nthe lungs for a variety of reasons\n4:09\nbecomes stiff and hard to blow up like a balloon\n4:12\nthat's been dipped in paper mache\n4:14\nand it can't blow up properly.\n4:16\nSo if you look at, if this is suppose to be\n4:18\nthe size of the lung when it's blown up,\n4:19\nthis smaller lung her in restrictive disease\n4:23\ngives us a lot of wasted space,\n4:25\nother space that could have had oxygen\n4:27\nbut is now not usable.\n4:29\nThat just makes the whole\n4:30\nsystem less efficient, right?\n4:32\nSo there's something wrong with the actual\n4:34\nstructure of the lungs that's making it hard to expand.\n4:37\nSo let's think of some examples.\n4:39\nSo there's fibrosis.\n4:41\nFibrosis just means,\n4:42\nlaying down too much scar tissue.\n4:44\nSo if the lungs are chronically injured\n4:47\nor sometimes there's a genetic factor to it,\n4:49\nthe tissue gets stiff.\n4:51\nJust like the scar you would have on your hand,\n4:53\nexcept you have all over your lungs.\n4:55\nSo it's not, no longer expandable.\n4:58\nThere's also things that can affect the chest wall.\n5:01\nSay if there's a muscular diseases that make it hard\n5:05\nfor the chest to expand,\n5:06\nthat also limits how big the lungs can get.\n5:09\nOr sometimes there could be things that are\n5:11\ndeposited in the actual tissue of the lungs,\n5:14\nI can think of amyloidosis,\n5:16\nwhich is these protein particles that get\n5:19\nstudded into the lungs,\n5:20\nmaking it harder to expand.\n5:22\nSo those are our examples of restrictive disease,\n5:25\noxygen cannot get in.\n5:27\nNow it's evil twin, or I guess they are both evil,\n5:30\nbut it's counterpart would be obstructive disease.\n5:34\nObstructive.\n5:37\nSo if we said before that,\n5:39\nthe restrictive is about not getting air in,\n5:42\nthen the opposite will not be getting air out.\n5:44\nIn restrictive diseases\n5:46\nwe're having trouble with expiration.\n5:49\nSo instead of letting the lungs collapse back to\n5:51\nit's normal size at the end of an exhale.\n5:54\nIt stays expanded like this.\n5:57\nLet me just draw some of the\n5:58\nbranches here just to show you.\n6:00\nThere's different reasons that\n6:01\nobstructive diseases can occur.\n6:04\nSometimes, let's say there's a mucous plug.\n6:07\nAn air can't get out\n6:08\nor sometimes these airways collapse\n6:10\nbecause the walls have loss\n6:12\nit's elastic quality structure.\n6:15\nSo the air is essentially stuck in there.\n6:17\nLet's think of all these extra air.\n6:20\nCan you imagine how difficult it would be\n6:22\nif you cannot exhale,\n6:23\nthat's very uncomfortable.\n6:25\nSo obstructive disease describes\n6:27\nlarge, over-inflated lungs.\n6:29\nAnd some examples would be\n6:31\nsomething you probably heard of as COPD,\n6:34\nwhich is actually a group of two different diseases.\n6:36\nOne is emphysema,\n6:38\nwhich have to do with the lungs losing\n6:40\ntheir elastic quality,\n6:42\nand the other one is chronic bronchitis,\n6:45\nwhich is just a lot of irritation day in and day out,\n6:48\nthat makes a lot of mucous.\n6:50\nBoth of these result in this large inflated lungs.\n6:53\nSomething more common that\n6:55\na lot of people have is asthma,\n6:57\nwhich is when the air ways spasm and they close up,\n7:01\nblocking the air from getting out.\n7:02\nSo restrictive and obstructive diseases\n7:05\ngoing have to do with a global picture of the lung.\n7:08\nNot to get into too much of the detail,\n7:10\njust think of restrictive as having trouble\n7:12\ngetting air in, oxygen in,\n7:13\nand obstructive,\n7:15\nhaving trouble getting carbon dioxide out\n7:17\nwith the exhale.\n7:18\nSo now let's zoom back in to the alveoli.\n7:21\nWhat's going on down here\n7:23\nthat could give us lung disease.\n7:25\nSo number three I said there's\n7:26\nsomething wrong with exchange.\n7:28\nSo let me just redraw this here.\n7:30\nWe have our air sac,\n7:32\nso air has finally made it here to where\n7:35\nit can make contact with the blood supply.\n7:38\nAnd one thing that will really mess up this process\n7:42\nis let's say if this air sac is filled with fluid.\n7:47\nLike that.\n7:48\nLet's fill that in to make it,\n7:49\nyeah, like that.\n7:51\nOkay, so what would happen to your oxygen,\n7:53\nso it's coming in here,\n7:54\nit wants to get to the blood\n7:55\nand uh-oh, it's stuck.\n7:56\nAs you know it's much harder for air to diffuse\n8:00\nthrough liquid than it is when it's empty space.\n8:03\nAnd then on the other hand,\n8:05\ncarbon dioxide is here trying to get out\n8:07\nand uh-oh it's stuck in the fluid too.\n8:09\nSo as you this makes\n8:11\nthe whole exchange much less efficient.\n8:14\nSo you have less oxygen going in\n8:16\nand less carbon dioxide going out.\n8:18\nSo that when, I would say that this blue,\n8:21\nlet's extend this a little further,\n8:23\ninstead of turning red where it's suppose to,\n8:25\nsince it's so inefficient,\n8:27\nit eventually becomes as kind of\n8:29\nweak red when it leaves.\n8:32\nSo you have less oxygen in your blood\n8:34\nand more to carbon dioxide\n8:35\nthan you would in a healthy lung.\n8:37\nSo what could cause this to happen with the fluid.\n8:40\nOne thing that's very common is an\n8:42\ninfection such as pneumonia.\n8:44\nSee when our lungs are not doing well,\n8:46\nthere's a lot of secretions, mucous,\n8:49\nwhich is fluid trying to flush out,\n8:51\nwash out what's there.\n8:52\nSo pneumonia, if it's bacteria or virus\n8:55\nthis fluid happens.\n8:57\nThere's also edema.\n8:58\nEdema kind of is just a general word for a\n9:01\nfluid being where it's not suppose to,\n9:03\nbeing pushed out.\n9:04\nSo, if for some reason if there's too much blood\n9:06\nin the blood supply.\n9:07\nLet's say if your heart is not working well,\n9:09\nand all this blood is backed up,\n9:11\nthen it will flow into the air sac\n9:14\nwhere it does not belong\n9:17\nand give us this picture of wet inefficient lung.\n9:20\nAnd usually the lungs works best when they are dry,\n9:23\nbecause we're talking about air exchange here.\n9:25\nI forgot to write a name for this category,\n9:27\nlet's call this ventilation.\n9:29\nWe're talking about the exchange here,\n9:32\nbut ventilation technically means\n9:34\ngetting carbon dioxide out of here.\n9:35\nBut I want to use this word to just describe\n9:38\nthe process of exchanging one gas for the other.\n9:42\nWhich is not working well here.\n9:44\nAnd talking about wet versus dry lungs here,\n9:47\nit kind of goes nicely into our fourth point.\n9:50\nSo our fourth problem,\n9:52\nlet's call it a problem with perfusion.\n9:54\nSo it's funny, it's kind of like the lungs are too dry.\n9:58\nSo perfusion is the ability\n10:01\nto get blood where it's suppose to go.\n10:03\nAgain let's draw our alveolus,\n10:07\nsingular, it's alveolus.\n10:09\nSo we have our blood supply coming in as usual\n10:12\nand uh-oh, sometimes there can be a clot.\n10:14\nSo our body can make clot and they can break off\n10:17\nand float in the blood stream when they get\n10:19\nto a place that's small enough to get stuck,\n10:21\nthey get stuck here.\n10:22\nAnd stops the blood from flowing pass this point.\n10:25\nSo for the rest of the path, there's no blood.\n10:29\nAnd the branches of blood supply,\n10:32\nthe branches of past this point are also gone.\n10:35\nSo as you can see in this scenario,\n10:38\nno matter how much oxygen we have in here,\n10:40\nwe only have,\n10:41\nwe don't have any blood supply to put it into.\n10:44\nSo not having enough perfusion is a huge problem,\n10:47\nand we call it a pulmonary embolus.\n10:50\nSo pulmonary means it's in the lungs.\n10:52\nEmbolus describes a clot that formed\n10:55\nsomewhere else and it's travelled.\n10:57\nAnd if it gets lodged in the lungs\n11:00\nand it's a pulmonary embolus,\n11:02\nnow the severity of this really has to do with\n11:04\nwhere in the blood supply get stuck.\n11:07\nSo let me just go back here,\n11:08\nup here and draw some blood vessels\n11:11\nalong these trees.\n11:13\nSo if this embolus is all the way up here\n11:16\nin a major branch and it shuts off\n11:18\nthis whole part of the lung.\n11:19\nThey have a huge problem, people can die from this.\n11:22\nNow if it's a very small branch,\n11:23\nlike down here,\n11:24\nthen it's still uncomfortable and you'll lose a portion\n11:28\nof the lungs but it's not relatively\n11:30\nnot as a big of a problem.\n11:31\nBut of course it will still compromise\n11:33\nhow well your lungs are working,\n11:35\nhow much oxygen is getting in,\n11:37\nso on and so forth.\n11:38\nSo here you have four very general categories\n11:42\nof lung disease that I think provides\n11:44\na nice structure for,\n11:45\nokay, what are the different players involved,\n11:47\nand what can go wrong to give us lung disease?",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nOver many videos now, we've been talking\n0:02\nabout how every interstellar object is moving away\n0:06\nfrom Earth.\n0:07\nAnd we've also been talking about how the further something\n0:10\nis away from Earth, the faster it's moving.\n0:13\nWhat I want to do in this video is\n0:14\nto put a little bit of numbers behind it,\n0:16\nor even better conceptualize what we've been talking about.\n0:19\nSo one way to think about it is that, if at an early stage\n0:22\nin the universe, I were to pick some points.\n0:24\nSo that's one point, another point, another point,\n0:28\nanother point.\n0:30\nLet me just pick nine points so that I have a proper grid.\n0:33\nSo this at an early stage in the universe.\n0:36\nIf we fast forward a few billion years--\n0:39\nand I'm clearly not drawing it to scale-- all of these points\n0:42\nhave all moved away from each other.\n0:45\nSo this point is over here-- actually, let me\n0:48\ndraw another column, just to make it clear.\n0:54\nSo if we fast forward a few billion years,\n0:57\nthe universe has expanded.\n0:58\nAnd so everything has moved away from everything.\n1:01\nAnd let me color code it a little bit.\n1:03\nLet me make this point magenta.\n1:05\nSo this point, the magenta point is now here.\n1:09\nThis green point has now moved away from the magenta point.\n1:13\nAnd now this blue point has now moved away\n1:17\nfrom the magenta point in that direction.\n1:20\nAnd we could keep going.\n1:21\nThis yellow point is maybe over here now.\n1:24\nI think you get the general idea.\n1:26\nAnd I'll just draw the other yellow points.\n1:29\nSo they've all moved away from each other.\n1:34\nSo there's no center here.\n1:35\nEverything is just expanding away from things next to it.\n1:39\nAnd what you can see here is not only did this thing expand away\n1:42\nfrom this, but this thing expanded away\n1:44\nfrom this even further.\n1:46\nBecause it had this expansion, plus this expansion.\n1:50\nOr another way to think about it is,\n1:55\nthe apparent velocity with which something is expanding\n1:58\nis going to be proportional to how far it is.\n2:00\nBecause every point in between is also expanding away.\n2:04\nAnd just to review a little bit of the visualization\n2:06\nof this-- one way to think of this,\n2:08\nif you think of the universe as an infinite flat sheet.\n2:11\nYou can imagine that we're just taking\n2:12\na sheet of, I don't know, some type of sheet\n2:16\nof stretchy material and just stretching it out.\n2:19\nWe're just stretching it out.\n2:21\nThat's if we kind of imagine a more infinite universe that\n2:24\njust goes off in every direction.\n2:25\nWe're just stretching that infinite sheet out.\n2:28\nSo it has no boundaries, but we're still stretching it out.\n2:30\nAnother way to visualize it-- and this what we did earlier\n2:33\non-- Is you can imagine that the universe is the three\n2:38\ndimensional surface of a four dimensional sphere.\n2:41\nOr the three dimensional surface of a hyper-sphere.\n2:44\nSo at an early stage in the universe,\n2:45\nthe sphere looked like this.\n2:50\nAnd these points here-- that magenta point\n2:53\nis right over here.\n2:54\nThe green point is right over there.\n2:57\nThen we add the blue point up here.\n3:00\nAnd then let me just draw the rest of the yellow points.\n3:03\nAnd the yellow points are here.\n3:05\nThey're all on the surface of this sphere.\n3:09\nObviously I'm only dealing with two dimensions right now\n3:12\nand it's nearly impossible, or maybe impossible,\n3:14\nto imagine a three dimensional surface of a four\n3:16\ndimensional sphere.\n3:17\nBut the analogy holds.\n3:19\nIf this is a surface the balloon,\n3:21\nor the surface of a bubble, if the bubble\n3:23\nwere to expand over a few billion years-- and once again,\n3:29\nnot drawn to scale.\n3:30\nSo now we have a bigger bubble here.\n3:33\nThis part of the surface is all going to expand.\n3:36\nSo once again, you have your magenta.\n3:38\nYou have your blue dot.\n3:41\nYou have your green dot right over here.\n3:45\nAnd then let me just draw the rest in yellow.\n3:47\nSo they will have all expanded away from each other\n3:51\non the surface of this sphere.\n3:53\nAnd just to make it clear that this is a sphere,\n3:56\nlet me draw some contour lines.\n3:58\nSo this is a contour line.\n3:59\nJust to make it clear that we are\n4:00\non the surface of an actual sphere.\n4:05\nNow with that out of the way, let's think\n4:07\nabout what is the apparent velocity with which things\n4:11\nare moving away?\n4:11\nAnd remember, we're going have to say, not only how far things\n4:14\nare moving away, but we're going to say how far they are moving\n4:17\naway from-- if the observer is us--\n4:20\ndepending on how far they already are.\n4:23\nSo what we're going to do-- we could say\n4:26\nis-- let me write this down.\n4:28\nAll objects moving away from each other.\n4:43\nAnd the apparent relative velocity\n4:56\nis proportional to distance.\n5:04\nAnd what I've just written down here--\n5:06\nand this is why I wrote it down--\n5:07\nthis is a rephrasing of, essentially, Hubble's Law.\n5:14\nAnd he came up with this by just observing\n5:16\nthat when he looks-- especially the further out he looks,\n5:18\nthe more redshifted objects are.\n5:21\nAnd not only were they moving faster and faster away\n5:23\nfrom Earth, but they seem to be moving faster and faster\n5:27\naway from each other.\n5:28\nSo this is just a restating of Hubble's Law.\n5:31\nOr another way to say it is, from any point,\n5:35\nlet's say from the earth, the velocity\n5:37\nthat something appears to be moving\n5:39\nis going to be some constant times the distance\n5:46\nthat it is away from the observer.\n5:48\nIn this case, we are the observer.\n5:50\nAnd we put this little zero-- so this H here\n5:53\nis called Hubble's Constant.\n5:59\nAnd it's a very non-constant constant.\n6:01\nBecause this constant will change depending\n6:04\non where we are in the evolution of the universe.\n6:07\nSo we put this little zero here, this little sub 0 right\n6:11\nover here, to show that this is Hubble's Constant right now.\n6:16\nAnd when we talk about distance, we're\n6:17\ntalking about the proper distance right now.\n6:25\nAnd this has to be very important\n6:26\nbecause that proper distance is constantly\n6:28\nchanging as the universe expands.\n6:30\nSo the now will actually change slightly\n6:33\nfrom the beginning of this video to the end of this video.\n6:35\nBut we could roughly say in kind of our current period of time.\n6:40\nAnd when we say proper distance, we're\n6:41\ntalking about if you actually had rulers.\n6:43\nAnd if you were to just lay them down instantaneously--\n6:46\nobviously we can't do something like that.\n6:48\nBut we can imagine doing something like that.\n6:50\nSo that's what we're talking about it.\n6:51\nSo just to give a sense of, or do a little bit of math\n6:55\nof how fast things are actually moving apart-- let\n7:04\nme actually write it someplace where\n7:05\nI have more space-- the current Hubble\n7:08\nConstant is 70.6 plus or minus 3.1.\n7:16\nSo we have observed some variation here.\n7:19\nThere is some error to our actual measurements.\n7:23\nKilometers per second per megaparsec.\n7:33\nAnd remember, a parsec is roughly 3.2, 3.3 light years.\n7:39\nSo another way to think about it is,\n7:42\nif this is where we are in the universe right now.\n7:47\nAnd if this object right over here--\n7:49\nif this distance right over here is one megaparsec, so 1 million\n7:55\nparsecs.\n7:56\nOr 3.26 million light years from Earth.\n8:03\nSo just so we have a sense, this is\n8:06\nroughly 3.26 million light years from Earth.\n8:11\nThen this object will appear to be moving away.\n8:14\nAlthough it's not moving in space,\n8:16\njust the space that it's in is stretching in such a way\n8:18\nthat it looks to be moving at, based on its redshift,\n8:25\n70.6 kilometers per second away from us.\n8:31\nSo this is a huge velocity.\n8:33\n70.6 kilometers per second.\n8:38\nSo this is a pretty fast velocity.\n8:42\nBut you have to remember, this is over one megaparsec.\n8:45\nThe Andromeda galaxy is not even a megaparsec away.\n8:49\nIt is about 2.5 million light years.\n8:51\nSo it's about 0.7 or 0.8 of a megaparsec.\n8:55\nSo if you look at a point in space\n8:56\na little bit further than the Andromeda galaxy,\n8:59\nit will look to be, right now, receding\n9:01\nat about 70.6 kilometers per second.\n9:04\nBut what if you were to go twice that distance?\n9:06\nIf you were to look at something that's almost 7 light years\n9:09\naway?\n9:10\n2 megaparsecs away?\n9:12\nSo if you were to look at this object over here,\n9:18\nhow fast would that be receding?\n9:20\nWell, if you just look at it over here,\n9:22\nit's 2 megaparsecs away.\n9:24\nSo it's going to be twice this.\n9:26\nYou're just going to multiply its distance-- 2\n9:28\nmegaparsecs times this.\n9:30\nThe megaparsecs cancel out.\n9:31\nSo 70.6 times 2 is-- it's going to look to be moving,\n9:38\nIt's not moving in space.\n9:39\nRemember, space is just stretching.\n9:42\nSo its velocity, It's apparent velocity, will be 70.6 times 2.\n9:46\nSo that's 141.2 kilometers per second.\n9:51\nAnd one question you say, well how did Hubble\n9:54\nknow-- you can observe the redshift of objects moving away\n9:58\nfrom us.\n9:58\nBut how did he know that they were moving away\n10:00\nfrom each other?\n10:01\nWell, if you were look at the redshift of this object,\n10:03\nand say, wow, that's moving away is 70.6 kilometers per second.\n10:06\nAnd then you were to look at the redshift of this\n10:08\nand say, wow, that's moving away from us\n10:10\nat 141.2 kilometers per second.\n10:13\nThen you also know that these two objects are moving away\n10:17\nfrom each other at 70.6 kilometers per second.\n10:22\nAnd we could keep doing this over different distances.\n10:24\nBut hopefully this gives you a little bit bigger sense\n10:28\nof things.\n10:29\nAnd just remember, even though I said this is a huge distance--\n10:31\na megaparsec is further than it is to the Andromeda galaxy.\n10:35\nThe Andromeda galaxy is the nearest large galaxy to us.\n10:38\nThere are some smaller galaxies that\n10:40\nare closer to us that are kind of satellite\n10:42\ngalaxies around the Milky Way.\n10:43\nBut the Andromeda is the nearest large galaxy to us.\n10:48\nAnd we also know that we're talking about hundreds\n10:51\nof billions of galaxies in just the observable universe.\n10:57\nSo very quickly, as you go near the edge\n10:59\nof the observable universe, these velocities,\n11:03\nthe apparent distance at which things move are moving away\n11:06\nfrom us, start to become pretty significant.",

mass.\n0:09\nIf you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,\n0:11\nit would just be this really, really massive thing.\n0:15\nSo you have this huge cloud.\n0:16\nWell, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually\n0:20\nattracted to each other.\n0:21\nIt's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.\n0:25\nBut it would slowly affect these atoms.\n0:27\nAnd they would slowly draw close to each other.\n0:30\nIt would slowly condense.\n0:31\nThey'd slowly move towards the center\n0:34\nof mass of all of the atoms.\n0:37\nThey'd slowly move in.\n0:39\nSo if we fast forward, this cloud's\n0:42\ngoing to get denser and denser.\n0:46\nAnd the hydrogen atoms are going to start\n0:48\nbumping into each other and rubbing up against each other\n0:51\nand interacting with each other.\n0:53\nAnd so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.\n0:56\nNow remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.\n0:58\nSo the temperature is going up.\n1:03\nAnd it'll-- they'll keep condensing.\n1:05\nThey'll just keep condensing and condensing\n1:07\nuntil something really interesting happens.\n1:09\nSo let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here\n1:12\nin the center.\n1:16\nAnd there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.\n1:19\nIt's really dense.\n1:20\nI could never draw the actual number of atoms here.\n1:22\nThis is really to give you an idea.\n1:24\nThere's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,\n1:28\nfrom everything that wants to get\n1:29\nto that center of mass of our entire cloud.\n1:32\nThe temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.\n1:38\nAnd at that point, something neat happens.\n1:40\nAnd to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,\n1:43\nlet's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.\n1:46\nA hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just\n1:48\ngoing to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.\n1:49\nSo the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.\n1:50\nIf you want to think about a hydrogen atom,\n1:52\nit also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.\n1:57\nAnd let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.\n1:59\nAnd obviously this distance isn't to scale.\n2:02\nThis distance is also not to scale.\n2:04\nAtoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms\n2:05\nare actually much, much, much, much smaller\n2:07\nthan the actual radius of an atom.\n2:10\nAnd so is the electron.\n2:11\nBut anyway, this just gives you an idea.\n2:13\nSo we know from the Coulomb forces,\n2:14\nfrom electromagnetic forces, that these two positively\n2:17\ncharged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere\n2:20\nnear each other.\n2:22\nBut we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four\n2:25\nforces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,\n2:28\nthat if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures\n2:31\nand huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close\n2:35\nenough to each other, then all of a sudden,\n2:37\nthe strong force will overtake.\n2:39\nIt's much stronger than the Coulomb force.\n2:41\nAnd then these two hydrogens will actually--\n2:43\nthese nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?\n2:48\nWell, anyway, they would actually fuse together.\n2:50\nAnd so that is what actually happens\n2:53\nonce this gets hot and dense enough.\n2:57\nYou now have enough pressure and enough temperature\n2:59\nto overcome the Coulomb force and bring\n3:02\nthese protons close enough to each other for fusion\n3:05\nto occur, for fusion ignition.\n3:12\nAnd the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.\n3:14\nIt's not ignition.\n3:15\nIt's not combustion in the traditional sense.\n3:16\nIt's not like you're burning a carbon molecule\n3:20\nin the presence of oxygen.\n3:22\nIt's not combustion.\n3:23\nIt's ignition.\n3:24\nAnd the reason why it's called ignition\n3:25\nis because when two of these protons,\n3:27\nor two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus\n3:32\nhas a slightly smaller mass.\n3:35\nAnd so in the first stage of this,\n3:36\nyou actually have two protons under enough pressure--\n3:42\nobviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--\n3:44\nwith enough pressure they get close enough.\n3:46\nAnd then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.\n3:51\nOne of these guys degrades into a neutron.\n3:56\nAnd the resulting mass of the combined protons\n3:59\nis lower than the mass of each of the original.\n4:01\nBy a little bit, but that little bit of mass\n4:04\nresults in a lot of energy-- plus energy.\n4:11\nAnd this energy is why we call it ignition.\n4:13\nAnd so what this energy does is it provides\n4:16\na little bit of outward pressure,\n4:17\nso that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.\n4:21\nSo once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.\n4:24\nAnd then that energy provides outward pressure\n4:26\nto balance what is now a star.\n4:30\nSo now we are at where we actually\n4:32\nhave the ignition at the center.\n4:35\nWe have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying\n4:39\nto get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.\n4:43\nNow, what is the hydrogen being fused into?\n4:46\nWell, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just\n4:50\nkind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens\n4:54\nin stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.\n5:00\nI have trouble spelling.\n5:01\nWhich is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.\n5:03\nThis is still hydrogen because it\n5:04\nhas one proton and one neutron now.\n5:07\nIt is not helium yet.\n5:08\nThis does not have two-- it does not have two protons.\n5:12\nBut then the deuterium keeps fusing.\n5:14\nAnd then we eventually end up with helium.\n5:19\nAnd we can even see that on the periodic table.\n5:21\nOh, I lost my periodic table.\n5:22\nWell, I'll show you the next video.\n5:23\nBut we know hydrogen in its atomic state\n5:30\nhas an atomic number of 1.\n5:32\nAnd it also has a mass of 1.\n5:34\nIt only has one nucleon in its nucleus.\n5:38\nBut it's being fused.\n5:39\nIt goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,\n5:42\nwhich is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.\n5:46\nAnd then that eventually gets fused--\n5:48\nand I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--\n5:50\ninto helium.\n5:51\nAnd by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.\n5:56\nSo it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,\n5:58\nin particular, that isotope of helium--\n6:00\nit has an atomic mass of 4.\n6:03\nAnd this process releases a ton of energy.\n6:06\nBecause the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced\n6:09\nis slightly lower than four times the atomic mass\n6:15\nof each of the constituent hydrogens.\n6:17\nSo all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it\n6:21\nneeds super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--\n6:24\nkeeps the star from collapsing.\n6:28\nAnd once a star is in this stage,\n6:31\nonce it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen\n6:35\nin its core, where the pressure and the temperature\n6:37\nis the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.\n6:41\nThis is now a main sequence star.\n6:48\nAnd that's actually where the sun is right now.\n6:50\nNow there's questions of, well, what if there just\n6:53\nwasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?\n6:56\nAnd there actually are things that\n6:57\nnever get to quite that threshold\n6:59\nto fuse all the way into helium.\n7:00\nThere are a few things that don't quite\n7:02\nmake the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.\n7:05\nSo they are generating some of their heat.\n7:06\nOr there are even smaller objects\n7:08\nthat just get to the point there's\n7:10\na huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually\n7:13\noccurring inside of the core.\n7:15\nAnd something like Jupiter would be an example.\n7:17\nAnd you could go several masses above Jupiter\n7:20\nwhere you get something like that.\n7:21\nSo you have to reach a certain threshold\n7:23\nwhere the mass, where the pressure and the temperature\n7:25\ndue to the heavy mass, get so large that you\n7:27\nstart this fusion.\n7:28\nAnd-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,\n7:31\nthe slower the fusion will occur.\n7:33\nBut if you're super massive, the fusion\n7:35\nwill occur really, really fast.\n7:37\nSo that's the general idea of just how stars get formed\n7:40\nand why they don't collapse on themselves\n7:43\nand why they are these kind of balls\n7:45\nof fusion reactions existing in the universe.\n7:48\nIn the next few videos, we'll talk\n7:50\nabout what happens once that hydrogen fuel in the core\n7:54\nstarts to run out.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn talking about the adaptive immune system, we've already\n0:04\nseen that there's a couple of actors.\n0:16\nYou have your humoral response.\n0:20\nSo this is responding to things that are floating\n0:22\naround in the fluids of the body and not necessarily\n0:24\nthings that have infiltrated your body cells and then you\n0:27\nhave your cell mediated response.\n0:35\nAnd then in the humoral response-- and we're talking\n0:38\nabout specific humoral response-- this is where the B\n0:40\ncells, the B lymphocytes are at their most active.\n0:45\nAnd essentially what they do is, you got a B cell here.\n0:48\nIt has a very specific antibody, specific to just\n0:52\nthis B cell, not B cells in general.\n0:55\nIf this happens to be the one of the billions of B cells\n0:59\nthat happens to have the matching key-- or maybe I\n1:02\nshould say the matching lock for the key that is the\n1:05\nintruding pathogen-- that pathogen will\n1:09\nbind to that B cell.\n1:11\nMaybe it's a virus, maybe it's a bacteria.\n1:14\nAnd then the B cell will get activated and we'll talk about\n1:17\nin this video that the activation\n1:19\ndoesn't always happen.\n1:20\nIn fact, it usually doesn't happen just from this, but so\n1:23\nfar we've said it gets activated, it goes into memory\n1:28\nB cells, which are essentially multiple versions of this\n1:31\noriginal B cell-- just saying, hey, let's have multiple\n1:33\nversions of this-- because it tends to recognize this virus.\n1:36\nSo in the future if we get this virus, those multiple\n1:39\nversions, those memory cells are going to be there to have\n1:42\nthis interaction.\n1:43\nThis interaction's going to be more likely to happen in the\n1:45\nfuture because I'm going to have more of this\n1:47\nvariety of B cell.\n1:48\nAnd then you have effector cells.\n1:53\nAnd these are essentially-- so both of these are B cells.\n1:56\nSo this guy, once he gets activated, he proliferates,\n2:00\nkeeps dividing and cloning himself.\n2:02\nThe memory cells just stick around waiting to be activated\n2:05\nin the future.\n2:06\nAnd I'm only drawing one of these membrane bound\n2:10\nantibodies, but there are actually 10,000 on them.\n2:13\nI mean, I could draw a bunch of these.\n2:15\nI don't have to just draw one.\n2:17\nThe memories just wade around in the future, but there's\n2:19\nmore of them now.\n2:19\nSo in the future, if we get this virus again, this\n2:23\ninteraction's going to happen faster and so they're going to\n2:26\nget activated faster.\n2:27\nAnd then the effector B cells essentially turn\n2:32\ninto antibody factories.\n2:35\nThis antibody goes in and it says, let me just produce--\n2:39\nI've been activated.\n2:39\nLet me produce many, many more versions\n2:42\nof that exact antibody.\n2:44\nSo they get spit out.\n2:46\nI drew that one little wrong.\n2:48\nSo that exact antibody, that can then be spit out to go\n2:53\ndisable or tag antigens-- and not just any antigen-- this\n2:57\nantigen right here.\n3:00\nAnd we also saw that the other thing that the B cell does is\n3:03\nit becomes an antigen presenting cell.\n3:06\nSo what it does is, as soon as it recognizes this, it's had\n3:11\nthis interaction with an antigen that just matches the\n3:14\nvariable portion of its membrane bound antibody.\n3:17\nIt endocytosizes that.\n3:19\nIt brings that into itself.\n3:22\nIt's membrane facilitated so it just kind of pulls it in,\n3:25\nchunks it up, and then presents a piece of that\n3:27\nantibody on an MHC II molecule.\n3:31\nWe saw that in the last video.\n3:33\nSo it cuts that up and presents a piece of it right\n3:36\nthere and that's why we call it an antigen presenting cell.\n3:39\nNow in this video, we're going to talk about why we even have\n3:42\nthese MHC II molecules.\n3:44\nWhat are we presenting these antigens to?\n3:47\nSo we're going to start talking about the cell\n3:48\nmediated-- and actually, even more than the cell mediated,\n3:50\nwe're going to talk about T cells.\n3:56\nAnd I said in the first video, they're called T cells because\n3:59\nthey mature in the thymus.\n4:07\nAnd there are two types of T cells and it's all very\n4:09\nconfusing because you have B cells and T cells, but then\n4:11\nthere are two types of T cells.\n4:13\nYou have helper T cells-- and most people just write T with\n4:18\na lower-case or subscript h there.\n4:21\nAnd then you have cytotoxic T cells-- or T cells that kill\n4:26\nother cells.\n4:32\nNow just so that you have a big, overarching impression of\n4:36\nwhat does what-- B cells.\n4:39\nWhen they are activated, they generate antibodies.\n4:43\nAt 30,000 feet, that's the best summary of what an\n4:46\nactivated B cell does.\n4:47\nIt actually generate antibodies.\n4:49\nThose antibodies attach to viruses and bacteria and other\n4:53\ntypes of pathogens and disables them-- either tags\n4:55\nthem so that macrophages can go and eat them up or just by\n5:02\nthrowing all of those antibodies on to the surface\n5:06\nof the pathogen in question.\n5:08\nIt might disable the pathogens or essentially bundle them\n5:11\naltogether so that it'll be easier for macrophages to pick\n5:14\nthem up, but this is only effective for things that are\n5:17\nfloating around.\n5:19\nFree floating antibodies are only effective for things that\n5:21\nare floating around.\n5:24\nCytotoxic T cells, which I'll cover in more detail in a\n5:27\nfuture video-- these actually attack cells that have been\n5:32\ninfiltrated.\n5:34\nSo this is attack, kill, infiltrated cells-- and when I\n5:42\nsay infiltrated, it could be a cell that a virus has gone\n5:45\ninto or some bacteria has penetrated it.\n5:47\nAnd when I say infiltrated, it doesn't necessarily even mean\n5:49\nsomething from the outside.\n5:50\nIt could even be a cancerous cell that shows itself to be\n5:53\nabnormal in some way and so the cytotoxic T cells will at\n5:57\nleast attempt to kill them.\n5:59\nBut what I want to focus on-- out of the three types of\n6:02\nlymphocytes-- remember, everything we've been talking\n6:06\nabout was leukocytes, white blood cells, but lymphocytes\n6:09\nare a subset of that and these three are lymphocytes.\n6:12\nAnd they're called that because they began their\n6:14\ndevelopment in the bone marrow.\n6:18\nSo this guy and this guy actually do stuff.\n6:24\nThis guy generates antibodies that attach to pathogens\n6:27\nfloating around.\n6:28\nThis guy directly attacks cells that are\n6:31\nbroken in some way.\n6:32\nThey've either been infiltrated, they're abnormal,\n6:34\nthey're cancerous-- who knows what.\n6:36\nAnd I'll do a whole video on that, but that leads us to a\n6:39\nvery obvious question.\n6:40\nWhat does this guy do?\n6:42\nWhat does the helper T cell do if he doesn't directly\n6:47\ninterface either with pathogens or produce things\n6:50\nthat interface with pathogens-- or if he himself\n6:53\ndoesn't go and directly kill cells?\n6:55\nAnd the answer is that the helper T cell's kind of the\n6:58\nalarm of the immune system.\n7:01\nAnd on some level, it's almost the most important.\n7:03\nSo we talked already in the last video about antigen\n7:08\npresenting cells-- that either when a macrophage or a\n7:11\ndendritic cell takes things in, it cuts them up and\n7:15\npresents it on its surface as these MHC II proteins or in\n7:19\ncomplex with these MHC II complexes or proteins.\n7:24\nAnd so do B cells.\n7:27\nB cells are more specific.\n7:28\nNow, once something is presented, now the helper T\n7:33\ncell can come into the picture.\n7:34\nSo this is a-- let me do a dendritic cell-- and I'm doing\n7:39\ndendritic cells actually on purpose because dendritic\n7:42\ncells are actually the best cells at\n7:45\nactivating helper T cells.\n7:46\nWe're going to talk about in a second what happens when a\n7:49\nhelper T cell gets activated.\n7:51\nSo let's say I have this dendritic cell.\n7:54\nIt's called dendritic so it looks like it has\n7:55\ndendrites on it.\n8:01\nSo I have this dendritic cell here.\n8:03\nIt's a phagocyte.\n8:06\nLet's say it's already consumed some type of bacteria\n8:10\nor virus and it's cut it up and now it's presenting kind\n8:14\nof the body parts of that virus on the MHC II complex.\n8:23\nIt's kind of its way of saying, hey, I found this\n8:25\nshady thing floating around in the body's tissues.\n8:29\nMaybe someone ought to raise an alarm.\n8:32\nMaybe this is part of some type of bigger thing going on\n8:35\nand some type of alarm bell has to be released.\n8:37\nAnd that's what the helper T cell does.\n8:40\nSo let's say this guy-- he's presented it.\n8:42\nHe says, I found this thing.\n8:43\nI killed it.\n8:43\nHere's a part of it.\n8:44\nThe helper T cell has a T cell receptor on it.\n8:49\nLet's say this is the helper T cell right here.\n8:55\nAnd it has a T cell receptor on it and the T cell receptors\n9:00\nbond to-- and I'll be very particular here.\n9:03\nSo this is the T cell receptor.\n9:07\nIt's just like a protein, but like the membrane bound\n9:11\nantibodies on B cells that every B cell or almost every B\n9:16\ncell has a different version, different variable chain,\n9:18\nthat's also true of helper T cells-- that just like the B\n9:24\ncells, this has some variation in where it binds.\n9:27\nSo this right here is going to be variable from one helper T\n9:31\ncell to another.\n9:31\nFor example, I might have another helper T cell here.\n9:35\nThat also has a T cell receptor, but the variable\n9:41\nportion on that T cell receptor is different than the\n9:47\nvariable portion on this T cell receptor.\n9:49\nSo this helper T cell will not bind to this dendritic cell or\n9:55\nthe MHC II complex of this dendritic cell.\n9:58\nOnly this one would.\n9:59\nAnd the mechanism of how you get this variation is very\n10:02\nsimilar to the mechanism in how you get the variation on\n10:05\nthe antibodies and the B cells.\n10:07\nDuring these helper T cells' development, at some point the\n10:12\ngenes that code for this part of this receptor get shuffled\n10:15\naround and they get shuffled around intentionally so that\n10:18\neach T cell has a certain specificity to a combination\n10:23\nof an MHC II complex and a certain polypeptide, a certain\n10:28\npart of a virus.\n10:29\nSo only this guy's going to be activated, not this guy.\n10:32\nSo this is why we call it the specific immune system.\n10:35\nNow we said, what does that helper T\n10:36\ncell do at that point?\n10:40\nHe said, hey, I happen to be the one helper T cell that can\n10:44\nbond to this guy, this antigen that's presented.\n10:46\nIt becomes activated.\n10:49\nAnd I won't go into the details, but in general,\n10:51\ndendritic cells are the best ones at activating it,\n10:54\nespecially a naive T cell.\n11:02\nIn general, when we talk about a naive B cell or a naive\n11:05\nhelper T cell, these are cells that are non-memory,\n11:08\nnon-effector, that have never been touched by-- they've\n11:11\nnever been activated, in the case of a B cell.\n11:14\nThey've never been activated by something binding to their\n11:18\nmembrane bound antibody-- or a naive helper T cell is a\n11:23\nnon-effector, non-memory helper T cell that's never had\n11:26\nanything bound to it.\n11:28\nSo if this guy is naive and then he finally has a reaction\n11:33\nwith this antigen presenting cell, he becomes non-naive.\n11:37\nHe becomes activated and when activated, two things happen.\n11:41\nWell, just like with B cells, he proliferates many, many,\n11:44\nmany copies of himself and some subset of those copies\n11:48\ndifferentiate into effector cells.\n11:54\nAnd effector just means it does something.\n11:56\nIt does something now instead of saving the memory.\n12:01\nAnd then some subset of them become memory helper T cells\n12:08\nafter getting activated.\n12:12\nNow the memory T cells, just like memory B cells-- now you\n12:15\nhave more copies of this.\n12:16\nSo in 10 years in the future, if something like this\n12:17\nhappens, this interaction's going to be\n12:19\nmore likely to happen.\n12:20\nThese guys have the same T cell receptor as their parent.\n12:33\nIt's just that the memory T cells-- or actually even the\n12:36\nmemory B cells-- they last longer.\n12:38\nThey don't kill themselves.\n12:39\nThey'll last for years so that if 10 years later, something\n12:42\nlike this starts presenting itself, you're going to have\n12:44\nmore of these guys around to bump into this guy so that you\n12:47\ncan raise the alarm bells.\n12:49\nThis guy's also going to have the same chain right there.\n12:56\nSo you're saying, fine.\n12:57\nI have these memory cells.\n12:58\nThey're going to stick around so that this reaction can\n13:00\nhappen in the future, but I still haven't answered the\n13:02\nquestion, what does the effector T cell do?\n13:05\nWhat the effector T cell does is it raises the alarm.\n13:16\nSo there's an effector T cell.\n13:18\nIt has been activated.\n13:22\nRemember, this is very particular.\n13:23\nOnly this version of T cells, but once it got activated, it\n13:27\nproduced many copies of itself because it says, hey, I'm\n13:29\nresponding to a particular type of pathogen.\n13:32\nSo that this is a helper T cell.\n13:34\nThis is an effector.\n13:37\nAnd what these do is they start releasing these\n13:39\nmolecules called cytokines.\n13:42\nSo they start releasing cytokines.\n13:50\nThere are many, many different types of cytokines and I'm not\n13:52\ngoing to go into detail on all that, but what cytokines do is\n13:56\nthat they really raise the alarm.\n13:58\nSo if you have other activated lymphatic cells or other\n14:03\nactivated immunological cells-- when the cytokines\n14:07\nenter those cells-- remember, cytokines\n14:08\nare really just proteins.\n14:10\nWhen the cytokines enter-- or polypeptides-- when they enter\n14:14\nthose cells, it makes them get in gear.\n14:17\nIt makes them multiply more often or it makes them get\n14:21\nmore active in their immune response.\n14:24\nSo what this does-- these cytokines you can view as\n14:26\nchemical alarm bells chemical or peptide alarm bells alarm\n14:34\nbells it it tells everyone to get in gear.\n14:38\nSo that's one role, and so you can see this is actually a\n14:40\nvery central role and it'll tell both activated cytotoxic\n14:45\nT cells to get in gear, which we haven't talked about yet.\n14:47\nAnd it'll also tell B cells to keep proliferating.\n14:50\nSo when an activated B cell gets some of-- so this is an\n14:53\nactivated B cell.\n14:55\nWhen it gets some of these cytokines, that maybe come\n14:58\nfrom a local helper T cell, it'll tell it, hey no, divide\n15:01\nmore often.\n15:02\nDivide more often.\n15:03\nOnly if you've been activated already.\n15:04\nAnd we'll talk more about why it has to be that case,\n15:07\nbecause you don't want all the B cells to be activated.\n15:10\nAnd the other thing that the effector T cell does-- in the\n15:13\nB cell discussion, I said, OK, if I have a B cell, and it has\n15:21\nits membrane bound antibody, has its\n15:24\nmembrane bound antibody.\n15:25\nAnd remember, this is a particular version, it has its\n15:29\nparticular variable chain right here.\n15:31\nAnd this guy binds to a pathogen.\n15:34\nSo this binds to a pathogen.\n15:36\nMaybe it's a virus right there.\n15:38\nUp to now, I've been saying that this guy's activated.\n15:41\nAnd he's going to-- well, when he binds to the pathogen he'll\n15:44\ntake this in and he'll take part of the pathogen and cut\n15:49\nit up and place it on an MHC II molecule.\n15:55\nAnd we said, then he'll be activated.\n15:57\nHe'll proliferate and he'll differentiate into memory and\n16:00\neffector B cells-- but that's not quite true.\n16:02\nThis first stage happens.\n16:04\nThis guy bonds.\n16:05\nThis B cell happened to be specific to this virus.\n16:08\nCuts up the virus.\n16:10\nPuts parts of the virus on its surface and presents parts of\n16:13\nthe antigen.\n16:14\nBut in most cases, this B cell isn't yet activated.\n16:19\nYou can kind of view it as in its resting state, ready to be\n16:22\nactivated, but it hasn't started proliferating and\n16:24\ndifferentiating into effector and memory molecules yet.\n16:27\nAnd in order for that to happen, an activated helper T\n16:36\ncell that is also specific to this very same virus-- so you\n16:40\ncould imagine someplace else in the cell-- this virus was\n16:45\neaten by a dendritic cell.\n16:52\nSo this exact same virus, this exact same species of virus,\n16:55\nis eaten by that dendritic cell and so the dendritic cell\n16:59\neats it up, it cuts it up, and then it presents it-- it's\n17:05\nantigen presenting so it presents it just like that.\n17:10\nThen this will activate a very specific T\n17:12\ncell, maybe that one.\n17:14\nSo a very specific T cell will come and bump into it.\n17:20\nNot just any T cell, the one with the\n17:23\nright variable portion.\n17:24\nSo think about what's happening.\n17:25\nThe variable portion for this T cell, it connects to this\n17:33\npart of the virus plus the MHC II, but it's really reacting\n17:38\nto the same virus.\n17:39\nIt might be a different part.\n17:40\nThis little part that was cut off might be someplace inside\n17:43\nthe virus while the epitope for the B cell might be some\n17:47\nplace on the outside of the virus, but they're both\n17:50\nspecific to the same virus.\n17:53\nNow once this guy gets activated and he starts\n17:56\nproducing memory and effector cells-- or they're descended\n17:59\nfrom him, one of those effector cells specific to\n18:02\nthis virus are needed to come bind to this guy.\n18:06\nSo then this guy could then go along and bump around and\n18:09\neventually end up here.\n18:11\nAnd he is also specific to this virus.\n18:14\nSo this binding site right here is the same as this\n18:16\nbinding site.\n18:17\nThis combination of antigen plus MHC II.\n18:21\nAnd so when this guy binds-- and remember, this binding\n18:29\nsite is the same as this and it only binds to this\n18:31\ncombination right here-- this is what activates the B cell\n18:36\nin most cases.\n18:37\nThis is T-dependent activation, which\n18:41\nis usually the case.\n18:42\nSometimes all you need is this first thing, but in general\n18:45\nyou need the first thing and then you also need a T cell to\n18:48\ncome and activate it, and only then will the B cell get\n18:52\nactivated and start proliferating and dividing and\n18:55\ndifferentiating itself and producing-- when its effector\n18:58\ncells will produce a lot of antibodies.\n19:00\nAnd so there's a natural question.\n19:01\nWhy do biological systems-- or why do we\n19:04\nhave this double system?\n19:05\nAnd at least my sense of it is, it's a failsafe mechanism.\n19:10\nIf every time a virus came and attached this, this guy just\n19:13\nstarted going crazy and producing antibodies against\n19:15\nthis thing, there's some chance that maybe after\n19:20\ndevelopment, this chain right here or his genes for\n19:26\ngenerating these chains become specific, not for foreign\n19:30\npathogens, but maybe they become specific for self\n19:35\nmolecules, molecules that are naturally\n19:37\nproduced within the body.\n19:38\nIt's just a random mutation, but if he started going crazy\n19:40\nfor that, his antibodies will start attacking molecules that\n19:45\nare naturally in the body and then that could really hurt.\n19:47\nThat what causes autoimmune diseases, where your own\n19:51\nimmune cells start activating yourself.\n19:53\nBut if you have this double handshake system where this\n19:55\nhas to happen and this has to happen, the likelihood of both\n19:59\nof these guys after they leave their development stage\n20:03\nbecoming specific to a self protein or a self cell or a\n20:09\nself molecule is very unlikely.\n20:12\nSo it kind of inhibits this guy from going wild, even if\n20:15\nhe has some type of a mutation.\n20:17\nAnyway, hopefully that explains a little bit of what\n20:19\nhelper T cells do.\n20:20\nWe'll talk a lot more about it.\n20:22\nI know it can be a little bit confusing.\n20:23\nIn the next video, we'll talk about cytotoxic T cells.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn this video, I want to cover several topics\n0:02\nthat are all related.\n0:03\nAnd on some level, they're really simple, but on a whole\n0:05\nother level, they tend to confuse people a lot.\n0:07\nSo hopefully we can make some headway.\n0:10\nSo a good place to start-- let's just imagine that I have\n0:12\nsome type of container here.\n0:15\nLet's say that's my container and inside of that container,\n0:18\nI have a bunch of water molecules.\n0:21\nIt's just got a bunch of water molecules.\n0:24\nThey're all rubbing against each other.\n0:25\nIt's in its liquid form, this is liquid water.\n0:27\nand inside of the water molecules, I\n0:30\nhave some sugar molecules.\n0:33\nMaybe I'll do sugar in this pink color.\n0:35\nSo I have a bunch of sugar molecules right here.\n0:40\nI have many, many more water molecules though.\n0:43\nI want to make that clear.\n0:49\nNow in this type of situation, we call the thing that there's\n0:55\nmore of, the solvent.\n1:00\nSo in this case, there's more water molecules and you can\n1:03\nliterally just view more as the number of molecules.\n1:07\nI'm not going to go into a whole discussion of moles and\n1:10\nall of that because you may or may not have been exposed to\n1:13\nthat yet, but just imagine whatever there's more of,\n1:15\nthat's what we're going to call the solvent.\n1:17\nSo in this case, water is the solvent.\n1:24\nAnd whatever there is less of-- in this case, that is the\n1:30\nsugar-- that is considered the solute.\n1:36\nIt doesn't have to be sugar.\n1:37\nIt can be any molecule that there's less of, in the water,\n1:40\nin this case.\n1:45\nAnd we say that the sugar has been dissolved into the water.\n2:03\nAnd this whole thing right here, the combination of the\n2:06\nwater and the sugar molecules, we call a solution.\n2:10\nWe call this whole thing a solution.\n2:14\nAnd a solution has the solvent and the solute.\n2:16\nThe solvent is water.\n2:18\nThat's the thing doing the dissolving and the thing that\n2:21\nis dissolved is the sugar.\n2:23\nThat's the solute.\n2:24\nNow all of this may or may not be review for you, but I'm\n2:27\ndoing it for a reason-- because I want to talk about\n2:32\nthe idea of a diffusion.\n2:39\nAnd the idea is actually pretty straightforward.\n2:43\nIf I have, let's say, the same container.\n2:46\nLet me do it in a slightly different container here, just\n2:49\nto talk about diffusion.\n2:50\nWe'll go back to water and sugar--\n2:52\nespecially back to water.\n2:54\nLet's say we have a container here and let's say it just has\n2:58\na bunch of-- let's say it just has some air particles in it.\n3:00\nIt could be anything-- oxygen or carbon dioxide.\n3:03\nSo let me just draw a couple of air molecules here.\n3:07\nSo let's say that that is a gaseous-- just for the sake of\n3:11\nargument-- gaseous oxygen.\n3:12\nSo each of this is an O2-- each of those, right?\n3:14\nAnd let's say that this is the current configuration, that\n3:16\nall of this is a vacuum here and that there's some\n3:19\ntemperatures.\n3:20\nSo these water molecules, they have some\n3:22\ntype of kinetic energy.\n3:25\nThey're moving in some type of random directions right there.\n3:29\nSo my question is, what is going to happen in this type\n3:34\nof container?\n3:35\nWell, any of these guys are going to be randomly bumping\n3:38\ninto each other.\n3:39\nThey're more likely to bump into things in this down-left\n3:43\ndirection than they are in the up-right direction.\n3:45\nSo if this guy was happening to go in this down-left\n3:47\ndirection, he's going to bump into something and then\n3:50\nricochet into the up-right direction.\n3:52\nBut in the up-right direction, there's\n3:53\nnothing to bounce into.\n3:55\nSo in general, everything is moving in random directions,\n3:57\nbut you're more likely to be able to move in\n4:00\nthe rightward direction.\n4:01\nWhen you go to the left, you're more likely to bump\n4:02\ninto something.\n4:04\nSo it's almost common sense.\n4:06\nOver time, if you just let this system come to some type\n4:09\nof equilibrium-- I'm not going to go into detail\n4:11\non what that means.\n4:12\nYou can watch the thermodynamics videos if you'd\n4:14\nlike to see that.\n4:15\nYou'll eventually see the container will look\n4:18\nsomething like this.\n4:19\nI can't guarantee it.\n4:20\nThere's some probability it would actually stay like this,\n4:22\nbut very likely that those five particles are going to\n4:25\nget relatively spread out.\n4:27\nThis is diffusion and so it's really just the spreading of\n4:32\nparticles or molecules from high concentration to low\n4:36\nconcentration areas, right?\n4:39\nIn this case, the molecules are going to spread in that\n4:41\ndirection from a high concentration to a low\n4:43\nconcentration area.\n4:45\nNow you're saying, Sal, what is concentration?\n4:47\nAnd there's many ways to measure concentration and you\n4:51\ncan go into molarity and molality and all of that.\n4:54\nBut the very simple idea is, how much of that particle do\n4:57\nyou have per unit space?\n4:59\nSo here, you have a lot of those particles per unit space\n5:02\nand here you have very few of those\n5:04\nparticles per unit space.\n5:05\nSo this is a high concentration and that's a low\n5:09\nconcentration.\n5:09\nSo you could imagine other experiments like this.\n5:12\nYou could imagine a solution like-- let's do\n5:17\nsomething like this.\n5:21\nLet's say I have two containers.\n5:25\nLet's go back to the solution situation.\n5:27\nThis was a gas, but I started off with that example so let's\n5:29\nstay with that example.\n5:31\nSo let's say that I have a door right there that's larger\n5:35\nthan either the water or the sugar molecules.\n5:38\nOn either side, I have a bunch of water molecules.\n5:52\nSo I have a lot of water molecules.\n5:53\nSo if I just had water molecules here-- they're all\n5:55\nbouncing around in random directions-- and so the odds\n5:58\nof a water molecule going this way, equivalent to odds of a\n6:01\nwater molecule going that way, assuming that both sides have\n6:04\nthe same level of water molecule, otherwise the\n6:06\npressures would be different.\n6:07\nBut let's say that the top of this is the same\n6:10\nas the top of this.\n6:11\nSo there's no more pressure going in one\n6:12\ndirection or another.\n6:13\nSo if for whatever reason, a bunch more water molecules\n6:17\nwere going in the rightward direction, then all of a\n6:18\nsudden this would fill up with more water and we know that\n6:20\nthat isn't likely to occur.\n6:22\nSo this is just two containers of water.\n6:28\nNow let's put some solute in it.\n6:30\nLet's dissolve some solute in it and let's say we do all the\n6:33\ndissolving on the left-hand side.\n6:35\nSo we put some sugar molecules on the left-hand side.\n6:40\nAnd these are small enough to fit through this little pipe.\n6:42\nThat's one assumption that I'm making.\n6:44\nSo what's going to happen?\n6:45\nAll of these things have some type of kinetic energy.\n6:47\nThey're all bouncing around.\n6:52\nWell, over time, the water's going back and forth.\n6:56\nThis water molecule might go that way.\n6:57\nThat water molecule might go that way, but they net each\n7:00\nother out, but over time one of these big sugar molecules\n7:03\nwill be going in just the right direction to go\n7:06\nthrough-- maybe this guy's, instead of going that\n7:08\ndirection, he starts off going in that direction.\n7:10\nHe goes just through this tunnel connecting the two\n7:15\ncontainers and he'll end up there, right?\n7:18\nAnd this guy will still be bouncing around.\n7:20\nThere's some probability he goes back, but there's still\n7:23\nmore sugar particles here than there.\n7:25\nSo there's still more probability that one of these\n7:31\nguys will go to that side than one of these guys\n7:33\nwill go to that side.\n7:34\nSo you can imagine if you're doing this with gazillions of\n7:36\nparticles-- I'm only doing it with four-- over time, the\n7:40\nparticles will have spread out so that their concentrations\n7:43\nare roughly equal.\n7:44\nSo that maybe you'll have two here over time.\n7:46\nBut when you're only dealing with three or four or five\n7:49\nparticles, there's some probability it doesn't happen,\n7:51\nbut when you're doing it with a gazillion and they're super\n7:53\nsmall, it's a very, very, very high likelihood.\n7:56\nBut anyway, this whole process-- we went from a\n7:59\ncontainer of high concentration to a container\n8:02\nof low concentration and the particles would have spread\n8:06\nfrom the low concentration container to the high\n8:08\nconcentration container.\n8:09\nSo they diffused.\n8:11\nThis is diffusion.\n8:16\nAnd just so that we learn some other words that tend to be\n8:18\nused with the idea of diffusion-- when we started\n8:21\noff, this had a higher concentration.\n8:24\nThe left-hand side container had higher concentration.\n8:33\nIt's all relative, right?\n8:34\nIt's higher than this guy.\n8:37\nAnd this right here had a lower concentration.\n8:42\nAnd there are words for these things.\n8:44\nThis solution with a high concentration is called a\n8:47\nhypertonic solution.\n8:50\nLet me write that in yellow.\n8:58\nHyper, in general, meaning having a lot of something,\n9:01\nhaving too much of something.\n9:02\nAnd this lower concentration is hypotonic.\n9:13\nYou might have heard maybe one of your relatives, if they\n9:16\nhaven't had a meal in awhile say, I'm hypoglycemic.\n9:20\nThat means that they have not-- they're feeling\n9:22\nlightheaded.\n9:22\nThere's not enough sugar in their bloodstream and they\n9:24\nwant to pass out so they want a meal.\n9:26\nIf you just had a candy bar, maybe you're hyperglycemic--\n9:29\nor maybe you're just hyper in general.\n9:32\nSo these are just good prefixes to know, but\n9:35\nhypertonic-- you have a lot of the solute.\n9:38\nYou have a high concentration.\n9:40\nAnd then in hypotonic, not too much of the solute so you have\n9:44\na low concentration.\n9:46\nThese are good words to know.\n9:47\nSo in general, diffusion-- if there's no barriers to the\n9:51\ndiffusion like we had here, you will have the solute go\n9:54\nfrom a high concentration or hypertonic solution if they\n9:58\ncan travel to a hypotonic solution, to a hypo, where the\n10:03\nconcentration is lower.\n10:05\nNow let's do an interesting experiment here.\n10:08\nWe've talked about diffusion and so far we've been talking\n10:10\nabout the diffusion of the solute, right?\n10:14\nAnd in general-- and this is not always the case-- if you\n10:17\nwant to be as general as possible, the solute is\n10:19\nwhatever you have less of, the solvent is whatever\n10:22\nyou have more of.\n10:23\nAnd the most common solvent tends to be water, but it\n10:26\ndoesn't have to be water.\n10:27\nIt could be some type of alcohol.\n10:28\nIt could be mercury.\n10:31\nIt could be a whole set of molecules, but water in most\n10:34\nbiological or chemical systems tends to be the\n10:38\nmost typical solvent.\n10:39\nIt's what other things are dissolved into.\n10:41\nBut what happens if we have a tunnel where the solute is too\n10:46\nbig to travel, but water is small enough to travel?\n10:51\nLet's think about that situation.\n10:55\nIn order to think about it, I'm going to do something\n10:57\ninteresting.\n10:58\nLet's say we have a container here.\n11:02\nActually, I won't even draw a container.\n11:03\nLet's just say we have an outside environment that has a\n11:07\nbunch of water.\n11:09\nThis is the outside environment and then you have\n11:12\nsome type of membrane.\n11:19\nWater can go in and out of this membrane.\n11:22\nSo it's semi-permeable.\n11:23\nWell, it's permeable to water, but the solute cannot go\n11:26\nthrough the membrane.\n11:27\nSo let's say that the solute is sugar.\n11:28\nSo we have water on the outside and\n11:33\nalso inside the membrane.\n11:36\nSo these are little small water molecules.\n11:39\nThis is a membrane right here.\n11:43\nAnd let's say that we have some sugar molecules again--\n11:46\nI'm just picking on sugar.\n11:47\nIt could have been anything.\n11:48\nSo we have some sugar molecules here that are just a\n11:51\nlittle bit bigger-- or they could be a lot bigger.\n11:55\nActually, they're a lot bigger than water molecules.\n11:57\nYou have a bunch of-- and I only draw four, but you have a\n11:59\ngazillion of them, right?\n12:01\nYou have that much more water molecules.\n12:03\nI'm just trying to show you have more water molecules than\n12:05\nsugar molecules.\n12:06\nAnd this membrane is semi-permeable.\n12:13\nPermeable means it allows things to pass.\n12:15\nSemi-permeables means it's not completely permeable.\n12:18\nSo semi-permeable-- in this context, I'm saying I allow\n12:20\nwater to pass through the membrane.\n12:22\nSo water can pass, but sugar cannot.\n12:28\nSugar is too large.\n12:35\nSo if we were to zoom in on the actual membrane itself--\n12:39\nmaybe the membrane looks like this.\n12:40\nI'm going to zoom in on this membrane.\n12:44\nSo it has little holes in the membrane, just like that.\n12:48\nAnd maybe the water molecules are about that size.\n12:51\nSo they can go through those holes.\n12:53\nSo the water molecules can go back and forth through the\n12:56\nholes, but the sugar molecules are about that big.\n13:01\nSo they cannot go through that hole.\n13:04\nThey're too big for this opening right here to go back\n13:07\nand forth between them.\n13:08\nNow what do you think is going to happen in this situation?\n13:12\nSo first of all, let's use our terminology.\n13:14\nRemember, sugar is our solute.\n13:15\nWater is our solvent.\n13:17\nSemi-permeable membrane.\n13:18\nWhich side of the membrane has a higher or lower\n13:21\nconcentration of solute?\n13:24\nWell, the inside does.\n13:25\nThe inside is hypertonic.\n13:32\nThe outside has a lower\n13:33\nconcentration so it's hypotonic.\n13:44\nNow, if these openings were big enough, based on what we\n13:47\njust talked about-- these guys are bouncing around, water is\n13:51\ntravelling in either direction, and equal\n13:53\nprobability or-- actually I'm going to talk\n13:56\nabout that in a second.\n13:58\nIf everything was wide open, it would be equal probability,\n14:01\nbut if it was wide open, these guys eventually would bounce\n14:03\ntheir ways over to this side and you'd probably end up with\n14:06\nequal concentrations eventually.\n14:08\nAnd so you would have your traditional diffusion, where\n14:10\nhigh concentration of solute to low\n14:13\nconcentrations of solute.\n14:14\nBut in this case, these guys-- they can't\n14:17\nfit through the hole.\n14:18\nOnly water can go back and forth.\n14:20\nIf these guys were not here, water would have an equal\n14:25\nlikelihood of going in this direction as they would be\n14:28\ngoing in that direction, a completely equal likelihood.\n14:33\nBut because these guys are on the right-hand side of-- or in\n14:40\nthis case, on the inside of our membrane.\n14:42\nThis is our inside of our membrane zoomed up-- it's less\n14:47\nlikely because these guys might be in the approach\n14:50\nposition of the holes-- that's slightly less likely for water\n14:55\nto be in the approach position for the holes so it's actually\n14:58\nmore probable that water could enter than water exit.\n15:02\nAnd I want to make that very clear.\n15:04\nIf these sugar molecules were not here, obviously it's\n15:07\nequally likely for water to go in either direction.\n15:09\nNow that these sugar molecules are there, these sugar\n15:12\nmolecules might be on the right-hand side.\n15:15\nThey might be blocking-- I guess the best way to think\n15:18\nabout it is blocking the approach to the hole.\n15:20\nThey'll never be able to go through the hole themselves\n15:22\nand might not even be blocking the hole, but they're going in\n15:24\nsome random direction.\n15:25\nSo if a water molecule was approaching-- it's all\n15:29\nprobabilistic and we're dealing with gazillions of\n15:31\nmolecules-- it's that much more likely to be blocked to\n15:34\nget outside.\n15:35\nBut the water molecules from the outside-- there's nothing\n15:37\nblocking them to get in so you're going to have a flow of\n15:40\nwater inside.\n15:41\nSo in this situation, with a semi-permeable membrane,\n15:44\nyou're going to have water.\n15:45\nYou're going to have a net inward flow of water.\n15:49\nAnd so this is kind of interesting.\n15:51\nWe have the solvent flowing from a hypotonic situation to\n15:56\na hypertonic solution, but it's only\n15:59\nhypotonic in the solute.\n16:07\nBut water-- if you flip it the other way-- if you've used\n16:11\nsugar as the solvent, then you could say, we're going from a\n16:15\nhigh concentration of water to a low concentration of water.\n16:19\nI don't want to confuse you too much.\n16:20\nThis is what tends to confuse people, but just think about\n16:23\nwhat's going to happen.\n16:24\nNo matter in what situation, the solution is going to do\n16:27\nwhat it can to try to equilibriate the\n16:30\nconcentration.\n16:30\nTo make the concentrations on both\n16:32\nsides as close as possible.\n16:33\nAnd it's not just some magic.\n16:35\nIt's not like the solution knows.\n16:36\nIt's all based on probabilities and these things\n16:38\nbumping around, but in this situation, water is more\n16:41\nlikely to flow into the container.\n16:43\nSo it's actually going to go from the hypotonic side when\n16:46\nwe talk about low concentration of solute to the\n16:50\nside that has high concentrations of solute, of\n16:53\nsugar-- and actually, if this thing is stretchable, more\n16:57\nwater will keep flowing in and this membrane\n17:01\nwill stretch out.\n17:04\nI won't go to too much detail here, but this idea of water--\n17:08\nof the solvent-- if in this case, water is the solvent--\n17:12\nof water as a solvent diffusing through a\n17:15\nsemi-permeable membrane, this is called osmosis.\n17:22\nYou've probably heard learning by osmosis-- if you put a book\n17:25\nagainst your head, maybe it'll just seep into your brain.\n17:27\nSame idea.\n17:28\nThat's where the word comes from.\n17:29\nThis idea of water seeping through membranes to try to\n17:33\nmake concentrations more equal.\n17:35\nSo if you say, well, I have high concentration here, low\n17:38\nconcentration here.\n17:39\nIf there was no membrane here, these big molecules would\n17:43\nexit, but because there's this semi-permeable membrane here,\n17:48\nthey can't.\n17:48\nSo the system just probabilistically-- no magic\n17:52\nhere-- more water will enter to try to equilibriate\n17:56\nconcentration.\n17:57\nEventually-- if maybe there's a few molecules out here-- not\n18:01\nas high concentration here-- eventually if everything was\n18:06\nallowed to happen fully, you'll get to the point where\n18:08\nyou have just as many-- you have just as high\n18:11\nconcentration on this side as you have on the right-hand\n18:13\nside because this right-hand side is going to fill with\n18:16\nwater and also probably become a larger volume.\n18:19\nAnd then, once again, the probabilities of a water\n18:21\nmolecule going to the right and to the left will be the\n18:23\nsame and you'll get to some type of equilibrium.\n18:25\nBut I want to make it very clear-- diffusion is the idea\n18:29\nof any particle going from higher concentration and\n18:33\nspreading into a region that has a lower concentration and\n18:35\njust spreading out.\n18:36\nOsmosis is the diffusion of water.\n18:41\nAnd usually you're talking about the diffusion of water\n18:44\nas a solvent and usually it's in the context of a\n18:47\nsemi-permeable membrane, where the actual solute cannot\n18:51\ntravel through the membrane.\n18:53\nAnyway, hopefully you've found that useful and\n18:55\nnot completely confusing.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn talking about the adaptive immune system, we've already\n0:04\nseen that there's a couple of actors.\n0:16\nYou have your humoral response.\n0:20\nSo this is responding to things that are floating\n0:22\naround in the fluids of the body and not necessarily\n0:24\nthings that have infiltrated your body cells and then you\n0:27\nhave your cell mediated response.\n0:35\nAnd then in the humoral response-- and we're talking\n0:38\nabout specific humoral response-- this is where the B\n0:40\ncells, the B lymphocytes are at their most active.\n0:45\nAnd essentially what they do is, you got a B cell here.\n0:48\nIt has a very specific antibody, specific to just\n0:52\nthis B cell, not B cells in general.\n0:55\nIf this happens to be the one of the billions of B cells\n0:59\nthat happens to have the matching key-- or maybe I\n1:02\nshould say the matching lock for the key that is the\n1:05\nintruding pathogen-- that pathogen will\n1:09\nbind to that B cell.\n1:11\nMaybe it's a virus, maybe it's a bacteria.\n1:14\nAnd then the B cell will get activated and we'll talk about\n1:17\nin this video that the activation\n1:19\ndoesn't always happen.\n1:20\nIn fact, it usually doesn't happen just from this, but so\n1:23\nfar we've said it gets activated, it goes into memory\n1:28\nB cells, which are essentially multiple versions of this\n1:31\noriginal B cell-- just saying, hey, let's have multiple\n1:33\nversions of this-- because it tends to recognize this virus.\n1:36\nSo in the future if we get this virus, those multiple\n1:39\nversions, those memory cells are going to be there to have\n1:42\nthis interaction.\n1:43\nThis interaction's going to be more likely to happen in the\n1:45\nfuture because I'm going to have more of this\n1:47\nvariety of B cell.\n1:48\nAnd then you have effector cells.\n1:53\nAnd these are essentially-- so both of these are B cells.\n1:56\nSo this guy, once he gets activated, he proliferates,\n2:00\nkeeps dividing and cloning himself.\n2:02\nThe memory cells just stick around waiting to be activated\n2:05\nin the future.\n2:06\nAnd I'm only drawing one of these membrane bound\n2:10\nantibodies, but there are actually 10,000 on them.\n2:13\nI mean, I could draw a bunch of these.\n2:15\nI don't have to just draw one.\n2:17\nThe memories just wade around in the future, but there's\n2:19\nmore of them now.\n2:19\nSo in the future, if we get this virus again, this\n2:23\ninteraction's going to happen faster and so they're going to\n2:26\nget activated faster.\n2:27\nAnd then the effector B cells essentially turn\n2:32\ninto antibody factories.\n2:35\nThis antibody goes in and it says, let me just produce--\n2:39\nI've been activated.\n2:39\nLet me produce many, many more versions\n2:42\nof that exact antibody.\n2:44\nSo they get spit out.\n2:46\nI drew that one little wrong.\n2:48\nSo that exact antibody, that can then be spit out to go\n2:53\ndisable or tag antigens-- and not just any antigen-- this\n2:57\nantigen right here.\n3:00\nAnd we also saw that the other thing that the B cell does is\n3:03\nit becomes an antigen presenting cell.\n3:06\nSo what it does is, as soon as it recognizes this, it's had\n3:11\nthis interaction with an antigen that just matches the\n3:14\nvariable portion of its membrane bound antibody.\n3:17\nIt endocytosizes that.\n3:19\nIt brings that into itself.\n3:22\nIt's membrane facilitated so it just kind of pulls it in,\n3:25\nchunks it up, and then presents a piece of that\n3:27\nantibody on an MHC II molecule.\n3:31\nWe saw that in the last video.\n3:33\nSo it cuts that up and presents a piece of it right\n3:36\nthere and that's why we call it an antigen presenting cell.\n3:39\nNow in this video, we're going to talk about why we even have\n3:42\nthese MHC II molecules.\n3:44\nWhat are we presenting these antigens to?\n3:47\nSo we're going to start talking about the cell\n3:48\nmediated-- and actually, even more than the cell mediated,\n3:50\nwe're going to talk about T cells.\n3:56\nAnd I said in the first video, they're called T cells because\n3:59\nthey mature in the thymus.\n4:07\nAnd there are two types of T cells and it's all very\n4:09\nconfusing because you have B cells and T cells, but then\n4:11\nthere are two types of T cells.\n4:13\nYou have helper T cells-- and most people just write T with\n4:18\na lower-case or subscript h there.\n4:21\nAnd then you have cytotoxic T cells-- or T cells that kill\n4:26\nother cells.\n4:32\nNow just so that you have a big, overarching impression of\n4:36\nwhat does what-- B cells.\n4:39\nWhen they are activated, they generate antibodies.\n4:43\nAt 30,000 feet, that's the best summary of what an\n4:46\nactivated B cell does.\n4:47\nIt actually generate antibodies.\n4:49\nThose antibodies attach to viruses and bacteria and other\n4:53\ntypes of pathogens and disables them-- either tags\n4:55\nthem so that macrophages can go and eat them up or just by\n5:02\nthrowing all of those antibodies on to the surface\n5:06\nof the pathogen in question.\n5:08\nIt might disable the pathogens or essentially bundle them\n5:11\naltogether so that it'll be easier for macrophages to pick\n5:14\nthem up, but this is only effective for things that are\n5:17\nfloating around.\n5:19\nFree floating antibodies are only effective for things that\n5:21\nare floating around.\n5:24\nCytotoxic T cells, which I'll cover in more detail in a\n5:27\nfuture video-- these actually attack cells that have been\n5:32\ninfiltrated.\n5:34\nSo this is attack, kill, infiltrated cells-- and when I\n5:42\nsay infiltrated, it could be a cell that a virus has gone\n5:45\ninto or some bacteria has penetrated it.\n5:47\nAnd when I say infiltrated, it doesn't necessarily even mean\n5:49\nsomething from the outside.\n5:50\nIt could even be a cancerous cell that shows itself to be\n5:53\nabnormal in some way and so the cytotoxic T cells will at\n5:57\nleast attempt to kill them.\n5:59\nBut what I want to focus on-- out of the three types of\n6:02\nlymphocytes-- remember, everything we've been talking\n6:06\nabout was leukocytes, white blood cells, but lymphocytes\n6:09\nare a subset of that and these three are lymphocytes.\n6:12\nAnd they're called that because they began their\n6:14\ndevelopment in the bone marrow.\n6:18\nSo this guy and this guy actually do stuff.\n6:24\nThis guy generates antibodies that attach to pathogens\n6:27\nfloating around.\n6:28\nThis guy directly attacks cells that are\n6:31\nbroken in some way.\n6:32\nThey've either been infiltrated, they're abnormal,\n6:34\nthey're cancerous-- who knows what.\n6:36\nAnd I'll do a whole video on that, but that leads us to a\n6:39\nvery obvious question.\n6:40\nWhat does this guy do?\n6:42\nWhat does the helper T cell do if he doesn't directly\n6:47\ninterface either with pathogens or produce things\n6:50\nthat interface with pathogens-- or if he himself\n6:53\ndoesn't go and directly kill cells?\n6:55\nAnd the answer is that the helper T cell's kind of the\n6:58\nalarm of the immune system.\n7:01\nAnd on some level, it's almost the most important.\n7:03\nSo we talked already in the last video about antigen\n7:08\npresenting cells-- that either when a macrophage or a\n7:11\ndendritic cell takes things in, it cuts them up and\n7:15\npresents it on its surface as these MHC II proteins or in\n7:19\ncomplex with these MHC II complexes or proteins.\n7:24\nAnd so do B cells.\n7:27\nB cells are more specific.\n7:28\nNow, once something is presented, now the helper T\n7:33\ncell can come into the picture.\n7:34\nSo this is a-- let me do a dendritic cell-- and I'm doing\n7:39\ndendritic cells actually on purpose because dendritic\n7:42\ncells are actually the best cells at\n7:45\nactivating helper T cells.\n7:46\nWe're going to talk about in a second what happens when a\n7:49\nhelper T cell gets activated.\n7:51\nSo let's say I have this dendritic cell.\n7:54\nIt's called dendritic so it looks like it has\n7:55\ndendrites on it.\n8:01\nSo I have this dendritic cell here.\n8:03\nIt's a phagocyte.\n8:06\nLet's say it's already consumed some type of bacteria\n8:10\nor virus and it's cut it up and now it's presenting kind\n8:14\nof the body parts of that virus on the MHC II complex.\n8:23\nIt's kind of its way of saying, hey, I found this\n8:25\nshady thing floating around in the body's tissues.\n8:29\nMaybe someone ought to raise an alarm.\n8:32\nMaybe this is part of some type of bigger thing going on\n8:35\nand some type of alarm bell has to be released.\n8:37\nAnd that's what the helper T cell does.\n8:40\nSo let's say this guy-- he's presented it.\n8:42\nHe says, I found this thing.\n8:43\nI killed it.\n8:43\nHere's a part of it.\n8:44\nThe helper T cell has a T cell receptor on it.\n8:49\nLet's say this is the helper T cell right here.\n8:55\nAnd it has a T cell receptor on it and the T cell receptors\n9:00\nbond to-- and I'll be very particular here.\n9:03\nSo this is the T cell receptor.\n9:07\nIt's just like a protein, but like the membrane bound\n9:11\nantibodies on B cells that every B cell or almost every B\n9:16\ncell has a different version, different variable chain,\n9:18\nthat's also true of helper T cells-- that just like the B\n9:24\ncells, this has some variation in where it binds.\n9:27\nSo this right here is going to be variable from one helper T\n9:31\ncell to another.\n9:31\nFor example, I might have another helper T cell here.\n9:35\nThat also has a T cell receptor, but the variable\n9:41\nportion on that T cell receptor is different than the\n9:47\nvariable portion on this T cell receptor.\n9:49\nSo this helper T cell will not bind to this dendritic cell or\n9:55\nthe MHC II complex of this dendritic cell.\n9:58\nOnly this one would.\n9:59\nAnd the mechanism of how you get this variation is very\n10:02\nsimilar to the mechanism in how you get the variation on\n10:05\nthe antibodies and the B cells.\n10:07\nDuring these helper T cells' development, at some point the\n10:12\ngenes that code for this part of this receptor get shuffled\n10:15\naround and they get shuffled around intentionally so that\n10:18\neach T cell has a certain specificity to a combination\n10:23\nof an MHC II complex and a certain polypeptide, a certain\n10:28\npart of a virus.\n10:29\nSo only this guy's going to be activated, not this guy.\n10:32\nSo this is why we call it the specific immune system.\n10:35\nNow we said, what does that helper T\n10:36\ncell do at that point?\n10:40\nHe said, hey, I happen to be the one helper T cell that can\n10:44\nbond to this guy, this antigen that's presented.\n10:46\nIt becomes activated.\n10:49\nAnd I won't go into the details, but in general,\n10:51\ndendritic cells are the best ones at activating it,\n10:54\nespecially a naive T cell.\n11:02\nIn general, when we talk about a naive B cell or a naive\n11:05\nhelper T cell, these are cells that are non-memory,\n11:08\nnon-effector, that have never been touched by-- they've\n11:11\nnever been activated, in the case of a B cell.\n11:14\nThey've never been activated by something binding to their\n11:18\nmembrane bound antibody-- or a naive helper T cell is a\n11:23\nnon-effector, non-memory helper T cell that's never had\n11:26\nanything bound to it.\n11:28\nSo if this guy is naive and then he finally has a reaction\n11:33\nwith this antigen presenting cell, he becomes non-naive.\n11:37\nHe becomes activated and when activated, two things happen.\n11:41\nWell, just like with B cells, he proliferates many, many,\n11:44\nmany copies of himself and some subset of those copies\n11:48\ndifferentiate into effector cells.\n11:54\nAnd effector just means it does something.\n11:56\nIt does something now instead of saving the memory.\n12:01\nAnd then some subset of them become memory helper T cells\n12:08\nafter getting activated.\n12:12\nNow the memory T cells, just like memory B cells-- now you\n12:15\nhave more copies of this.\n12:16\nSo in 10 years in the future, if something like this\n12:17\nhappens, this interaction's going to be\n12:19\nmore likely to happen.\n12:20\nThese guys have the same T cell receptor as their parent.\n12:33\nIt's just that the memory T cells-- or actually even the\n12:36\nmemory B cells-- they last longer.\n12:38\nThey don't kill themselves.\n12:39\nThey'll last for years so that if 10 years later, something\n12:42\nlike this starts presenting itself, you're going to have\n12:44\nmore of these guys around to bump into this guy so that you\n12:47\ncan raise the alarm bells.\n12:49\nThis guy's also going to have the same chain right there.\n12:56\nSo you're saying, fine.\n12:57\nI have these memory cells.\n12:58\nThey're going to stick around so that this reaction can\n13:00\nhappen in the future, but I still haven't answered the\n13:02\nquestion, what does the effector T cell do?\n13:05\nWhat the effector T cell does is it raises the alarm.\n13:16\nSo there's an effector T cell.\n13:18\nIt has been activated.\n13:22\nRemember, this is very particular.\n13:23\nOnly this version of T cells, but once it got activated, it\n13:27\nproduced many copies of itself because it says, hey, I'm\n13:29\nresponding to a particular type of pathogen.\n13:32\nSo that this is a helper T cell.\n13:34\nThis is an effector.\n13:37\nAnd what these do is they start releasing these\n13:39\nmolecules called cytokines.\n13:42\nSo they start releasing cytokines.\n13:50\nThere are many, many different types of cytokines and I'm not\n13:52\ngoing to go into detail on all that, but what cytokines do is\n13:56\nthat they really raise the alarm.\n13:58\nSo if you have other activated lymphatic cells or other\n14:03\nactivated immunological cells-- when the cytokines\n14:07\nenter those cells-- remember, cytokines\n14:08\nare really just proteins.\n14:10\nWhen the cytokines enter-- or polypeptides-- when they enter\n14:14\nthose cells, it makes them get in gear.\n14:17\nIt makes them multiply more often or it makes them get\n14:21\nmore active in their immune response.\n14:24\nSo what this does-- these cytokines you can view as\n14:26\nchemical alarm bells chemical or peptide alarm bells alarm\n14:34\nbells it it tells everyone to get in gear.\n14:38\nSo that's one role, and so you can see this is actually a\n14:40\nvery central role and it'll tell both activated cytotoxic\n14:45\nT cells to get in gear, which we haven't talked about yet.\n14:47\nAnd it'll also tell B cells to keep proliferating.\n14:50\nSo when an activated B cell gets some of-- so this is an\n14:53\nactivated B cell.\n14:55\nWhen it gets some of these cytokines, that maybe come\n14:58\nfrom a local helper T cell, it'll tell it, hey no, divide\n15:01\nmore often.\n15:02\nDivide more often.\n15:03\nOnly if you've been activated already.\n15:04\nAnd we'll talk more about why it has to be that case,\n15:07\nbecause you don't want all the B cells to be activated.\n15:10\nAnd the other thing that the effector T cell does-- in the\n15:13\nB cell discussion, I said, OK, if I have a B cell, and it has\n15:21\nits membrane bound antibody, has its\n15:24\nmembrane bound antibody.\n15:25\nAnd remember, this is a particular version, it has its\n15:29\nparticular variable chain right here.\n15:31\nAnd this guy binds to a pathogen.\n15:34\nSo this binds to a pathogen.\n15:36\nMaybe it's a virus right there.\n15:38\nUp to now, I've been saying that this guy's activated.\n15:41\nAnd he's going to-- well, when he binds to the pathogen he'll\n15:44\ntake this in and he'll take part of the pathogen and cut\n15:49\nit up and place it on an MHC II molecule.\n15:55\nAnd we said, then he'll be activated.\n15:57\nHe'll proliferate and he'll differentiate into memory and\n16:00\neffector B cells-- but that's not quite true.\n16:02\nThis first stage happens.\n16:04\nThis guy bonds.\n16:05\nThis B cell happened to be specific to this virus.\n16:08\nCuts up the virus.\n16:10\nPuts parts of the virus on its surface and presents parts of\n16:13\nthe antigen.\n16:14\nBut in most cases, this B cell isn't yet activated.\n16:19\nYou can kind of view it as in its resting state, ready to be\n16:22\nactivated, but it hasn't started proliferating and\n16:24\ndifferentiating into effector and memory molecules yet.\n16:27\nAnd in order for that to happen, an activated helper T\n16:36\ncell that is also specific to this very same virus-- so you\n16:40\ncould imagine someplace else in the cell-- this virus was\n16:45\neaten by a dendritic cell.\n16:52\nSo this exact same virus, this exact same species of virus,\n16:55\nis eaten by that dendritic cell and so the dendritic cell\n16:59\neats it up, it cuts it up, and then it presents it-- it's\n17:05\nantigen presenting so it presents it just like that.\n17:10\nThen this will activate a very specific T\n17:12\ncell, maybe that one.\n17:14\nSo a very specific T cell will come and bump into it.\n17:20\nNot just any T cell, the one with the\n17:23\nright variable portion.\n17:24\nSo think about what's happening.\n17:25\nThe variable portion for this T cell, it connects to this\n17:33\npart of the virus plus the MHC II, but it's really reacting\n17:38\nto the same virus.\n17:39\nIt might be a different part.\n17:40\nThis little part that was cut off might be someplace inside\n17:43\nthe virus while the epitope for the B cell might be some\n17:47\nplace on the outside of the virus, but they're both\n17:50\nspecific to the same virus.\n17:53\nNow once this guy gets activated and he starts\n17:56\nproducing memory and effector cells-- or they're descended\n17:59\nfrom him, one of those effector cells specific to\n18:02\nthis virus are needed to come bind to this guy.\n18:06\nSo then this guy could then go along and bump around and\n18:09\neventually end up here.\n18:11\nAnd he is also specific to this virus.\n18:14\nSo this binding site right here is the same as this\n18:16\nbinding site.\n18:17\nThis combination of antigen plus MHC II.\n18:21\nAnd so when this guy binds-- and remember, this binding\n18:29\nsite is the same as this and it only binds to this\n18:31\ncombination right here-- this is what activates the B cell\n18:36\nin most cases.\n18:37\nThis is T-dependent activation, which\n18:41\nis usually the case.\n18:42\nSometimes all you need is this first thing, but in general\n18:45\nyou need the first thing and then you also need a T cell to\n18:48\ncome and activate it, and only then will the B cell get\n18:52\nactivated and start proliferating and dividing and\n18:55\ndifferentiating itself and producing-- when its effector\n18:58\ncells will produce a lot of antibodies.\n19:00\nAnd so there's a natural question.\n19:01\nWhy do biological systems-- or why do we\n19:04\nhave this double system?\n19:05\nAnd at least my sense of it is, it's a failsafe mechanism.\n19:10\nIf every time a virus came and attached this, this guy just\n19:13\nstarted going crazy and producing antibodies against\n19:15\nthis thing, there's some chance that maybe after\n19:20\ndevelopment, this chain right here or his genes for\n19:26\ngenerating these chains become specific, not for foreign\n19:30\npathogens, but maybe they become specific for self\n19:35\nmolecules, molecules that are naturally\n19:37\nproduced within the body.\n19:38\nIt's just a random mutation, but if he started going crazy\n19:40\nfor that, his antibodies will start attacking molecules that\n19:45\nare naturally in the body and then that could really hurt.\n19:47\nThat what causes autoimmune diseases, where your own\n19:51\nimmune cells start activating yourself.\n19:53\nBut if you have this double handshake system where this\n19:55\nhas to happen and this has to happen, the likelihood of both\n19:59\nof these guys after they leave their development stage\n20:03\nbecoming specific to a self protein or a self cell or a\n20:09\nself molecule is very unlikely.\n20:12\nSo it kind of inhibits this guy from going wild, even if\n20:15\nhe has some type of a mutation.\n20:17\nAnyway, hopefully that explains a little bit of what\n20:19\nhelper T cells do.\n20:20\nWe'll talk a lot more about it.\n20:22\nI know it can be a little bit confusing.\n20:23\nIn the next video, we'll talk about cytotoxic T cells.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's see if we can get the molecular structure for\n0:03\nbutylcyclopentane.\n0:11\nSo you just break this up the way we've done it in the last\n0:13\nseveral videos, the suffix is -ane, so it is an alkane, all\n0:18\nsingle bonds.\n0:20\nSo single bonds.\n0:25\nIt's pentane, so we're dealing with five carbons on the base,\n0:29\nor on the backbone.\n0:31\nSo this is five carbons and it's a cyclopentane, so it's\n0:35\nfive carbons in a ring.\n0:37\nSo its five-carbon ring is the backbone, and then we have a\n0:42\nbutyl group added to that five-carbon ring.\n0:45\nNow, you might say, hey, Sal, how do I know which\n0:46\ncarbon to add it to?\n0:47\nWhen you're dealing with a ring and you only have one\n0:50\ngroup on the ring, it doesn't matter.\n0:52\nLet me just show you what I mean.\n0:53\nSo let's draw the five-carbon ring.\n0:55\nLet's draw the cyclopentane.\n0:57\nSo it'll just be a pentagon, so one, two, three, four,\n1:02\nfive, and it's a ring, so you can connect them.\n1:04\nOne, two, three, four, five.\n1:07\nNow, it doesn't matter where I draw the butyl group.\n1:09\nIt's all symmetric around there.\n1:11\nWe just have a ring and it's connected to a butyl group at\n1:13\nsome point.\n1:14\nIt'll start to matter once we add more than one group.\n1:16\nSo we can just pick any of these carbons to add\n1:18\nthe butyl group to.\n1:19\nNow, just as a review, the but- prefix, that refers to,\n1:24\nremember, methyl, ethyl, propyl, or meth-,\n1:28\neth-, prop-, but-.\n1:29\nThis is four carbons.\n1:31\nThis is a four-carbon alkyl group.\n1:35\nSo let me just add it here.\n1:37\nI could have added it to any of these carbons around this\n1:39\ncyclopentane ring.\n1:40\nSo if I just add it right here, so I'm going to have\n1:42\nfour carbons.\n1:43\nSo one, two, three, four.\n1:48\nThat is the butyl part of this whole thing.\n1:51\nAnd then let me just attach them up.\n1:53\nSo you might be tempted to just draw this right there.\n1:56\nAnd actually, this would be right.\n1:57\nThis is butylcyclopentane.\n2:00\nBut a question might arise.\n2:02\nI just happened to connect the cyclopentane to the butyl at\n2:07\nthis first carbon on the butyl right there.\n2:09\nI could have just as easily done it like this.\n2:16\nI could have just as easily had it like this, where-- let\n2:21\nme draw my butyl again, so I have one, two, three, four.\n2:27\nSo, once again, this is a butyl, but instead of being\n2:30\nbonded to the cyclopentane on my first carbon, maybe it's\n2:34\nbonded right here.\n2:37\nLet me do it with that yellow color.\n2:39\nMaybe it's bonded right here.\n2:42\nThis seems like maybe this could also be\n2:45\nbutylcyclopentane.\n2:47\nIt looks like we have a butyl group.\n2:49\nThis is a butyl right here.\n2:50\nI drew a butyl group right over here, and I also drew a\n2:54\nbutyl group right over here.\n2:56\nBut these are fundamentally two different molecular\n2:59\nstructures.\n3:00\nI'm touching the first carbon here.\n3:01\nI'm touching the second carbon over here.\n3:03\nNow, there's two ways to differentiate this.\n3:06\nOne is the common naming and one is the systematic naming.\n3:10\nSo let me differentiate between the two.\n3:12\nSo in the common naming, and this can get a little bit\n3:15\ninvolved, and this frankly is probably the most complicated\n3:19\npart of naming organic compounds.\n3:22\nSystematic is often more complicated, but it's easier\n3:25\nto systematically come up with it.\n3:27\nSo there's a common and then there's a systematic.\n3:35\nSo the common way of doing it is, if you just say\n3:38\nbutylcyclopentane, that implies that you are bonding\n3:42\nto the first or, depending on how you view it, the last\n3:44\ncarbon in the chain.\n3:45\nSo this right here is butylcyclopentane.\n3:47\nThis right here is not just butylcyclopentane.\n3:51\nWhat you would do is you definitely have a cyclopentane\n3:54\nring, so this would definitely be a cyclopentane.\n3:58\nLet me put some space here.\n4:01\nThis is definitely going to be a cyclopentane.\n4:06\nAnd you do have a butyl group on it, so we do have a butyl\n4:11\ngroup, but because we are bonded-- we aren't bonded to\n4:17\nthe first carbon.\n4:18\nWe're bonded to a carbon that is bonded\n4:20\nto two other carbons.\n4:21\nWe call this\n4:22\nsec-butylcyclopentane, so this is sec-.\n4:29\nAnd everything I'm doing is obviously free-hand.\n4:31\nIf you were to see this in a book, the sec- would be\n4:34\nitalicized, or sometimes it would be written as\n4:38\ns-butylcyclopentane.\n4:48\nAnd this sec- means that we have attached to a carbon that\n4:51\nis touching two other carbons.\n4:53\nSo you look at the butyl group, and say, well, which of\n4:55\nthese carbons is attached to two others?\n4:56\nIt's either that one or that one.\n4:57\nAnd regardless of whether you're attached to this or\n4:59\nthis, if you think about it, it's fundamentally the same\n5:02\nmolecular structure.\n5:04\nSo that's what you do when you're attached to that guy\n5:06\nright over there.\n5:07\nBut what about the situation where we're dealing with just\n5:09\nthe common names right here?\n5:10\nWhat about the situation where it looks like this?\n5:13\nSo we have our cyclopentane right there, and we have a-- I\n5:18\nguess we could call it a butyl group.\n5:19\nIt'll have four carbons in it, but let's say that the four\n5:23\ncarbons look something like this.\n5:25\nLet's say there are four carbons, so we have one, two,\n5:30\nthree, four carbons and we're bonded to this\n5:36\none right over here.\n5:37\nSo whenever you're bonded to one end of the four-carbon\n5:42\ngroup and it branches off at the other end, and it seems a\n5:46\nlittle complicated, this only deals for alkyl groups below\n5:50\nfive or six carbons, this we call an isobutyl group.\n5:55\nSo let me write this down.\n5:56\nSo this right here, is sec-butyl, or s-butyl\n6:02\nsometimes for short.\n6:04\nThis right here, this right there is iso-butyl.\n6:11\nIt's actually-- iso- that is an iso-butyl group.\n6:17\nAnd then the last thing to worry about when you're\n6:18\ndealing with butyl groups is something like this.\n6:24\nLet me draw it.\n6:26\nSo you could also draw four carbons like this.\n6:28\nYou have one carbon, two, three, four.\n6:30\nOne, two, three, four carbons and you're attached over here.\n6:34\nNow this naming, this group right here-- and you're going\n6:38\nsee the systematic naming is much\n6:39\neasier for these compounds.\n6:41\nThis group right here, over here the carbon you're\n6:44\nattached to is attached to two other\n6:45\ncarbons, so it is sec-butyl.\n6:49\nWhen you're attached to three carbons, it is t-butyl, or\n6:52\ntert-butyl, so this right here is a tert-butyl group, or\n7:00\nsometimes called a t-butyl.\n7:02\nAnd I really want you to understand\n7:03\nthe difference here.\n7:04\nThe common naming, it's easier to say and easier to spell,\n7:07\nbut it's sometimes a little confusing.\n7:08\nThis is just straight up butyl so you would call this\n7:11\nbutylcyclopentane.\n7:13\nThis is sec-butyl, because you have this guy\n7:16\nconnected to two carbons.\n7:17\nThat's where the sec- comes from.\n7:21\nSometimes it'll be s-butyl.\n7:22\nSo this could be called sec-butylcyclopentane or\n7:27\ns-butylcyclopentane.\n7:29\nThis, because we're attached to the end away from this\n7:32\nbranching off, is still a butyl group, since we have\n7:35\nfour carbons.\n7:36\nBut since we're attached here, this is iso-butyl, so this is\n7:39\niso-butylcyclopentane,\n7:41\nAnd then finally, since the carbon we're attaching to is\n7:44\nattached to one, two, three other carbons, it is a\n7:48\ntert-butyl or a t-butyl group.\n7:50\nSo this is t-butylcyclopentane.\n7:54\nThat's the common naming.\n7:55\nSo maybe I should clear out systematic here just so it's\n7:57\nclear to you that everything we've done\n8:01\nhere is common naming.\n8:04\nSo let me write it down.\n8:05\nIt won't hurt to write them down again because the more\n8:08\nfamiliar you are with these, the better.\n8:10\nSo this is just butylcyclopentane.\n8:18\nThis is s- or sec- butylcyclopentane.\n8:26\nAnd this is iso-butylcyclopentane.\n8:37\nI'm going off the screen here.\n8:38\nAnd then finally, this is tert-butyl, or\n8:41\nt-butylcyclopentane.\n8:45\nNow, I said these are the common naming.\n8:48\nWhat are the systematic naming?\n8:50\nWell, in the systematic, this is still butylcyclopentane.\n8:54\nSo let me write this down.\n8:55\nSystematic, this is still\n9:01\nbutylcyclopentane, which makes sense.\n9:02\nThis is very clearly a cyclopentane.\n9:05\nThis is very clearly a butyl group.\n9:08\nBut in the systematic naming, what we try to do is we try to\n9:11\nname this group right here just as we would name a\n9:16\ntraditional chain, but we ended it with an -yl.\n9:19\nSo if you look at this right here, what we do is we just\n9:22\nconsider the chain where we attach.\n9:26\nWe attached over here, so the longest chain from that point\n9:30\nis there and there.\n9:33\nSo if you look at it like that, it looks like you have\n9:35\none, two, three carbons, and you have one carbon attached\n9:39\non the beginning.\n9:40\nSo this little group right here in the systematic naming,\n9:43\nthis looks like a one, two, three.\n9:45\nThree carbons, that's the prop- prefix, so we're dealing\n9:49\nwith a prop-, and it's all going to be one group, so it's\n9:52\na propyl group.\n9:54\nThis is a propyl group, but it has a methyl-- remember, meth-\n9:59\nis one carbon.\n10:00\nIt has a methyl group attached on the first carbon.\n10:03\nSo this is 1-methylpropyl.\n10:11\nNow, that describes just the group.\n10:15\n1-methylpropyl describes just this part right here.\n10:18\nThat describes just that right over there.\n10:21\nAnd then to have the whole compound, to describe the\n10:25\nwhole compound, you put this in parentheses, so this is the\n10:27\nsystematic naming.\n10:29\nSo 1-methyl-- I put an L there.\n10:33\nLet me do it in the same color.\n10:34\n1-methyl, because you're starting\n10:38\nwhere you're attaching.\n10:39\nSo 1-methyl, you have a methyl group right there on that\n10:43\nfirst carbon.\n10:44\nIt's a propyl chain.\n10:45\nOne, two, three, propyl, and then you would say\n10:48\ncyclopentane.\n10:54\nThat's the systematic name for that.\n10:56\nNow if you look at this one right here, and the common\n10:59\nname is iso-butyl, what you do is you\n11:01\nlook at where we attach.\n11:03\nWhere we attached is one, two, three carbons.\n11:07\nSo once again, I'm doing that same one, two, three carbons.\n11:11\nSo once again, this is a propyl.\n11:15\nProp- is for three, but with a methyl group now is attached\n11:19\nto the one, two, the second carbon.\n11:23\nSo this is 2-methyl.\n11:26\nLet me make some space here.\n11:28\nThis is 2-methyl.\n11:31\nSo that describes this group right here.\n11:34\nThat describes this entire group cyclopentane.\n11:39\nRemember, this is a systematic name.\n11:41\nYou might sometimes see this referred to as\n11:43\niso-butylcyclopentane or 2-methylpropylcyclopentane.\n11:47\nAnd this is actually a -yl.\n11:48\nI spelled it wrong.\n11:50\nAnd then finally, we do the same exact idea here, but it\n11:53\nbecomes a little bit more interesting.\n11:55\nOver here, we are attached to this carbon and the longest\n11:59\nchain I can do starting with that carbon is just one chain\n12:03\nright there.\n12:04\nSo we just have a two-carbon chain, right?\n12:06\nOne, two.\n12:07\nThe prefix for a two carbon is ethyl, or eth-.\n12:11\nEth-, and since it's a group, ethyl.\n12:14\nAnd then we have two methyl groups attached right over\n12:22\nthere, and it's attached on the one carbon, right?\n12:25\nThis is one and this is two.\n12:27\nWe call the one carbon where we are attached\n12:29\nto the broader chain.\n12:30\nSo what this is going to be, you would actually write one\n12:34\ncomma one to show that we have two groups attached to the\n12:36\nfirst carbon and both of them are methyl.\n12:40\nSo we write 1,1-dimethyl, di- for two, dimethyl.\n12:48\nSo this entire group right here, which we also called\n12:50\nt-butyl, in systematic naming is 1,1-.\n12:53\nWe have two groups attached to this first carbon.\n12:56\n1,1-dimethylethyl.\n12:58\nThat's this whole thing.\n12:59\nThis is the ethyl, and then we have two methyls attached\n13:02\nthere. that's why we write 1,1-.\n13:03\nThey're both attached to the one.\n13:04\nWe have two of them.\n13:06\nThat's why we wrote di- over there.\n13:08\nSo it's 1,1-dimethylethyl- and then finally, cyclopentane.\n13:15\nSo hopefully, that doesn't confuse you too much.\n13:16\nI think if you watch the video over and over and try to\n13:18\npractice it with your own problems, you'll see that the\n13:20\nsystematic name way is actually\n13:22\npretty, pretty logical.\n13:23\nAnd actually, if you have more than five or six carbons in\n13:26\nthe group, they always or they tend to always use the\n13:29\nsystematic naming.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the last video, we talked a little bit\n0:02\nabout the immune system.\n0:04\nIn that video, we focused on the nonspecific or the innate\n0:09\nimmune system.\n0:10\nSo let me write that.\n0:17\nAnd even in the nonspecific immune system, we subdivided\n0:20\nthat into kind of the first line barriers.\n0:24\nAnd those were things like the skin, or the stomach acid, or\n0:30\nthe acidity of the oils on the outside of your skin.\n0:33\nThese are just natural barriers to not allowing\n0:35\nthings inside of your body, but then once they get in-- so\n0:38\nyou can almost imagine these were the\n0:39\nfirst line of defense.\n0:42\nAnd then you had your second line of defense, but these are\n0:45\nstill nonspecific-- and when we say nonspecific, it means\n0:48\nthat they don't necessarily know what type of virus, what\n0:51\ntype of protein, what type of bacteria.\n0:53\nThey just know that this thing looks shady.\n0:55\nLet me eat it up.\n0:56\nLet me kill it.\n0:56\nLet me have an inflammatory response.\n0:59\nSo in there, we said, well, there's an inflammatory\n1:01\nresponse, which I'm actually going to talk about after we\n1:06\ndo videos on the specific immune system.\n1:09\nYou have your inflammatory response, which really just\n1:11\ngets things to where the action is at and then you also\n1:14\nhave your phagocytes, which are these cells that are\n1:20\nengulfing things.\n1:22\nAnd just so you know, all the phagocytes that we talked\n1:24\nabout in the last video, these are all instances of white\n1:29\nblood cells or leukocytes.\n1:35\nThese phagocytes right here, these are all-- I talk about\n1:38\ndendritic cells and macrophages and neutrophils.\n1:43\nThese were all white blood cells.\n1:45\nThese weren't all the kinds of white blood cells.\n1:47\nWe're about to talk about more-- and the other word for\n1:50\nwhite blood cell is also leukocyte.\n1:55\nSo that is nonspecific.\n1:57\nWell, one, it just doesn't let you in, but then when you're\n1:59\nin, it says, hey, you're just shady.\n2:01\nI'm going to eat you up.\n2:02\nI have receptors.\n2:03\nYou have some double stranded DNA floating around.\n2:06\nOnly viruses have double strand DNA.\n2:08\nI'm going to eat you up.\n2:08\nI don't know what type of virus you are.\n2:10\nI don't know if I've seen you before or not.\n2:12\nThat's why it's nonspecific.\n2:14\nNow the really interesting thing about our immune\n2:16\nsystem-- and this nonspecific, this exists across many, many,\n2:22\nmany species and types of organisms. But the specific is\n2:28\nkind of a-- it's thought to be a newer adaptation.\n2:32\nWhat I'm going to talk about is the specific immune system\n2:34\nthat's particular to humans.\n2:41\nThat's our other classification.\n2:42\nLet me do it like that.\n2:45\nSo then you have your specific-- or you can imagine\n2:50\nit's an adaptive immune system.\n2:52\nYou've probably heard of things like that.\n2:54\nI have resistance to that bacteria or that virus.\n3:00\nSo this is adaptive.\n3:03\nAnd it's really all based on having exposure to things.\n3:06\nAnd within the specific immune system, we talked a little--\n3:12\nwhen we talked about the antigen presenting molecules\n3:16\nthat phagocytes do-- that plays a role in this.\n3:18\nWe're going to go into more detail, but I don't want to\n3:20\nconfuse you.\n3:21\nBut the main actors here are called lymphocytes, not to be\n3:24\nconfused with leukocytes-- because they still are\n3:26\nleukocytes.\n3:28\nSo let me write this down.\n3:38\nThese are specific.\n3:40\nPhagocytes, for the most part, are nonspecific, but both of\n3:44\nthese are white blood cells.\n3:45\nLymphocytes are another type of white\n3:47\nblood cell or leukocyte.\n3:49\nDon't want to confuse you with this convoluted diagram, but I\n3:53\njust want to make the terminology clear.\n3:54\nWhen someone talks about a white blood cell, they're\n3:56\nreally just talking about a set of cells that when people\n3:58\nfirst tried to separate the components of blood-- you'd\n4:01\nhave your red blood cells that would kind of settle in the\n4:03\nbottom, then you'd have this layer of white frothy stuff in\n4:06\nthe middle that was really made of white blood cells, and\n4:08\nthen on the top, you had the fluid, the plasma from your\n4:11\nblood, kind of the watery part.\n4:13\nSo that's where the name came from, but they have different\n4:15\nroles, but they interact with each other.\n4:17\nNow lymphocytes can be divided into B lymphocytes, usually\n4:24\nreferred to as B cells-- and T lymphocytes.\n4:36\nAnd the B and T just come from where they're developed.\n4:39\nB lymphocytes were first recognized in\n4:42\nthe bursa of Fabricius.\n4:44\nThat's why it's called B.\n4:45\nThat's actually a part of birds that participate in the\n4:48\nimmune system.\n4:49\nAnd so the B came from bursa, but B also applies to the\n4:52\nhuman immune system because it's produced in bone marrow.\n4:56\nSo that might be an easier way to remember.\n4:58\nIt's produced in bone marrow.\n5:01\nIt's developed in bone marrow, but historically, the B came\n5:08\nfrom the bursa of Fabricius, just in case you want to know.\n5:11\nBut it's easy to remember.\n5:12\nThe B could also stand for bone marrow because that's\n5:14\nwhere it's produced.\n5:16\nT lymphocytes actually do start off in the bone marrow,\n5:18\nbut they mature and become what they are in the thymus.\n5:22\nSo that's where the T comes from.\n5:26\nNow in this video, I'm going to focus just on the B\n5:29\nlymphocytes-- because frankly, if I focused on everything, it\n5:31\nwould be an hour-long video.\n5:32\nBut the B lymphocytes frankly on some level-- well, I don't\n5:36\nwant to pick and choose favorites, but something in my\n5:39\nbrain-- I just really like the B lymphocytes.\n5:41\nSo the B lymphocytes participate in what's called\n5:44\nthe humoral response.\n5:49\nAnd I'll tell you what humoral means in a second.\n5:58\nYou'll see that T lymphocytes participate in what's called\n6:00\nthe cell mediated response and we're going to do that in a\n6:02\nfuture video.\n6:07\nThey actually do certain classes of T lymphocytes.\n6:10\nWe'll see that there are helper T cells and there are\n6:15\ncytotoxic T cells.\n6:16\nI know it's all very confusing the first time you see it, but\n6:19\nthat's why I just want to focus on just\n6:21\nthis part right here.\n6:22\nWe're going to see in the future that the helper T cells\n6:25\nplay a role in amplifying and really activating\n6:28\nthis humoral response.\n6:30\nBut a simple way to think about the difference between\n6:33\nthe humoral response and the cell mediated response is,\n6:36\nwhen I get infected-- let's say I get\n6:38\ninfected by a virus, right?\n6:45\nAt first, when a virus comes into my system, it's just\n6:48\nfloating around in the fluids in my system.\n6:51\nThe fluids of our system-- that's really what humoral\n6:54\nresponds to, into the humoral fluids of your body.\n6:59\nSo you have your viruses.\n7:05\nThese are little viruses floating around.\n7:08\nSo while they're floating around and they're not sitting\n7:11\ninside of cells, that's where the humoral response\n7:17\ncan come into play.\n7:18\nSame thing if we have little bacteria floating around and\n7:22\nthey haven't infiltrated cells yet.\n7:23\nThey're just floating around in the fluid, then the humoral\n7:27\nresponse can be useful for that.\n7:31\nNow if all of a sudden, these guys have infiltrated cells--\n7:37\nso if the cells are now infected with the virus and\n7:40\nthey're producing the viruses using the mechanisms of the\n7:43\ncell to produce more, then all of a sudden we have to be a\n7:46\nlittle bit more sophisticated in how we deal with these\n7:49\ncells and how we deal with the viruses because they're not\n7:52\njust going to be floating around anymore.\n7:53\nWe probably want to just kill this cell even though it was\n7:56\none of our own, but now it's helping to make viruses.\n7:59\nOr maybe it's been colonized by bacteria.\n8:02\nSo in either case, you want to kill this.\n8:03\nAnd we'll talk more about that in the cell mediating.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn this video, I want to cover several topics\n0:02\nthat are all related.\n0:03\nAnd on some level, they're really simple, but on a whole\n0:05\nother level, they tend to confuse people a lot.\n0:07\nSo hopefully we can make some headway.\n0:10\nSo a good place to start-- let's just imagine that I have\n0:12\nsome type of container here.\n0:15\nLet's say that's my container and inside of that container,\n0:18\nI have a bunch of water molecules.\n0:21\nIt's just got a bunch of water molecules.\n0:24\nThey're all rubbing against each other.\n0:25\nIt's in its liquid form, this is liquid water.\n0:27\nand inside of the water molecules, I\n0:30\nhave some sugar molecules.\n0:33\nMaybe I'll do sugar in this pink color.\n0:35\nSo I have a bunch of sugar molecules right here.\n0:40\nI have many, many more water molecules though.\n0:43\nI want to make that clear.\n0:49\nNow in this type of situation, we call the thing that there's\n0:55\nmore of, the solvent.\n1:00\nSo in this case, there's more water molecules and you can\n1:03\nliterally just view more as the number of molecules.\n1:07\nI'm not going to go into a whole discussion of moles and\n1:10\nall of that because you may or may not have been exposed to\n1:13\nthat yet, but just imagine whatever there's more of,\n1:15\nthat's what we're going to call the solvent.\n1:17\nSo in this case, water is the solvent.\n1:24\nAnd whatever there is less of-- in this case, that is the\n1:30\nsugar-- that is considered the solute.\n1:36\nIt doesn't have to be sugar.\n1:37\nIt can be any molecule that there's less of, in the water,\n1:40\nin this case.\n1:45\nAnd we say that the sugar has been dissolved into the water.\n2:03\nAnd this whole thing right here, the combination of the\n2:06\nwater and the sugar molecules, we call a solution.\n2:10\nWe call this whole thing a solution.\n2:14\nAnd a solution has the solvent and the solute.\n2:16\nThe solvent is water.\n2:18\nThat's the thing doing the dissolving and the thing that\n2:21\nis dissolved is the sugar.\n2:23\nThat's the solute.\n2:24\nNow all of this may or may not be review for you, but I'm\n2:27\ndoing it for a reason-- because I want to talk about\n2:32\nthe idea of a diffusion.\n2:39\nAnd the idea is actually pretty straightforward.\n2:43\nIf I have, let's say, the same container.\n2:46\nLet me do it in a slightly different container here, just\n2:49\nto talk about diffusion.\n2:50\nWe'll go back to water and sugar--\n2:52\nespecially back to water.\n2:54\nLet's say we have a container here and let's say it just has\n2:58\na bunch of-- let's say it just has some air particles in it.\n3:00\nIt could be anything-- oxygen or carbon dioxide.\n3:03\nSo let me just draw a couple of air molecules here.\n3:07\nSo let's say that that is a gaseous-- just for the sake of\n3:11\nargument-- gaseous oxygen.\n3:12\nSo each of this is an O2-- each of those, right?\n3:14\nAnd let's say that this is the current configuration, that\n3:16\nall of this is a vacuum here and that there's some\n3:19\ntemperatures.\n3:20\nSo these water molecules, they have some\n3:22\ntype of kinetic energy.\n3:25\nThey're moving in some type of random directions right there.\n3:29\nSo my question is, what is going to happen in this type\n3:34\nof container?\n3:35\nWell, any of these guys are going to be randomly bumping\n3:38\ninto each other.\n3:39\nThey're more likely to bump into things in this down-left\n3:43\ndirection than they are in the up-right direction.\n3:45\nSo if this guy was happening to go in this down-left\n3:47\ndirection, he's going to bump into something and then\n3:50\nricochet into the up-right direction.\n3:52\nBut in the up-right direction, there's\n3:53\nnothing to bounce into.\n3:55\nSo in general, everything is moving in random directions,\n3:57\nbut you're more likely to be able to move in\n4:00\nthe rightward direction.\n4:01\nWhen you go to the left, you're more likely to bump\n4:02\ninto something.\n4:04\nSo it's almost common sense.\n4:06\nOver time, if you just let this system come to some type\n4:09\nof equilibrium-- I'm not going to go into detail\n4:11\non what that means.\n4:12\nYou can watch the thermodynamics videos if you'd\n4:14\nlike to see that.\n4:15\nYou'll eventually see the container will look\n4:18\nsomething like this.\n4:19\nI can't guarantee it.\n4:20\nThere's some probability it would actually stay like this,\n4:22\nbut very likely that those five particles are going to\n4:25\nget relatively spread out.\n4:27\nThis is diffusion and so it's really just the spreading of\n4:32\nparticles or molecules from high concentration to low\n4:36\nconcentration areas, right?\n4:39\nIn this case, the molecules are going to spread in that\n4:41\ndirection from a high concentration to a low\n4:43\nconcentration area.\n4:45\nNow you're saying, Sal, what is concentration?\n4:47\nAnd there's many ways to measure concentration and you\n4:51\ncan go into molarity and molality and all of that.\n4:54\nBut the very simple idea is, how much of that particle do\n4:57\nyou have per unit space?\n4:59\nSo here, you have a lot of those particles per unit space\n5:02\nand here you have very few of those\n5:04\nparticles per unit space.\n5:05\nSo this is a high concentration and that's a low\n5:09\nconcentration.\n5:09\nSo you could imagine other experiments like this.\n5:12\nYou could imagine a solution like-- let's do\n5:17\nsomething like this.\n5:21\nLet's say I have two containers.\n5:25\nLet's go back to the solution situation.\n5:27\nThis was a gas, but I started off with that example so let's\n5:29\nstay with that example.\n5:31\nSo let's say that I have a door right there that's larger\n5:35\nthan either the water or the sugar molecules.\n5:38\nOn either side, I have a bunch of water molecules.\n5:52\nSo I have a lot of water molecules.\n5:53\nSo if I just had water molecules here-- they're all\n5:55\nbouncing around in random directions-- and so the odds\n5:58\nof a water molecule going this way, equivalent to odds of a\n6:01\nwater molecule going that way, assuming that both sides have\n6:04\nthe same level of water molecule, otherwise the\n6:06\npressures would be different.\n6:07\nBut let's say that the top of this is the same\n6:10\nas the top of this.\n6:11\nSo there's no more pressure going in one\n6:12\ndirection or another.\n6:13\nSo if for whatever reason, a bunch more water molecules\n6:17\nwere going in the rightward direction, then all of a\n6:18\nsudden this would fill up with more water and we know that\n6:20\nthat isn't likely to occur.\n6:22\nSo this is just two containers of water.\n6:28\nNow let's put some solute in it.\n6:30\nLet's dissolve some solute in it and let's say we do all the\n6:33\ndissolving on the left-hand side.\n6:35\nSo we put some sugar molecules on the left-hand side.\n6:40\nAnd these are small enough to fit through this little pipe.\n6:42\nThat's one assumption that I'm making.\n6:44\nSo what's going to happen?\n6:45\nAll of these things have some type of kinetic energy.\n6:47\nThey're all bouncing around.\n6:52\nWell, over time, the water's going back and forth.\n6:56\nThis water molecule might go that way.\n6:57\nThat water molecule might go that way, but they net each\n7:00\nother out, but over time one of these big sugar molecules\n7:03\nwill be going in just the right direction to go\n7:06\nthrough-- maybe this guy's, instead of going that\n7:08\ndirection, he starts off going in that direction.\n7:10\nHe goes just through this tunnel connecting the two\n7:15\ncontainers and he'll end up there, right?\n7:18\nAnd this guy will still be bouncing around.\n7:20\nThere's some probability he goes back, but there's still\n7:23\nmore sugar particles here than there.\n7:25\nSo there's still more probability that one of these\n7:31\nguys will go to that side than one of these guys\n7:33\nwill go to that side.\n7:34\nSo you can imagine if you're doing this with gazillions of\n7:36\nparticles-- I'm only doing it with four-- over time, the\n7:40\nparticles will have spread out so that their concentrations\n7:43\nare roughly equal.\n7:44\nSo that maybe you'll have two here over time.\n7:46\nBut when you're only dealing with three or four or five\n7:49\nparticles, there's some probability it doesn't happen,\n7:51\nbut when you're doing it with a gazillion and they're super\n7:53\nsmall, it's a very, very, very high likelihood.\n7:56\nBut anyway, this whole process-- we went from a\n7:59\ncontainer of high concentration to a container\n8:02\nof low concentration and the particles would have spread\n8:06\nfrom the low concentration container to the high\n8:08\nconcentration container.\n8:09\nSo they diffused.\n8:11\nThis is diffusion.\n8:16\nAnd just so that we learn some other words that tend to be\n8:18\nused with the idea of diffusion-- when we started\n8:21\noff, this had a higher concentration.\n8:24\nThe left-hand side container had higher concentration.\n8:33\nIt's all relative, right?\n8:34\nIt's higher than this guy.\n8:37\nAnd this right here had a lower concentration.\n8:42\nAnd there are words for these things.\n8:44\nThis solution with a high concentration is called a\n8:47\nhypertonic solution.\n8:50\nLet me write that in yellow.\n8:58\nHyper, in general, meaning having a lot of something,\n9:01\nhaving too much of something.\n9:02\nAnd this lower concentration is hypotonic.\n9:13\nYou might have heard maybe one of your relatives, if they\n9:16\nhaven't had a meal in awhile say, I'm hypoglycemic.\n9:20\nThat means that they have not-- they're feeling\n9:22\nlightheaded.\n9:22\nThere's not enough sugar in their bloodstream and they\n9:24\nwant to pass out so they want a meal.\n9:26\nIf you just had a candy bar, maybe you're hyperglycemic--\n9:29\nor maybe you're just hyper in general.\n9:32\nSo these are just good prefixes to know, but\n9:35\nhypertonic-- you have a lot of the solute.\n9:38\nYou have a high concentration.\n9:40\nAnd then in hypotonic, not too much of the solute so you have\n9:44\na low concentration.\n9:46\nThese are good words to know.\n9:47\nSo in general, diffusion-- if there's no barriers to the\n9:51\ndiffusion like we had here, you will have the solute go\n9:54\nfrom a high concentration or hypertonic solution if they\n9:58\ncan travel to a hypotonic solution, to a hypo, where the\n10:03\nconcentration is lower.\n10:05\nNow let's do an interesting experiment here.\n10:08\nWe've talked about diffusion and so far we've been talking\n10:10\nabout the diffusion of the solute, right?\n10:14\nAnd in general-- and this is not always the case-- if you\n10:17\nwant to be as general as possible, the solute is\n10:19\nwhatever you have less of, the solvent is whatever\n10:22\nyou have more of.\n10:23\nAnd the most common solvent tends to be water, but it\n10:26\ndoesn't have to be water.\n10:27\nIt could be some type of alcohol.\n10:28\nIt could be mercury.\n10:31\nIt could be a whole set of molecules, but water in most\n10:34\nbiological or chemical systems tends to be the\n10:38\nmost typical solvent.\n10:39\nIt's what other things are dissolved into.\n10:41\nBut what happens if we have a tunnel where the solute is too\n10:46\nbig to travel, but water is small enough to travel?\n10:51\nLet's think about that situation.\n10:55\nIn order to think about it, I'm going to do something\n10:57\ninteresting.\n10:58\nLet's say we have a container here.\n11:02\nActually, I won't even draw a container.\n11:03\nLet's just say we have an outside environment that has a\n11:07\nbunch of water.\n11:09\nThis is the outside environment and then you have\n11:12\nsome type of membrane.\n11:19\nWater can go in and out of this membrane.\n11:22\nSo it's semi-permeable.\n11:23\nWell, it's permeable to water, but the solute cannot go\n11:26\nthrough the membrane.\n11:27\nSo let's say that the solute is sugar.\n11:28\nSo we have water on the outside and\n11:33\nalso inside the membrane.\n11:36\nSo these are little small water molecules.\n11:39\nThis is a membrane right here.\n11:43\nAnd let's say that we have some sugar molecules again--\n11:46\nI'm just picking on sugar.\n11:47\nIt could have been anything.\n11:48\nSo we have some sugar molecules here that are just a\n11:51\nlittle bit bigger-- or they could be a lot bigger.\n11:55\nActually, they're a lot bigger than water molecules.\n11:57\nYou have a bunch of-- and I only draw four, but you have a\n11:59\ngazillion of them, right?\n12:01\nYou have that much more water molecules.\n12:03\nI'm just trying to show you have more water molecules than\n12:05\nsugar molecules.\n12:06\nAnd this membrane is semi-permeable.\n12:13\nPermeable means it allows things to pass.\n12:15\nSemi-permeables means it's not completely permeable.\n12:18\nSo semi-permeable-- in this context, I'm saying I allow\n12:20\nwater to pass through the membrane.\n12:22\nSo water can pass, but sugar cannot.\n12:28\nSugar is too large.\n12:35\nSo if we were to zoom in on the actual membrane itself--\n12:39\nmaybe the membrane looks like this.\n12:40\nI'm going to zoom in on this membrane.\n12:44\nSo it has little holes in the membrane, just like that.\n12:48\nAnd maybe the water molecules are about that size.\n12:51\nSo they can go through those holes.\n12:53\nSo the water molecules can go back and forth through the\n12:56\nholes, but the sugar molecules are about that big.\n13:01\nSo they cannot go through that hole.\n13:04\nThey're too big for this opening right here to go back\n13:07\nand forth between them.\n13:08\nNow what do you think is going to happen in this situation?\n13:12\nSo first of all, let's use our terminology.\n13:14\nRemember, sugar is our solute.\n13:15\nWater is our solvent.\n13:17\nSemi-permeable membrane.\n13:18\nWhich side of the membrane has a higher or lower\n13:21\nconcentration of solute?\n13:24\nWell, the inside does.\n13:25\nThe inside is hypertonic.\n13:32\nThe outside has a lower\n13:33\nconcentration so it's hypotonic.\n13:44\nNow, if these openings were big enough, based on what we\n13:47\njust talked about-- these guys are bouncing around, water is\n13:51\ntravelling in either direction, and equal\n13:53\nprobability or-- actually I'm going to talk\n13:56\nabout that in a second.\n13:58\nIf everything was wide open, it would be equal probability,\n14:01\nbut if it was wide open, these guys eventually would bounce\n14:03\ntheir ways over to this side and you'd probably end up with\n14:06\nequal concentrations eventually.\n14:08\nAnd so you would have your traditional diffusion, where\n14:10\nhigh concentration of solute to low\n14:13\nconcentrations of solute.\n14:14\nBut in this case, these guys-- they can't\n14:17\nfit through the hole.\n14:18\nOnly water can go back and forth.\n14:20\nIf these guys were not here, water would have an equal\n14:25\nlikelihood of going in this direction as they would be\n14:28\ngoing in that direction, a completely equal likelihood.\n14:33\nBut because these guys are on the right-hand side of-- or in\n14:40\nthis case, on the inside of our membrane.\n14:42\nThis is our inside of our membrane zoomed up-- it's less\n14:47\nlikely because these guys might be in the approach\n14:50\nposition of the holes-- that's slightly less likely for water\n14:55\nto be in the approach position for the holes so it's actually\n14:58\nmore probable that water could enter than water exit.\n15:02\nAnd I want to make that very clear.\n15:04\nIf these sugar molecules were not here, obviously it's\n15:07\nequally likely for water to go in either direction.\n15:09\nNow that these sugar molecules are there, these sugar\n15:12\nmolecules might be on the right-hand side.\n15:15\nThey might be blocking-- I guess the best way to think\n15:18\nabout it is blocking the approach to the hole.\n15:20\nThey'll never be able to go through the hole themselves\n15:22\nand might not even be blocking the hole, but they're going in\n15:24\nsome random direction.\n15:25\nSo if a water molecule was approaching-- it's all\n15:29\nprobabilistic and we're dealing with gazillions of\n15:31\nmolecules-- it's that much more likely to be blocked to\n15:34\nget outside.\n15:35\nBut the water molecules from the outside-- there's nothing\n15:37\nblocking them to get in so you're going to have a flow of\n15:40\nwater inside.\n15:41\nSo in this situation, with a semi-permeable membrane,\n15:44\nyou're going to have water.\n15:45\nYou're going to have a net inward flow of water.\n15:49\nAnd so this is kind of interesting.\n15:51\nWe have the solvent flowing from a hypotonic situation to\n15:56\na hypertonic solution, but it's only\n15:59\nhypotonic in the solute.\n16:07\nBut water-- if you flip it the other way-- if you've used\n16:11\nsugar as the solvent, then you could say, we're going from a\n16:15\nhigh concentration of water to a low concentration of water.\n16:19\nI don't want to confuse you too much.\n16:20\nThis is what tends to confuse people, but just think about\n16:23\nwhat's going to happen.\n16:24\nNo matter in what situation, the solution is going to do\n16:27\nwhat it can to try to equilibriate the\n16:30\nconcentration.\n16:30\nTo make the concentrations on both\n16:32\nsides as close as possible.\n16:33\nAnd it's not just some magic.\n16:35\nIt's not like the solution knows.\n16:36\nIt's all based on probabilities and these things\n16:38\nbumping around, but in this situation, water is more\n16:41\nlikely to flow into the container.\n16:43\nSo it's actually going to go from the hypotonic side when\n16:46\nwe talk about low concentration of solute to the\n16:50\nside that has high concentrations of solute, of\n16:53\nsugar-- and actually, if this thing is stretchable, more\n16:57\nwater will keep flowing in and this membrane\n17:01\nwill stretch out.\n17:04\nI won't go to too much detail here, but this idea of water--\n17:08\nof the solvent-- if in this case, water is the solvent--\n17:12\nof water as a solvent diffusing through a\n17:15\nsemi-permeable membrane, this is called osmosis.\n17:22\nYou've probably heard learning by osmosis-- if you put a book\n17:25\nagainst your head, maybe it'll just seep into your brain.\n17:27\nSame idea.\n17:28\nThat's where the word comes from.\n17:29\nThis idea of water seeping through membranes to try to\n17:33\nmake concentrations more equal.\n17:35\nSo if you say, well, I have high concentration here, low\n17:38\nconcentration here.\n17:39\nIf there was no membrane here, these big molecules would\n17:43\nexit, but because there's this semi-permeable membrane here,\n17:48\nthey can't.\n17:48\nSo the system just probabilistically-- no magic\n17:52\nhere-- more water will enter to try to equilibriate\n17:56\nconcentration.\n17:57\nEventually-- if maybe there's a few molecules out here-- not\n18:01\nas high concentration here-- eventually if everything was\n18:06\nallowed to happen fully, you'll get to the point where\n18:08\nyou have just as many-- you have just as high\n18:11\nconcentration on this side as you have on the right-hand\n18:13\nside because this right-hand side is going to fill with\n18:16\nwater and also probably become a larger volume.\n18:19\nAnd then, once again, the probabilities of a water\n18:21\nmolecule going to the right and to the left will be the\n18:23\nsame and you'll get to some type of equilibrium.\n18:25\nBut I want to make it very clear-- diffusion is the idea\n18:29\nof any particle going from higher concentration and\n18:33\nspreading into a region that has a lower concentration and\n18:35\njust spreading out.\n18:36\nOsmosis is the diffusion of water.\n18:41\nAnd usually you're talking about the diffusion of water\n18:44\nas a solvent and usually it's in the context of a\n18:47\nsemi-permeable membrane, where the actual solute cannot\n18:51\ntravel through the membrane.\n18:53\nAnyway, hopefully you've found that useful and\n18:55\nnot completely confusing.",

Pizza!\"\n1:20\nThen, it can respond by sending back information\n1:22\nthrough different nerve pathways that say,\n1:24\n\"You should eat more of that pizza.\"\n1:27\nDespite what my brain is telling me,\n1:28\nI'm going to try to not eat any more of that pizza.\n1:31\nYou wouldn't think that it's terribly complicated\n1:32\nto know that pizza tastes good, and to tell someone\n1:34\nto eat more pizza, but it turns out\n1:37\nthat our brains and our nervous systems are crazy complicated.\n1:40\nYour nervous system, basically, has a big ol' bureaucracy\n1:42\nof neurons and it's divided into two main departments -\n1:47\nthe central nervous system, and the peripheral nervous system.\n1:50\nCentral and peripheral.\n1:52\nThe central nervous system, basically your brain and your spinal cord,\n1:54\nis responsible for analyzing and interpreting\n1:56\nall of those data that your peripheral nervous system -\n1:59\nall of the nerves outside of your brain and spine -\n2:02\ncollects and sends its way.\n2:03\nOnce the central nervous system makes a decision about data,\n2:06\nit sends a signal back through to the peripheral nervous system,\n2:09\nsaying, \"Do this thing,\"\n2:11\nwhich the peripheral nervous system then does.\n2:14\nBoth of these systems contain two different types of neurons -\n2:17\nafferent and efferent.\n2:20\nAfferent and efferent are biological terms,\n2:22\nand they're horribly confusing,\n2:24\nand I apologize on behalf of the entire institution\n2:26\nof biology for them.\n2:28\nAfferent systems carry things to a central point,\n2:30\nand efferent systems carry things away from a central point.\n2:33\nSo, afferent neurons carry information\n2:36\nto the brain and spinal cord for analysis.\n2:39\nIn the peripheral nervous system,\n2:40\nafferent neurons are called sensory neurons,\n2:42\nand they're activated by external stimuli,\n2:44\nlike the complex and glorious flavor of pizza,\n2:47\nand then they convert those data into a signal\n2:49\nfor the central nervous system to process.\n2:50\nThe central nervous system has afferent neurons, too,\n2:53\nand there, they bring information\n2:55\ninto special parts of the brain,\n2:57\nlike the part of the brain that goes, \"Hmmm, salty.\"\n2:58\nthat goes, \"Mmmm, salt.\"\n3:00\nThe efferent neurons carry information\n3:01\nout of the center.\n3:03\nIn the peripheral nervous system,\n3:04\nthey're called motor neurons,\n3:06\nbecause many of them carry information\n3:08\nfrom the brain and spinal cord to muscles\n3:09\nto make us move, but they also go\n3:11\nto pretty much every other organ in your body,\n3:13\nthus making them work and do stuff to keep you alive.\n3:16\nIn the central system, efferent neurons carry information\n3:19\nfrom special parts of the brain\n3:20\nto other parts of the brain or spinal cord.\n3:23\nOf course, if it ended there, it would be way too simple,\n3:25\nand no good bureaucracy has just two departments.\n3:27\nSo, the peripheral nervous system is actually made up\n3:30\nof two different systems, with two very different jobs,\n3:32\nthe somatic nervous system\n3:34\nand the autonomic nervous system.\n3:36\nThe somatic system controls all the stuff\n3:38\nyou think about doing, like all the information coming\n3:40\nthrough your senses, and the movement\n3:42\nof your body that it makes\n3:44\nwhen you want it to make movements.\n3:45\nBut here's something interesting.\n3:46\nSince we're totally in love with our brains\n3:48\nas sort of the center of all being of ourselves,\n3:50\nwe think that all the information\n3:52\nabout everything going on in our bodies goes\n3:55\nto our brain for some kind of decision.\n3:57\nNot so!\n3:57\nSometimes, like when we touch a hot stove,\n3:59\nthe afferent neurons carry the signal, \"Hot!\"\n4:02\nto the central nervous system,\n4:03\nbut that information doesn't even ever get to the brain.\n4:06\nThe spinal cord actually makes that decision\n4:08\nbefore it gets to the brain.\n4:09\nIt sends a message directly back to the muscle,\n4:11\nsaying, \"Get your hand off the friggin' stove!\"\n4:13\n(bleeping noise)\n4:14\nYoung man: This bit of fancy nerve work lets the\n4:15\nspinal cord make decisions, rather than the brain,\n4:17\nand it's called the reflex loop.\n4:19\nSo, the other branch of the peripheral nervous system,\n4:21\nthe autonomic system, carries signals\n4:23\nfrom the central nervous system\n4:25\nthat drive all of the things that your body does\n4:27\nwithout thinking about them -\n4:28\nyour heart beat, your digesion,\n4:30\nbreathing, saliva production,\n4:32\nall of your organ functions.\n4:33\nBut, we're not done yet here.\n4:34\nWe need to go deeper.\n4:36\nThe autonomic nervous system has two divisions of its own,\n4:38\nthe sympathetic and the parasympathetic.\n4:40\nThe jobs that these two perform aren't just different.\n4:43\nThey're completely opposite and, frankly,\n4:45\nthey're always vying for control of the body\n4:48\nin some kind of nervous system cage match.\n4:50\nThe sympathetic division is responsible\n4:53\nfor, like, freakin' out.\n4:55\nYou probably heard this talked about\n4:56\nas the fight-or-flight response -\n4:58\nin other words, stress.\n5:00\nBut, stress isn't all bad.\n5:02\nIt's what saves our lives when we're being chased\n5:04\nby saber-tooth tigers, right?\n5:05\nThe sympathetic system prepared our body for action\n5:07\nby increasing the heart rate, and the blood pressure,\n5:10\nenhancing our sense of smell,\n5:12\ndilating the pupils, activating our adrenal cortex\n5:14\nto make adrenaline, shutting down blood supply\n5:17\nto our digestive and reproductive systems\n5:19\nso that there'll be more blood available\n5:21\nfor our lungs and muscles when we have to, like, run!\n5:23\nAnd even though you're not in a constant state of panic -\n5:25\nat least I hope not - I kind of am -\n5:27\nthat system's running all the time every day.\n5:30\nBut, right next to it is the parasympathetic division,\n5:33\nworking hard to make sure we take it nice and easy.\n5:35\nIt dials down the heart rate, and the blood pressure,\n5:38\nconstricts our lungs, makes our nose run,\n5:41\nincreases blood flow to our reproductive junk,\n5:44\nour mouths produce saliva, encourages us to poop and pee.\n5:48\nThat's basically what we have to thank\n5:50\nfor taking a nap sitting in front of the TV,\n5:52\ngoing to the bathroom, and getting it on.\n5:55\nSo, consider yourself lucky you got both\n5:57\nthe stress response and the chill-the-heck-out response\n5:59\nworking side-by-side,\n6:00\nbecause together, they create a balance, or a homeostasis.\n6:04\nNow, That's what the nervous system does.\n6:06\nNext, we have to talk about how it does it.\n6:10\nThe neurons that make up our nervous systems\n6:12\nmake it possible for our bodies to have\n6:14\ntheir very own little electric systems.\n6:15\nTo understand how they work,\n6:17\nyou have to understand their anatomy.\n6:18\nLike I've said before, the typical neuron\n6:20\nhas branches like a tree.\n6:22\nThese are called dendrites,\n6:23\nand they receive information from other neurons.\n6:25\nNeurons also have a single axon,\n6:27\nthe trunk of the tree, which is branched at the end\n6:30\nand sends signals to other neurons.\n6:32\nThe axon is also covered\n6:34\nin a fatty material called myelin,\n6:36\nwhich acts as insulation.\n6:37\nThe myelin sheath isn't continuous.\n6:39\nThere are these little bits of exposed neuron\n6:41\nalong the axon, which have the sweetest names in this whole episode.\n6:44\nThey're called the nodes of Ranvier,\n6:48\nwhich seems like an excellent working title\n6:49\nfor the eighth Harry Potter novel,\n6:51\n\"Harry Potter and the Nodes of Ranvier.\"\n6:53\nAnyway, these nodes allow signals to hop from node to node,\n6:57\nwhich lets the signal travel down a nerve faster.\n6:59\nThis node-hopping, by the way, has a name.\n7:01\nIt's called saltatory condution -\n7:04\nconduction because it's electrical conduction,\n7:06\nand saltatory because saltatory means leaping.\n7:08\nFinally, the place where an axon's branches come\n7:10\nin contact with the next cell dendrite\n7:12\nis called a synapse.\n7:14\nThat's where neurotransmitters pass information\n7:16\nfrom one neuron to the next.\n7:17\nNow, think back to, or just go watch the episode\n7:20\nthat we did on cell membranes,\n7:21\nwhere we talked about how materials travel\n7:23\ndown concetration gradients.\n7:25\nWell, in much the same way, all of the neurons\n7:27\nin your body have a membrane potential,\n7:28\na difference in voltage or electrical charge\n7:31\nbetween the inside and the outside of the membrane.\n7:33\nYou might also remember that this build-up\n7:35\nof voltage is handled in part by a sexy little protein\n7:38\ncalled the sodium-potassium pump.\n7:40\nBasically, the pump creates a voltage differential,\n7:42\nlike charging a battery,\n7:43\nby moving three positively-charged sodium ions out\n7:46\nfor every two potassium ions it lets in,\n7:49\ncreating a net negative charge\n7:51\ninside the cell relative to the outside.\n7:53\nWhen a neuron is inactive,\n7:55\nthis is called its resting potential,\n7:56\nand its voltage is at about negative 70 millivolts.\n7:59\nIn addition to the pumps,\n8:01\nneurons also have ion channels.\n8:02\nThese are proteins that straddle the membranes,\n8:04\nbut they're a lot simpler and don't need ATP to power them.\n8:08\nEach cell can have more than 300 different kinds of ion channels,\n8:11\neach tailored to accept a specific ion.\n8:14\nNow, don't zone out here because all of this stuff\n8:17\nis going to come into play when a neuron becomes active.\n8:20\nThis happens when an input or stimulus creates a change\n8:22\nin the neuron that eventually reaches the axon,\n8:24\ncreating what's called an action potential,\n8:27\na brief event where the electrical potential\n8:29\nof a cell rapidly rises and falls.\n8:30\nWhen an action potential begins - like when a molecule\n8:33\nof sugar touches one of my sweet taste buds -\n8:35\nsome ion channels open and let those\n8:37\npositive sodium ions rush in,\n8:39\nso that the inside starts to become less negative.\n8:41\nWith enough stimulus, the internal [unintelligible]\n8:42\nof the neuron reaches a certain threshhold,\n8:44\nwhich triggers more sodium channels to respond,\n8:46\nand open the floodgates to let even more ions in.\n8:49\nThat's happening on one tiny little area of the neuron,\n8:52\nbut this change in voltage creeps over\n8:54\nto the next bunch of soium channels,\n8:55\nwhich are also sensitive to voltage, and so they open.\n8:59\nThat exchange triggers the next batch,\n9:00\nand the next batch, and so on down the line.\n9:02\nThis signal-changing voltage travels\n9:04\ndown the neuron's membrane like a wave.\n9:06\nBut remember, the myelin sheath insulates most of the neurons,\n9:07\nand just leaves those little nodes exposed.\n9:11\nInstead of being a steady wave, the wave jumps from node to node,\n9:14\nspeeding up the travel time of action potential down a neuron.\n9:18\nThat's your saltatory condution at work.\n9:20\nWhen a wave reaches the end of the neuron,\n9:21\nit triggers a release of neurotransmitters\n9:23\nfrom the neuron through exocytosis.\n9:25\nThose neurotransmitters, then, flow across the synapse\n9:28\nto the next neuron,\n9:29\nwhere they trigger another action potential over there.\n9:32\nBy this time, so many sodium ions have gotten\n9:35\ninside the first neuron that the difference\n9:37\nbetween the outside and the inside is actually reversed.\n9:39\nThe inside is positive, and the outside is negative.\n9:42\nIt seems like neurons hate that more than pretty much anything else,\n9:45\nso it fixes itself.\n9:46\nThe sodium channels close and the potassium channels open up.\n9:49\nThe positive potassium ions rush down\n9:52\nboth the concentration and the electro-chemical gradients,\n9:55\nto get the heck out of the cell.\n9:57\nThat brings the charge inside the cell back\n9:58\ndown to negative on the inside,\n10:00\nand positive on the outside.\n10:01\nNotice, though, that now the sodium is on the inside of the cell,\n10:04\nand the potassium is on the outside,\n10:06\nand in the opposite places of where they started.\n10:08\nThe sodium-potassium pumps get back to work,\n10:10\nburn up some ATP to pump the sodium back out and the potassium back in.\n10:15\nWhew!\n10:16\nThings are now back at the resting potential again.\n10:19\nThat, my friends, is how action potential allows neurons\n10:22\nto communicate signals down a whole chain of neurons,\n10:25\nfrom the outer reaches of the peripheral nervous system,\n10:28\nall the way up the spinal cord, into the brain,\n10:30\nand then back out again.\n10:32\nLet's zoom out, and look at the broad view here.\n10:34\nI'm gonna think about it as pizza.\n10:36\nAll my taste buds have neurons in 'em.\n10:37\nEach of my taste buds contain\n10:39\nbetween 50 to 100 specialized taste-receptor neurons.\n10:42\nChemicals from this beautiful pizza dissolve\n10:44\nin saliva and then stimulate the dendrites on the afferent neuron.\n10:48\nThis generates a bunch of action-potentials\n10:49\nthat travel from the afferent neurons in my tongue,\n10:52\nall the way to my brain, which is like,\n10:54\n\"My goodness!\n10:55\n\"I think that's pizza!\n10:56\n\"Let's have another bite.\"\n10:58\nThe brain then sends messages\n10:59\nthrough the efferent nerve pathways\n11:01\nto do all sorts of things.\n11:02\nOne, chew, which involves constricting the muscles\n11:05\nin my jaw over and over again;\n11:07\ntwo, lower my head down to catch another bite,\n11:10\nwhich involves moving all kinds of neck muscles;\n11:12\nthree, swallowing, which involves constricting\n11:16\nthe muscles in my throat and esophagus;\n11:18\nfour, opening my mouth again to receive another bite.\n11:22\nThat signal is also going to my jaw,\n11:24\nand that's not even to mention\n11:25\nwhat's going to go on with the digestion\n11:27\nof this bad boy, driven by the autonomic nervous system.\n11:30\nDigestion is still a couple of episodes now.\n11:34\nHopefully, there will be more pizza.",

just sunlight and water.\n0:23\nPaula Deen can't do that, and she makes\n0:25\nfried egg bacon doughnut burgers.\n0:32\nI'm telling you, this is surprisingly good.\n0:34\nThis is a different kind of magic, but part of this is plants.\n0:39\nEverything in it, in fact everything that is in this [McDonalds],\n0:42\nin fact, everything you have ever eaten in your life\n0:44\nis either made from plants or made from something that ate plants.\n0:47\nSo let's talk about plants.\n0:49\n(cheerful music)\n0:58\nPlants probably evolved more than 500 million years ago.\n1:01\nThe earliest land plant fossils date back\n1:03\nto more than 400 million years ago.\n1:05\nThese plants were lycophytes,\n1:06\nwhich are still around today and which reproduce\n1:09\nthrough making a bunch of spores, shedding them,\n1:11\nsaying a couple of Hail Marys, and hoping for the best.\n1:14\nSome of these lycophytes went on to evolve\n1:15\ninto scale trees, which are now extinct, but huge,\n1:18\nswampy forests of them used to cover the earth.\n1:21\nSome people call these scale tree forests coal forest\n1:23\nbecause there were so many of them,\n1:25\nthey were so dense and they covered the whole earth,\n1:26\nthat they eventually fossilized into giant seams of coal,\n1:30\nwhich are very important to our lifestyles today.\n1:32\nThis is now called the Carboniferous Period.\n1:34\nSee what we did there?\n1:35\nBecause coal is made of carbon, so they named\n1:37\nthe epoch of geological history over how face-meltingly\n1:40\nintense and productive these forests were.\n1:42\nI would give my left eyeball,\n1:46\nthree fingers on my left hand, the middle ones so that\n1:50\nI could hang loose, and my pinky toe,\n1:54\nif I were able to go back and see these scale forests,\n1:56\nbecause they would be freaking awesome.\n1:58\nAnyway, angiosperms, or plants that used flowers\n2:01\nto reproduce, didn't develop until the end of\n2:03\nthe Cretaceous Period, about 65 million years ago,\n2:06\njust as the dinosaurs were dying out.\n2:08\nWhich makes you wonder if, in fact,\n2:10\nthe first angiosperms assassinated all the dinosaurs.\n2:13\nI'm not saying that's definitely what happened.\n2:15\nI'm just, it's a little bit suspicious.\n2:16\nAnyway, on a cellular level, plant and animal cells\n2:19\nare actually pretty similar.\n2:21\nThey're called eukaryotic cells, which means they have\n2:24\na good kernel, and that kernel is the nucleus.\n2:27\nNot \"nuculus\".\n2:30\nThe nucleus can be found in all sorts of cells:\n2:32\nanimal cells, plant cells, algae cells.\n2:34\nBasically, all the popular kids.\n2:36\nEukaryotic cells are way more advanced than prokaryotic cells.\n2:40\nWe have the eukaryotic cell and we have the prokaryotic cell.\n2:43\nProkaryotic basically means before the kernel, pro-kernel.\n2:48\nThen we have the eukaryotic, which means good kernel.\n2:50\nThe prokaryotes include your bacteria and your archea,\n2:53\nwhich you've probably met before in your lifetime.\n2:56\nEvery time you've had strep throat, for example.\n2:58\nOr if you've ever been in a hot spring,\n2:59\nor an oil well or something, they're everywhere:\n3:02\nthey cover the planet; they cover you.\n3:05\nLike I said, eukaryotes have that separately enclosed nucleus,\n3:08\nthat is, that all-important nucleus that contains its DNA\n3:12\nand is enclosed by a separate membrane,\n3:14\nbecause a eukaryotic cell is a busy place.\n3:15\nThere's chemical reactions going on in all different parts of the cell.\n3:18\nIt's important to keep those places divided up.\n3:21\nEukaryotic cells also have these little stuff-doing\n3:23\nfactories called organelles, because we decided that\n3:25\nwe'd name everything something weird.\n3:27\nBut organelles, and they're suspended in cytoplasm,\n3:30\ncontinuing with the really esoteric terminology\n3:33\nthat you're going to have to know.\n3:34\nCytoplasm is mostly just water, but it's some other stuff, too.\n3:36\nWell, basically, if you want to know about\n3:38\nthe structure of the eukaryotic cell,\n3:40\nyou should watch my video on animal cells,\n3:42\nwhich let's just link to it right here.\n3:45\nPlant and animal cells are very similar environments.\n3:47\nThey control themselves in very similar ways.\n3:50\nBut obviously plants and animals are very different things,\n3:53\nso what are the differences in a plant cell\n3:55\nthat makes it so different from an animal?\n3:59\nThat's what we're going to go over now.\n4:00\nFirst, plants are thought to have evolved from green algae,\n4:03\nwhich evolved from some more primitive prokaryotes.\n4:05\nSomething plants inherited from their ancestors was a rigid\n4:08\ncell wall surrounding the plasma membrane of each cell.\n4:11\nThis cell wall of plants is mainly made out of cellulose\n4:13\nand lignin, which are two really tough compounds.\n4:16\nCellulose is by far the most common and\n4:19\neasy to find complex carbohydrate in nature,\n4:21\nthough if you were to include simple carbohydrates\n4:23\nas well, glucose would win that one.\n4:25\nThis is because, fascinating fact, cellulose is in fact\n4:29\njust a chain of glucose molecules.\n4:30\nYou're welcome.\n4:31\nIf you want to jog your memory about\n4:33\ncarbohydrates and other organic molecules,\n4:34\nyou can watch this episode right here.\n4:37\nAnyway, as it happens, you know who\n4:38\nneeds carbohydrates to live?\n4:40\nAnimals.\n4:41\nBut you know what's a real pain in the ass to digest?\n4:43\nCellulose.\n4:44\nPlants weren't born yesterday.\n4:45\nCellulose is a far more complex structure\n4:47\nthan you'll generally find in a prokaryotic cell,\n4:50\nand it's also one of the main things that\n4:51\ndifferentiates a plant cell from an animal cell.\n4:54\nAnimals do not have this rigid cell wall.\n4:56\nThey have a flexible membrane that frees them up to\n4:58\nmove around and eat plants and stuff.\n4:59\nHowever, the cell wall gives structure\n5:01\nto a plant's leaves, roots and stems,\n5:04\nand also protects it, to a degree.\n5:06\nWhich is why trees aren't squishy,\n5:07\nand they don't giggle when you poke them.\n5:10\nThe combination of lignin and cellulose\n5:11\nis what makes trees, for example,\n5:13\nable to grow really, really freaking tall.\n5:15\nBoth of these compounds are extremely strong\n5:18\nand resistant to deterioration.\n5:19\nWhen we eat food, lignin and cellulose\n5:22\nis what we call roughage because we can't digest it.\n5:25\nIt's still useful for us on certain aspects\n5:29\nof our digestive system, but it's not nutritious.\n5:32\nWhich is why eating a stick\n5:33\nis really unappetizing and like your shirt.\n5:37\nThis is a 100% plant shirt, but it doesn't taste good.\n5:41\nWe can't go around eating wood like a beaver,\n5:43\nor grass like a cow, because our digestive systems\n5:46\njust aren't set up for that.\n5:48\nA lot of other animals that don't have access\n5:49\nto delicious donut burgers have either\n5:52\ndeveloped gigantic stomachs, like sloths,\n5:54\nor multipe stomachs, like goats,\n5:56\nin order to make a living eating cellulose.\n5:58\nThese animals have a kind of bacteria in their stomachs\n5:59\nthat actually does the digestion of the cellulose for it.\n6:02\nIt breaks the cellulose into individual\n6:04\nglucose molecules which can then be used for food.\n6:07\nOther animals, like humans, mostly carnivores,\n6:09\ndon't have any of that kind of bacteria,\n6:11\nwhich is why it's so difficult for us to digest sticks.\n6:14\nBut there is another reason why cellulose and lignin\n6:17\nare very, very useful to us as humans.\n6:20\nIt burns, my friends.\n6:23\nThis is basically what would happen in our stomachs.\n6:25\nIt's oxidizing.\n6:26\nIt's producing the energy that we would get out of it if\n6:28\nwe were able to, except it's doing it very, very quickly.\n6:31\nThis is the kind of energy,\n6:33\nlike this energy that's coming out of it right now,\n6:35\nis the energy that would be useful to us if we were cows.\n6:39\nBut we're not, so instead, we just use it\n6:42\nto keep ourselves warm on the cold winter nights.\n6:46\n(blows air)\n6:47\nOw; it's on me; ow.\n6:50\nAnyway, while we animals are walking around,\n6:52\nspending our lives searching for ever more digestable\n6:55\nplant materials, plants don't have to do any of that.\n6:58\nThey just sit there and they make their own food.\n7:00\nWe know how they do that.\n7:01\nThey do it with photosynthesis.\n7:03\nAnother thing that plant cells have\n7:05\nthat animal cells just don't have are plastids,\n7:08\nthe organelles that plants use to\n7:10\nmake and store compounds that they need.\n7:12\nYou want to know something super interesting about plastids?\n7:14\nThey and their fellow organelles, the mitochondria,\n7:16\nthat generate energy for the cell,\n7:18\nactually started as bacteria that were absorbed\n7:21\ninto plant cells very early in their evolution.\n7:24\nLike maybe some [produ-select] cell absorbed a bacteria\n7:27\nand it found that instead of just digesting that bacteria\n7:29\nfor the energy that it had, it could use that bacteria.\n7:32\nThat bacteria could create energy for the cell\n7:34\nor convert light into lovely glucose compounds,\n7:37\nwhich is crazy.\n7:39\nNobody's really precisely sure how this happened,\n7:41\nbut they know that it did happen because plastids\n7:43\nand mitochondria have double membranes:\n7:45\none from the original bacteria,\n7:46\nand one from the cell as it wrapped around it.\n7:49\nCool, huh?\n7:50\nAnyway, the most important of the plastids are\n7:52\nthe chloroplasts, which convert light energy\n7:54\nfrom the sun into sugar and into oxygen,\n7:57\nwhich the plant doesn't need, so it just gets rid of it.\n8:00\nAll of the green parts of a plant that you see:\n8:01\nthe leaves, the non-woody stems, the unripened oranges,\n8:05\nare all filled with cells that are filled with chloroplasts,\n8:08\nwhich are making food and oxygen for you.\n8:11\nYou're very welcome, I'm sure.\n8:12\nAnother big difference between plant cell and\n8:15\nan animal cell is the large central vacuole.\n8:18\nPlant cells can push water into vacuoles,\n8:20\nwhich provides turgor pressure from inside the cell,\n8:24\nwhich reinforces the already stiff cellulose wall\n8:26\nand makes the plant rigid,\n8:27\nlike a crunchy piece of celery or something.\n8:30\nUsually, when the soil dries out or the celery stalk\n8:32\nsits in your refrigerator for too long,\n8:34\nthe cells lose some water, turgor pressure drops,\n8:37\nand the plant wilts or gets all floppy.\n8:39\nSo the vacuole is also a kind of storage container for the cell.\n8:41\nIt can contain water, which plants need to save up, just in case,\n8:45\nand also other compounds that the cell might need.\n8:47\nIt can also contain an export stuff that\n8:49\nthe cell doesn't need anymore, like wastes.\n8:51\nSome animal cells also have vacuoles,\n8:53\nbut they aren't as large, and they don't have\n8:56\nthis very important job of giving the animal shape.\n8:58\nNow, let's do this.\n8:59\nLet's just go over the basics of plant cell anatomy.\n9:02\nOne, they have a cell wall that's made out of cellulose,\n9:04\nand so it's really rigid and not messing around.\n9:07\nTwo, they've got a nucleus in its own little baggie\n9:10\nthat's separate from all the other organelles.\n9:12\nThis is basically the headquarters of any eukaryotic cell.\n9:16\nIt stores the genetic information for a plant\n9:18\nand also access the cell's activities director,\n9:20\ntelling it how to grow, when to split,\n9:22\nwhen to jump and how high, that sort of thing.\n9:24\nAnimal cells have this kind of nucleus, too,\n9:26\nbut prokaryotes don't, which is why they're stuck,\n9:29\nhanging around in oil wells and stuff.\n9:30\nThree, they've got plastids, including chloroplasts,\n9:33\nwhich are awesome, green, food-making machines.\n9:36\nFour, they have a central vacuole that stores water and\n9:39\nother stuff, and helps give the cell structural support.\n9:42\nAnd so, stack these cells on top of one another,\n9:46\nlike apartments in an apartment building, and you had a plant.\n9:48\nAll of these unique features are what makes it possible\n9:50\nfor plants to put food on our table and air in our lungs.\n9:54\nSo next time you see a plant,\n9:55\njust go ahead and shake its hand.\n9:57\nThank it for its hard work and its service.",

It could be\n4:21\njust this change in energy over time.\n4:23\nBut we'll learn, especially when we do quantum mechanics,\n4:25\nthat it all gets jumbled up as we start approaching the\n4:29\nscales or the size of an atom.\n4:31\nAnyway, I said this was an incorrect way of doing it.\n4:34\nWhat's the correct way?\n4:37\nSo it turns out-- this is a picture, not a picture really,\n4:40\nthis is also a depiction.\n4:42\nSo it's an interesting question, what I just said.\n4:44\nHow can you have a picture of an atom?\n4:47\nBecause is actually turns out that most wavelengths of\n4:49\nlight, especially the visible wavelengths of light, are much\n4:52\nlarger than the size of an atom.\n4:56\nEverything else we quote-unquote, observe in\n4:58\nlife, it's by reflected light.\n5:00\nBut all of a sudden when you're dealing with an atom,\n5:02\nreflected light you could almost view it as too big, or\n5:06\ntoo blunt of an instrument with which to observe an atom.\n5:09\nAnyway, this is a depiction of a helium atom.\n5:14\nA helium atom has two protons and two neutrons.\n5:18\nOr at least this helium atom has two\n5:19\nprotons and two neutrons.\n5:21\nAnd the way they depict it here in the nucleus, right\n5:24\nthere, maybe these are the two-- I'm assuming they're\n5:26\nusing red for proton and purple for neutron.\n5:32\nPurple seems like more of a neutral color.\n5:34\nAnd they're sitting at the center of this atom.\n5:39\nAnd then this whole haze around there, those are the\n5:42\ntwo electrons that helium has, or that at least\n5:45\nthis helium atom has.\n5:47\nMaybe you could gain or lose an electron.\n5:49\nBut these are the two electrons.\n5:50\nAnd you say, hey, Sal, how can two electrons be this blur\n5:55\nthat's kind of smeared around this atom.\n5:58\nAnd that's where it gets philosophically interesting.\n6:01\nSo you cannot describe an electron's path around a\n6:09\nnucleus with the traditional orbit idea that we've\n6:12\nencountered when we look at planets or if we just imagine\n6:16\nthings at kind of a larger scale.\n6:18\nIt turns out that an electron, you cannot know exactly its\n6:24\nmomentum and location at any given point in time.\n6:28\nAll you can know is a probability distribution of\n6:31\nwhere it is likely to be.\n6:33\nAnd the way they depicted this, black is a higher\n6:36\nprobability, so you're much more likely to find the\n6:39\nelectron here than you are here.\n6:42\nBut the electron really could be anywhere.\n6:43\nIt could even to be here, even though it's completely white\n6:46\nthere, with some very, very, very, very, very low\n6:49\nprobability.\n6:50\nAnd so this function of where an electron is, this is called\n6:55\nan orbital.\n6:56\nOrbital.\n6:57\nNot to be confused with orbit.\n7:00\nOrbital.\n7:02\nRemember, an orbit was something like this.\n7:05\nIt's like Venus going around the Sun.\n7:08\nSo it's very physically easy for us to imagine.\n7:12\nWhile an orbital is actually a mathematical probability\n7:16\nfunction that tells us where we're\n7:17\nlikely to find an electron.\n7:18\nWe'll deal a lot more with that when we cover quantum\n7:21\nmechanics, but that's not going to be in the scope of\n7:23\nthis kind of introductory set of chemistry lectures.\n7:26\nBut it's interesting, right?\n7:28\nAn electron's behavior is so bizarre at that scale that you\n7:32\ncan't-- I mean, to call it a particle is almost misleading.\n7:35\nIt is called a particle, but it's not a particle in the\n7:38\nsense that we're used to in our everyday life.\n7:40\nIt's this thing that you can't even say exactly where it is.\n7:45\nIt can be anywhere in this haze.\n7:47\nAnd we'll learn later that there are different shapes of\n7:49\nthe hazes is as we add more and more electrons to an atom.\n7:53\nBut to me, it starts to address philosophical issues\n7:57\nof what matter even is, or do the things we look at, how\n8:01\nreal are they?\n8:02\nOr how real are they, at least as we've defined reality?\n8:04\nAnyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.\n8:07\nBut the whole notion of electrons, protons, they're\n8:12\nall kind of predicated on this notion of charge.\n8:15\nAnd we've talked about it before when we learned about\n8:17\nCoulomb's law.\n8:18\nYou could review Coulomb's laws videos in the physics\n8:22\nplaylist. But the idea is that an electron\n8:27\nhas a negative charge.\n8:29\nA proton, sometimes written like that,\n8:31\nhas a positive charge.\n8:33\nAnd a neutron has no charge.\n8:37\nAnd so that's what was tempting about the original\n8:39\nmodel of an electron.\n8:42\nIf they say, OK, if this thing has positive charges, right?\n8:45\nSo let's say this is two neutrons and two protons.\n8:47\nLet's say it's a helium atom.\n8:48\nThen we'll have some positive charges here.\n8:51\nWe have some negative charges out here.\n8:54\nOpposite charges attract.\n8:56\nAnd so if these things had some velocity, enough\n9:03\nvelocity, they would orbit around this, just the way a\n9:08\nplanet will orbit around the Sun.\n9:10\nBut now we learn, even though this is partially true, that\n9:15\nthe further away an electron is from the nucleus, it does\n9:23\nhave more, it's true, potential energy.\n9:27\nIn that it will want to move towards the nucleus, but\n9:31\nbecause of all the mechanics at the quantum level, it won't\n9:34\njust do something simple like move in a path like that, like\n9:37\na comet would do around the Sun, it actually has this kind\n9:41\nof wave-like behavior, where it just has this probability\n9:43\nfunction that describes it.\n9:45\nBut the further away an orbital, it\n9:48\ndoes have more potential.\n9:50\nWe're going to go a lot more into that in future videos.\n9:53\nBut anyway, how do you recognize what an element is?\n9:56\nI've talked a lot about the philosophy and all of that,\n9:58\nbut how do I know that this is helium?\n10:00\nIs it by the number of neutrons it has?\n10:03\nIs it by the number of protons it has?\n10:05\nIs it by the number of electrons?\n10:07\nWell the answer is, it's by the number of protons.\n10:09\nSo if you know the number of protons in an element, you\n10:13\nknow what that element is.\n10:14\nAnd the number of protons, this is defined\n10:21\nas the atomic number.\n10:26\nNow, so let's say I said something has four protons.\n10:33\nHow do we know what it is?\n10:34\nWell if we haven't memorized it, we could look it up on the\n10:37\nperiodic table of elements, which we'll be dealing with a\n10:39\nlot in this playlist. And you'd say, oh, four protons,\n10:43\nthat is beryllium.\n10:45\nRight there.\n10:46\nAnd the atomic number is the number that you see up there.\n10:50\nAnd that' s literally the number of protons.\n10:52\nAnd that is what differentiates\n10:55\none atom from another.\n10:56\nIf you have fifteen protons, you're dealing with\n10:59\nphosphorus.\n11:00\nAnd all of a sudden, if you have seven protons, you're\n11:06\ndealing with nitrogen.\n11:07\nIf you have eight, you're dealing with oxygen.\n11:09\nThat is what defines the element.\n11:11\nNow, we'll talk in the future about what happens with charge\n11:15\nand all of that.\n11:17\nOr what happens when you gain or lose electrons.\n11:19\nBut that does not change what element you're dealing with.\n11:21\nAnd likewise, when you change the number of neutrons, that\n11:26\nalso does not change the element you're dealing with.\n11:30\nBut that leads to an obvious question of, well, how many\n11:32\nneutrons and electrons do you have?\n11:35\nWell, if an atom is charge-neutral, that means it\n11:43\nhas the same number of electrons.\n11:46\nSo let's say that I have carbon.\n11:52\nIts atomic number is six.\n11:53\nAnd let's say its mass number is twelve.\n12:00\nNow what does this mean?\n12:01\nAnd let me say further that this is a neutral particle.\n12:05\nThis is a neutral atom.\n12:07\nSo the atomic number for carbon is six.\n12:10\nThat tells us exactly how many protons it has.\n12:13\nSo if I were to draw a little model here, and this is in no\n12:16\nway an accurate model.\n12:17\nI'll draw six-- two, three, four, five, six\n12:21\nprotons in the center.\n12:23\nAnd the weight of these protons, each proton is one\n12:26\natomic mass unit, and we'll talk more about how that\n12:28\nrelates to kilograms. It's a very small\n12:31\nfraction of a kilogram.\n12:32\nRoughly I think it's 1.6 times 10 to the\n12:36\nminus 27th of a kilogram.\n12:38\nSo let's say each of these are one atomic mass unit, and\n12:45\nthat's approximately equal to, I think, 1.67 times 10 to the\n12:48\nminus 27 kilograms. This is a very small number.\n12:53\nIt's actually almost impossible to visualize.\n12:57\nAt least it is for me.\n12:58\nThis tells me the mass of the entire carbon atom, of this\n13:03\nparticular carbon atom.\n13:04\nAnd this can actually change from carbon\n13:05\natom to carbon atom.\n13:07\nAnd this is essentially the mass of all of the protons\n13:10\nplus all of the neutrons.\n13:12\nAnd each proton has an atomic mass of one, in atomic mass\n13:17\nunits, and each neutron has an atomic mass of\n13:20\none atomic mass unit.\n13:22\nSo this is really the number of protons plus\n13:28\nthe number of neutrons.\n13:33\nSo in this case we have six protons, so we must also have\n13:37\nsix neutrons.\n13:39\nSix neutrons plus six protons.\n13:42\nNow, where are the electrons?\n13:44\nWell, I said it's neutral, so the proton has an equal\n13:49\npositive charge as the electron's negative charge.\n13:51\nSo this is a neutral atom, and it has six protons, so it also\n13:55\nhas six electrons.\n13:56\nLet me draw that.\n13:57\nSo we said it has six neutrons in here.\n13:59\nOne, two, three, four, five, six.\n14:01\nSo that's the nucleus right there.\n14:04\nAnd then if we were to draw the electons-- well, I could\n14:09\ndraw it as a smear, but if we want to kind of visualize it a\n14:12\nlittle better, we could say, OK, there's going to be six\n14:13\nelectrons orbiting.\n14:15\nOne, two, three, four, five, six.\n14:18\nAnd they're going to be moving around in this unpredictable\n14:21\nway that we would have to describe with\n14:22\na probability function.\n14:24\nAnd so the interesting thing about it is, most of the mass\n14:30\nof an atom is sitting right in here.\n14:32\nI mean, you might notice that when people care about the\n14:34\nmass, when they care about the atomic mass number of an atom,\n14:40\nthey ignore the electrons.\n14:41\nAnd that's because the mass of a proton, one proton\n14:47\nmass-wise, is equal to 1,836 electons.\n14:52\nSo for thinking about the mass of an atom, for all basic\n14:58\npurposes, you can ignore the mass of an electron.\n15:01\nIt's really the mass of the nucleus that counts as the\n15:08\nmass of the atom.\n15:10\nNow, you might see this periodic table here, and you\n15:12\nsay, OK, they gave us the atomic number up there.\n15:15\nThe atomic number of oxygen is eight.\n15:18\nIt means it has eight protons.\n15:20\nThe atomic number of silicon is 14.\n15:22\nIt has 14 protons.\n15:24\nNow what is this right here?\n15:27\nLet's see, in carbon.\n15:28\nIn carbon they have this 12.0107.\n15:34\nThat is the atomic weight of carbon.\n15:36\nLet me write this.\n15:41\nAtomic weight of carbon.\n15:47\nThe atomic weight of carbon is 12.0107.\n15:56\nNow, what does that mean?\n15:57\nDoes that mean that carbon has six protons and then the\n16:03\nremainder, the remaining 6.0107 neutrons, it has kind\n16:09\nof this fraction of a neutron?\n16:11\nNo.\n16:12\nIt means if you were to average all the different\n16:16\nversions of carbon you find on the planet and you were to\n16:19\naverage the number of neutrons based on the quantity of the\n16:25\ndifferent types of carbon, this is the\n16:27\naverage you would get.\n16:28\nSo it turns out that carbon, the two major forms, the main\n16:32\none you'll find is carbon-12.\n16:35\nSo that's like this.\n16:36\nSo that has six protons and six neutrons.\n16:39\nAnd then another isotope of carbon.\n16:42\nNow an isotope is the same element with a different\n16:45\nnumber of neutrons.\n16:46\nAnother isotope of carbon is carbon-14, which is much more\n16:50\nscarce on the planet.\n16:52\nWe don't know how much in the universe, but on the planet.\n16:55\nNow, if you were to average these, not just a straight-up\n16:58\naverage, then you would get carbon-13 and then the atomic\n17:01\nweight would be 13, but you weight this one much higher\n17:04\nbecause this exists in much larger quantities on Earth.\n17:07\nI mean, this is pretty much all of the\n17:08\ncarbon that you see.\n17:09\nBut there's a little bit of this.\n17:10\nSo if you weight them appropriately, the average\n17:13\nbecomes this.\n17:14\nSo most of the carbon you'll find-- if you just found\n17:17\ncarbon someplace, on average its weight in atomic mass\n17:22\nunits is going to be 12.0107.\n17:27\nBut that idea of an isotope is an interesting one.\n17:29\nRemember, when you change the neutrons, you're not changing\n17:32\nthe actual, fundamental element.\n17:33\nYou're just getting a different isotope, a different\n17:36\nversion, of the element.\n17:37\nSo these two versions of carbon are both isotopes.\n17:41\nNow, I want to leave this video with what I think is\n17:43\nkind of the neatest idea behind atoms. And it's the\n17:46\nmost philosophically interesting things about them.\n17:49\nIt's that the relative size-- so, we have these electrons,\n17:54\nwhich represent very little of the mass of an atom.\n17:58\nIt's 1/2000 of the mass of an atom are the electrons.\n18:01\nAnd even those, it's hard to even describe them as\n18:04\nparticles, because you can't even tell me exactly where and\n18:08\nhow fast one of these particles is moving.\n18:11\nThey just have a probability function.\n18:12\nSo most of the atom is sitting inside the nucleus.\n18:16\nAnd this is the interesting thing.\n18:17\nIf you look at an atom on average, if you\n18:21\nsay this is my atom.\n18:23\nLet's say I had two atoms that are bonded to each other.\n18:26\nAnd I were to say, how much of this is actual stuff?\n18:29\nAnd when I say stuff, that's a very abstract concept, because\n18:32\nwe're talking about the nucleus, right?\n18:33\nBecause the nucleus is where all the\n18:34\nmass is, all the stuff.\n18:36\nIt turns out that it's actually an infinitesimally\n18:39\nsmall fraction of the volume of the atom where-- the volume\n18:44\nof the atom is hard to define, because the electron can\n18:45\npretty much be anywhere, but if you view the volume as\n18:48\nwhere you're most likely to find the electron, or with 90%\n18:52\nprobability you're likely to find the electron, then the\n18:55\nnucleus is, in a lot of cases and the way I think about it,\n18:59\nit's about 1/10,000 of the volume.\n19:01\nSo if you think about it, when you look at something, if you\n19:03\nlook at your hand or if you look at the wall or if you\n19:06\nlook at your computer, 99.999% of it is free space.\n19:14\nIt's nothing.\n19:15\nIt's vacuum.\n19:18\nIf you had ultra-small-- I guess we could call them\n19:20\nparticles or something-- most of them would pass straight\n19:23\nthrough whatever you look at.\n19:24\nSo it already starts to kind of\n19:26\nquestion our hold on reality.\n19:28\nWhat is there when, if-- and this is fact, this isn't\n19:32\ntheory right here-- that if you take anything down to the\n19:35\nbuilding blocks, down to the atomic level, most of the\n19:39\nspace of that kind of, quote-unquote object, is free\n19:43\nvacuum space.\n19:44\nYou could go straight through it if you could get down to\n19:46\nthat scale.\n19:47\nThis image of a helium atom, they say right here this is\n19:50\none femtometer.\n19:52\nRight?\n19:52\nOne femtometer.\n19:57\nThis is the scale of the nucleus of a\n20:00\nhelium atom, right?\n20:01\nOne femtometer.\n20:03\nThis is one angstrom, right?\n20:04\nAnd they say that equals 100,000 femtometers.\n20:06\nAnd just to get a sense of scale, one angstrom is 1 times\n20:10\n10 to the negative 10 meters, right?\n20:13\nSo the atom is roughly on the scale of an angstrom.\n20:15\nIn the case of helium, the nucleus is\n20:17\neven a smaller fraction.\n20:18\nIt's 1/100,000.\n20:20\nSo if you had-- let's say you had liquid helium, which you'd\n20:23\nhave to get very cold to get.\n20:25\nIf you're looking at that, most of it is free space.\n20:27\nIf you're looking at an iron bar, the great, great, great,\n20:30\ngreat, great, great majority of it is free space.\n20:33\nAnd we're not even talking about, maybe there's some free\n20:35\nspace inside the nucleus that we could talk\n20:37\nabout in the future.\n20:38\nBut to me, that just blows my mind that most things we look\n20:41\nat are not really solid.\n20:44\nThey're really just empty space, but they look solid\n20:47\nbecause of the way light reflects on them or the forces\n20:50\nthat repel us.\n20:51\nBut there really isn't something to touch there.\n20:55\nThat most of this right here is all free space.\n20:57\nI think I've said the word free space now, and I think\n21:00\nI'll leave further\n21:02\nmind-blowing to the next video.",

it.\n0:09\nWhat we'll see in this video is that we can't even\n0:11\ngrasp things that are actually super small compared\n0:13\nto the size of the universe.\n0:14\nAnd we actually don't even know what\n0:16\nthe entire size of the universe is.\n0:17\nBut with that said, let's actually\n0:19\njust try to appreciate how small we are.\n0:21\nSo this is me right over here.\n0:24\nI am 5 foot 9 inches, depending on whether I'm wearing shoes--\n0:28\nmaybe 5 foot 10 with shoes.\n0:30\nBut for the sake of this video, let's just roughly\n0:32\napproximate around 6 feet, or around roughly--\n0:35\nI'm not to go into the details of the math-- around 2 meters.\n0:40\nNow, if I were to lie down 10 times in a row,\n0:43\nyou'd get about the length of an 18-wheeler.\n0:46\nThat's about 60 feet long.\n0:48\nSo this is times 10.\n0:49\nNow, if you were to put an 18-wheeler-- if you were\n0:53\nto make it tall, as opposed to long-- somehow stand it up--\n0:56\nand you were to do that 10 times in a row,\n0:58\nyou'll get to the height of roughly a 60-story skyscraper.\n1:03\nSo once again, if you took me and you piled me up 100 times,\n1:07\nyou'll get about a 60-story skyscraper.\n1:09\nNow, if you took that skyscraper and if you\n1:12\nwere to lie it down 10 times in a row,\n1:15\nyou'd get something of the length of the Golden Gate\n1:18\nBridge.\n1:19\nAnd once again, I'm not giving you the exact numbers.\n1:21\nIt's not always going to be exactly 10.\n1:23\nBut we're now getting to about something that's\n1:25\na little on the order of a mile long.\n1:28\nSo the Golden Gate Bridge is actually longer than a mile.\n1:30\nBut if you go within the twin spans, it's roughly about\n1:33\na mile.\n1:33\nIt's actually a little longer than that.\n1:35\nBut that gives you a sense of a mile.\n1:37\nNow, if you multiply that by 10, you\n1:40\nget to the size of a large city.\n1:43\nAnd this right here is a satellite photograph\n1:45\nof San Francisco.\n1:47\nThis is the actual Golden Gate Bridge here.\n1:49\nAnd when I copy and pasted this picture,\n1:51\nI tried to make it roughly 10 miles by 10 miles\n1:54\njust so you appreciate the scale.\n1:56\nAnd what's interesting here-- and this picture's interesting.\n1:58\nBecause this is the first time we can relate to cities.\n2:02\nBut when you look at a city on this scale,\n2:04\nit's starting to get larger than what\n2:06\nwe're used to processing on a daily basis.\n2:09\nA bridge-- we've been on a bridge.\n2:11\nWe know what a bridge looks like.\n2:12\nWe know that a bridge is huge.\n2:14\nBut it doesn't feel like something\n2:15\nthat we can't comprehend.\n2:17\nAlready, a city is something that we\n2:19\ncan't comprehend all at once.\n2:20\nWe can drive across a city.\n2:21\nWe can look at satellite imagery.\n2:23\nBut if I were to show a human on this,\n2:26\nit would be unbelievably, unbelievably small.\n2:28\nYou wouldn't actually be able to see it.\n2:30\nIt would be less than a pixel on this image.\n2:32\nA house is less than a pixel on this image.\n2:35\nBut let's keep multiplying by 10.\n2:38\nIf you multiply by 10 again, you get to something\n2:41\nroughly the size of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n2:44\nThis whole square over here is roughly that square right\n2:47\nover there.\n2:48\nLet's multiply by 10 again.\n2:52\nSo this square is about 100 miles by 100 miles.\n2:55\nSo this one would be about 1,000 miles by 1,000 miles.\n2:57\nAnd now you're including a big part of the Western United\n3:00\nStates.\n3:01\nYou have California here.\n3:03\nYou Nevada here.\n3:04\nYou have Arizona and New Mexico--\n3:06\nso a big chunk of a big continent we're\n3:08\nalready including.\n3:09\nAnd frankly, this is beyond the scale\n3:11\nthat we're used to operating.\n3:13\nWe've seen maps, so maybe we're a little used to it.\n3:15\nBut if you ever had to walk across this type of distance,\n3:18\nit would take you a while.\n3:19\nTo some degree, the fact that planes goes so fast-- almost\n3:22\nunimaginably fast for us-- that it's\n3:25\nmade it feel like things like continents aren't as big.\n3:28\nBecause you can fly across them in five or six hours.\n3:30\nBut these are already huge, huge, huge distances.\n3:33\nBut once again, you take this square\n3:35\nthat's about 1,000 miles by 1,000 miles,\n3:38\nand you multiply that by 10.\n3:40\nAnd you get pretty close-- a little bit\n3:42\nover-- the diameter of the Earth-- a little bit\n3:46\nover the diameter of the Earth.\n3:47\nBut once again, we're on the Earth.\n3:49\nWe kind of relate to the Earth.\n3:52\nIf you look carefully at the horizon,\n3:54\nyou might see a little bit of a curvature,\n3:56\nespecially if you were to get into the plane.\n3:58\nSo even though this is, frankly, larger\n4:01\nthan my brain can really grasp, we\n4:03\ncan kind of relate to the Earth.\n4:06\nNow you multiply the diameter of Earth times 10.\n4:10\nAnd you get to the diameter of Jupiter.\n4:13\nAnd so if you were to sit Earth right next to Jupiter--\n4:17\nobviously, they're nowhere near that close.\n4:19\nThat would destroy both of the planets.\n4:21\nActually, it would definitely destroy Earth.\n4:23\nIt would probably just be merged into Jupiter.\n4:26\nSo if you put Earth next to Jupiter,\n4:30\nit would look something like that right over there.\n4:34\nSo I would say that Jupiter is definitely-- on this diagram\n4:38\nthat I'm drawing here-- is definitely\n4:39\nthe first thing that I have I can't comprehend.\n4:43\nThe Earth, itself, is so vastly huge.\n4:45\nJupiter is-- it's 10 times bigger in diameter.\n4:49\nIt's much larger in terms of mass, and volume,\n4:52\nand all the rest.\n4:53\nBut just in terms of diameter, it is 10 times bigger.\n4:56\nBut let's keep going.\n4:57\n10 times Jupiter gets us to the sun.\n5:02\nThis is times 10.\n5:04\nSo if this is the Sun-- and if I were to draw Jupiter,\n5:07\nit would look something like-- I'll\n5:08\ndo Jupiter in pink-- Jupiter would be around that big.\n5:13\nAnd then the Earth would be around that big\n5:17\nif you were to put them all next to each other.\n5:19\nSo the Sun, once again, is huge.\n5:21\nEven though we see it almost every day,\n5:24\nit is unimaginably huge.\n5:26\nEven the Earth is unimaginably huge.\n5:28\nAnd the Sun is 100 times more unimaginably bigger.\n5:33\nNow we're going to start getting really, really, really wacky.\n5:36\nYou multiply the diameter of the Sun, which is already\n5:40\n100 times the diameter of the Earth-- you\n5:43\nmultiply that times 100.\n5:44\nAnd that is the distance from the Earth to the Sun.\n5:47\nSo I've drawn the Sun here as a little pixel.\n5:52\nAnd I didn't even draw the Earth as a pixel.\n5:53\nBecause a pixel would be way too large.\n5:55\nIt would have to be a hundredth of a pixel\n5:57\nin order to draw the Earth properly.\n5:59\nSo this is a unbelievable distance\n6:02\nbetween the Earth and the Sun.\n6:04\nIt's 100 times the distance of the diameter of the Sun itself.\n6:10\nSo it's massive, massive.\n6:11\nBut once again, these things are relatively close\n6:15\ncompared to where we're about to go.\n6:17\nBecause if we want to get to the nearest star-- so remember,\n6:21\nthe Sun is 100 times the diameter of the Earth.\n6:24\nThe distance between the Sun and the Earth is 100 times that.\n6:29\nOr you could say it's 10,000 times the diameter\n6:32\nof the Earth.\n6:33\nSo these are unimaginable distances.\n6:35\nBut to get to the nearest star, which is 4.2 light years away,\n6:40\nit's 200,000 times-- and once again, unimaginable.\n6:45\nIt's 200,000 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun.\n6:51\nAnd to give you a rough sense of how far apart these things are,\n6:59\nif the Sun was roughly the size of a basketball--\n7:02\nif the average star was about the size of a basketball--\n7:04\nin our part of the galaxy in a volume the size of the Earth--\n7:09\nso if you had a big volume the size of the Earth,\n7:13\nif the stars were the sizes of basketballs,\n7:16\nin our part of the galaxy, you would only\n7:18\nhave a handful of basketballs per that volume.\n7:22\nSo unbelievably sparse.\n7:26\nEven though, when you look at the galaxy--\n7:28\nand this is just an artist's depiction of it--\n7:30\nit looks like something that has the spray of stars,\n7:33\nand it looks reasonably dense, there\n7:35\nis actually a huge amount of space\n7:37\nthat the great, great, great, great, great majority\n7:40\nof the volume in the galaxy is just empty, empty space.\n7:46\nThere's no stars, no planets, no nothing.\n7:49\nI mean, this is a huge jump that I'm talking about.\n7:52\nAnd then if you really want to realize\n7:55\nhow large a galaxy, itself, can be,\n7:57\nyou take this distance between the Sun,\n8:00\nor between our solar system and the nearest star--\n8:02\nso that's 200,000 times the distance between the Earth\n8:07\nand the Sun-- and you multiply that distance by 25,000.\n8:10\nSo if the Sun is right here, our nearest star\n8:16\nwill be in that same pixel.\n8:18\nThey'll actually be within-- you'd actually\n8:20\nget a ton of stars within that one pixel,\n8:22\neven though they're so far apart.\n8:24\nAnd then this whole thing is 100,000 light years.\n8:28\nIt's 25,000 times the distance than the distance\n8:33\nbetween the Sun and the nearest star.\n8:35\nSo we're talking about unimaginable, unfathomable\n8:39\ndistances, just for a galaxy.\n8:42\nAnd now we're going to get our-- frankly,\n8:44\nmy brain is already well beyond anything\n8:48\nthat it can really process.\n8:49\nAt this point, it almost just becomes abstract thinking.\n8:52\nIt just becomes playing with numbers and mathematics.\n8:55\nBut to get a sense of the universe, itself,\n8:58\nthe observable universe-- and we have to be clear.\n9:00\nBecause we can only observe light\n9:02\nthat started leaving from its source 13.7 billion years ago.\n9:06\nBecause that's how old the universe is.\n9:08\nThe observable universe is about 93 billion light years across.\n9:13\nAnd the reason why it's larger than 13.7 billion\n9:16\nis that the points in space that emitted\n9:20\nlight 13.7 billion years ago, those\n9:22\nhave been going away from us.\n9:24\nSo now they're on the order of 40 billion light years away.\n9:27\nBut this isn't about cosmology.\n9:29\nThis is just about scale and appreciating\n9:31\nhow huge the universe is.\n9:33\nJust in the part of the universe that we can theoretically\n9:36\nobserve, you have to get-- and that we can observe,\n9:43\njust because we're getting electromagnetic radiation\n9:47\nfrom those parts of the universe--\n9:50\nyou would have to multiply this number.\n9:52\nSo let me make this clear.\n9:53\n100,000 light years-- that's the diameter of the Milky Way.\n10:01\nYou would have to multiply not by 1,000.\n10:04\n1,000 would get you to 100 million light years.\n10:10\nThis is 100,000 times 1,000 is 100 million.\n10:13\nYou have to multiply by 1,000 again\n10:18\nto get to 100 billion light years.\n10:21\nAnd the universe, for all we know,\n10:22\nmight be much, much, much, much, larger.\n10:24\nIt might even be infinite.\n10:26\nWho knows?\n10:27\nBut to get from just the diameter of the Milky Way\n10:32\nto the observable universe, you have to multiply by a million.\n10:35\nAnd already, this is an unfathomable distance.\n10:38\nSo in the whole scheme of things,\n10:42\nnot only are we pretty small, and not only are the things\n10:46\nwe build pretty small, and not only is our planet ultra small,\n10:51\nand not only is our Sun ultra small,\n10:54\nand our solar system ultra small,\n10:56\nbut our galaxy is really nothing compared\n10:59\nto the vastness of the universe.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's talk about a concept that probably\n0:03\nconfuses chemistry students the most on some level.\n0:06\nBut on some level it's also one of the simplest concepts.\n0:09\nAnd that's the idea of a mole,\n0:12\nwhich in chemistry is different\n0:13\nthat the thing digging up your backyard,\n0:15\nor the thing you want to get removed from your left eye.\n0:19\nA mole in chemistry is just a number.\n0:21\nIt's just a number,\n0:23\nand the number is 6.02 times 10 to the 23.\n0:28\nSo it's a very huge number.\n0:29\nAnd this is also called Avogadro's number.\n0:31\nMaybe I will do a video on Avogadro.\n0:35\nAvogadro's number\n0:39\nBut that's all you need to know.\n0:41\nA mole is just a number.\n0:43\nThere are kind of more Byzantine definitions of a mole.\n0:47\nThis actually is not\n0:49\n-- actually, let me copy and paste it from Wikipedia.\n0:51\nThis is Wikipedia's definition of a mole.\n0:55\nAnd you hopefully at the end of this video\n0:58\nyou'll see that they're equivalent.\n0:59\nBut if you're just getting exposed to the concept,\n1:01\nthis to me, it's just not an easy concept.\n1:07\nBasically, \"a mole is defined as the amount of substance\n1:10\nof a system that contains as many elemental entities\n1:16\nas there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon 12.\"\n1:19\nWell, I just told you that a mole is 6.02 times 10 to the 23.\n1:24\nSo if you just take the last part,\n1:26\natoms in 12 grams of carbon 12.\n1:30\nSo that means that there are 1 mole of carbon 12\n1:39\n-- let me write it like that -- carbon 12.\n1:42\nThere are 1 mole of carbon 12 atoms in 12 grams of carbon.\n1:57\nAnd so that's why a mole is useful.\n1:59\nSo I could have just instead of writing 1 mole,\n2:02\nI could have replaced this as there's 6.02 times 10\n2:06\nto the 23 carbon atoms, carbon 12 atoms in 12 grams of carbon.\n2:12\nHow do you figure that out?\n2:13\nOr I guess, what else does this mean?\n2:15\nI mean, we just added in carbon,\n2:17\nthey said it's the amount of substance of any molecule,\n2:19\nif you convert between atomic mass units and grams.\n2:22\nThis I find very confusing.\n2:24\nHow can we apply this in other places?\n2:26\nSo the first thing to realize is a mole is just a way\n2:29\nof translating between grams and atomic mass units.\n2:32\nOne carbon 12 atom is what?\n2:35\nWhat's its mass number?\n2:37\nIt's 12.\n2:39\nThat's why it's called carbon 12 instead of carbon 14.\n2:41\nSo its mass is 12 atomic mass units.\n2:46\nSo if you have something that has a mass of 12 atomic mass units\n2:50\nand you have a mole of them,\n2:52\nor you have 6.02 times 10 to the 23 of them,\n2:55\nall of those atoms combined will have a mass of 12 grams.\n3:01\nSo another way to think about it is\n3:04\n1 gram is equal to 1 mole of atomic mass units.\n3:13\nI'll write amu's like that.\n3:16\nOr you can write 1 gram is equal to 6.02\n3:22\ntimes 10 to the 23 atomic mass units.\n3:26\nAnd the reason why this is useful\n3:28\n-- and it's kind of addressed in this Wikipedia definition there\n3:30\n-- is it helps us translate between the atomic world\n3:33\n-- where we deal with atomic mass units and we deal with,\n3:36\noh, we've got an extra neutron now,\n3:37\nlet's add one to our atomic mass number\n3:41\n-- and translating between that atomic world\n3:43\nand our everyday world where we deal in grams.\n3:45\nAnd just so you know, a gram is still\n3:47\na pretty small amount of mass.\n3:50\nIt's 1/1,000 of a kilogram.\n3:52\nA kilogram is about 2 pounds.\n3:54\nSo this is about 1/500 of a pound.\n3:56\nSo this is not much.\n3:58\nSo there's a ton of atoms in a very small amount of\n4:02\n-- in 1 gram of carbon, or at least in 12 grams of carbon,\n4:06\nyou have a ton of atoms. You have 6.02 times 10 to the 23.\n4:10\nAnd just to hit the point home,\n4:12\nI probably should have talked about this in the atom.\n4:13\nThis is a huge number.\n4:15\nTo maybe visualize it, if you think of -- I was told that\n4:22\nin the diameter of a hair, if this is a hair\n4:25\nand this is diameter of the hair,\n4:27\nif you go this way there 1 million carbon atoms.\n4:32\n1 million carbon atoms that way.\n4:35\nOr if you were to take an apple\n4:41\nand you were to try to figure out what fraction,\n4:45\nif you were to make one of the atoms of an apple\n4:48\n-- and obviously,\n4:50\nan apple has a bunch of different types of atoms in it\n4:52\n-- but if you were to take one of the atoms\n4:53\nand make it the size of the apple,\n4:55\nthen the apple would be the size of the earth.\n4:58\nSo an apple atom is to an apple\n5:00\nas an apple is to the earth.\n5:03\nSo these are obviously-- it's hard for us\n5:06\nto even process things of this size.\n5:08\nWhen you just have one gram of\n5:12\n-- well, let's say you have 1 gram of hydrogen.\n5:14\n1 gram of hydrogen. 1 gram of hydrogen.\n5:22\nIf you have 1 gram of hydrogen,\n5:24\nthat means you have 1 mole of hydrogen.\n5:29\nHow do I know that?\n5:31\nBecause hydrogen's atomic mass number is 1.\n5:34\nSo in general, if you just take any element\n5:39\n-- so what is the mass of,\n5:41\nlet me just pick, 1 mole of aluminum?\n5:45\nSo if I were to take 6.02 times 10 to the 23 aluminum atoms,\n5:54\nwhat is the mass of that collection?\n5:56\nWell, each of them have an atomic mass number of 13.\n6:00\nSo it's 13 amu's-- I don't have to put the s there\n6:08\n-- times six point\n6:11\n-- well, I won't write that way, actually.\n6:14\nThat'll probably just confuse you.\n6:15\nThe easy way to think about is if you have a mole of an atom,\n6:18\nyou take its mass-- I was taking its atomic number,\n6:21\nthat's not good-- you take its mass number.\n6:23\nIn this case let's say it's 27.\n6:26\nSo we're dealing with aluminum 27.\n6:30\nYou take its mass number, and if you have 1 mole of it,\n6:34\nthen the mass of that will be 27 grams.\n6:41\nSo that literally, when you have one mole of an atom\n6:44\nit's a direct translation between its mass number and grams.\n6:48\n1 mole of iron, let's say iron 56--\n6:53\nthere's obviously many isotopes or iron\n6:55\n-- let's say we're dealing with iron 56.\n6:58\nYou normally don't hear it like that,\n6:59\nbut let's say we're dealing with the isotope of iron\n7:02\nthat has a mass number of 56.\n7:04\nSo if I have 1 mole of this, 1 mole of this atom right here,\n7:11\nthat's going to have a mass of\n7:15\n-- the math isn't difficult here\n7:16\n-- 56 grams. Right? And if you think about it,\n7:23\nhow many atomic mass units is this?\n7:24\nWell, this is 56 atomic mass units per atom.\n7:30\nThen you have a mole of those, so you have\n7:32\n6.02 times 10 to the 23 times 56 atomic mass units.\n7:37\nAnd then you divide it\n7:39\nby the number of atomic mass units per gram.\n7:41\nAnd you end up with 56 grams.\n7:43\nBut the easy way to think about it is\n7:44\nyou just take whatever the mass number is.\n7:46\nIf you have silicon, if you have a mole of silicon,\n7:49\na mole of silicon will have a mass\n7:52\n-- I don't want to say weight\n7:53\nbecause this should apply to any planet\n7:54\n-- of 28 grams.\n7:56\nWhat about 2 moles of silicon? 2 moles of silicon.\n8:04\nAnd I'll write its mass number.\n8:05\nLet's say silicon has a mass number of 28.\n8:10\nTwo moles of silicon.\n8:12\nWell, 1 more would have a mass of 28 grams,\n8:15\nso 2 moles is going to have a mass of 56 grams.\n8:23\nIf I were to say, let's say I had 4 moles of oxygen,\n8:29\nwhich has a mass number of 16.\n8:32\nWhat is the mass of that?\n8:34\nThis is a huge number of oxygen atoms\n8:37\n-- what would be the mass of that?\n8:38\nWell, it would be 4 times-- 1 mole of oxygen\n8:44\nwould have a mass of 16 grams,\n8:47\nso 4 moles has 64 grams.\n8:52\nIt's confusing because we're not used to using a word\n8:55\nlike moles as a number, but all it is, is a number.\n8:58\nAnd the easy way to think about is that it lets us\n9:00\ntranslate between this atomic mass unit number and grams.\n9:06\nAnd you say, well, how do I get that many grams?\n9:08\nWell, I have to have 6.02 times 10 to the 23 carbon atoms\n9:12\nfor that collection of carbon to have a mass of 12 grams.\n9:16\nThat's all that mole means.\n9:18\nIt's just a number.\n9:19\nAnd I encourage you to kind of play around\n9:21\nwith a lot of what we talked about.\n9:22\nBecause it's super important\n9:24\nto have the intuition behind moles,\n9:25\notherwise, you'll get confused later on\n9:27\nwhen we start getting into energies\n9:29\nin terms of it requires kilojoules per mole,\n9:31\nand what is the energy of this reaction\n9:34\nand all that type of stuff.\n9:35\nSo just really try to make sure\n9:37\nyou digest this as well as possible.\n9:38\nAnd let me know if you don't\n9:40\nand I'll maybe make another video on this\n9:42\nbecause it's so important.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] Let's now see if we can balance a chemical\n0:02\nequation with slightly more complex molecules.\n0:07\nSo, here we have a chemical equation,\n0:10\ndescribing a chemical reaction.\n0:11\nThis is actually a combustion reaction.\n0:14\nYou have some ethylene right over here,\n0:17\nin the presence of oxygen, and you need to get a\n0:20\nlittle bit of energy to get this going, but then you're\n0:22\ngoing to have this reaction that's actually going to\n0:24\nrelease energy as well, but we're not accounting for\n0:26\nthe energy, at least the way we've written it.\n0:28\nRight over here, you have some ethylene, and this little\n0:32\ng in parentheses, says it's in the gas form\n0:35\nor gaseous form, so gaseous ethylene plus some\n0:40\ndioxygen molecule, which is the most prevalent form of\n0:43\noxygen molecule that you would find in the atmosphere.\n0:47\nAnd so, that's also in the gas form.\n0:49\nPut them together, you end up with some carbon dioxide\n0:52\ngas and some liquid water.\n0:55\nThis is the classic combustion reaction.\n0:58\nBut now let's think about, how do we balance this thing?\n1:01\nLet's make sure we have the same number\n1:03\nof each atom on both sides.\n1:07\nAnd when you see something more complicated like this,\n1:09\nwhere, you know, here I have an oxygen and two different\n1:13\nmolecules over here, and a lot of these molecules have\n1:17\nmultiple elements in it.\n1:19\nIt might be very daunting.\n1:20\nWhere do I start?\n1:21\nAnd this is where the art of balancing chemical\n1:23\nequations starts to come into play.\n1:26\nThe general idea is,\n1:28\nTry to balance the...\n1:30\ntry to balance the molecules that have multiple\n1:33\nelements in them first, and leave the...\n1:37\nmolecules that only have one element in them for last.\n1:40\nAnd the idea there is, is that these are harder.\n1:43\nThey're going to have all sorts of implications,\n1:44\nand then, at the end of the day, you can just set\n1:46\na number here for the number of dioxygens.\n1:50\nIf you saved, say the ethylene for last,\n1:54\nthen every time, and you're trying to balance the carbons,\n1:57\nyou try to change the number of carbons, you're going to\n1:59\nchange the number of hydrogens,\n2:00\nwhich is going to change the...\n2:01\nYou're going to have to balance over and over, and you're\n2:03\ngoing to go into this really really really confusing circle.\n2:05\nSo, the best thing to do, try to balance\n2:08\nthe complex molecules first, and then\n2:11\nsave the single element molecules for last.\n2:15\nSo let's do that.\n2:16\nSo, let's start with the carbons.\n2:19\nSo, over here, I have two carbons.\n2:22\nOver here, I only have one carbon.\n2:26\nI only have one carbon.\n2:28\nSo, it seems like the best way to balance it is, I should\n2:31\nhave two molecules of carbon dioxide,\n2:35\nand I haven't even thought about the oxygens yet.\n2:37\nBy putting that two there, that's going to change the\n2:39\nnumber of oxygens I have on the righthand side.\n2:42\nBut at least it balances my carbons.\n2:44\nI now have two carbons on the lefthand side,\n2:47\nand I have two carbons on the righthand side.\n2:49\nI’m no longer magically destroying\n2:52\na carbon atom, all right.\n2:55\nNow, let's move on to the hydrogens, and remember,\n2:57\nwhat I said is, let's wait to do the oxygens last,\n3:00\nbecause we have a molecule\n3:03\nthat only contains oxygen right over here,\n3:06\nso we'll save oxygen for last.\n3:08\nSo, let's do hydrogen next.\n3:11\nSo, hydrogen, right over here, we have four hydrogens.\n3:15\nAnd on the righthand side, we have two hydrogens.\n3:18\nSo, it seems like the easiest thing to do to balance\n3:21\nthe hydrogens is to have two of these water molecules.\n3:25\nNow I have four hydrogens here,\n3:27\nand I have four hydrogens there.\n3:30\nNow, let's do the oxygen.\n3:33\nNow, let's do the oxygen.\n3:34\nI've balanced the carbons and the hydrogens.\n3:36\nAnd the reason why oxygen's going to be interesting,\n3:38\nI can just count the amount of oxygen I now have here,\n3:41\nafter changing the amount of molecules I have.\n3:45\nAnd then I can adjust this accordingly, because this is\n3:48\nonly going to affect the number of oxygens\n3:50\nthat I have on the lefthand side.\n3:52\nRight now, on the lefthand side, I have two oxygens,\n3:54\nand on the righthand side, let me count this,\n3:57\nI have two O two's, really.\n4:00\nSo, this is going to be four oxygens here,\n4:02\nand then I have, each of these water molecules has\n4:05\none oxygen, but I have two water molecules,\n4:07\nso this is going to be two oxygens, two oxygens here.\n4:11\nSo, on the righthand side, I have four plus two oxygens.\n4:15\nSo, I have six oxygens on the righthand side.\n4:17\nI need six oxygens on the lefthand side.\n4:19\nI need this number to be six.\n4:21\nSo, how do I do that?\n4:23\nWell, I just need three of these molecules.\n4:24\nIf I have three molecules, each of them have two oxygens,\n4:27\nI'm going to have a total of six oxygens.\n4:29\nAnd just like that, we have balanced this\n4:31\ncombustion reaction, this chemical equation.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWelcome back.\n0:01\nSo we have this green spring here, and let's see,\n0:03\nthere's a wall here.\n0:04\nThis connected to the wall.\n0:06\nAnd let's say that this is where the spring is naturally.\n0:09\nSo if I were not to push on the spring, it would stretch\n0:12\nall the way out here.\n0:14\nBut in this situation, I pushed on the spring, so it\n0:16\nhas a displacement of x to the left.\n0:19\nAnd we'll just worry about magnitude, so we won't worry\n0:21\ntoo much about direction.\n0:23\nSo what I want to do is think a little bit-- well, first I\n0:25\nwant to graph how much force I've applied at different\n0:29\npoints as I compress this spring.\n0:31\nAnd then I want to use that graph to maybe figure out how\n0:35\nmuch work we did in compressing the spring.\n0:38\nSo let's look at-- I know I'm compressing to the left.\n0:45\nMaybe I should compress to the right, so that you can-- well,\n0:48\nwe're just worrying about the magnitude of the x-axis.\n0:51\nLet's draw a little graph here.\n0:53\nThat's my y-axis, x-axis.\n1:03\nSo this axis is how much I've compressed it, x, and then\n1:09\nthis axis, the y-axis, is how much force I have to apply.\n1:14\nSo when the spring was initially all the way out\n1:18\nhere, to compress it a little bit, how much force\n1:21\ndo I have to apply?\n1:22\nWell, this was its natural state, right?\n1:25\nAnd we know from-- well, Hooke's Law told us that the\n1:29\nrestorative force-- I'll write a little r down here-- is\n1:34\nequal to negative K, where K is the spring constant, times\n1:39\nthe displacement, right?\n1:42\nThat's the restorative force, so that's the force that the\n1:44\nspring applies to whoever's pushing on it.\n1:47\nThe force to compress it is just the same thing, but it's\n1:50\ngoing in the same direction as the x.\n1:51\nIf I'm moving the spring, if I'm compressing the spring to\n1:55\nthe left, then the force I'm applying is also to the left.\n1:58\nSo I'll call that the force of compression.\n2:01\nThe force of compression is going to be\n2:03\nequal to K times x.\n2:05\nAnd when the spring is compressed and not\n2:07\naccelerating in either direction, the force of\n2:09\ncompression is going to be equal to\n2:11\nthe restorative force.\n2:12\nSo what I want to do here is plot the force of compression\n2:16\nwith respect to x.\n2:17\nAnd I should have drawn it the other way, but I think you\n2:20\nunderstand that x is increasing to the left in my\n2:22\nexample, right?\n2:23\nThis is where x is equal to 0 right here.\n2:30\nAnd say, this might be x is equal to 10 because we've\n2:33\ncompressed it by 10 meters.\n2:36\nSo let's see how much force we've applied.\n2:38\nSo when x is 0, which is right here, how much force do we\n2:43\nneed to apply to compress the spring?\n2:45\nWell, if we give zero force, the spring won't move, but if\n2:48\nwe just give a little, little bit of force, if we just give\n2:52\ninfinitesimal, super-small amount of force, we'll\n2:55\ncompress the spring just a little bit, right?\n2:58\nBecause at that point, the force of compression is going\n3:01\nto be pretty much zero.\n3:03\nSo when the spring is barely compressed, we're going to\n3:06\napply a little, little bit of force, so almost at zero.\n3:12\nTo displace the spring zero, we apply zero force.\n3:15\nTo displace the spring a little bit, we have to apply a\n3:17\nlittle bit more force.\n3:19\nTo displace soon. the spring 1 meter, so if this is say, 1\n3:22\nmeter, how much force will we have to\n3:28\napply to keep it there?\n3:31\nSo let's say if this is 1 meter, the force of\n3:36\ncompression is going to be K times 1, so it's\n3:38\njust going to be K.\n3:42\nAnd realize, you didn't apply zero and then apply K force.\n3:46\nYou keep applying a little bit more force.\n3:49\nEvery time you compress the spring a little bit, it takes\n3:52\na little bit more force to compress it a little bit more.\n3:55\nSo to compress it 1 meters, you need to apply K.\n3:58\nAnd to get it there, you have to keep increasing the amount\n4:01\nof force you apply.\n4:02\nAt 2 meters, you would've been up to 2K, et cetera.\n4:10\nI think you see a line is forming.\n4:11\nLet me draw that line.\n4:14\nThe line looks something like that.\n4:17\nAnd so this is how much force you need to apply as a\n4:20\nfunction of the displacement of the spring from its natural\n4:24\nrest state, right?\n4:26\nAnd here I have positive x going to the right, but in\n4:28\nthis case, positive x is to the left.\n4:30\nI'm just measuring its actual displacement.\n4:32\nI'm not worried too much about direction right now.\n4:36\nSo I just want you to think a little bit about what's\n4:38\nhappening here.\n4:39\nYou just have to slowly keep on-- you could apply a very\n4:42\nlarge force initially.\n4:43\nIf you apply a very large force initially, the spring\n4:46\nwill actually accelerate much faster, because you're\n4:48\napplying a much larger force than its restorative force,\n4:52\nand so it might accelerate and then it'll spring back, and\n4:54\nactually, we'll do a little example of that.\n4:55\nBut really, just to displace the spring a certain distance,\n4:59\nyou have to just gradually increase the force, just so\n5:01\nthat you offset the restorative force.\n5:04\nHopefully, that makes sense, and you understand that the\n5:06\nforce just increases proportionally as a function\n5:09\nof the distance, and that's just because\n5:11\nthis is a linear equation.\n5:12\nAnd what's the slope of this?\n5:14\nWell, slope is rise over run, right?\n5:17\nSo if I run 1, this is 1, what's my rise?\n5:23\nIt's K.\n5:24\nSo the slope of this graph is K.\n5:28\nSo using this graph, let's figure out how much work we\n5:31\nneed to do to compress this spring.\n5:35\nI don't know, let's say this is x0.\n5:39\nSo x is where it's the general variable.\n5:41\nX0 is a particular value for x.\n5:42\nThat could be 10 or whatever.\n5:44\nLet's see how much work we need.\n5:46\nSo what's the definition of work?\n5:48\nWork is equal to the force in the direction of your\n5:52\ndisplacement times the displacement, right?\n5:57\nSo let's see how much we've displaced.\n5:59\nSo when we go from zero to here, we've\n6:05\ndisplaced this much.\n6:06\nAnd what was the force of the displacement?\n6:08\nWell, the force was gradually increasing the entire time, so\n6:11\nthe force is going to be be roughly about that big.\n6:16\nI'm approximating.\n6:17\nAnd I'll show you that you actually have to approximate.\n6:19\nSo the force is kind of that square right there.\n6:25\nAnd then to displace the next little distance-- that's not\n6:31\nbright enough-- my force is going to increase a little\n6:34\nbit, right?\n6:35\nSo this is the force, this is the distance.\n6:38\nSo if you you see, the work I'm doing is actually going to\n6:41\nbe the area under the curve, each of\n6:42\nthese rectangles, right?\n6:43\nBecause the height of the rectangle is the force I'm\n6:46\napplying and the width is the distance, right?\n6:50\nSo the work is just going to be the sum of all of these\n6:52\nrectangles.\n6:53\nAnd the rectangles I drew are just kind of approximations,\n6:56\nbecause they don't get right under the line.\n6:57\nYou have to keep making the rectangle smaller, smaller,\n6:59\nsmaller, and smaller, and just sum up more and more and more\n7:02\nrectangles, right?\n7:04\nAnd actually I'm touching on integral calculus right now.\n7:07\nBut if you don't know integral calculus,\n7:09\ndon't worry about it.\n7:09\nBut the bottom line is the work we're doing-- hopefully I\n7:12\nshowed you-- is just going to be the area under this line.\n7:16\nSo the work I'm doing to displace the spring x meters\n7:20\nis the area from here to here.\n7:26\nAnd what's that area?\n7:27\nWell, this is a triangle, so we just need to know the base,\n7:30\nthe height, and multiply it times 1/2, right?\n7:32\nThat's just the area of a triangle.\n7:34\nSo what's the base?\n7:36\nSo this is just x0.\n7:39\nWhat's the height?\n7:41\nWell, we know the slope is K, so this height is going to be\n7:44\nx0 times K.\n7:47\nSo this point right here is the point x0, and\n7:51\nthen x0 times K.\n7:54\nAnd so what's the area under the curve, which is the total\n7:57\nwork I did to compress the spring x0 meters?\n8:02\nWell, it's the base, x0, times the height, x0, times K.\n8:09\nAnd then, of course, multiply by 1/2, because we're dealing\n8:12\nwith a triangle, right?\n8:14\nSo that equals 1/2K x0 squared.\n8:19\nAnd for those of you who know calculus, that, of course, is\n8:22\nthe same thing as the integral of Kx dx.\n8:25\nAnd that should make sense.\n8:27\nEach of these are little dx's.\n8:28\nBut I don't want to go too much into calculus now.\n8:29\nIt'll confuse people.\n8:31\nSo that's the total work necessary to compress the\n8:33\nspring by distance of x0.\n8:36\nOr if we set a distance of x, you can just get\n8:38\nrid of this 0 here.\n8:40\nAnd why is that useful?\n8:41\nBecause the work necessary to compress the spring that much\n8:44\nis also how much potential energy there is\n8:47\nstored in the spring.\n8:49\nSo if I told you that I had a spring and its spring constant\n8:57\nis 10, and I compressed it 5 meters, so x is equal to 5\n9:03\nmeters, at the time that it's compressed, how much potential\n9:08\nenergy is in that spring?\n9:10\nWe can just say the potential energy is equal to 1/2K times\n9:15\nx squared equals 1/2.\n9:18\nK is 10 times 25, and that equals 125.\n9:25\nAnd, of course, work and potential energy\n9:26\nare measured in joules.\n9:29\nSo this is really what you just have to memorize.\n9:33\nOr hopefully you don't memorize it.\n9:34\nHopefully, you understand where I got it, and that's why\n9:36\nI spent 10 minutes doing it.\n9:38\nBut this is how much work is necessary to compress the\n9:39\nspring to that point and how much potential energy is\n9:43\nstored once it is compressed to that point, or actually\n9:45\nstretched that much.\n9:47\nWe've been compressing, but you can\n9:48\nalso stretch the spring.\n9:50\nIf you know that, then we can start doing some problems with\n9:53\npotential energy in springs, which I will\n9:56\ndo in the next video.\n9:57\nSee",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's start again with a point.\n0:02\nLet's call that point point A. And what I'm curious about\n0:05\nis all of the points on my screen right over here,\n0:08\nthat are exactly 2 centimeters away from A.\n0:11\nSo 2 centimeters on my screen is about that far.\n0:16\nSo clearly if I start at A and I go\n0:17\n2 centimeters in that direction, this point right over there,\n0:20\nis 2 centimeters from A. If I call that point, point B,\n0:23\nthen I could say line segment AB is 2 centimeters.\n0:27\nThe length is 2 centimeters.\n0:28\nRemember this would refer to the actual line segment.\n0:33\nI could say this looks nice, but if I talk about its length,\n0:36\nI would get rid of that line on top\n0:37\nand I would just say AB is equal to 2.\n0:39\nIf I wanted to put units I could say 2 centimenters.\n0:42\nBut I'm not curious just about B, I want to think about all\n0:45\nof the points, the set of all of the points\n0:47\nthat are exactly 2 centimeters away from A.\n0:51\nSo I could go 2 centimeters in the other direction,\n0:53\nmaybe get to point C right over here.\n0:57\nSo AC is also going to be equal to 2 centimeters,\n1:00\nbut I could go 2 centimeters in any direction.\n1:02\nAnd so if I find the set of all of the points\n1:04\nthat are exactly 2 centimeters away from A,\n1:07\nI will get a very familiar looking shape, like this,\n1:11\nand I'm trying to draw it freehand.\n1:13\nSo I would get a shape that looks like this.\n1:16\nActually, let me draw it in.\n1:17\nI don't want to make you think that it's only the points where\n1:20\nthere's white, it's all of these points right over here.\n1:22\nI don't want to draw a dashed line over there, which maybe I\n1:25\nshould just, let me clear out all of these\n1:28\nand I'll just draw it as a solid line.\n1:31\nSo this could look something like that.\n1:36\nMy best attempt.\n1:38\nAnd this set of all of the points that\n1:40\nare exactly 2 centimeters away from A,\n1:43\nthis is a circle, as I'm sure you are already familiar with.\n1:47\nBut that is the formal definition-- the set\n1:49\nof all points that are a fixed distance,\n1:51\nor that have a fixed distance, from A\n1:53\nthat are a given distance from A.\n1:55\nIf I said the set of all points that are 3 centimeters from A,\n1:58\nit might look something like this.\n2:00\nIt might look something like that.\n2:02\nThat would give us another circle.\n2:06\nI think you get the general idea.\n2:07\nNow what I want to do in this video\n2:09\nis introduce ourselves into some of the concepts and words\n2:14\nthat we use when dealing with circles.\n2:16\nSo let me get rid of that 3-centimeter circle.\n2:18\nSo first of all, let's think about this distance.\n2:22\nThis distance, or one of these line segments\n2:26\nthat join A, which we would call the center of the circle.\n2:30\nSo we'll call A the center of the circle,\n2:32\nand it makes sense just from the way\n2:33\nwe use the word center in everyday life.\n2:36\nWhat I want to do is think about what line segment AB is.\n2:41\nAB connects the center and it connects a point on the circle\n2:45\nitself.\n2:46\nRemember, the circle itself is all of the points that\n2:48\nare equal distance from the center.\n2:50\nSo AB, any line segment, I should say,\n2:53\nthat connects the center to a point on the circle,\n2:56\nwe would call a radius.\n3:01\nAnd so the length of the radius, AB over here,\n3:03\nis equal to 2 centimeters.\n3:05\nAnd you're probably already familiar with the word radius,\n3:07\nbut I'm just being a little bit more formal.\n3:09\nAnd what's interesting about geometry,\n3:11\nat least when you start learning it at the high school level,\n3:13\nis it's probably the first class where you're\n3:15\nintroduced into a slightly more formal mathematics, where we're\n3:18\na little bit more careful about giving our definitions\n3:21\nand then building on those definitions\n3:23\nto come up with interesting results\n3:24\nand proving to ourselves that we definitely\n3:27\nknow what we think we know.\n3:28\nAnd so that's why we're being a little bit more\n3:30\ncareful with our language over here.\n3:33\nSo AB is our radius, line segment AB, and so\n3:36\nis line segment-- let me draw another point on here,\n3:41\nlet's say this is X-- so line segment AX is also a radius.\n3:52\nNow you can also have other forms of lines and line\n3:55\nsegments that interact in interesting ways\n3:58\nwith the circle.\n3:59\nSo you could have a line that just intersects\n4:02\nthat circle at exactly one point.\n4:05\nSo let's call that point right over there, let's call that D.\n4:08\nAnd let's say you have a line, and the only point\n4:12\non the circle-- the only point in the set of all of the points\n4:16\nthat are equal distant from A, the only point on that circle\n4:19\nthat is also on that line is point D.\n4:22\nAnd we could call that line l.\n4:25\nSo sometimes you'll see lines specified\n4:27\nby some of the points on them.\n4:29\nSo for example, if I had another point right over here called E,\n4:32\nwe could call this line line DE, or we could just\n4:37\nput a little script letter here with an l\n4:39\nand say this is line l.\n4:41\nBut this line that only has one point in common\n4:44\nwith our circle, we call this a tangent line.\n4:47\nSo line l is a tangent.\n4:49\nIt is tangent to the circle.\n4:54\nSo let me write it this way, line l\n4:58\nis tangent-- you normally wouldn't write it\n5:01\nin caps like this, I'm just doing\n5:02\nthat for emphasis-- is tangent to-- instead of writing\n5:06\nthe circle centered at A, you'll sometimes\n5:09\nsee this notation-- to the circle centered at A.\n5:13\nSo this tells us that this is the circle we're talking about.\n5:15\nBecause who knows, maybe we had another circle over here\n5:18\nthat is centered at M, another circle.\n5:21\nSo we have to specify it's not tangent to that one,\n5:23\nit's tangent to this one.\n5:24\nSo this circle with a dot in the middle\n5:26\ntells we're talking about a circle,\n5:28\nand this is a circle centered at point\n5:30\nA. I want to be very clear, point A is not on the circle,\n5:33\npoint A is the center of the circle.\n5:35\nThe points on the circle are the points equal distant\n5:38\nfrom point A. Now, l is tangent, because it only\n5:42\nintersects the circle in one point.\n5:44\nYou could just as easily imagine a line\n5:48\nthat intersects the circle at two points.\n5:51\nSo we could call, maybe this is F and this is G,\n5:55\nyou could call that line FG.\n5:58\nSo we could write it like this, line FG.\n6:01\nAnd this line that intersects it at two points,\n6:03\nwe call this a secant of circle A.\n6:09\nIt is a secant line to this circle right over here,\n6:14\nbecause it intersects it in two points.\n6:16\nNow, if FG was just a segment, if it\n6:19\ndidn't keep on going forever, like lines like to do,\n6:22\nif we only spoke about this line segment--\n6:25\nlet me do this in a new color-- if we only spoke\n6:28\nabout this line segment between F and G,\n6:32\nand not thinking about going on forever, then all of a sudden\n6:35\nwe have a line segment, which we would specify there.\n6:38\nAnd we would call this a chord of the circle,\n6:43\na chord of circle A. It starts at a point on the circle,\n6:49\na point that is exactly in this case 2 centimeters away,\n6:52\nand then it finishes at a point on the circle.\n6:54\nSo it connects two points on the circle.\n6:58\nNow, you could have chords like this,\n7:00\nand you can also have a chord, as you can imagine,\n7:02\na chord that actually goes through the center\n7:04\nof the circle.\n7:06\nSo let's call this point, point H,\n7:09\nand you have a straight line connecting F to H through A.\n7:14\nSo that's about as straight as I could draw it.\n7:16\nSo if you have a chord like that,\n7:20\nthat contains the actual center of the circle,\n7:23\nof course it goes from one point of the circle\n7:25\nto another point of the circle, and it goes\n7:26\nthrough the center of the circle,\n7:28\nwe call that a diameter of A.\n7:39\nAnd you've probably seen this in tons of problems\n7:42\nbefore, when we were not talking about geometry as formally,\n7:46\nbut the diameter is made up of exactly two radiuses.\n7:51\nWe already know that a radius connects a point to the center.\n7:54\nSo you have one radius right over here\n7:56\nthat connects F and A, that's one radius,\n8:00\nand then you have another radius connecting\n8:02\nA and H, the center to a point on the circle.\n8:05\nSo the diameter is made up of these two radiuses,\n8:07\nor radii I should call it, I think\n8:09\nthat's the plural for radius.\n8:11\nAnd so the length of a diameter is\n8:13\ngoing to be twice the length of a radius.\n8:15\nSo we could say the length of the diameter, so the length\n8:19\nof FH-- and once again I don't put the line on top of it\n8:22\nwhen I'm just talking about the length--\n8:24\nis going to be equal to FA, the length of segment\n8:28\nFA, plus the length of segment AH.\n8:34\nNow there's one last thing I want\n8:36\nto talk about when we're dealing with circles,\n8:38\nand that's the idea of an arc.\n8:40\nSo we also have the parts of the circle itself.\n8:43\nSo let me draw another circle over here.\n8:46\nLet's center this circle right over here at B.\n8:49\nAnd I'm going to find all of the points that\n8:52\nare a given distance from B. So it has some radius,\n8:56\nI'm not going to specify it right over here,\n8:59\nand let me pick some random points on the circle.\n9:01\nSo let's call this J, let's call that K, let's call this S,\n9:10\nlet's call this T, let's call this U right over here.\n9:14\nAnd I know it doesn't look that centered, let me try to center\n9:16\nB a little bit better.\n9:17\nLet me erase that.\n9:19\nAnd if I put B a little bit closer\n9:21\nto the center of the circle, so that's my best shot, so let's\n9:25\nput B right over there.\n9:27\nNow, one interesting thing is, what do you\n9:29\ncall the length of the circle that goes between two points?\n9:33\nSo what would you call-- let me get a good color here--\n9:37\nwhat would you call this?\n9:38\nWell, you could imagine in everyday language\n9:40\nwe would call something that looks like that an arc,\n9:41\nand we would also call that an arc in geometry.\n9:44\nTo specify this arc we would call\n9:46\nthis JK, the two endpoints of the arc,\n9:50\nthe two points on the circle that\n9:51\nare the endpoints of the arc, and you\n9:53\nuse a little notation like that.\n9:55\nSo you put a little curve on top instead of a straight line.\n9:59\nNow you could also have another arc that connects JK,\n10:01\nthis is the minor arc.\n10:03\nIt is the shortest way along the circle to connect J and K,\n10:06\nbut you could also go the other way around.\n10:08\nYou could also have this thing that\n10:10\ngoes all the way around the circle.\n10:13\nAnd we would call that the major arc.\n10:15\nAnd normally when you specify a major arc, just\n10:17\nto show that you're going the long way around,\n10:21\nit's not the shortest way to get between J and K,\n10:23\nyou'll often specify another point\n10:24\nthat you're going through.\n10:25\nSo for example, this major arc we could specify we start at J,\n10:30\nwe went through-- we could have said U, T, or S,\n10:32\nbut I'll put T right over there-- we went through T\n10:34\nand then we went all the way to K.\n10:37\nAnd so this specifies the major arc\n10:40\nand this thing could have been the same thing as if I wrote\n10:42\nJUK, these are specifying the same thing, or JSK.\n10:48\nSo there's multiple ways to specify this major arc\n10:51\nright over here.\n10:51\nBut the one thing I make clear is,\n10:53\nis that the minor arc is the shortest distance,\n10:56\nso this is the minor arc, and the longer distance around\n11:01\nis the major arc.\n11:06\nAnd I'll leave you there and maybe the next few videos we'll\n11:09\nstart playing with some of this notation a little bit more.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the last video, we saw that sodium borohydride\n0:03\nwill reduce aldehydes or ketones to form\n0:06\nprimary or secondary alcohols.\n0:08\nAnd if we look at this general reaction,\n0:10\nthis is either an aldehyde or a ketone over here.\n0:13\nIf we add lithium aluminum hydride in the first step\n0:16\nand then a source of protons in the second step-- which\n0:19\nis water-- we will form either a primary or a secondary alcohol,\n0:23\ndepending on our starting materials.\n0:24\nSo in that respect, lithium aluminum hydride\n0:26\nwill react in the same way as sodium borohydride.\n0:29\nHowever, sodium borohydride will only\n0:32\nreduce aldehydes or ketones.\n0:34\nIt won't reduce carboxylic acids or esters.\n0:37\nAnd that's what lithium aluminum hydride does.\n0:39\nSo we can see that-- if this is an OH right here--\n0:43\nthat would be a carboxylic acid functional group.\n0:45\nAnd if we take off the H and put in an alkyl group\n0:47\nin our prime group there, we would have an ester.\n0:50\nSo lithium aluminum hydride, not only\n0:52\nreduces aldehydes and ketones, it also\n0:54\nreduces carboxylic acids and esters\n0:56\nsince it's more reactive, which is also\n0:58\nwhy we have to separate these two.\n1:00\nWe can't have water in the same reaction vessel\n1:02\nas our lithium aluminum hydride because it\n1:04\nwill react with that faster.\n1:06\nAnd so once again, our product will\n1:09\ndepend on what our starting material is.\n1:11\nSo the mechanism for the reduction\n1:13\nof aldehydes or ketones with lithium aluminum hydride\n1:15\nis just like the one for sodium borohydride.\n1:18\nSo we'll move on to a mechanism for the reduction of an ester.\n1:22\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n1:24\nSo let's start with an ester down here.\n1:26\nSo we have our carbonyl.\n1:28\nLike that.\n1:29\nSo we'll put in our lone pairs.\n1:31\nAnd down here, we have our R prime group.\n1:34\nLike that.\n1:35\nSo there's our ester.\n1:36\nAnd we add lithium aluminum hydride in excess.\n1:40\nSo in terms of molar equivalence,\n1:43\nlet's go ahead and put lithium aluminum hydride down here,\n1:46\nLi+.\n1:47\nAnd then, we have Al bonded to 4 hydrogens.\n1:51\nLike that.\n1:51\nAnd that's going to give the aluminum\n1:53\na negative 1 formal charge.\n1:55\nLike that.\n1:56\nSo the first step in the mechanism\n1:58\nis just like the one we did in the previous video.\n2:00\nAll right.\n2:01\nWe think about the carbonyl up here and the difference\n2:04\nin electronegativity between this carbon and this oxygen--\n2:08\noxygen being more electronegative,\n2:10\npulling these electrons closer towards it and the double bond,\n2:13\ngiving it a partial negative charge.\n2:16\nWhereas the carbon down here is losing some electron density,\n2:18\nbecoming partially positive.\n2:20\nSo the carbonyl carbon is an electrophile.\n2:23\nIt wants electrons.\n2:24\nAnd of course, it's going to get electrons\n2:26\nfrom these 2 electrons in here.\n2:28\nSo these 2 electrons are going to attack this carbon.\n2:32\nAll right.\n2:32\nSo a nucleophilic attack.\n2:34\nAnd kick these electrons off onto our oxygen.\n2:38\nSo that's our first step-- the nucleophilic attack portion.\n2:41\nSo now, we have R. And it used to have\n2:45\n2 bonds to carbon and oxygen.\n2:46\nNow, it has only 1 bond because those electrons\n2:49\nmoved off onto the oxygen, giving the oxygen\n2:52\na negative 1 formal charge.\n2:54\nLike that.\n2:55\nSo we added on our hydrogen.\n2:57\nLike that.\n2:58\nAnd then, we still have our O and our R prime group\n3:02\nover here.\n3:02\nSo it will look like that.\n3:04\nIn the next step of this reaction,\n3:07\nthe carbonyl's going to reform.\n3:09\nSo the electrons in here are going to kick back into here\n3:12\nto reform our carbonyl.\n3:14\nThat would mean 5 bonds to carbon--\n3:16\nwhich we know never happens-- so that these electrons are going\n3:18\nto have to break and come off onto the oxygen.\n3:22\nSo let's go ahead and draw the results of that.\n3:24\nSo now, we have R bonded to carbon.\n3:27\nNow, we reformed our carbonyls.\n3:29\nNow, we have only two lone pairs of electrons\n3:31\non that oxygen now.\n3:32\nAnd then, we still have a hydrogen.\n3:34\nRight here.\n3:35\nAll right.\n3:35\nSo we lost an oxygen with an R prime group.\n3:40\nAnd that oxygen is going to have three lone pairs around it\n3:43\nwith a negative 1 formal charge.\n3:44\nOxygen being relatively electronegative,\n3:47\nit can handle that formal charge fairly well\n3:49\nand be relatively stable.\n3:51\nSo now we have an aldehyde.\n3:53\nAnd we know that this reaction can occur again\n3:57\nwith an aldehyde.\n3:58\nSo since you have extra lithium aluminum hydride floating\n4:01\naround, what's going to happen is another reaction.\n4:03\nRight?\n4:04\nSo another reaction just like the one we just did.\n4:07\nWe're going to have our lithium aluminum hydride again.\n4:11\nIt's so reactive, you can't stop this reaction\n4:14\nfrom occurring a second time.\n4:16\nAnd same idea.\n4:18\nRight?\n4:18\nExact same idea.\n4:20\nPartial negative oxygen, partial positive carbon.\n4:23\nThe carbon wants electrons.\n4:27\nIt's going to get these electrons right in here.\n4:30\nSo these electrons are going to attack this carbon, bring\n4:33\nthe hydrogen along with it, and then\n4:35\nthese electrons kick off onto the oxygen.\n4:38\nSo let's go ahead and draw the product\n4:40\nof that nucleophilic attack.\n4:42\nRight now, we have an R group here\n4:44\nand we have our carbon bonded to an oxygen.\n4:47\nOnce again, it used to have two lone pairs.\n4:49\nNow it has three, giving it a negative 1 formal charge.\n4:52\nAnd this hydrogen over here on the right\n4:54\nis going to stay here.\n4:55\nAnd we added on another hydrogen.\n4:57\nLike that.\n4:58\nAll right.\n4:58\nSo in the second step of this reaction,\n5:01\nwe're going to add water.\n5:03\nSo we go back up here to refresh our memory.\n5:05\nIn the second step of this reaction,\n5:08\nyou add water as a proton source.\n5:11\nSo let's go ahead and draw water floating around there.\n5:15\nSo here is our H20 molecule.\n5:17\nAnd we're going to get an acid-base reaction.\n5:20\nWe're going to get a lone pair of electrons\n5:23\nattacking and grabbing that proton\n5:25\nthere, kicking these electrons off onto the oxygen.\n5:28\nSo we're going to protonate that alkoxide anion.\n5:31\nSo you form our alcohol finally.\n5:34\nSo we're finally done.\n5:35\nNow, we have r and then we have oxygen bonded\n5:37\nto that hydrogen there.\n5:39\nAnd now only two lone pairs, the formal charge goes away.\n5:42\nAnd you can see what we've done here.\n5:44\nWe've actually added on two hydrogens\n5:48\nto our original carbonyl carbon.\n5:50\nAll right.\n5:52\nThis is my original carbonyl carbon.\n5:54\nAnd if I look at it over here, there's\n5:57\nactually no hydrogen attached to it over here.\n5:59\nBoth of those hydrogens came from our lithium aluminum\n6:03\nhydride.\n6:04\nSo this one and this one.\n6:06\nSo the reaction happened twice.\n6:09\nAll right.\n6:09\nSo if you're doing this reaction with a carboxylic acid,\n6:13\nit's a similar mechanism.\n6:15\nWe don't have time to go through it.\n6:16\nBut you're going to end up with the same product.\n6:20\nYou're going to add on two hydrogens\n6:22\non to that original carbonyl carbon.\n6:24\nLike that.\n6:25\nSo let's look at the chemoselectivity\n6:28\nof this reaction.\n6:29\nOK.\n6:29\nSo now that we've covered sodium borohydride and lithium\n6:32\naluminum hydride, let's see how you\n6:35\ncan choose which one of those reagents is the best to use.\n6:38\nSo if I start here with our reactants-- so let's\n6:43\nmake it a benzene ring.\n6:44\nLike that.\n6:45\nAnd let's put stuff on the benzene ring.\n6:47\nOK.\n6:47\nSo let's go ahead and put a double bond here.\n6:50\nAnd then, we'll make this an aldehyde functional group\n6:53\non one end.\n6:54\nAnd then over here on this end, I'm going to put an ester.\n7:00\nLike that.\n7:01\nAnd let's look at how we can selectively\n7:06\ntransform different parts of this molecule using\n7:08\ndifferent reagents.\n7:10\nSo let's say we were to do a reaction wherein\n7:15\nwe add on sodium borohydride.\n7:18\nAnd then, the proton source in the second step.\n7:22\nSo we need to think about what's going to happen.\n7:25\nSodium borohydride is selective for aldehydes and ketones only.\n7:30\nIt will not reduce carboxylic acids or esters.\n7:34\nSo it's only going to react with the aldehyde at the top right\n7:39\nportion of this molecule.\n7:41\nSo let's see if we can draw this in here.\n7:43\nSo it's going to react with the aldehyde in the top right\n7:46\nportion.\n7:47\nAll right.\n7:47\nSo we are still going to have our double bond here.\n7:51\nAnd the aldehyde's going to go away to form a primary alcohol.\n7:56\nSo we're going to get primary alcohol\n7:58\nwhere the aldehyde used to be.\n7:59\nSodium borohydride has reduced that carbonyl.\n8:02\nAnd the second step-- the protonation of the alkyloxide--\n8:04\nforms your primary alcohol as your product.\n8:07\nAnd the rest of the molecule's going to stay the same.\n8:10\nSo this ester is going to remain untouched down here.\n8:13\nSo it's the chemoselectivity of that reaction.\n8:17\nAll right.\n8:17\nLet's say we start with the same starting material.\n8:21\nAnd the first step-- this time we\n8:22\nadd lithium aluminum hydride.\n8:24\nLike that.\n8:25\nAnd the second step-- we add some water.\n8:29\nWell, lithium aluminum hydride will\n8:31\nreduce aldehydes and ketones, and it will also reduce esters.\n8:36\nSo lithium aluminum hydride in excess--\n8:38\nso let's just assume this is at an excess\n8:40\nhere-- it's going to react with this aldehyde portion\n8:44\nof the molecule.\n8:45\nIt's also going to react with this ester\n8:47\nportion of the molecule.\n8:48\nSo it's going to reduce both of those and form alcohol.\n8:51\nSo let's go ahead and try to draw the product here.\n8:53\nAll right.\n8:53\nSo we have our benzene ring, which is untouched.\n8:56\nAnd up here, we know that lithium aluminum hydride\n9:01\nis going to form a primary alcohol as well.\n9:03\nLike that.\n9:04\nAnd then, down here, what used to be our ester functional\n9:08\ngroup, we're going to add two molar equivalents of hydrogen\n9:11\nto that carbonyl.\n9:12\nAnd we're going to end up breaking\n9:16\nthat bond between the carbonyl carbon and that oxygen.\n9:20\nAll of this over here is going to go away\n9:22\nas a leaving group in our mechanism.\n9:24\nAnd we're going to add on two hydrogens to that carbon.\n9:29\nAnd then, that's going to form our alcohol.\n9:31\nSo we're going to add two hydrogens onto that carbon,\n9:34\nforming a primary alcohol down here as well-- just\n9:37\nlike in the mechanism that we just discussed.\n9:39\nSo reduction of esters using lithium aluminum hydride.\n9:43\nWhat about if we were to add a hydrogen gas\n9:47\nand palladium as our metal catalyst here?\n9:51\nWell, this is also a reduction reaction\n9:54\nthat we talked about earlier.\n9:55\nHydrogenation is an example of a reduction reaction.\n9:59\nAnd it's going to be chemoselective.\n10:01\nIf you just used the normal conditions for a hydrogenation\n10:05\nreaction, the only thing the hydrogenation reaction\n10:08\nis going to touch is this double bond.\n10:10\nIt's going to reduce this double bond.\n10:13\nSo let's go ahead and draw the product.\n10:14\nIt's not going to touch the aldehyde.\n10:16\nIt's not going to touch the ester.\n10:17\nAnd it's not going to touch the benzene ring.\n10:19\nSo let's go ahead and draw the product.\n10:21\nThe benzene ring is not hydrogenated\n10:25\nunder normal conditions, but we're\n10:27\ngoing to add on two hydrogens across that double bond.\n10:30\nAnd the aldehyde is untouched.\n10:32\nAnd down here, the ester is going to be untouched as well.\n10:37\nSo that would be our product from a hydrogenation.\n10:40\nSo three different reductions, three different products.\n10:44\nNow, hydrogen will reduce carbonyls\n10:47\nunder the right conditions.\n10:48\nUsually, if you have increased pressure and increased\n10:51\ntemperatures, you actually can reduce those carbonyls.\n10:55\nBut again, you can control those conditions.\n10:58\nSo you can control what part of the molecule is reduced.\n11:01\nSo that sums up the ways to reduce carbonyl compounds using\n11:07\nsodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride.\n11:10\nIn the next video or two, we'll take a look\n11:12\nat organometallics and particularly\n11:14\nthe Grignard reagent.",

three ones that we normally deal with are, things\n0:10\ncould be a solid, a liquid, or it could be a gas.\n0:22\nAnd we have this general notion, and I think water is\n0:25\nthe example that always comes to at least my mind.\n0:29\nIs that solid happens when things are\n0:30\ncolder, relatively colder.\n0:33\nAnd then as you warm up, you go into a liquid state.\n0:37\nAnd as your warm up even more you go into a gaseous state.\n0:40\nSo you go from colder to hotter.\n0:44\nAnd in the case of water, when you're a solid, you're ice.\n0:51\nWhen you're a liquid, some people would call ice water,\n0:55\nbut let's call it liquid water.\n0:58\nI think we know what that is.\n1:01\nAnd then when it's in the gas state, you're essentially\n1:04\nvapor or steam.\n1:12\nSo let's think a little bit about what, at least in the\n1:14\ncase of water, and the analogy will extend to\n1:17\nother types of molecules.\n1:19\nBut what is it about water that makes it solid, and when\n1:22\nit's colder, what allows it to be liquid.\n1:24\nAnd I'll be frank, liquids are kind of fascinating because\n1:28\nyou can never nail them down, I guess is the\n1:31\nbest way to view them.\n1:32\nOr a gas.\n1:34\nSo let's just draw a water molecule.\n1:39\nSo you have oxygen there.\n1:42\nYou have some bonds to hydrogen.\n1:47\nAnd then you have two extra pairs of valence electrons in\n1:50\nthe oxygen.\n1:51\nAnd a couple of videos ago, we said oxygen is a lot more\n1:55\nelectronegative than the hydrogen.\n1:58\nIt likes to hog the electrons.\n2:00\nSo even though this shows that they're sharing\n2:04\nelectrons here and here.\n2:06\nAt both sides of those lines, you can kind of view that\n2:08\nhydrogen is contributing an electron and oxygen is\n2:10\ncontributing an electron on both sides of that line.\n2:13\nBut we know because of the electronegativity, or the\n2:15\nrelative electronegativity of oxygen, that it's hogging\n2:18\nthese electrons.\n2:19\nAnd so the electrons spend a lot more time around the\n2:22\noxygen than they do around the hydrogen.\n2:24\nAnd what that results is that on the oxygen side of the\n2:27\nmolecule, you end up with a partial negative charge.\n2:32\nAnd we talked about that a little bit.\n2:33\nAnd on the hydrogen side of the molecules, you end up with\n2:35\na slightly positive charge.\n2:44\nNow, if these molecules have very little kinetic energy,\n2:51\nthey're not moving around a whole lot, then the positive\n2:56\nsides of the hydrogens are very attracted to the negative\n2:59\nsides of oxygen in other molecules.\n3:03\nLet me draw some more molecules.\n3:04\nWhen we talk about the whole state of the whole matter, we\n3:06\nactually think about how the molecules are interacting with\n3:10\neach other.\n3:10\nNot just how the atoms are interacting with each other\n3:13\nwithin a molecule.\n3:16\nI just drew one oxygen, let me copy and paste that.\n3:20\nBut I could do multiple oxygens.\n3:22\nAnd let's say that that hydrogen is going to want to\n3:26\nbe near this oxygen.\n3:28\nBecause this has partial negative charge, this has a\n3:30\npartial positive charge.\n3:32\nAnd then I could do another one right there.\n3:37\nAnd then maybe we'll have, and just to make the point clear,\n3:40\nyou have two hydrogens here, maybe an oxygen\n3:43\nwants to hang out there.\n3:45\nSo maybe you have an oxygen that wants to be here because\n3:49\nit's got its partial negative here.\n3:52\nAnd it's connected to two hydrogens right there that\n3:55\nhave their partial positives.\n3:57\nBut you can kind of see a lattice structure.\n4:00\nLet me draw these bonds, these polar bonds that start forming\n4:05\nbetween the particles.\n4:08\nThese bonds, they're called polar bonds because the\n4:10\nmolecules themselves are polar.\n4:14\nAnd you can see it forms this lattice structure.\n4:16\nAnd if each of these molecules don't have a\n4:19\nlot of kinetic energy.\n4:21\nOr we could say the average kinetic energy of this matter\n4:26\nis fairly low.\n4:27\nAnd what do we know is average kinetic energy?\n4:29\nWell, that's temperature.\n4:30\nThen this lattice structure will be solid.\n4:33\nThese molecules will not move relative to each other.\n4:37\nI could draw a gazillion more, but I think you get the point\n4:40\nthat we're forming this kind of fixed structure.\n4:44\nAnd while we're in the solid state, as we add kinetic\n4:48\nenergy, as we add heat, what it does to molecules is, it\n4:52\njust makes them vibrate around a little bit.\n4:57\nIf I was a cartoonist, they way you'd draw a vibration is\n4:59\nto put quotation marks there.\n5:01\nThat's not very scientific.\n5:03\nBut they would vibrate around, they would buzz around a\n5:05\nlittle bit.\n5:06\nI'm drawing arrows to show that they are vibrating.\n5:08\nIt doesn't have to be just\n5:09\nleft-right it could be up-down.\n5:10\nBut as you add more and more heat in a solid, these\n5:14\nmolecules are going to keep their structure.\n5:16\nSo they're not going to move around relative to each other.\n5:19\nBut they will convert that heat, and heat is just a form\n5:23\nof energy, into kinetic energy which is expressed as the\n5:27\nvibration of these molecules.\n5:29\nNow, if you make these molecules start to vibrate\n5:33\nenough, and if you put enough kinetic energy into these\n5:35\nmolecules, what do you think is going to happen?\n5:37\nWell this guy is vibrating pretty hard, and he's\n5:39\nvibrating harder and harder as you add more and more heat.\n5:42\nThis guy is doing the same thing.\n5:43\nAt some point, these polar bonds that they have to each\n5:46\nother are going to start not being strong enough to contain\n5:50\nthe vibrations.\n5:52\nAnd once that happens, the molecules-- let me draw a\n5:57\ncouple more.\n5:58\nOnce that happens, the molecules are going to start\n6:01\nmoving past each other.\n6:07\nSo now all of a sudden, the molecule will start shifting.\n6:13\nBut they're still attracted.\n6:14\nMaybe this side is moving here, that's moving there.\n6:17\nYou have other molecules moving around that way.\n6:19\nBut they're still attracted to each other.\n6:22\nEven though we've gotten the kinetic energy to the point\n6:25\nthat the vibrations can kind of break the bonds between the\n6:31\npolar sides of the molecules.\n6:34\nOur vibration, or our kinetic energy for each molecule,\n6:38\nstill isn't strong enough to completely separate them.\n6:40\nThey're starting to slide past each other.\n6:43\nAnd this is essentially what happens when you're in a\n6:44\nliquid state.\n6:46\nYou have a lot of atoms that want be touching each other\n6:49\nbut they're sliding.\n6:50\nThey have enough kinetic energy to slide past each\n6:53\nother and break that solid lattice structure here.\n6:57\nAnd then if you add even more kinetic energy, even more\n7:00\nheat, at this point it's a solution now.\n7:05\nThey're not even going to be able to stay together.\n7:07\nThey're not going to be able to stay near each other.\n7:08\nIf you add enough kinetic energy they're going to start\n7:11\nlooking like this.\n7:12\nThey're going to completely separate and then kind of\n7:15\nbounce around independently.\n7:17\nEspecially independently if they're an ideal gas.\n7:19\nBut in general, in gases, they're no longer touching\n7:22\neach other.\n7:22\nThey might bump into each other.\n7:25\nBut they have so much kinetic energy on their own that\n7:28\nthey're all doing their own thing\n7:29\nand they're not touching.\n7:31\nI think that makes intuitive sense if you just think about\n7:33\nwhat a gas is.\n7:36\nFor example, it's hard to see a gas.\n7:37\nWhy is it hard to see a gas?\n7:39\nBecause the molecules are much further apart.\n7:41\nSo they're not acting on the light in the way that a liquid\n7:46\nor a solid would.\n7:47\nAnd if we keep making that extended further, a solid--\n7:50\nwell, I probably shouldn't use the example with ice.\n7:53\nBecause ice or water is one of the few situations where the\n7:56\nsolid is less dense than the liquid.\n7:58\nThat's why ice floats.\n8:00\nAnd that's why icebergs don't just all fall to the\n8:02\nbottom of the ocean.\n8:03\nAnd ponds don't completely freeze solid.\n8:07\nBut you can imagine that, because a liquid is in most\n8:11\ncases other than water, less dense.\n8:13\nThat's another reason why you can see through it a little\n8:15\nbit better.\n8:15\nOr it's not diffracting-- well I won't go into that too much,\n8:18\nthan maybe even a solid.\n8:20\nBut the gas is the most obvious.\n8:21\nAnd it is true with water.\n8:23\nThe liquid form is definitely more dense than the gas form.\n8:27\nIn the gas form, the molecules are going to jump around, not\n8:31\ntouch each other.\n8:32\nAnd because of that, more light can\n8:35\nget through the substance.\n8:37\nNow the question is, how do we measure the amount of heat\n8:40\nthat it takes to do this to water?\n8:44\nAnd to explain that, I'll actually draw a\n8:47\nphase change diagram.\n8:49\nWhich is a fancy way of describing something fairly\n8:53\nstraightforward.\n8:54\nLet me say that this is the amount of heat I'm adding.\n8:57\nAnd this is the temperature.\n8:59\nWe'll talk about the states of matter in a second.\n9:02\nSo heat is often denoted by q.\n9:06\nSometimes people will talk about change in heat.\n9:09\nThey'll use H, lowercase and uppercase H.\n9:11\nThey'll put a delta in front of the H.\n9:13\nDelta just means change in.\n9:15\nAnd sometimes you'll hear the word enthalpy.\n9:17\nLet me write that.\n9:18\nBecause I used to say what is enthalpy?\n9:26\nIt sounds like empathy, but it's\n9:29\nquite a different concept.\n9:30\nAt least, as far as my neural connections could make it.\n9:33\nBut enthalpy is closely related to heat.\n9:36\nIt's heat content.\n9:45\nFor our purposes, when you hear someone say change in\n9:49\nenthalpy, you should really just be thinking\n9:51\nof change in heat.\n9:52\nI think this word was really just introduced to confuse\n9:56\nchemistry students and introduce a non-intuitive word\n10:00\ninto their vocabulary.\n10:02\nThe best way to think about it is heat content.\n10:04\nChange in enthalpy is really just change in heat.\n10:07\nAnd just remember, all of these things, whether we're\n10:09\ntalking about heat, kinetic energy,\n10:13\npotential energy, enthalpy.\n10:16\nYou'll hear them in different contexts, and you're like, I\n10:18\nthought I should be using heat and they're\n10:19\ntalking about enthalpy.\n10:21\nThese are all forms of energy.\n10:23\nAnd these are all measured in joules.\n10:26\nAnd they might be measured in other ways, but the\n10:28\ntraditional way is in joules.\n10:29\nAnd energy is the ability to do work.\n10:31\nAnd what's the unit for work?\n10:33\nWell, it's joules.\n10:34\nForce times distance.\n10:35\nBut anyway, that's a side-note.\n10:37\nBut it's good to know this word enthalpy.\n10:38\nEspecially in a chemistry context, because it's used all\n10:40\nthe time and it can be very confusing and non-intuitive.\n10:43\nBecause you're like, I don't know what enthalpy is in my\n10:46\neveryday life.\n10:47\nJust think of it as heat contact, because that's really\n10:50\nwhat it is.\n10:50\nBut anyway, on this axis, I have heat.\n10:55\nSo this is when I have very little heat and I'm\n10:57\nincreasing my heat.\n10:58\nAnd this is temperature.\n11:05\nNow let's say at low temperatures I'm here and as I\n11:09\nadd heat my temperature will go up.\n11:12\nTemperature is average kinetic energy.\n11:14\nLet's say I'm in the solid state here.\n11:16\nAnd I'll do the solid state in purple.\n11:21\nNo I already was using purple.\n11:23\nI'll use magenta.\n11:26\nSo as I add heat, my temperature will go up.\n11:29\nHeat is a form of energy.\n11:31\nAnd when I add it to these molecules, as I did in this\n11:36\nexample, what did it do?\n11:37\nIt made them vibrate more.\n11:38\nOr it made them have higher kinetic energy, or higher\n11:41\naverage kinetic engery, and that's what temperature is a\n11:43\nmeasure of; average kinetic energy.\n11:46\nSo as I add heat in the solid phase, my average kinetic\n11:50\nenergy will go up.\n11:51\nAnd let me write this down.\n11:52\nThis is in the solid phase, or the solid state of matter.\n11:58\nNow something very interesting happens.\n12:01\nLet's say this is water.\n12:03\nSo what happens at zero degrees?\n12:09\nWhich is also 273.15 Kelvin.\n12:14\nLet's say that's that line.\n12:15\nWhat happens to a solid?\n12:18\nWell, it turns into a liquid.\n12:19\nIce melts.\n12:20\nNot all solids, we're talking in particular about\n12:22\nwater, about H2O.\n12:25\nSo this is ice in our example.\n12:27\nAll solids aren't ice.\n12:29\nAlthough, you could think of a rock as solid magma.\n12:33\nBecause that's what it is.\n12:38\nI could take that analogy a bunch of different ways.\n12:41\nBut the interesting thing that happens at zero degrees.\n12:49\nDepending on what direction you're going, either the\n12:51\nfreezing point of water or the melting point of ice,\n12:53\nsomething interesting happens.\n12:55\nAs I add more heat, the temperature does not to go up.\n13:00\nAs I add more heat, the temperature does not go up for\n13:03\na little period.\n13:05\nLet me draw that.\n13:07\nFor a little period, the temperature stays constant.\n13:10\nAnd then while the temperature is constant, it stays a solid.\n13:14\nWe're still a solid.\n13:16\nAnd then, we finally turn into a liquid.\n13:22\nLet's say right there.\n13:23\nSo we added a certain amount of heat and it\n13:25\njust stayed a solid.\n13:26\nBut it got us to the point that the ice\n13:28\nturned into a liquid.\n13:29\nIt was kind of melting the entire time.\n13:31\nThat's the best way to think about it.\n13:32\nAnd then, once we keep adding more and more heat, then the\n13:36\nliquid warms up too.\n13:42\nNow, we get to, what temperature becomes\n13:45\ninteresting again for water?\n13:46\nWell, obviously 100 degrees Celsius or 373 degrees Kelvin.\n13:56\nI'll do it in Celsius because that's what\n13:57\nwe're familiar with.\n13:59\nWhat happens?\n13:59\nThat's the temperature at which water will vaporize or\n14:03\nwhich water will boil.\n14:05\nBut something happens.\n14:07\nAnd they're really getting kinetically active.\n14:13\nBut just like when you went from solid to liquid, there's\n14:16\na certain amount of energy that you have to contribute to\n14:19\nthe system.\n14:20\nAnd actually, it's a good amount at this point.\n14:23\nWhere the water is turning into vapor, but it's not\n14:26\ngetting any hotter.\n14:31\nSo we have to keep adding heat, but notice that the\n14:34\ntemperature didn't go up.\n14:35\nWe'll talk about it in a second what\n14:37\nwas happening then.\n14:38\nAnd then finally, after that point, we're completely\n14:43\nvaporized, or we're completely steam.\n14:46\nThen we can start getting hot, the steam can then get hotter\n14:48\nas we add more and more heat to the system.\n14:53\nSo the interesting question, I think it's intuitive, that as\n14:55\nyou add heat here, our temperature is going to go up.\n15:01\nBut the interesting thing is, what was going on here?\n15:03\nWe were adding heat.\n15:04\nSo over here we were turning our heat into kinetic energy.\n15:07\nTemperature is average kinetic energy.\n15:10\nBut over here, what was our heat doing?\n15:12\nWell, our heat was was not adding kinetic\n15:15\nenergy to the system.\n15:16\nThe temperature was not increasing.\n15:17\nBut the ice was going from ice to water.\n15:20\nSo what was happening at that state, is that the kinetic\n15:24\nenergy, the heat, was being used to essentially break\n15:29\nthese bonds.\n15:32\nAnd essentially bring the molecules into a\n15:34\nhigher energy state.\n15:35\nSo you're saying, Sal, what does that mean,\n15:37\nhigher energy state?\n15:38\nWell, if there wasn't all of this heat and all this kinetic\n15:42\nenergy, these molecules want to be very\n15:44\nclose to each other.\n15:46\nFor example, I want to be close to the\n15:49\nsurface of the earth.\n15:50\nWhen you put me in a plane you have put me in a\n15:52\nhigher energy state.\n15:53\nI have a lot more potential energy.\n15:56\nI have the potential to fall towards the earth.\n15:58\nLikewise, when you move these molecules apart, and you go\n16:02\nfrom a solid to a liquid, they want to fall\n16:05\ntowards each other.\n16:06\nBut because they have so much kinetic energy, they never\n16:08\nquite are able to do it.\n16:10\nBut their energy goes up.\n16:12\nTheir potential energy is higher because they want to\n16:14\nfall towards each other.\n16:15\nBy falling towards each other, in theory, they\n16:18\ncould do some work.\n16:21\nSo what's happening here is, when we're contributing heat--\n16:26\nand this amount of heat we're contributing, it's called the\n16:32\nheat of fusion.\n16:36\nBecause it's the same amount of heat regardless how much\n16:39\ndirection we go in.\n16:40\nWhen we go from solid to liquid, you view it as the\n16:43\nheat of melting.\n16:45\nIt's the head that you need to put in to melt\n16:48\nthe ice into liquid.\n16:49\nWhen you're going in this direction, it's the heat you\n16:51\nhave to take out of the zero degree water to\n16:55\nturn it into ice.\n16:58\nSo you're taking that potential energy and you're\n17:01\nbringing the molecules closer and closer to each other.\n17:05\nSo the way to think about it is, right here this heat is\n17:08\nbeing converted to kinetic energy.\n17:10\nThen, when we're at this phase change from solid to liquid,\n17:15\nthat heat is being used to add potential\n17:16\nenergy into the system.\n17:18\nTo pull the molecules apart, to give them\n17:21\nmore potential energy.\n17:22\nIf you pull me apart from the earth, you're giving me\n17:25\npotential energy.\n17:26\nBecause gravity wants to pull me back to the earth.\n17:29\nAnd I could do work when I'm falling back to the earth.\n17:32\nA waterfall does work.\n17:33\nIt can move a turbine.\n17:35\nYou could have a bunch of falling Sals move\n17:37\na turbine as well.\n17:39\nAnd then, once you are fully a liquid, then you just become a\n17:42\nwarmer and warmer liquid.\n17:43\nNow the heat is, once again, being used for kinetic energy.\n17:48\nYou're making the water molecules move past each other\n17:51\nfaster, and faster, and faster.\n17:53\nTo some point where they want to completely disassociate\n17:57\nfrom each other.\n17:58\nThey want to not even slide past each other, just\n18:00\ncompletely jump away from each other.\n18:03\nAnd that's right here.\n18:04\nThis is the heat of vaporization.\n18:13\nAnd the same idea is happening.\n18:15\nBefore we were sliding next to each other, now we're pulling\n18:17\napart altogether.\n18:19\nSo they could definitely fall closer together.\n18:22\nAnd then once we've added this much heat, now we're just\n18:27\nheating up the steam.\n18:28\nWe're just heating up the gaseous water.\n18:30\nAnd it's just getting hotter and hotter and hotter.\n18:33\nBut the interesting thing there, and I mean at least the\n18:35\ninteresting thing to me when I first learned this, whenever I\n18:41\nthink of zero degrees water I'll say, oh it must be ice.\n18:43\nBut that's not necessarily the case.\n18:45\nIf you start with water and you make it colder and colder\n18:48\nand colder to zero degrees, you're essentially taking heat\n18:52\nout of the water.\n18:53\nYou can have zero degree water and it hasn't\n18:57\nturned into ice yet.\n18:58\nAnd likewise, you could have 100 degree water that hasn't\n19:01\nturned into steam yeat.\n19:03\nYou have to add more energy.\n19:04\nYou can also have 100 degree steam.\n19:05\nYou can also have zero degree water.\n19:08\nAnyway, hopefully that gives you a little bit of intuition\n19:10\nof what the different states of matter are.\n19:12\nAnd in the next problem, we'll talk about how much heat\n19:15\nexactly it does take to move along this line.\n19:18\nAnd maybe we can solve some problems on how much ice we\n19:21\nmight need to make our drink cool.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWhat I want to do with this video is talk about\n0:02\nnucleophilicity.\n0:14\nThis is really just how good of a nucleophile something is.\n0:17\nOr I'll just make up a definition right now: the\n0:20\nability for an atom slash ion slash molecule to act as a\n0:35\nnucleophile, or to give away extra electrons and bond with\n0:51\na nucleus or with something else.\n0:53\nI'll say with a nucleus.\n1:01\nI want to say with a nucleus, because that's what\n1:03\nnucleophilicity is saying.\n1:04\nIt loves nucleuses, especially positive ones, that it can\n1:07\ngive its extra electrons to it.\n1:09\nNow, as a first cut, if you want to identify a good\n1:13\nnucleophile, it should have extra electrons to give away.\n1:32\nThe best things that have extra electrons to give away\n1:35\nare negative ions or anions, so just at a very high level,\n1:40\nsomething like the fluoride anion.\n1:44\nNormally, fluorine has seven valence electrons: one, two,\n1:48\nthree, four, five, six, seven, but it's so electronegative,\n1:53\nit might be able swipe off another electron from\n1:55\nsomething else and then it becomes the fluoride anion.\n1:59\nThen it becomes the fluoride anion with a negative charge.\n2:03\nYou can do that for all of the halides.\n2:05\nYou could do that for chlorine.\n2:06\nIt can become chloride.\n2:07\nBromine can be bromide.\n2:09\nIodine could be iodide.\n2:11\nLet me do iodine, too.\n2:13\nIodine, once again, it's a halide.\n2:15\nIt has seven valence electrons.\n2:16\nIt has many, many more electrons than fluorine, but\n2:19\nif you just look at its valence shell,\n2:21\nit has seven electrons.\n2:23\nAnd then it is also reasonably electronegative, not as\n2:26\nelectronegative as fluorine.\n2:28\nRemember, the trend goes like this from the bottom left to\n2:32\nthe top right.\n2:32\nSo fluorine is extremely electronegative, but iodine is\n2:36\nstill pretty electronegative.\n2:39\nIt is a halogen so it also might be able to swipe off an\n2:43\nelectron from someone else and become iodide.\n2:48\nIn general, things with extra electrons, lone pairs of\n2:52\nelectrons, and especially a negative charge, are going to\n2:54\nbe pretty good nucleophiles.\n2:59\nAnother example that's not a halide is the\n3:01\nhydroxide anion, so OH.\n3:05\nThis is an example of something that is a molecule.\n3:09\nMaybe traditionally water would look like this.\n3:12\nTraditionally, this is just neutral water, and oxygen has\n3:17\ntwo lone pairs like that, but oxygen is pretty\n3:19\nelectronegative.\n3:20\nIt is already kind of taking the electrons away from one of\n3:23\nthe hydrogens, and at some point, it might just take it\n3:26\naltogether and then you have the hydroxide anion.\n3:31\nThis would look like this.\n3:33\nYou have your original two lone pairs, just like that,\n3:36\nand then you have this pair that's going to be taken.\n3:39\nIt already had that electron.\n3:40\nIt takes that electron from the hydrogen, so now it has\n3:42\ntwo more electrons.\n3:44\nLet me color code it so you see what it took.\n3:45\nIt took this electron from the hydrogen and now this also has\n3:49\na negative charge.\n3:50\nThat's also a reasonably good nucleophile.\n3:55\nAnd, of course, you have your hydrogen now.\n3:56\nIt lost its one electron.\n3:58\nIt only has a proton in its nucleus.\n4:01\nWhenever you see H plus, this is really just a proton.\n4:03\nThere's nothing else to that hydrogen.\n4:05\nSo that's hydroxide.\n4:06\nThese are all reasonably good nucleophiles in that they have\n4:11\nsomething to give away.\n4:12\nThey have extra charge.\n4:14\nNow, what I want to do is think about between these, how\n4:17\ndo you think about what's going to be a stronger or\n4:19\nweaker nucleophile?\n4:21\nAnd here, it becomes a little bit more nuanced.\n4:25\nWhat we're going to do is differentiate what happens in\n4:27\na protic solvent versus what happens in an aprotic solvent.\n4:31\nLet me write down.\n4:33\nLet me start with a protic solvent.\n4:40\nI'll make two columns here, protic solvent and then we'll\n4:43\ndo aprotic solvent right over here.\n4:54\nOnce again, these are fancy words, but they mean something\n4:56\npretty simple.\n4:57\nProtic solvent is something that has hydrogens that can be\n5:01\ntaken away or might have free protons floating around.\n5:04\nAn example of a protic solvent is water\n5:07\nor really any alcohol.\n5:08\nWater is the simplest example or maybe the most common.\n5:12\nThe reason why you might have protons floating around is\n5:15\nexactly this reaction I showed right here.\n5:18\nMaybe every now and then a hydroxide anion forms. Even\n5:21\nmore likely, maybe a water takes a hydrogen from one of\n5:26\nthe other waters.\n5:27\nOne of the water molecules takes hydrogen from one of the\n5:29\nother water molecules and becomes a hydronium, where\n5:33\nit's not a proton necessarily, but it's an oxygen.\n5:41\nLet's say if you start with water and one of these\n5:44\nelectrons were to be given to some proton floating around,\n5:48\nit would look like this.\n5:50\nAnd it has a positive charge and then this\n5:53\nproton is very available.\n5:56\nYou can almost imagine it's almost floating around because\n5:58\nthat oxygen really wants to take back that electron.\n6:01\nSo protic solvent is water.\n6:03\nIn water, you might see a little bit of hydroxide, a\n6:05\nlittle bit of proton, a little bit a hydronium.\n6:07\nYou see all of it in there, but the bottom line is that\n6:09\nthere are protons that can react with other things.\n6:15\nLet me clear this away so that I have some real estate.\n6:19\nLet me just write down water.\n6:21\nWater is a protic solvent.\n6:24\nNow, wait.\n6:25\nIs that always the case?\n6:27\nIt seems like hydrogens are everywhere.\n6:28\nWell, no, it's not always the case.\n6:29\nLet me show you an aprotic solvent.\n6:32\nDiethyl ether looks like this.\n6:41\nAnd just so you know the naming, it's an ether because\n6:43\nit has oxygen, and it's diethyl because it has two\n6:46\nethyl groups.\n6:47\nThat's one ethyl group right there and that is the second.\n6:50\nSo it's diethyl ether.\n6:53\nNow, you might say, hey, this guy's got hydrogens lying\n6:56\naround as well.\n6:56\nMaybe those can get released.\n6:58\nBut, no, these hydrogens are bonded to the carbon and\n7:01\ncarbon is not anywhere near as electronegative as oxygen.\n7:06\nCarbon is unlikely to steal these hydrogens' electrons and\n7:10\nthese hydrogens to be loose.\n7:12\nIf they were bonded to the oxygen, that would have been a\n7:14\npossibility.\n7:16\nWith water, you have obviously H-O-H.\n7:20\nIn alcohols, you have some maybe carbon chain bonded to\n7:27\nan oxygen, which is then bonded to a hydrogen.\n7:29\nSo in either of these cases, in either water or alcohol,\n7:32\nyou have these hydrogens where the electron might be taken by\n7:36\nthe oxygen because it's so electronegative and then the\n7:38\nhydrogen floats around.\n7:39\nAnyway, that's a review of protic versus aprotic.\n7:42\nIn a protic solvent-- and this is actually a general rule of\n7:45\nthumb-- if a nucleophile is likely to react with its\n7:51\nsolvent, it will be bad at being a nucleophile.\n7:54\nThink about it.\n7:54\nIf it's reacting with the solvent, it's not going to be\n7:57\nable to do this.\n7:58\nIt's not going to be able to give its electrons away to\n8:01\nwhat it needs to give it away, to maybe what we saw in an\n8:04\nSn2-type reaction.\n8:07\nIn a protic solvent, what happens is that the things\n8:09\nthat are really electronegative and really\n8:11\nsmall, like a fluoride anion-- let me draw a fluoride anion.\n8:19\nIn a protic solvent, what's going to happen is it's going\n8:26\nto be blocked by hydrogen bonds.\n8:29\nIt's very negative, right?\n8:30\nIt has a negative charge.\n8:31\nAnd it's also tightly packed.\n8:33\nAs you can see right here, its electrons are\n8:36\nvery close, tied in.\n8:38\nIt's a much smaller atom or ion, in this case.\n8:42\nIf we looked at iodide, iodide has 53\n8:45\nelectrons, many orbitals.\n8:48\nActually, iodide would have 54.\n8:49\nIt would have the same as iodine plus one.\n8:52\nFluoride will have 10 electrons, nine from fluorine\n8:55\nplus it gains another one, so it's a much smaller atom.\n9:00\nSo when you have water hanging around it, let's say you have\n9:03\nsomething like water.\n9:04\nThat has a negative charge.\n9:06\nWater is polar.\n9:11\nActually, both of these are polar, so I should write down\n9:14\npolar for both of these.\n9:15\nThis is a polar protic solvent.\n9:18\nThis is a polar aprotic solvent.\n9:21\nIn this case, water is still more electronegative than the\n9:23\ncarbon, so it still has a partial negative charge.\n9:26\nThese parts still have a partial negative.\n9:27\nWater still has a partial negative charge.\n9:30\nThe hydrogen has a partial positive charge so it is going\n9:33\nto be attracted to the fluorine.\n9:35\nThis is going to happen all around the fluorine.\n9:38\nAnd if these waters are attracted to the fluorine in\n9:40\nkind of forming a tight shell around it, it makes it hard\n9:44\nfor fluorine to react.\n9:52\nSo it's a worse nucleophile than, say, iodide or hydroxide\n9:58\nin a polar protic solvent.\n10:00\nHydroxide has the same issue.\n10:02\nIt's still forming hydrogen bonds, but if you wanted to\n10:05\ncompare them, iodide is much bigger.\n10:10\nMaybe I'll draw it like this.\n10:12\nI'll draw its valence shell like this.\n10:14\nIt's a much bigger ion.\n10:20\nIt has all these electrons in here.\n10:22\nAnd so, it still will form hydrogen bonds with the water.\n10:26\nIt still will form hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen end of\n10:29\nthe water because they're partially positive, but it's\n10:31\ngoing to be less tightly packed.\n10:34\nAnd on top of that, iodide is more polarizable, which means\n10:47\nthat its electron cloud is so big and the valence electrons\n10:50\nare so far away from the nucleus that they can be\n10:53\ninfluenced by things and then be more likely to react.\n10:56\nSo let's say this iodide is getting close to a carbon that\n11:00\nhas a partial positive charge.\n11:02\nSo let's say carbon is attached to a bromine and then\n11:09\nit's attached to three hydrogens.\n11:12\nWe've seen that this will have a partial negative charge.\n11:14\nIt's more electronegative than the carbon, which will have a\n11:17\npartial positive charge.\n11:19\nWhen this guy, this big guy with the electrons really far\n11:22\naway, gets close to this, more of the electron cloud is going\n11:28\nto be attracted to the partial positive charge.\n11:30\nIt'll get distorted a little bit and so it is more likely\n11:33\nto react in a polar protic solvent.\n11:37\nFluoride, on the other hand, is very tightly packed,\n11:40\nblocked by the hydrogen bonds.\n11:43\nIt's less likely to react.\n11:45\nIf you were to look at the Periodic Table, if you look at\n11:49\njust the halogens in a polar protic solvent, the halides--\n11:57\nthis would be the ion version of the halogens-- the halide's\n12:00\niodide will be the best nucleophile.\n12:03\nFluoride will be the worst. So in a polar protic solvent--\n12:07\nlet me write this down-- we have a situation where the\n12:21\niodide is the best nucleophile, followed by\n12:25\nbromide, followed by chloride, and then last\n12:30\nof all is the fluoride.\n12:33\nThe exact opposite is true in an aprotic solvent.\n12:38\nIn an aprotic solvent, the fluoride, which is-- fluorine\n12:42\nis far more electronegative.\n12:44\nFluoride is more basic.\n12:48\nIt will be more stable if it is able to form a bond with\n12:52\nsomething than iodide.\n12:54\nIodide is pretty stable.\n12:56\nIf you look at a hydrogen iodide, it's actually a highly\n13:01\nacidic molecule.\n13:02\nSo iodide itself, the conjugate base of hydrogen\n13:05\niodide, is going to be a very bad base.\n13:09\nWhen you're dealing with an aprotic solvent, you go in the\n13:12\ndirection of basicity.\n13:14\nWe're going to learn in the next video that actually\n13:15\nbasicity and nucleophilicity are related, but they aren't\n13:19\nthe same concept.\n13:20\nWe're going to talk about that in a little bit.\n13:23\nIf you're in an aprotic solvent, you're not reacting\n13:27\nwith the solvent as much.\n13:28\nAnd then in this situation, fluoride is actually the best\n13:32\nnucleophile, followed by chloride, followed by bromide,\n13:37\nfollowed by iodide.\n13:39\nSo here, you're going in the direction of basicity.\n13:42\nThis is the best. This is the worse in an aprotic solvent.\n13:47\nIf it was in a protic solvent, this is flipped around.\n13:50\nThis becomes the best and this becomes the worst.",

I have zero lone pairs\n0:31\nof electrons around that carbon, so four plus zero\n0:34\ngives me a steric number of four.\n0:36\nIn the last video, we saw that SP three hybridized\n0:40\nsituation, we get four hybrid orbitals,\n0:42\nand that's how many we need, the steric number\n0:44\ntells us we need four hybridized orbitals,\n0:46\nso we took one S orbital, and three P orbitals,\n0:49\nand that gave us four, SP three hybrid orbitals,\n0:52\nso this carbon must be SP three hybridized.\n0:56\nSo let's go ahead, and draw that in here.\n0:57\nSo this carbon is SP three hybridized,\n0:59\nand in the last video, we also drew everything out,\n1:02\nso we drew in those four, SP three hybrid orbitals,\n1:06\nfor that carbon, and we had one valence electron\n1:10\nin each of those four, SP three hybrid orbitals,\n1:14\nand then hydrogen had one valence electron,\n1:17\nin an un-hybridized S orbital, so we drew in our hydrogens,\n1:21\nand the one valence electron, like that.\n1:24\nThis head-on overlap; this is, of course, a sigma bond,\n1:28\nso we talked about this in the last video.\n1:31\nAnd so now that we have this picture\n1:34\nof the methane molecule, we can think about\n1:36\nthese electron pairs, so these electron pairs\n1:39\nare going to repel each other: like charges repel.\n1:43\nAnd so, the idea of the VSEPR theory, tell us these\n1:45\nelectron pairs are going to repel, and try\n1:47\nto get as far away from each other\n1:48\nas they possibly can, in space.\n1:51\nAnd this means that the arrangement\n1:52\nof those electron pairs, ends up being tetrahedral.\n1:55\nSo let's go ahead and write that.\n1:57\nSo we have a tetrahedral arrangement of electron pairs\n2:00\naround our carbon, like that.\n2:04\nWhen we think about the molecular geometry,\n2:06\nso that's like electron group geometry,\n2:08\nyou wanna think about the geometry of the entire molecule.\n2:11\nI could think about drawing in those electrons,\n2:15\nthose bonding electrons, like that.\n2:17\nSo we have a wedge coming out at us in space,\n2:20\na dash going away from us in space,\n2:21\nand then, these lines mean, \"in the plane of the page.\"\n2:25\nAnd so, we can go ahead a draw in our hydrogens,\n2:27\nand this is just one way to represent the methane molecule,\n2:32\nwhich attempts to show the geometry\n2:33\nof the entire molecule.\n2:35\nSo the arrangement of the atoms turns out to also\n2:37\nbe tetrahedral, so let's go ahead and write that.\n2:40\nSo, tetrahedral.\n2:42\nAnd, let's see if we can see that four-sided figure,\n2:45\nso a tetrahedron is a four-sided figure,\n2:47\nso we can think about this being one face,\n2:51\nand then let's go ahead and draw a second face.\n2:53\nAnd if I draw a line back here, that gives us\n2:55\nfour faces to our tetrahedron.\n2:58\nSo our electron group geometry is tetrahedral,\n3:01\nthe molecular geometry of methane is tetrahedral,\n3:04\nand then we also have a bond angle, let me go ahead\n3:06\nand draw that in, so a bond angle,\n3:08\nthis hydrogen-carbon-hydrogen bond angle in here,\n3:11\nis approximately 109 point five degrees.\n3:15\nAll right, let's go ahead and do the same type\n3:17\nof analysis for a different molecule, here.\n3:21\nSo let's do it for ammonia, next.\n3:24\nSo we have NH three, if I want to find the steric number,\n3:27\nthe steric number is equal to the number of sigma bonds,\n3:31\nso that's one, two, three; so three sigma bonds.\n3:35\nPlus number of lone pairs of electrons, so I have\n3:38\none lone pair of electrons here, so three plus one\n3:40\ngives me a steric number of four.\n3:42\nSo I need four hybridized orbitals, and once again,\n3:45\nwhen I need four hybridized orbitals, I know that\n3:48\nthis nitrogen must be SP three hybridized,\n3:51\nbecause SP three hybridization gives us\n3:54\nfour hybrid orbitals, and so let's go ahead\n3:56\nand draw those four hybrid orbitals.\n3:58\nSo we would have nitrogen, and let's go ahead\n4:00\nand draw in all four of those.\n4:01\nSo, one, two, three, and four;\n4:04\nthose are the four hybrid orbitals.\n4:06\nWhen you're drawing the dot structure for nitrogen,\n4:08\nyou would have one electron, another electron,\n4:11\nanother electron, and then you'd have two\n4:13\nin this one, like that.\n4:15\nAnd then you'd go ahead, and put in your hydrogens,\n4:16\nso, once again, each hydrogen has one electron,\n4:20\nin a hybridized S orbital, so we go ahead\n4:23\nand draw in those hydrogens, so our overlap\n4:27\nof orbitals, so here's a sigma bond, here's\n4:30\na sigma bond, and here's a sigma bond;\n4:32\nso three sigma bonds in ammonia,\n4:34\nand then we have this lone pair up here.\n4:37\nSo the arrangement of these electron pairs,\n4:39\nis just what we talked about before:\n4:42\nSo we have this tetrahedral arrangement\n4:44\nof electron pairs, or electron groups,\n4:46\nso the VSEPR theory tells us\n4:48\nthat's how they're going to repel.\n4:50\nHowever, that's not the shape of the molecule,\n4:52\nso if I go ahead and draw in another picture\n4:54\nover here, to talk about the molecular geometry,\n4:57\nand go ahead and draw in the bonding electrons,\n4:59\nlike that, and then I'll put in my non-bonding\n5:02\nelectrons, up here: this lone pair right here,\n5:05\nhoused in an SP three hybridized orbital.\n5:08\nSo, the arrangement of the atoms turns out\n5:10\nnot to be tetrahedral, and that has to do\n5:12\nwith this lone pair of electrons up here, at the top.\n5:15\nSo, this lone pair of electrons is going to\n5:18\nrepel these bonding electrons more strongly\n5:21\nthan in our previous example, and because it's\n5:24\ngoing to repel those electrons a little bit\n5:26\nmore strongly, you're not gonna get a bond angle\n5:28\nof 109 point five; it's going to decrease the bond angle.\n5:31\nSo let me go ahead, and use the same color\n5:33\nwe used before, so this bond angle is not 109 point five;\n5:37\nit goes down a bit, because of the extra repulsion,\n5:40\nso it turns out to be approximately 107 degrees.\n5:44\nAnd in terms of the shape of the molecule,\n5:47\nwe don't say \"tetrahedral\"; we say \"trigonal-pyramidal.\"\n5:50\nSo let me go ahead, and write that here,\n5:52\nso the geometry of the ammonia molecule\n5:54\nis trigonal-pyramidal, and let's analyze that a little bit.\n6:01\nSo, \"trigonal\" refers to the fact\n6:03\nthat nitrogen is bonded to three atoms here,\n6:06\nso nitrogen is bonded to three hydrogens,\n6:07\nso that takes care of the trigonal part.\n6:09\nThe \"pyramidal\" part comes in, because when you're\n6:12\ndoing molecular geometry,\n6:13\nyou ignore lone pairs of electrons.\n6:15\nSo if you ignore that lone pair of electrons,\n6:17\nand just look at this nitrogen,\n6:18\nat the top of this pyramid right here,\n6:21\nso that's where the \"pyramidal\" term comes in.\n6:24\nSo bonded to three other atoms,\n6:25\nlike this, this, and this; for our pyramid.\n6:28\nSo trigonal-pyramidal is the geometry\n6:30\nof the ammonia molecule, but the nitrogen\n6:33\nis SP three hybridized.\n6:36\nAll right, let's do one more example; let's do water.\n6:39\nSo, first we calculate the steric number,\n6:42\nso the steric number is equal to the number of sigma bonds,\n6:45\nso that's one, two; so, two sigma bonds.\n6:48\nPlus numbers of lone pairs of electrons,\n6:50\nso here's a lone pair, here's a lone pair;\n6:52\nso we have two plus two, which is equal to four,\n6:55\nso we need four hybridized orbitals.\n6:57\nAs we've seen in the previous two examples,\n6:59\nwhen you need four hybridized orbitals,\n7:01\nthat's an SP three hybridization situation;\n7:05\nyou have four SP three hybridized orbitals.\n7:07\nSo this oxygen is SP three hybridized, so I'll\n7:11\ngo ahead and write that in here, so oxygen\n7:12\nis SP three hybridized.\n7:14\nSo we can draw that out, showing oxygen\n7:17\nwith its four SP three hybrid orbitals;\n7:21\nso there's four of them.\n7:22\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and draw in all four.\n7:24\nIn terms of electrons, this orbital gets one,\n7:28\nthis orbital gets one, and these orbitals\n7:30\nare going to get two, like that;\n7:33\nso that takes care of oxygen's six valence electrons.\n7:37\nWhen you're drawing in your hyrdogens,\n7:39\nso let's go ahead and put in the hydrogen here,\n7:41\nso, once again, each hydrogen with one electron,\n7:44\nin a un-hybridized S orbital, like that.\n7:48\nSo in terms of overlap of bonds, here's one\n7:50\nsigma bond, and here's another sigma bond;\n7:54\nso that's our two sigma bonds for water.\n7:57\nOnce again, the arrangement of these electron pairs\n8:00\nis tetrahedral, so VSEPR theory says the electrons repel,\n8:04\nand so the electron group geometry, you could say,\n8:07\nis tetrahedral, but that's not the geometry\n8:10\nof the entire molecule, 'cause I was just\n8:13\nthinking about electron groups, and these hybrid orbitals.\n8:17\nThe geometry of the molecule is different,\n8:19\nso we'll go ahead and draw that over here.\n8:21\nSo we have our water molecule, and draw in our\n8:25\nbonding electrons, and now let's put in our\n8:27\nnon-bonding electrons, like that, so we have\n8:30\na different situation than with ammonia.\n8:33\nWith ammonia, we had one lone pair of electrons\n8:35\nrepelling these bonding electrons up here;\n8:38\nfor water, we have two lone pairs of electrons\n8:40\nrepelling these bonding electrons,\n8:42\nand so that's going to change the bond angle;\n8:44\nit's going to short it even more\n8:46\nthan in the previous example.\n8:48\nSo the bond angle decreases, so this bond angle in here\n8:51\ndecreases to approximately 105 degrees,\n8:54\nrounded up a little bit.\n8:56\nSo, thinking about the molecular geometry,\n8:59\nor the shape of the water molecule,\n9:02\nso we actually call this \"bent,\" or \"angular,\"\n9:05\nso this is, \"bent geometry,\" because you ignore\n9:08\nthe lone pairs of electrons, and that would\n9:10\njust give you this oxygen here, and then this angle;\n9:13\nso you could also call this, \"angular.\"\n9:15\nSo we have this bent molecular geometry, like that,\n9:19\nor angular, and once again, for molecular geometry,\n9:23\nignore your lone pairs of electrons.\n9:25\nSo these are examples of three molecules,\n9:28\nand the central atom in all three of these molecules\n9:30\nis SP three hybridized,\n9:33\nand so, this is one way to figure out\n9:37\nyour overall molecular geometry,\n9:39\nand to think about bond angles,\n9:41\nand to think about how those hybrid orbitals\n9:43\naffect the structure of these molecules.",

That must have its nuclear DNA\n0:27\n\"in a membrane-bound nucleus.\" and that would be true,\n0:31\nso let's draw our membrane-bound nucleus.\n0:33\nThat's our nuclear membrane.\n0:35\nYou have your DNA in here,\n0:38\nso let's draw some DNA.\n0:39\nBut when we talk about eukaryotic cells,\n0:42\nwe're not just talking about a membrane-bound nucleus,\n0:44\nwe're also talking about other membrane-bound organelles\n0:47\nand in a close second place for a membrane-bound structure\n0:51\nthat is very important to the cell\n0:52\nwould be the mitochondria.\n0:55\nSo let's draw some mitochondria right over here.\n0:58\nSo I'll talk a little bit more about\n1:00\nwhat these little squiggly lines that I'm drawing\n1:02\ninside of the mitochondria are\n1:04\nand this is actually a little bit more\n1:05\nof a textbook visualization, as we'll learn\n1:06\nin a few minutes or seconds that we now have more\n1:09\nsophisticated visualizations of what's actually going on\n1:12\ninside of a mitochondria, but we haven't actually\n1:13\nanswered all of our questions,\n1:15\nbut you might have already learned that,\n1:17\nso let me make it clear, these are mitochondria.\n1:20\nThat's the plural.\n1:21\nIf we're just talking about one of them,\n1:22\nwe're talking about a mitochondrion.\n1:24\nThat's the singular of mitochondria.\n1:26\nBut you might have already learned,\n1:27\nsome time in your past or in another Khan Academy video,\n1:31\nthat these are viewed as the ATP factories for cells.\n1:35\nSo let me right it this way.\n1:38\nSo ATP factories.\n1:40\nA-T-P factories and if you watched the videos on ATP\n1:45\nor cellular respiration or other videos,\n1:48\nI'd repeatedly talk about how ATP is really the currency\n1:51\nfor energy in the cell that when it's in its ATP form\n1:55\nyou have adenosine triphosphate.\n1:57\nIf you pop one of the phosphate groups off,\n2:00\nyou pop one of the P's off, it release energy\n2:02\nand that's what your body uses to do all sort of things\n2:05\nfrom movement to thinking to all sorts of things\n2:08\nthat actually go on in your bodies,\n2:10\nso you can imagine mitochondria are really important\n2:12\nfor energy, for when the cell has to do things.\n2:16\nAnd that's why you'll find more mitochondria\n2:18\nin things like muscle cells, things that have to use\n2:21\na lot of energy.\n2:22\nNow before I get into the structure of mitochondria,\n2:25\nI wanna talk a little bit about its fascinating past\n2:28\nbecause we think of cells as the most basic unit of life\n2:31\nand that is true, that comes straight out of cell theory,\n2:33\nbut it turns out the most prevalent theory\n2:36\nof how mitochondria got into our cells\n2:39\nis that at one time the predecessors,\n2:43\nthe ancestors to our mitochondria,\n2:45\nwere free, independent organisms, microorganisms.\n2:49\nSo they're descendent from bacterial-like microorganisms\n2:54\nthat might have been living on their own\n2:57\nand they were maybe really good at processing energy\n2:59\nor maybe they were even good at other things,\n3:01\nbut at some point in the evolutionary past,\n3:04\nthey got ingested by what the ancestors of our cells\n3:08\nand instead of just being engulfed and being torn to shreds\n3:10\nand kind of being digested and eaten,\n3:12\nit was like, \"Hey, wait, if these things stick around,\n3:15\n\"those cells are more likely to survive\n3:17\n\"because they're able to help process glucose\n3:19\n\"or help generate more energy out of things.\"\n3:24\nAnd so the cells that were able to kind of live\n3:27\nin symbiosis have them kind of give a place\n3:30\nfor the mitochondria to live or the pre-mitochondria,\n3:33\nthe ancestor mitochondria, those survived\n3:35\nand then through kind of the processes of natural selection,\n3:38\nthis is what we now associate,\n3:41\nwe now associate eukaryotic cells\n3:43\nas having mitochondria,\n3:44\nso I find this whole idea of one organism being inside\n3:47\nof another organism in symbiosis even at the cellular level,\n3:52\nthat's kind of mind-boggling, but anyway,\n3:55\nI'll stop talking about that and now let's just talk\n3:57\nabout the present, let's talk about\n3:59\nwhat the actual structure of mitochondria are.\n4:03\nAnd I'll first draw kind of a simplified drawing\n4:06\nof a mitochondion and I'll draw a cross section.\n4:10\nSo, I'm gonna draw a cross section.\n4:13\nSo if we were to kind of cut it in half.\n4:15\nSo what I've drawn right over here\n4:16\nthis would be its outer membrane.\n4:18\nThis is the outer membrane right over here\n4:24\nand we label that.\n4:25\nOuter membrane.\n4:28\nAnd all of these membranes that I'm gonna draw,\n4:30\nthey're all going to be phospholipid bilayers.\n4:34\nSo if I were to zoom in right over here,\n4:38\nso let me, if I were to zoom in,\n4:41\nwe would see a bilayer of phospholipids.\n4:44\nSo you have your\n4:47\nhydrophilic heads facing outwards,\n4:50\nhydrophilic heads facing outwards\n4:53\nand your hydrophobic tails facing inwards.\n4:57\nSo.\n5:00\nYou see something just like that,\n5:02\nso they're all phospholipid bilayers.\n5:05\nBut they aren't just phospholipids.\n5:07\nAll of these membranes have all sorts of proteins imbedded,\n5:10\nI mean cells are incredibly complex structures,\n5:13\nbut even organelles like mitochondria have a fascinating,\n5:16\nI guess you would say sub-structure to them.\n5:18\nThey themselves have all sorts of interesting proteins,\n5:21\nenzymes imbedded in their membranes\n5:23\nand are able to help regulate what's going on\n5:25\ninside and outside of these organelles.\n5:28\nAnd one of the proteins that you have in the outer membrane\n5:34\nof mitochondria, they're called porins\n5:38\nand porins aren't found only in mitochondria,\n5:40\nbut they're kind of tunnel proteins,\n5:41\nthey're structured so they kind of form a hole\n5:44\nin the outer membrane.\n5:46\nSo I'm drawing them the best that I can.\n5:49\nThese are porins\n5:51\nand what's interesting about porins is they don't allow\n5:54\nlarge molecules to pass through passively,\n5:57\nbut small molecules like sugars or ions can pass passively\n6:02\nthrough the porins.\n6:04\nAnd so, because of that, your ion concentration\n6:06\nand well, I should actually say,\n6:07\nyour small molecule concentrations tend\n6:09\nto be similar on either side of this membrane,\n6:12\non either side of this outer membrane.\n6:15\nBut that's not the only membrane involved\n6:17\nin a mitochondrion.\n6:18\nWe also have a inner membrane.\n6:20\nI'll do that in yellow.\n6:22\nWe also have a inner membrane\n6:24\nand I'm gonna draw it with a textbook model first\n6:27\nand then we'll talk a little bit about,\n6:28\nsince we think this model is not quite right,\n6:32\nbut in this, so we have this inner membrane,\n6:36\ninner membrane,\n6:41\nand this inner membrane has these folds in it\n6:45\nto increase their surface area\n6:46\nand the surface area is really important\n6:48\nfor the inner membrane because that's\n6:50\nwhere the processes of the electron transport chain\n6:53\noccur across, essentially, these membranes.\n6:55\nSo you want this extra surface area\n6:57\nso you can essentially have more of that going on.\n7:00\nAnd these folds have a name.\n7:02\nSo if you're talking about one of them,\n7:04\nif you're talking about one of these folds,\n7:05\nyou're talking about a crista,\n7:10\nbut if you're talking about more than one of them,\n7:14\nyou would call that a cristae, cristae.\n7:18\nSometimes I've seen the pronunciation of this\n7:20\nas cristae, cristae or cristae, that's plural for crista.\n7:24\nThese are just folds in the inner membrane\n7:27\nand once again the inner membrane is also\n7:30\na phospholipid bilayer.\n7:33\nNow inside of the inner membranes,\n7:36\nso between the outer membrane and the inner membrane\n7:40\nyou could imagine what this is gonna be called.\n7:42\nThat space is called the intermembrane space,\n7:46\nnot too creative of a name, intermembrane space\n7:51\nand because of the porins,\n7:53\nthe small molecule concentration\n7:56\nof the intermembrane space and then outside\n7:58\nof the mitochondria,\n8:02\nout in the cytosol,\n8:03\nthose concentrations are gonna be similar,\n8:05\nbut then the inner membrane does not have the porins\n8:08\nin it and so you can actually have a different concentration\n8:11\non either side and that is essential\n8:12\nfor the electron transport chain.\n8:14\nThe electron transport chain really culminates\n8:16\nwith hydrogen, a hydrogen ion gradient\n8:19\nbeing built between the two sides\n8:20\nand then they flow down that gradient through a protein\n8:24\ncalled ATP synthase which helps us synthesize ATP,\n8:28\nbut we'll talk more about that maybe in this video\n8:29\nor in a future video,\n8:31\nbut let's finish talking about the different parts\n8:33\nof a mitochondrion.\n8:36\nSo inside the inner membrane you have\n8:40\nthis area right over here is called the matrix.\n8:42\nIt's called, let me use this in a different color,\n8:45\nthis is\n8:48\nthe matrix\n8:49\nand it's called the matrix 'cause it actually has\n8:50\na much higher protein concentration,\n8:53\nit's actually more viscous than the cytosol\n8:58\nthat would be outside of the\n9:03\nmitochondria.\n9:05\nSo this right over here is the matrix.\n9:07\nWhen we we talk about cellular respiration,\n9:09\ncellular respiration has many phases in it.\n9:11\nWe talk about glycolysis.\n9:13\nGlycolysis is actually occurring in the cytosol.\n9:15\nSo glycolysis can occur in the cytosol.\n9:20\nGlycolysis.\n9:22\nBut the other major phases of cellular respiration.\n9:26\nRemember we talk about the citric acid cycle\n9:28\nalso known as the Krebs cycle,\n9:29\nthat is occuring in the matrix.\n9:32\nSo Krebs cycle\n9:35\nis occuring in the matrix\n9:37\nand then I said the electron transport chain\n9:40\nwhich is really what's responsible for producing\n9:42\nthe bulk of the ATP, that is happening through proteins\n9:46\nthat are straddling the inner membrane\n9:49\nor straddling the cristae right over here.\n9:55\nNow we're just done.\n9:56\nProbably one of the most fascinating parts of mitochondria,\n9:59\nwe said that we think that they are descendent\n10:01\nfrom these ancient independent lifeforms\n10:04\nand in order to be an ancient independent life form,\n10:06\nthey'd would have to have some information,\n10:09\nsome way to actually transmit their genetic information\n10:13\nand, it turns out, mitochondria actually have\n10:16\ntheir own genetic information.\n10:18\nThey have mitochondrial DNA\n10:19\nand they often don't just even have one copy of it,\n10:21\nthey have multiple copies of it\n10:23\nand they're in loops very similar to bacterial DNA.\n10:28\nIn fact, they have a lot in common\n10:29\nwith bacterial DNA and that's why we think\n10:30\nthat the ancestor to mitochondria that live independently\n10:34\nwas probably a form of bacteria or related to bacteria\n10:38\nin some way.\n10:39\nSo this is, this right over there,\n10:41\nthat is the loop of mitochondrial DNA.\n10:43\nSo all the DNA that's inside of you, the bulk of it,\n10:46\nyes, it is in your nuclear DNA, but you still have\n10:50\na little bit of DNA in your mitochondria\n10:52\nand what's interesting is your mitochondrial DNA,\n10:55\nyour mitochondria, are inherited, essentially,\n10:59\nfrom your mother's side, because when a egg is fertilized,\n11:05\na human egg has tons of mitochondria in it\n11:09\nand I'm obviously not drawing all of the things\n11:11\nin the human egg.\n11:12\nIt obviously has a nucleus and all of that.\n11:14\nThe sperm has some mitochondria in it,\n11:17\nyou could imagine it needs to be able\n11:20\nto win that very competitive fight\n11:22\nto get to fertilize the egg,\n11:24\nbut the current theory is all or most of that\n11:26\ngets digested or dissolved once it actually gets\n11:30\ninto the egg.\n11:31\nAnd anyway, the egg itself has way more mitochondria,\n11:34\nso the DNA in your mitochondria is\n11:38\nfrom your mother or is essentially from your mother's side\n11:42\nand that's actually used, mitochondrial DNA,\n11:43\nwhen people talk about kind of an ancient Eve\n11:45\nor tracing back to having kind\n11:47\nof one common mother,\n11:48\npeople are looking at the mitochondrial DNA,\n11:52\nso it is actually quite, quite fascinating.\n11:56\nNow I said a little bit earlier,\n11:58\nand you know, obviously, it has its own DNA\n12:00\nand then because it has its own DNA\n12:02\nit's able to synthesize some of its own RNA,\n12:04\nits own ribosomes, so it also has ribosomes here.\n12:07\nBut it doesn't synthesize all of the proteins\n12:10\nthat are sitting in mitochondria.\n12:11\nA lot of those are still synthesized by\n12:14\nor encoded for by your nuclear DNA\n12:17\nand are actually synthesized outside of the mitochondria\n12:19\nand then make their way into the mitochondria,\n12:22\nbut mitochondria are these fascinating, fascinating things.\n12:25\nThey're these little creatures living in symbiosis\n12:29\nin our cells and they're able to replicate themselves\n12:32\nand I don't know, I find all of this mind boggling.\n12:34\nBut anyway.\n12:35\nI said that this was the textbook model\n12:37\nbecause it turns out, when you look\n12:39\nat a micrograph, a picture of mitochondria,\n12:43\nit seems to back up this textbook model\n12:45\nof these folds, these cristae just kind of folding in,\n12:49\nbut when we've been able to have more sophisticated\n12:51\nvisualizations it actually turns out\n12:53\nthat it's not just these simple folds\n12:55\nthat the inner membrane essentially hooks\n12:59\ninto the matrix and it turns out it has\n13:02\nthese little tunnels that connect the space\n13:05\ninside of the cristae to the intermembrane space.\n13:10\nSo I like to think about this because it makes you realize,\n13:12\nyou know, we look in textbooks and we take these things\n13:14\nlike mitochondria for granted, like, \"Oh yeah, of course.\n13:17\n\"That's where ATP factories are,\"\n13:18\nbut it's still an area for visualization research\n13:21\nto fully understand exactly how they work\n13:24\nand even how they are structured\n13:25\nthat this Baffle Model where you see these cristae\n13:28\nkind of just coming in and out of the different sides.\n13:31\nThis is actually no longer the accepted model\n13:33\nfor the actual visualization, the structure of mitochondria.\n13:36\nSomething more like this, something more where\n13:39\nyou have this cristae junction model\n13:42\nwhere you have, if I were to draw a cross section\n13:46\nwhere this is the,\n13:50\nI drew the outer membrane and the inner membrane,\n13:52\nI'll just draw has these little tunnels\n13:54\nto the actual space inside of the cristae.\n13:59\nThis is actually now the more accepted visualization,\n14:03\nso I want you to appreciate\n14:04\nthat when in Biology, you read something in a textbook\n14:06\nyou kind of say, \"Oh, people have figured all\n14:08\n\"of this stuff out,\" but people are still think about,\n14:10\n\"Well, how does this structure work?\n14:11\n\"What is the actual structure?\" and then,\n14:12\n\"How does it actually let this organelle,\n14:14\n\"this fascinating organelle do all of the things\n14:16\n\"that it needs to do?\"",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nBy this point in the biology playlist,\n0:02\nyou're probably wondering a very natural question,\n0:06\nhow is gender determined in an organism?\n0:09\nAnd it's not an obvious answer,because throughout the animal kingdom,\n0:12\nit's actually determined in different ways.\n0:15\nIn some creatures,especially some types of reptiles,it's environmental\n0:23\nNot all reptiles,but certain cases of it.\n0:26\nIt could be maybe the temperature in which the\n0:29\nembryo develops will dictate whether it turns into a male or female\n0:32\nor other environmental factors.\n0:34\nAnd in other types of animals,especially mammals,\n0:38\nof which we are one example,it's a genetic basis.\n0:45\nAnd so your next question is,hey,Sal,so--\n0:47\nlet me write this down,in mammals it's genetic--\n0:55\nso,OK,maybe they're different alleles,a male or a female allele.\n1:01\nBut then you're like,hey,but there's so many different characteristics\n1:04\nthat differentiate a man from a woman.\n1:08\nMaybe it would have to be a whole set of genes\n1:09\nthat have to work together.\n1:11\nAnd to some degree,your second answer would be more correct.\n1:16\nIt's even more than just a set of genes.\n1:18\nIt's actually whole chromosomes determine it.\n1:21\nSo let me draw a nucleus.That's going to be my nucleus.\n1:25\nAnd this is going to be the nucleus for a man.\n1:27\nSo 22 of the pairs of chromosomes\n1:29\nare just regular non-sex-determining chromosomes.\n1:33\nSo I could just do,that's one of the homologous,2,4,6,8,10,12,14.\n1:41\nI can just keep going.And eventually you have 22 pairs.\n1:45\nSo these 22 pairs right there,they're called autosomal.\n1:51\nAnd those are just our standard pairs of chromosomes\n1:54\nthat code for different things.\n1:55\nEach of these right here is a homologous pair,homologous,\n2:02\nwhich we learned before you get one from each of your parents.\n2:05\nThey don't necessarily code for the same thing,\n2:07\nfor the same versions of the genes,but they code for the same genes.\n2:11\nIf eye color is on this gene,it's also on that gene,\n2:13\non the other gene of the homologous pair.\n2:15\nAlthough you might have different versions of eye color\n2:17\non either one and that determines what you display.\n2:20\nBut these are just kind of the standard genes\n2:23\nthat have nothing to do with our gender.\n2:25\nAnd then you have these two other special chromosomes.\n2:31\nI'll do this one.\n2:32\nIt'll be a long brown one,and then I'll do a short blue one.\n2:36\nAnd the first thing you'll notice is that they don't look homologous.\n2:39\nHow could they code for the same thing\n2:41\nwhen the blue one is short and the brown one's long?\n2:44\nAnd that's true.They aren't homologous.\n2:46\nAnd these we'll call our sex-determining chromosomes.\n2:59\nAnd the long one right here,\n3:01\nit's been the convention to call that the x chromosome.\n3:07\nLet me scroll down a little bit.\n3:09\nAnd the blue one right there,we refer to that as the y chromosome.\n3:16\nAnd to figure out whether something is a male or a female,\n3:19\nit's a pretty simple system.\n3:20\nIf you've got a y chromosome,you are a male.\n3:23\nSo let me write that down.\n3:26\nSo this nucleus that I drew just here--\n3:28\nobviously you could have the whole broader cell all around here--\n3:31\nthis is the nucleus for a man.\n3:34\nSo if you have an x chromosome--\n3:35\nand we'll talk about in a second\n3:37\nwhy you can only get that from your mom--\n3:39\nan x chromosome from your mom and a y chromosome from your dad,\n3:43\nyou will be a male.\n3:46\nIf you get an x chromosome from your mom\n3:49\nand an x chromosome from your dad,you're going to be a female.\n3:54\nAnd so we could actually even draw a Punnett square.\n3:56\nThis is almost a trivially easy Punnett square,\n3:58\nbut it kind of shows what all of the different possibilities are.\n4:02\nSo let's say this is your mom's genotype\n4:04\nfor her sex-determining chromosome.\n4:07\nShe's got two x's.\n4:09\nThat's what makes her your mom and not your dad.\n4:11\nAnd then your dad has an x and a y--\n4:14\nI should do it in capital--and has a Y chromosome.\n4:19\nAnd we can do a Punnett square.\n4:20\nWhat are all the different combinations of offspring?\n4:23\nWell,your mom could give this X chromosome,\n4:25\nin conjunction with this X chromosome from your dad.\n4:28\nThis would produce a female.\n4:29\nYour mom could give this other X chromosome with that X chromosome.\n4:32\nThat would be a female as well.\n4:35\nWell,your mom's always going to be donating an X chromosome.\n4:38\nAnd then your dad is going to donate either the X or the Y.\n4:42\nSo in this case,it'll be the Y chromosome.\n4:44\nSo these would be female,and those would be male.\n4:46\nAnd it works out nicely that half are female and half are male.\n4:50\nBut a very interesting and somewhat ironic fact\n4:55\nmight pop out at you when you see this.\n4:57\nwhat determines whether someone is\n4:59\nor Who determines whether their offspring are male or female?\n5:04\nIs it the mom or the dad?\n5:07\nWell,the mom always donates an X chromosome,\n5:09\nso in no way does- what the haploid genetic makeup of the mom's eggs\n5:16\nof the gamete from the female,\n5:18\nin no way does that determine the gender of the offspring.\n5:22\nIt's all determined by whether--let me just draw a bunch of--\n5:26\ndad's got a lot of sperm,and they're all racing towards the egg.\n5:34\nAnd some of them have an X chromosome in them\n5:37\nand some of them have a Y chromosome in them.\n5:41\nAnd obviously they have others.\n5:42\nAnd obviously if this guy up here wins the race.\n5:46\nOr maybe I should say this girl.If she wins the race,\n5:49\nthen the fertilized egg will develop into a female.\n5:53\nIf this sperm wins the race,\n5:55\nthen the fertilized egg will develop into a male.\n5:59\nAnd the reason why I said it's ironic is throughout history,\n6:01\nand probably the most famous example of this is Henry the VIII.\n6:09\nI mean it's not just the case with kings.\n6:11\nIt's probably true,because most of our civilization is male dominated,\n6:15\nthat you've had these men who are obsessed with producing a male heir\n6:19\nto kind of take over the family name.\n6:21\nAnd,in the case of Henry the VIII,take over a country.\n6:24\nAnd they become very disappointed and they tend to blame their wives\n6:28\nwhen the wives keep producing females,but it's all their fault.\n6:33\nHenry the VIII,I mean the most famous case was with Ann Boleyn.\n6:39\nI'm not an expert here,but the general notion is that\n6:43\nhe became upset with her that she wasn't producing a male heir.\n6:47\nAnd then he found a reason to get her essentially decapitated,\n6:52\neven though it was all his fault.\n6:58\nHe was maybe producing a lot more sperm\n7:01\nthat looked like that than was looking like this.\n7:03\nHe eventually does produce a male heir so he was--\n7:04\nand if we assume that it was his child--\n7:07\nthen obviously he was producing some of these,but for the most part,\n7:11\nit was all Henry the VIII's fault.\n7:13\nSo that's why I say there's a little bit of irony here.\n7:15\nIs that the people doing the blame are the people\n7:17\nto blame for the lack of a male heir?\n7:20\nNow one question that might immediately pop up in your head is,\n7:24\nSal,is everything on these chromosomes\n7:28\nrelated to just our sex-determining traits\n7:31\nor are there other stuff on them?\n7:34\nSo let me draw some chromosomes.\n7:38\nSo let's say that's an X chromosome and this is a Y chromosome.\n7:43\nNow the X chromosome,it does code for a lot more things,\n7:47\nalthough it is kind of famously gene poor.\n7:50\nIt codes for on the order of 1,500 genes.\n7:55\nAnd the Y chromosome,it's the most gene poor of all the chromosomes.\n8:00\nIt only codes for on the order of 78 genes.\n8:05\nI just looked this up,but who knows if it's exactly 78.\n8:09\nBut what it tells you is it does very little\n8:11\nother than determining what the gender is.\n8:13\nAnd the way it determines that,\n8:15\nit does have one gene on it called the SRY gene.\n8:19\nYou don't have to know that.\n8:21\nSRY,that plays a role in the development of testes\n8:30\nor the male sexual organ.So if you have this around,\n8:35\nthis gene right here can start coding for things\n8:38\nthat will eventually lead to the development of the testicles.\n8:42\nAnd if you don't have that around,that won't happen,\n8:43\nso you'll end up with a female.\n8:45\nAnd I'm making gross oversimplifications here.\n8:48\nBut everything I've dealt with so far,OK,\n8:50\nthis clearly plays a role in determining sex.\n8:53\nBut you do have other traits on these genes.\n8:58\nAnd the famous cases all deal with specific disorders.\n9:02\nSo,for example,color blindness.\n9:05\nThe genes,or the mutations I should say.\n9:08\nSo the mutations that cause color blindness.\n9:15\nRed-green color blindness,which I did in green,\n9:20\nwhich is maybe a little bit inappropriate.\n9:24\nColor blindness and also hemophilia.\n9:28\nThis is an inability of your blood to clot.\n9:30\nActually, there's several types of hemophilia.\n9:32\nBut hemophilia is an inability for your blood to clot properly.\n9:36\nAnd both of these are mutations on the X chromosome.\n9:45\nAnd they're recessive mutations.So what does that mean?\n9:51\nIt means both of your X chromosomes have to have--\n9:54\nlet's take the case for hemophilia--\n9:56\nboth of your X chromosomes have to have the hemophilia mutation\n9:59\nin order for you to show the phenotype of having hemophilia.\n10:04\nSo,for example,if there's a woman,\n10:06\nand let's say this is her genotype.\n10:09\nShe has one regular X chromosome\n10:10\nand then she has one X chromosome that has the--\n10:13\nI'll put a little superscript there for hemophilia--\n10:16\nshe has the hemophilia mutation.She's just going to be a carrier.\n10:21\nHer phenotype right here is going to be no hemophilia.\n10:29\nShe'll have no problem clotting her blood.\n10:32\nThe only way that a woman could be a hemophiliac is\n10:35\nif she gets two versions of this,\n10:36\nbecause this is a recessive mutation.\n10:42\nNow this individual will have hemophilia.\n10:49\nNow men,they only have one X chromosome.\n10:54\nSo for a man to exhibit hemophilia to have this phenotype,\n10:57\nhe just needs it only on the one X chromosome he has.\n11:03\nAnd then the other one's a Y chromosome.\n11:07\nSo this man will have hemophilia.\n11:11\nSo a natural question should be arising is, hey, you know this guy--\n11:14\nlet's just say that this is a relatively infrequent mutation\n11:19\nthat arises on an X chromosome--\n11:22\nthe question is who's more likely to have hemophilia?\n11:25\nA male or a female?\n11:27\nAll else equal,who's more likely to have it?\n11:29\nWell if this is a relatively infrequent allele,a female,\n11:33\nin order to display it,has to get two versions of it.\n11:35\nSo let's say that the frequency of it--\n11:38\nand I looked it up before this video--\n11:41\nroughly they say between 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 men exhibit hemophilia.\n11:46\nSo let's say that the allele frequency of this is 1 in 7,000,\n11:51\nthe frequency of Xh,the hemophilia version of the X chromosome.\n12:01\nAnd that's why 1 in 7,000 men display it,\n12:03\nbecause it's completely determined whether--\n12:05\nthere's a 1 in 7,000 chance that\n12:07\nthis X chromosome they get is the hemophilia version.\n12:11\nWho cares what the Y chromosome they get is, cause\n12:14\nthat essentially doesn't code at all for the blood clotting factors\n12:17\nand all of the things that drive hemophilia.\n12:19\nNow,for a woman to get hemophilia,what has to happen?\n12:23\nShe has to have two X chromosomes with the mutation.\n12:26\nWell the probability of each of them having the mutation is 1 in 7,000\n12:33\nSo the probability of her having hemophilia is\n12:37\n1 in 7,000 times 1 in 7,000,or that's 1 in what,49 million.\n12:46\nSo as you can imagine,the incidence of hemophilia in women\n12:49\nis much lower than the incidence of hemophilia in men.\n12:54\nAnd in general for any sex-linked trait, if it's recessive,\n12:56\nif it's a recessive sex-linked trait,which means men,\n13:00\nif they have it,they're going to show it,\n13:02\nbecause they don't have another X chromosome to dominate it.\n13:06\nOr for women to show it, she has to have both versions of it.\n13:09\nThe incidence in men is going to be,\n13:14\nso let's say that m is the incidence in men.I'm spelling badly.\n13:29\nThen the incidence in women will be what?\n13:33\nYou could view this as the allele frequency\n13:35\nof that mutation on the X chromosome.\n13:38\nSo women have to get two versions of it.\n13:40\nSo the woman's frequency is m squared.\n13:42\nAnd you might say,hey,that looks like a bigger number.\n13:44\nI'm squaring it. But you have to remember that these numbers,\n13:47\nthe frequency is less than 1,\n13:49\nso in the case of hemophilia,that was 1 in 7,000.\n13:53\nSo if you square 1 in 7,000,you get 1 in 49 million.\n13:58\nAnyway,hopefully you found that interesting\n14:00\nand now you know how we all become men and women.\n14:05\nAnd even better you know whom to blame when some of these, I guess,\n14:11\nmale-focused parents are having trouble getting their son.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:02\nSo the story begins with the WHO, the World Health\n0:06\nOrganization.\n0:08\nAnd the WHO actually works with a few of the regional labs.\n0:12\nSo there are actually five labs sprinkled around the world.\n0:16\nAnd these labs collect specimens from hundreds of countries.\n0:20\nSo hundreds and hundreds of countries\n0:22\ndo surveillance to figure out what type of flu\n0:24\nis affecting their particular population.\n0:27\nAnd they will send this information over\n0:30\nto these five regional labs.\n0:32\nAnd I'm just going to quickly draw out\n0:34\nfor you where the regional labs are.\n0:36\nThere's one over here in the US.\n0:38\nThere's also one down here in China.\n0:42\nAnd then there's another one over here in Japan.\n0:47\nAnd a fourth one in the southern hemisphere in Australia.\n0:53\nAnd finally, there's one in the United Kingdom.\n0:56\nSo this is the last one.\n0:57\nThere are five in total.\n0:58\nThe WHO will take a look at all the different strains that\n1:02\nhave come into these five labs again from all over the world.\n1:05\nAnd they'll try to make a decision\n1:07\nas to what makes the most sense.\n1:09\nBecause flu usually moves around the world\n1:12\nin a very predictable way.\n1:14\nSo they can make an educated guess\n1:15\nas to what strains they should include in the vaccine\n1:18\nto protect people most effectively.\n1:20\nSometimes they'll use a strain that they\n1:22\nused in previous years.\n1:23\nAnd sometimes they'll pick something brand new.\n1:25\nSo let's go through the three strains\n1:28\nthat they actually picked for the most\n1:29\nrecent vaccine, the 2012-2013 vaccine.\n1:34\nI'll start with the type of virus they put in there.\n1:36\nAnd generally it's two type A's and one type B.\n1:40\nThat's the usual formula that they use.\n1:44\nThe WHO recommends that for the trivalent, or three strain\n1:48\nvaccine.\n1:49\nAnd the exact one that they choose\n1:51\ncan be actually followed.\n1:52\nThey usually name it in part based on location.\n1:55\nSo they'll say, OK, the type is A.\n1:59\nAnd they'll say the location is-- in this case,\n2:02\nthe first one actually came from California.\n2:05\nThe second one came from Victoria, Australia.\n2:09\nAnd the final one came from Wisconsin in the United States.\n2:13\nSo this is the location of the three strains.\n2:15\nIn fact, if you ever see it named,\n2:17\nyou'll see a slash between these two.\n2:19\nSo I'll put a slash here as well.\n2:20\nNext, they actually have strain numbers.\n2:22\nSo they'll give you a number and what that number refers to.\n2:26\nIt doesn't mean a whole heck of a lot to us.\n2:27\nBut we're going to put it in there just because that's\n2:30\nhow they name things.\n2:31\nThe strain number is, for the first one, 7.\n2:34\nThis is 361.\n2:36\nAnd this is strain 1.\n2:37\nAnd then finally, they'll put the year that they actually\n2:40\nidentified this thing.\n2:41\nSo the year of identification.\n2:44\nAnd this first one, this type A, was actually\n2:45\nidentified back in 2009.\n2:48\nWhereas the other ones are a little bit newer,\n2:49\nidentified in 2011 and 2010.\n2:52\nSo, that's what comes after the strain number.\n2:55\nAnd finally, the last thing, which\n2:58\nonly applies to the first two, is that if it's a type A,\n3:02\nthey'll actually tell you the H and N type.\n3:05\nSo, for example, the first one, the California strain,\n3:09\nthis one is actually a type H1N1.\n3:13\nAnd the second one is an H3N2.\n3:16\nAnd the third one, because it's a type B,\n3:18\nwe don't really use that H and N classification.\n3:21\nSo I'll just put a hash there, meaning nothing.\n3:23\nSo if you ever come across these things\n3:25\nin some sort of formal document, at least now\n3:27\nyou know what the heck all these numbers and words refer to.\n3:31\nSo this is literally how they name the strains.\n3:33\nAnd just for you and I to know, this first one here,\n3:37\nthis one is actually an old strain.\n3:39\nSo, this is actually part of the last few vaccines.\n3:42\nThis is not a new one that was included.\n3:44\nWhereas these other ones down here, these ones,\n3:47\nare actually new strains.\n3:49\nThey were not part of the vaccine in previous years.\n3:52\nThese are new additions or changes to the vaccine.\n3:56\nSo just to remember, we always include\n3:58\ntwo type A's and one type B. And the type A's, one is a H1N1\n4:05\nand the other is a H3N2.\n4:07\nThat's how we've been doing it in recent years.\n4:09\nNow let me bring up a little bit more canvas\n4:11\nbecause I want to talk you through exactly what happens\n4:13\nonce the WHO decides that these are\n4:16\nthe strains they're going to use.\n4:17\nAnd this decision was actually made back in February of 2012.\n4:22\nSo months and months in advance they're figuring out what\n4:24\nstrain we're going to use.\n4:27\nAnd that information then goes to the next group\n4:30\nof folks, which is the manufacturers.\n4:32\nThe manufacturers are going to take this information\n4:35\nand they're literally going to start putting things together.\n4:38\nThey're going to start the manufacturing process.\n4:41\nAnd one of the key parts of this process, which a lot of people\n4:44\ndon't realize, and it's pretty mind boggling,\n4:46\nis that you need millions, actually\n4:48\nhundreds of millions of eggs.\n4:51\nThe same kind of eggs you might eat for breakfast.\n4:54\nBut these eggs are actually laboratory grade\n4:56\nand they're needed for making this process work.\n4:59\nAnd once it's made, one of the key things,\n5:01\nand this reassures a lot of folks, is safety.\n5:04\nWe want to make sure that these things are safe.\n5:06\nAnd so a lot of testing goes into making sure\n5:08\nthat all of these vaccines that they make are safe.\n5:12\nSo once that's done and people feel comfortable that it's\n5:15\na safe vaccine, we start distributing it.\n5:18\nSo distribution is next.\n5:19\nAnd we're going to go through each of these stages\n5:21\nand think just a little bit about which people\n5:24\nare involved in all these steps.\n5:25\nBut I just want to lay out all the steps first\n5:28\nso you get an appreciation for how many players there are\n5:32\nand how many steps are in getting a vaccine to you.\n5:36\nSo it goes, of course, from distribution,\n5:38\nit goes to these clinics.\n5:39\nAnd then finally, at the end of the day there is a person.\n5:43\nThere might be you.\n5:44\nThis is you getting your flu shot\n5:46\nand you're very happy because you're now\n5:49\nprotected from the vaccine.\n5:51\nAnd I'll draw a little shield around you,\n5:55\na little protection for you, to make sure\n5:57\nthat it's clear that you're protected-- not completely--\n6:00\nI'll draw a little hole in the protection--\n6:02\nnot completely because a vaccine isn't perfect.\n6:05\nBut it's pretty good.\n6:06\nAnd in fact, this year, in terms of how well the vaccine is\n6:09\nworking-- not in studies, but in the real world-- in terms\n6:13\nof how it's doing as people are getting it--\n6:15\nabout 62% effectiveness.\n6:17\nSo it's actually really quite good.\n6:19\nIn studies we always see around 60% to 70%.\n6:22\nAnd now, in real life, we're seeing a 62% effectiveness\n6:26\nin terms of vaccine effectiveness.\n6:29\nThe word effectiveness just means real world data,\n6:32\nversus efficacy-- is what we see in studies.\n6:35\nThat's the difference in the two words.\n6:37\nSo let me list out some of the different folks involved\n6:40\nat each step of the way.\n6:42\nSo in terms of selecting the strain,\n6:44\nwe said that the WHO is responsible in working\n6:47\nwith all the different countries and the public health\n6:50\ngroups and laboratories and scientists that\n6:52\nare looking at all the strain data.\n6:54\nAnd then in terms of manufacturing, there\n6:56\nyou got to think about the vaccine industry.\n6:58\nThere are many, many big players here.\n7:00\nBig business is involved in terms\n7:03\nof churning out millions of doses of vaccine.\n7:06\nSo here the vaccine industry is a major player.\n7:09\nAnd then, you think of all the other groups that are involved.\n7:11\nSo I said that you have to get hundreds of millions of eggs\n7:16\nto make this process work.\n7:18\nAnd so of course, then you have to really work with farmers.\n7:20\nAnd if you have a year where the flu is really\n7:23\nhurting the birds and the chicken population\n7:26\nthen that's going to make it really hard because there\n7:28\nare fewer eggs to contribute to the vaccine manufacturing.\n7:32\nSo it's actually an interesting thought process.\n7:35\nFlu obviously affects chickens as well as humans.\n7:38\nAnd so if those populations start dying out,\n7:41\nthen even humans suffer because we don't have the vaccine.\n7:44\nNow, then safety is huge.\n7:45\nSo you have to think of all the different countries that\n7:48\nhave organizations that care about safety.\n7:51\nAnd in the US the one that comes to mind\n7:53\nis the FDA, or the Food and Drug Administration.\n7:56\nSo each country has its own process\n7:58\nof thinking about safety.\n8:00\nAnd those groups are obviously very involved\n8:02\nin making the vaccine as well.\n8:04\nThen you've got all these logistic things to think about.\n8:06\nI mean, if you're making hundreds of millions\n8:08\nof vaccines, you've got to distribute them\n8:10\naround the world.\n8:11\nYou've got to think about airplanes that can actually\n8:13\ntake your flu vaccine and move it around.\n8:16\nYou've got to think about refrigeration.\n8:18\nMaybe ships if you're moving across large bodies of water.\n8:23\nMaybe trucks to get vaccine inland\n8:26\nif it's cheaper that way.\n8:27\nSo lots of logistical issues to think about how to get vaccine\n8:31\ndistributed.\n8:32\nAnd then finally, you've got nurses and doctors\n8:34\nin the clinics that have to be informed.\n8:36\nThey need to know when to start making appointments\n8:38\nfor their patients and how to set up\n8:40\nclinics to actually administer the vaccine to all the folks.\n8:44\nAnd finally we've got you.\n8:46\nYou're at the end of this chain.\n8:48\nAnd not just you, but there are about 250 million folks just\n8:52\nlike you getting vaccines.\n8:54\nSo 250 million doses are actually put together.\n8:58\nAnd this is quite an effort.\n9:00\nYou can see the countries involved.\n9:02\nAnd getting all that information to all these different groups\n9:05\nthat have to get involved in terms\n9:06\nof making this even possible.\n9:08\nSo, to me, this is actually one of the most impressive feats\n9:11\nout there.\n9:12\nAnd it really is a testament to what\n9:14\nscience can do for mankind.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nBy this point in the biology playlist,\n0:02\nyou're probably wondering a very natural question,\n0:06\nhow is gender determined in an organism?\n0:09\nAnd it's not an obvious answer,because throughout the animal kingdom,\n0:12\nit's actually determined in different ways.\n0:15\nIn some creatures,especially some types of reptiles,it's environmental\n0:23\nNot all reptiles,but certain cases of it.\n0:26\nIt could be maybe the temperature in which the\n0:29\nembryo develops will dictate whether it turns into a male or female\n0:32\nor other environmental factors.\n0:34\nAnd in other types of animals,especially mammals,\n0:38\nof which we are one example,it's a genetic basis.\n0:45\nAnd so your next question is,hey,Sal,so--\n0:47\nlet me write this down,in mammals it's genetic--\n0:55\nso,OK,maybe they're different alleles,a male or a female allele.\n1:01\nBut then you're like,hey,but there's so many different characteristics\n1:04\nthat differentiate a man from a woman.\n1:08\nMaybe it would have to be a whole set of genes\n1:09\nthat have to work together.\n1:11\nAnd to some degree,your second answer would be more correct.\n1:16\nIt's even more than just a set of genes.\n1:18\nIt's actually whole chromosomes determine it.\n1:21\nSo let me draw a nucleus.That's going to be my nucleus.\n1:25\nAnd this is going to be the nucleus for a man.\n1:27\nSo 22 of the pairs of chromosomes\n1:29\nare just regular non-sex-determining chromosomes.\n1:33\nSo I could just do,that's one of the homologous,2,4,6,8,10,12,14.\n1:41\nI can just keep going.And eventually you have 22 pairs.\n1:45\nSo these 22 pairs right there,they're called autosomal.\n1:51\nAnd those are just our standard pairs of chromosomes\n1:54\nthat code for different things.\n1:55\nEach of these right here is a homologous pair,homologous,\n2:02\nwhich we learned before you get one from each of your parents.\n2:05\nThey don't necessarily code for the same thing,\n2:07\nfor the same versions of the genes,but they code for the same genes.\n2:11\nIf eye color is on this gene,it's also on that gene,\n2:13\non the other gene of the homologous pair.\n2:15\nAlthough you might have different versions of eye color\n2:17\non either one and that determines what you display.\n2:20\nBut these are just kind of the standard genes\n2:23\nthat have nothing to do with our gender.\n2:25\nAnd then you have these two other special chromosomes.\n2:31\nI'll do this one.\n2:32\nIt'll be a long brown one,and then I'll do a short blue one.\n2:36\nAnd the first thing you'll notice is that they don't look homologous.\n2:39\nHow could they code for the same thing\n2:41\nwhen the blue one is short and the brown one's long?\n2:44\nAnd that's true.They aren't homologous.\n2:46\nAnd these we'll call our sex-determining chromosomes.\n2:59\nAnd the long one right here,\n3:01\nit's been the convention to call that the x chromosome.\n3:07\nLet me scroll down a little bit.\n3:09\nAnd the blue one right there,we refer to that as the y chromosome.\n3:16\nAnd to figure out whether something is a male or a female,\n3:19\nit's a pretty simple system.\n3:20\nIf you've got a y chromosome,you are a male.\n3:23\nSo let me write that down.\n3:26\nSo this nucleus that I drew just here--\n3:28\nobviously you could have the whole broader cell all around here--\n3:31\nthis is the nucleus for a man.\n3:34\nSo if you have an x chromosome--\n3:35\nand we'll talk about in a second\n3:37\nwhy you can only get that from your mom--\n3:39\nan x chromosome from your mom and a y chromosome from your dad,\n3:43\nyou will be a male.\n3:46\nIf you get an x chromosome from your mom\n3:49\nand an x chromosome from your dad,you're going to be a female.\n3:54\nAnd so we could actually even draw a Punnett square.\n3:56\nThis is almost a trivially easy Punnett square,\n3:58\nbut it kind of shows what all of the different possibilities are.\n4:02\nSo let's say this is your mom's genotype\n4:04\nfor her sex-determining chromosome.\n4:07\nShe's got two x's.\n4:09\nThat's what makes her your mom and not your dad.\n4:11\nAnd then your dad has an x and a y--\n4:14\nI should do it in capital--and has a Y chromosome.\n4:19\nAnd we can do a Punnett square.\n4:20\nWhat are all the different combinations of offspring?\n4:23\nWell,your mom could give this X chromosome,\n4:25\nin conjunction with this X chromosome from your dad.\n4:28\nThis would produce a female.\n4:29\nYour mom could give this other X chromosome with that X chromosome.\n4:32\nThat would be a female as well.\n4:35\nWell,your mom's always going to be donating an X chromosome.\n4:38\nAnd then your dad is going to donate either the X or the Y.\n4:42\nSo in this case,it'll be the Y chromosome.\n4:44\nSo these would be female,and those would be male.\n4:46\nAnd it works out nicely that half are female and half are male.\n4:50\nBut a very interesting and somewhat ironic fact\n4:55\nmight pop out at you when you see this.\n4:57\nwhat determines whether someone is\n4:59\nor Who determines whether their offspring are male or female?\n5:04\nIs it the mom or the dad?\n5:07\nWell,the mom always donates an X chromosome,\n5:09\nso in no way does- what the haploid genetic makeup of the mom's eggs\n5:16\nof the gamete from the female,\n5:18\nin no way does that determine the gender of the offspring.\n5:22\nIt's all determined by whether--let me just draw a bunch of--\n5:26\ndad's got a lot of sperm,and they're all racing towards the egg.\n5:34\nAnd some of them have an X chromosome in them\n5:37\nand some of them have a Y chromosome in them.\n5:41\nAnd obviously they have others.\n5:42\nAnd obviously if this guy up here wins the race.\n5:46\nOr maybe I should say this girl.If she wins the race,\n5:49\nthen the fertilized egg will develop into a female.\n5:53\nIf this sperm wins the race,\n5:55\nthen the fertilized egg will develop into a male.\n5:59\nAnd the reason why I said it's ironic is throughout history,\n6:01\nand probably the most famous example of this is Henry the VIII.\n6:09\nI mean it's not just the case with kings.\n6:11\nIt's probably true,because most of our civilization is male dominated,\n6:15\nthat you've had these men who are obsessed with producing a male heir\n6:19\nto kind of take over the family name.\n6:21\nAnd,in the case of Henry the VIII,take over a country.\n6:24\nAnd they become very disappointed and they tend to blame their wives\n6:28\nwhen the wives keep producing females,but it's all their fault.\n6:33\nHenry the VIII,I mean the most famous case was with Ann Boleyn.\n6:39\nI'm not an expert here,but the general notion is that\n6:43\nhe became upset with her that she wasn't producing a male heir.\n6:47\nAnd then he found a reason to get her essentially decapitated,\n6:52\neven though it was all his fault.\n6:58\nHe was maybe producing a lot more sperm\n7:01\nthat looked like that than was looking like this.\n7:03\nHe eventually does produce a male heir so he was--\n7:04\nand if we assume that it was his child--\n7:07\nthen obviously he was producing some of these,but for the most part,\n7:11\nit was all Henry the VIII's fault.\n7:13\nSo that's why I say there's a little bit of irony here.\n7:15\nIs that the people doing the blame are the people\n7:17\nto blame for the lack of a male heir?\n7:20\nNow one question that might immediately pop up in your head is,\n7:24\nSal,is everything on these chromosomes\n7:28\nrelated to just our sex-determining traits\n7:31\nor are there other stuff on them?\n7:34\nSo let me draw some chromosomes.\n7:38\nSo let's say that's an X chromosome and this is a Y chromosome.\n7:43\nNow the X chromosome,it does code for a lot more things,\n7:47\nalthough it is kind of famously gene poor.\n7:50\nIt codes for on the order of 1,500 genes.\n7:55\nAnd the Y chromosome,it's the most gene poor of all the chromosomes.\n8:00\nIt only codes for on the order of 78 genes.\n8:05\nI just looked this up,but who knows if it's exactly 78.\n8:09\nBut what it tells you is it does very little\n8:11\nother than determining what the gender is.\n8:13\nAnd the way it determines that,\n8:15\nit does have one gene on it called the SRY gene.\n8:19\nYou don't have to know that.\n8:21\nSRY,that plays a role in the development of testes\n8:30\nor the male sexual organ.So if you have this around,\n8:35\nthis gene right here can start coding for things\n8:38\nthat will eventually lead to the development of the testicles.\n8:42\nAnd if you don't have that around,that won't happen,\n8:43\nso you'll end up with a female.\n8:45\nAnd I'm making gross oversimplifications here.\n8:48\nBut everything I've dealt with so far,OK,\n8:50\nthis clearly plays a role in determining sex.\n8:53\nBut you do have other traits on these genes.\n8:58\nAnd the famous cases all deal with specific disorders.\n9:02\nSo,for example,color blindness.\n9:05\nThe genes,or the mutations I should say.\n9:08\nSo the mutations that cause color blindness.\n9:15\nRed-green color blindness,which I did in green,\n9:20\nwhich is maybe a little bit inappropriate.\n9:24\nColor blindness and also hemophilia.\n9:28\nThis is an inability of your blood to clot.\n9:30\nActually, there's several types of hemophilia.\n9:32\nBut hemophilia is an inability for your blood to clot properly.\n9:36\nAnd both of these are mutations on the X chromosome.\n9:45\nAnd they're recessive mutations.So what does that mean?\n9:51\nIt means both of your X chromosomes have to have--\n9:54\nlet's take the case for hemophilia--\n9:56\nboth of your X chromosomes have to have the hemophilia mutation\n9:59\nin order for you to show the phenotype of having hemophilia.\n10:04\nSo,for example,if there's a woman,\n10:06\nand let's say this is her genotype.\n10:09\nShe has one regular X chromosome\n10:10\nand then she has one X chromosome that has the--\n10:13\nI'll put a little superscript there for hemophilia--\n10:16\nshe has the hemophilia mutation.She's just going to be a carrier.\n10:21\nHer phenotype right here is going to be no hemophilia.\n10:29\nShe'll have no problem clotting her blood.\n10:32\nThe only way that a woman could be a hemophiliac is\n10:35\nif she gets two versions of this,\n10:36\nbecause this is a recessive mutation.\n10:42\nNow this individual will have hemophilia.\n10:49\nNow men,they only have one X chromosome.\n10:54\nSo for a man to exhibit hemophilia to have this phenotype,\n10:57\nhe just needs it only on the one X chromosome he has.\n11:03\nAnd then the other one's a Y chromosome.\n11:07\nSo this man will have hemophilia.\n11:11\nSo a natural question should be arising is, hey, you know this guy--\n11:14\nlet's just say that this is a relatively infrequent mutation\n11:19\nthat arises on an X chromosome--\n11:22\nthe question is who's more likely to have hemophilia?\n11:25\nA male or a female?\n11:27\nAll else equal,who's more likely to have it?\n11:29\nWell if this is a relatively infrequent allele,a female,\n11:33\nin order to display it,has to get two versions of it.\n11:35\nSo let's say that the frequency of it--\n11:38\nand I looked it up before this video--\n11:41\nroughly they say between 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 men exhibit hemophilia.\n11:46\nSo let's say that the allele frequency of this is 1 in 7,000,\n11:51\nthe frequency of Xh,the hemophilia version of the X chromosome.\n12:01\nAnd that's why 1 in 7,000 men display it,\n12:03\nbecause it's completely determined whether--\n12:05\nthere's a 1 in 7,000 chance that\n12:07\nthis X chromosome they get is the hemophilia version.\n12:11\nWho cares what the Y chromosome they get is, cause\n12:14\nthat essentially doesn't code at all for the blood clotting factors\n12:17\nand all of the things that drive hemophilia.\n12:19\nNow,for a woman to get hemophilia,what has to happen?\n12:23\nShe has to have two X chromosomes with the mutation.\n12:26\nWell the probability of each of them having the mutation is 1 in 7,000\n12:33\nSo the probability of her having hemophilia is\n12:37\n1 in 7,000 times 1 in 7,000,or that's 1 in what,49 million.\n12:46\nSo as you can imagine,the incidence of hemophilia in women\n12:49\nis much lower than the incidence of hemophilia in men.\n12:54\nAnd in general for any sex-linked trait, if it's recessive,\n12:56\nif it's a recessive sex-linked trait,which means men,\n13:00\nif they have it,they're going to show it,\n13:02\nbecause they don't have another X chromosome to dominate it.\n13:06\nOr for women to show it, she has to have both versions of it.\n13:09\nThe incidence in men is going to be,\n13:14\nso let's say that m is the incidence in men.I'm spelling badly.\n13:29\nThen the incidence in women will be what?\n13:33\nYou could view this as the allele frequency\n13:35\nof that mutation on the X chromosome.\n13:38\nSo women have to get two versions of it.\n13:40\nSo the woman's frequency is m squared.\n13:42\nAnd you might say,hey,that looks like a bigger number.\n13:44\nI'm squaring it. But you have to remember that these numbers,\n13:47\nthe frequency is less than 1,\n13:49\nso in the case of hemophilia,that was 1 in 7,000.\n13:53\nSo if you square 1 in 7,000,you get 1 in 49 million.\n13:58\nAnyway,hopefully you found that interesting\n14:00\nand now you know how we all become men and women.\n14:05\nAnd even better you know whom to blame when some of these, I guess,\n14:11\nmale-focused parents are having trouble getting their son.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:02\nVoiceover: You'll very rarely hear anyone say that\n0:04\nthe patient has leukemia.\n0:06\nInstead, they're more likely to say something like\n0:08\nthe patient has acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.\n0:11\nSo, what do all of those other words mean?\n0:13\nWell, to understand that we'd have to\n0:15\ngo back to this diagram, which at this point\n0:18\nis probably showing up in your dreams,\n0:20\nbecause of how many times I've used it,\n0:21\nbut we're going to use it this time\n0:23\nto show how the different leukemias are divided,\n0:26\nhow they're split up and organized.\n0:28\nSo, the first thing I'm going to do is,\n0:30\nI'm going to divide this diagram in half.\n0:32\nI'm going to divide it in half horizontally.\n0:34\nSo, I'm going to draw this line down the middle,\n0:36\nand that would split up the cells according to\n0:38\nhow mature they are, right?\n0:40\nSo, you'd end up with a row of cells on top that has\n0:43\nthe most immature blood cells\n0:45\nthat you could possibly have and a row of cells\n0:48\nat the bottom which has some still immature cells,\n0:51\nbut these cells are a little bit more developed,\n0:54\na little bit further along.\n0:56\nSo, this is actually the first way that\n0:58\nyou can split up the leukemias.\n1:00\nIf a leukemia comes from one of these cells up here,\n1:02\nit's called an acute leukemia, and if it comes from\n1:07\none of these cells down here,\n1:08\nit's called a chronic leukemia.\n1:10\nSo, the first way to split up the leukemias\n1:13\nis by how immature the originating cell is.\n1:17\nSo, what do the words acute and chronic\n1:19\nhave to do with maturity?\n1:21\nThat seems like a really random word choice, right?\n1:24\nWell, it's actually not, because acute leukemias,\n1:27\nturns out they grow very fast, they grow very fast.\n1:31\nSo, a person with an acute leukemia\n1:33\ncan start to feel sick, can start to show signs and symptoms\n1:36\nwithin weeks, not years but weeks of the leukemia forming.\n1:41\nSo, it's a very acute onset of disease, okay?\n1:46\nNow, chronic leukemias, turns out they grow very slowly.\n1:49\nSo, a patient with a chronic leukemia can sometimes\n1:53\ngo years without having any symptoms at all.\n1:56\nSo, it's a very chronic onset of disease.\n2:01\nSo, I just want to clarify, guys, that the whole process\n2:04\nby which the leukemia occurs is still the same.\n2:07\nSo, we still have this immature blood cell\n2:09\nthat loses the ability to mature and then starts\n2:12\ndividing rapidly and out of control.\n2:15\nThat's still going on, but what we're doing now is\n2:17\nwe're fine-tuning what we mean by the word, immature.\n2:21\nSo, we're asking the question,\n2:22\njust how immature is that blood cell?\n2:25\nAnd so, I want to go back to the diagram\n2:29\nthat we used to show how leukemias occur.\n2:31\nSo, we said that this is what normal blood cell\n2:34\nmaturation looks like, right?\n2:36\nAnd this is what happens when leukemia occurs.\n2:39\nSo, you have this blood cell that's stuck.\n2:41\nIt's arrested in the immature state,\n2:44\nand it can't move any further, and then it starts\n2:46\nto divide really rapidly and out of control.\n2:49\nSo, look at the leukemia cells.\n2:51\nSince they're in the first stage of development,\n2:53\nthey're the most immature blood cells\n2:55\nthat you could possibly have.\n2:56\nThis must be a picture of acute leukemia.\n2:59\nSo, let's compare that with what\n3:01\nchronic leukemias look like.\n3:03\nSo, a chronic leukemia picture looks more like this,\n3:07\nwhere you still have these blood cells,\n3:09\nthese immature blood cells that are arrested\n3:11\nin their maturation, they can't move forward,\n3:14\nand they start dividing really rapidly.\n3:15\nThe only difference is, is that this time\n3:18\nthe leukemia cells are a little bit more developed.\n3:20\nThey're at the next stage of maturation,\n3:22\nand not only do these chronic leukemia cells\n3:25\ndivide really rapidly, but they also live longer\n3:29\nthan the average normal blood cell does.\n3:32\nSo, there's a degree of immortality\n3:34\nthat these chronic leukemia cells have.\n3:36\nSo, this is a picture of chronic leukemia.\n3:42\nNow, something else that I think this diagram\n3:45\ndoes a pretty decent job of illustrating is that\n3:47\nwhen you have an acute leukemia,\n3:49\nyour leukemia cells look nothing like your\n3:51\nmature specialized cells.\n3:52\nI mean, they bear no resemblance whatsoever,\n3:55\nand we said before that these cells\n3:57\nperform almost no function.\n3:59\nThey're just kind of like a waste of space\n4:01\nversus if you look at your chronic leukemia cells,\n4:03\nthey don't look exactly like your\n4:06\nmature specialized cells, but they certainly\n4:07\nresemble them just a little bit more, right?\n4:10\nAnd in terms of their function, they leave a lot\n4:14\nto be wanted, but it's not unreasonable to say that\n4:17\nthey can do a couple of things correctly.\n4:20\nYou know, they won't do everything,\n4:21\nbut they can do a couple of things correctly.\n4:24\nSo, this is the first way you can split up\n4:26\nthe leukemias, acute versus chronic,\n4:28\nwhere acute leukemias come from the most immature cells,\n4:31\nchronic a little bit more developed,\n4:33\na little bit more mature cells.\n4:34\nAcute leukemias grow very rapidly.\n4:37\nChronic leukemias grow slowly.\n4:39\nAnd acute leukemia cells bear no resemblance\n4:41\nin appearance or in function to the\n4:43\nmature specialized cells versus chronic leukemia cells\n4:47\nresemble the mature specialized cells\n4:49\na little bit more, in terms of appearance\n4:51\nand what they're able to do, okay?\n4:55\nSo, now let's talk about the second way\n4:56\nyou can split up the leukemias.\n4:57\nAnd so, this time we're going to take this diagram,\n4:59\nand we're going to split it in half vertically,\n5:02\nand if we did that, we drew a line down the middle,\n5:05\nwe'd be splitting up the cells not according to\n5:07\nhow mature they are but according to what cell type,\n5:10\nwhat type of cell they are.\n5:12\nSo, you'd end up with the myeloid cells over here\n5:15\nand the lymphoid cells over here, and you can leave\n5:17\nthings as broad as myeloid versus lymphoid, or you can\n5:20\nspecify a little bit more about what cell lineage,\n5:24\nparticular cell lineage you're talking about.\n5:26\nSo, this is the second way that the leukemias\n5:28\nare split up, according to cell type.\n5:30\nSo, I want to go back to that first example\n5:33\nthat I gave you in the beginning of the video,\n5:35\nacute megakaryoblastic leukemia.\n5:38\nWhat cell does that leukemia develop from?\n5:40\nWell, if we're talking about acute, it must come from\n5:44\nthis row over here, right?\n5:45\nAnd we said acute megakaryoblastic,\n5:48\nso that must be this cell right here, this cell right here.\n5:52\nSo, an acute megakaryoblastic leukemia\n5:54\ncomes from this cell right here.\n5:56\nSo, let's take another example.\n5:57\nWhat about chronic lymphocytic leukemia?\n6:00\nSo, chronic means that it must come from\n6:02\none of these cells down here.\n6:03\nLymphocytic must be pointing to either\n6:05\nthis cell or this cell, right, one of the lymphocytes.\n6:09\nAnd you can leave it as broad as that\n6:11\nor you can specify whether you're talking about a\n6:12\nB lymphocyte or a T lymphocyte, okay?\n6:15\nSo, that's how all the leukemias are split up.\n6:17\nNow, we're ready to go into the details\n6:19\nabout the different leukemias.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- Now that we know how to assign oxidation states\n0:02\nto Carbon let's look at some organic redox reactions,\n0:06\nand remember these definition from general chemistry.\n0:09\nOxidation involves an increase in the oxidation state\n0:14\nand reduction involves a decrease\n0:17\nor a reduction in the oxidation state.\n0:20\nYou might also remember that loss of electrons is oxidation\n0:25\nand gain of electrons is reduction.\n0:28\nSo, LEO the lion goes GER as a good way to remember that.\n0:33\nLet's look at this starting compound here\n0:35\nand this reaction, and let's figure out\n0:37\nwhether the starting compound\n0:38\nhas been oxidized, reduced, or neither.\n0:41\nIf you look at these three carbons on the left\n0:44\nand these three carbons on the right.\n0:47\nAll right, there's no change to those carbons\n0:49\nso there should be no change\n0:50\nin the oxidation states of those carbons\n0:53\nbut when you look at this carbon right here,\n0:55\nthe one I just marked in yellow, right,\n0:57\non the left it's bonded to,\n0:59\nlet me go ahead and draw\n0:59\nthat out, Is double bonded to an oxygen,\n1:03\nand on the right it's bonded to a hydrogen,\n1:06\nand on the left it's bonded to a carbon.\n1:08\nBut on the right here that same carbon, right,\n1:12\nis now bonded to an oxygen on the right.\n1:14\nSo, it still double bonded it to an oxygen\n1:17\nand has a, has a bond to a carbon on the left,\n1:20\nbut on the right now, it has a bond to an OH.\n1:23\nSo, that carbon has likely changed its oxidation state\n1:27\nand we can go ahead and find the oxidation state\n1:30\nusing what we learned in the last video.\n1:33\nSo, remember you need to put in your bonding electrons.\n1:36\nSo, let's put in our bonding electrons here.\n1:38\nEach bond consists of two electrons.\n1:42\nAll right, so we know that when we're doing oxidation states\n1:45\nwe need to think about electronegativity differences\n1:48\nand carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen.\n1:51\nSo, we assign both of those electrons to carbon.\n1:55\nOxygen is more electronegative than carbon\n1:58\nso oxygen takes all four of those electrons.\n2:00\nAnd when we get to carbon versus carbon\n2:02\nwe can assume that those carbons have\n2:04\nthe same electronegativies\n2:06\nand therefore for two electrons\n2:08\nwe're gonna split those two electrons up.\n2:10\nWe're gonna give one electron to one carbon\n2:12\nand the other electron to the other carbon.\n2:14\nSo, this carbon is surrounded by three electrons\n2:17\nand we know carbon should have,\n2:19\nwe know carbon is supposed to have\n2:21\na number of four valence electrons around it.\n2:24\nSo, carbon's supposed to have four.\n2:25\nIn our dot structure here Carbon only has three.\n2:28\nLet me highlight them. One, two, and three.\n2:32\nSo, four minus three gives us plus one\n2:35\nwhich is the oxidation state for this carbon.\n2:38\nSo, this carbon right here has an oxidation state\n2:40\nof plus one on the left.\n2:42\nWhat about on the right?\n2:44\nLet's go ahead and put in our bonding electrons, right.\n2:46\nSo, we know that each bond consists of two electrons.\n2:51\nLet me put those in here.\n2:53\nAnd again, we think about electronegativity.\n2:55\nThis time on the right, this carbon\n2:58\nis bonded to an oxygen now so carbon loses\n3:01\nthose two electrons to oxygen.\n3:03\nRight, oxygen's more electronegative.\n3:06\nOxygen takes, this top oxygen takes those four electrons\n3:09\nand again, we split these two electrons.\n3:12\nSo, this time carbon is only surrounded by one.\n3:15\nSo, define carbon's oxidation state\n3:17\nwe know that carbon's supposed\n3:18\nto have four valence electrons\n3:20\nand from that we subtract the number\n3:22\nof valence electrons around carbon\n3:24\nonce we've accounted for electronegativity.\n3:26\nAnd that's only one electron now.\n3:28\nSo, four minus one gives us\n3:31\nan oxidation state of plus three.\n3:34\nSo, on the right this same carbon\n3:36\nnow has an oxidation state of plus three.\n3:40\nSo, what happened in this reaction?\n3:42\nCarbon went from an oxidation state of plus one\n3:44\nto an oxidation state of plus three.\n3:47\nAn increase in the oxidation state is oxidation.\n3:52\nSo, our starting compound was oxidized here.\n3:55\nSo, our starting compound was oxidized.\n3:58\nIn order for this to be oxidized\n4:00\nwe would need some sort of oxidizing agent.\n4:03\nSo, I'll write that down here really quickly.\n4:06\nWe would need an oxidizing agent\n4:07\nto accomplish this reaction.\n4:09\nAnd it's the oxidizing agent that itself\n4:12\nis being reduced because remember,\n4:14\nwhenever something is being oxidized\n4:15\nsomething else has to be reduced.\n4:18\nLet's think about the other definitions for,\n4:20\nthe other definition I should say for oxidation.\n4:23\nWe know that oxidation involves the loss of electrons.\n4:28\nSo, let's look at that here.\n4:29\nOn the left, right, carbon had three electrons around it,\n4:33\nand when we added a bond to oxygen,\n4:36\nright, carbon lost these two electrons over here.\n4:40\nIt had those two electrons.\n4:41\nOn the left it had those two electrons.\n4:43\nOn the right it lost those two electrons\n4:45\nand now it's only surrounded by one.\n4:47\nAnd we see an increase in the oxidation state.\n4:50\nSo, it's like carbon lost electrons.\n4:53\nAlso there's a shortcut that you can use.\n4:56\nFor this reaction, let's think about\n4:58\nwhat that shortcut would be.\n5:00\nLet me use, I'll use red still.\n5:02\nOn the left, this carbon with an oxidation state of plus one\n5:05\nhas two bonds to oxygen.\n5:07\nLet me go ahead and highlight them here.\n5:08\nSo, here's one bond and here's the other bond.\n5:10\nOn the right, that same carbon now\n5:13\nhas three bonds to oxygen.\n5:15\nSo, here's one bond, here's two bonds,\n5:17\nand then this bond over here.\n5:19\nSo, we've increased in the number of bonds to oxygen\n5:22\nand that can tell us we have an oxidation really quickly\n5:25\nwithout going through and doing all these oxidation states.\n5:29\nNotice we lost a bond to hydrogen.\n5:31\nAll right, so over here we lost this bond to hydrogen\n5:34\nand we replaced it with a bond to oxygen.\n5:39\nSo, an increase in the number of bonds to oxygen\n5:42\nor a decrease in number of bonds to hydrogen\n5:45\ncan tell you that your carbon is oxidized too.\n5:49\nLet's do another one.\n5:50\nSo, our goal is to figure out\n5:51\nwhether this starting compound has\n5:53\nbeen oxidized, reduced, or neither.\n5:56\nSo, again, these three carbons on the left, right,\n5:58\nare the same as these three carbons on the right.\n6:01\nAnd there's no change in those carbons.\n6:02\nSo, therefore we would expect no change\n6:04\nin the oxidation state.\n6:05\nThe same with this carbon.\n6:07\nSo, we're gonna focus in on this carbon.\n6:10\nSo, on the left that carbon has a double bond\n6:12\nto oxygen so we draw that in there\n6:14\nan then it's bonded to a carbon on the left\n6:16\nand a carbon on the right.\n6:19\nAnd our product, that same carbon,\n6:21\nis now bonded to only one oxygen.\n6:24\nLet me go ahead and do that.\n6:25\nOnly one bond I should say to oxygen\n6:27\nand it's still bonded to a carbon on the left\n6:30\nand still bonded to a carbon on the right,\n6:31\nand it must have a bond to hydrogen in here, right?\n6:34\nIt's not drawn in but it's assumed that you know that.\n6:37\nSo, let's put in that bond to hydrogen.\n6:39\nAnd let's find our oxidation states.\n6:41\nSo, we start on the left,\n6:43\nand we draw in our bonding electrons,\n6:46\nand next we think about electronegativity differences.\n6:50\nSo, we know that oxygen's more electronegative than carbon\n6:54\nso oxygen takes those four electrons.\n6:56\nOver here, right, we assume that the electronegativities\n6:59\nfor these carbons are the same,\n7:01\nand so we split up those two electrons.\n7:03\nWe give on electron to one carbon\n7:05\nand one electron to the other carbon.\n7:07\nAnd same over here.\n7:08\nSo, the oxidation state for carbon\n7:10\nwould be four valence electrons\n7:12\nminus this, in this case we have\n7:14\ntwo around carbon, so here's two.\n7:16\nFour minus two gives us an oxidation state of plus two.\n7:20\nSo, on the left this carbon has\n7:22\nan oxidation state of plus two.\n7:24\nWhat about on the right?\n7:26\nLet's put in our bonding electrons\n7:28\nand again, once we've done that we think about\n7:30\nelectronegativity and we can assign\n7:33\nan oxidation state to that carbon.\n7:36\nSo, we know that oxygen's more elecrtonegative\n7:39\nso oxygen takes those two electrons.\n7:41\nRight, again, there's, we assume\n7:43\nthat these carbons have the same electronegativity\n7:46\nso we split up those electrons.\n7:48\nWe split up these electrons.\n7:49\nBut now carbon is bonded to hydrogen.\n7:52\nSo, carbon is a little more electronegative\n7:54\nthan hydrogen so we just give both\n7:56\nof those electrons to carbon.\n7:58\nAnd now let's find our oxidation state.\n8:01\nWe know carbon is supposed to have\n8:02\nfour valence electrons around it\n8:04\nand in our drawing here, once we've\n8:06\naccounted for electronegativity\n8:08\ncarbon is surrounded by one, two, three, and four.\n8:12\nSo, four minus four is equal to zero.\n8:16\nAnd so this carbon, this carbon now\n8:19\nhas an oxidation state of zero.\n8:21\nSo, that carbon went from an oxidation state\n8:23\nof plus two to an oxidation state of zero.\n8:27\nThat's a decrease in the oxidation state.\n8:30\nSo, carbon was reduced.\n8:32\nSo, in this reaction our starting compound was reduced.\n8:36\nAll right, so this was, our starting compound was reduced\n8:39\nwhich means we would need some sort of reducing agent\n8:42\nto accomplish this reaction.\n8:45\nAnd it's the reducing agent that would be oxidized\n8:48\nbecause if something is reduced\n8:49\nsomething else has to be oxidized.\n8:51\nWe can also think about our other definition for reduction.\n8:56\nGain of electrons is reduction\n8:59\nand let's look at what happened here.\n9:01\nSo, the electrons that were gained right,\n9:03\nwere these two electrons right here\n9:05\nbecause on the left we had this carbon\n9:07\nwith a double bond to this oxygen.\n9:09\nOn the right, we have only now one bond to oxygen.\n9:11\nRight, so we gained these two electrons\n9:14\nbecause we increased the number of bonds to hydrogen.\n9:17\nSo, our other shortcut is to look\n9:19\nat the number of bonds to oxygen.\n9:21\nLike we talked about in the last example.\n9:23\nOn the left, carbon has a double bond to oxygen.\n9:26\nSo, two bonds to oxygen.\n9:28\nOn the right we have only one bond to oxygen.\n9:31\nSo, we decreased in the number of bonds to oxygen\n9:34\nso that's a reduction.\n9:35\nAgain, a fast way of figuring it out.\n9:37\nOr we increased an number of bonds to hydrogen.\n9:44\nLet's do one more of these problems.\n9:45\nSo, our goal is to figure out\n9:46\nif our starting compound on the left\n9:48\nhas been oxidized, reduced, or neither.\n9:51\nAnd this time these are the two carbons\n9:53\nthat we are going to analyze.\n9:55\nThose are the two carbons\n9:56\nthat have changed in this reaction.\n9:58\nSo, on the left let's draw what we have.\n10:00\nWe have a carbon with a double bond to another carbon\n10:03\nand both of those carbons are bonded to,\n10:06\ndirectly bonded to two more carbons.\n10:09\nOn the right, those carbons now\n10:11\nonly have a single bond between them\n10:13\nand this carbon on the left\n10:15\nis bonded to a hydrogen.\n10:16\nThis carbon on the right is directly bonded to an oxygen\n10:19\nand let's put in those other carbons, right?\n10:21\nWe have another carbon, carbon bonds.\n10:23\nI mean, let's put in those carbon, carbon bonds like that.\n10:26\nLet's assign our oxidation states.\n10:28\nSo, we draw in our bonding electrons\n10:31\nand we think about electronegativity differences\n10:35\nbut we're going assume once again\n10:37\nthat our carbons have the same electronegativity on the left\n10:41\nand so when we're assigning electrons\n10:43\nlet's just pick one of those carbons.\n10:45\nSo, let's pick the carbon on the left, right?\n10:48\nWe divide up those two electrons in that bond.\n10:51\nGive one electron to one carbon.\n10:52\nOne electron to the other.\n10:54\nWe do the same thing here.\n10:55\nAnd for the double bond with four electrons\n10:57\nwe divide up those four electrons.\n10:58\nWe give two electrons to each carbon.\n11:01\nAnd so carbon is supposed to have four valence electrons\n11:04\nand around it, this carbon has one, two, three, and four.\n11:09\nSo, four minus four is an oxidation state of zero.\n11:13\nSo, this carbon has an oxidation state of zero.\n11:16\nSame thing for the carbon on the\n11:18\nright side of the double bond, right?\n11:20\nSo, the same situation.\n11:22\nSo, it also has an oxidation state of zero.\n11:25\nWhat about for our product, right?\n11:28\nLet's examine those two carbons.\n11:29\nLet's put in our bonding electrons.\n11:31\nSo, we draw in our bonding electrons here.\n11:34\nSo, we put those in.\n11:36\nA lot more bonding electrons to draw.\n11:38\nAnd we think about electronegativity differences, right?\n11:41\nThings have changed.\n11:42\nSo, now, now let's focus in on the carbon on the left.\n11:47\nSo, the carbon on the left is now bonded to a hydrogen\n11:50\nand carbon is a little bit more electronegative.\n11:52\nSo, we give both of those electrons to carbon\n11:55\nand then we have carbon bonded to carbon,\n11:57\ncarbon bonded to carbon, and carbon bonded to carbon.\n12:00\nSo, what's the oxidation state\n12:01\nof that carbon on the left now?\n12:03\nCarbon is supposed to have four valence electrons\n12:06\nand how many do have around it?\n12:07\nLet's see, one, two, three, four, five.\n12:11\nSo, four minus five gives us\n12:13\nan oxidation state of minus one.\n12:16\nSo, this carbon on the left now has\n12:18\nan oxidation state of minus one.\n12:20\nWhat about the carbon on the right?\n12:23\nWell, we have a tie here, right?\n12:25\nSo, we divide up those electrons, a tie here,\n12:27\nbut oxygen is more electronegative than carbon.\n12:29\nSo, oxygen gets both of those electrons.\n12:32\nSo, the carbon on the right should have\n12:33\nan oxidation state of for minus three.\n12:37\nHere are the three electrons around carbon\n12:39\nonce we've accounted for electronegativity.\n12:42\nSo, that's an oxidation state of plus one.\n12:46\nSo, this carbon has an oxidation state of plus one.\n12:47\nSo, overall, what happened here?\n12:49\nWell, let me use red.\n12:51\nSo, the carbon on the left went from\n12:53\nan oxidation state of zero\n12:55\nto an oxidation state of minus one.\n12:58\nThat is a decrease in the oxidation state.\n13:01\nSo, that carbon was reduced.\n13:04\nWhat about the carbon on the right side\n13:06\nof the double bond that we started off with?\n13:08\nIt started off with an oxidation state of zero\n13:10\nand it went to an oxidation state of plus one.\n13:13\nThat's an increase in the oxidation state.\n13:16\nSo, that carbon was oxidized.\n13:18\nWhat can we say about starting compounds overall?\n13:21\nWell, the starting compound overall\n13:23\nthere's no net change in the oxidation states, right?\n13:26\nSo, on the left for those two carbons\n13:28\nwe get a total of zero.\n13:29\nOn the right we had negative one and positive one\n13:32\nfor a total of zero.\n13:33\nThere's no net change.\n13:35\nSo, this would be neither.\n13:36\nThe starting compound was, overall,\n13:38\nit wasn't oxidized or reduced. It's neither.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:02\nSo I've got four empty cells here.\n0:04\nLet's imagine these are four cells in someone's body.\n0:07\nAnd the inside of the cells are the same,\n0:09\nand the outside of the cells are the same.\n0:12\nSo they're really completely the same except for one thing.\n0:15\nAnd that one thing is that, let's say\n0:17\nthat these cells, each of them, is only permeable to one ion.\n0:21\nAnd I'm going to write the ion that they're\n0:23\npermeable to underneath them.\n0:25\nSo each of them can only let in or let out one ion.\n0:30\nSo in the first cell, you know that there's\n0:32\na lot of potassium that wants to get out,\n0:34\nso it's going to have potassium leaving.\n0:37\nIn the second cell, you know that we generally\n0:39\nhave more sodium on the outside that wants to get in.\n0:44\nAnd the same is true for chloride that wants to get in.\n0:47\nAnd the same is true for calcium that wants to get in.\n0:49\nSo this is how the four cells are\n0:52\ngoing to have a movement of ions,\n0:53\nand these are the concentration gradients.\n0:56\nAnd so then, of course, if you want\n0:58\nto figure out what the membrane potentials are,\n1:00\nyou have to think, OK, well, if it's a positive ion leaving,\n1:04\nthen it's going to make the membrane potential negative.\n1:08\nIn fact, we even calculated it to be negative 92 millivolts.\n1:12\nAnd for sodium, it turns out to be positive 67 millivolts.\n1:17\nAnd these are estimates based on rough concentrations.\n1:21\nOf course, concentrations aren't exact everywhere.\n1:23\nDifferent cell types have different concentrations.\n1:26\nBut these are kind of rough approximations.\n1:28\nAnd chloride would be somewhere around,\n1:31\nlet's say, negative 86 millivolts.\n1:36\nAnd you know it's negative because a negative ion is\n1:38\nentering.\n1:40\nAnd finally, calcium is going to be positive 123 millivolts.\n1:44\nAnd just to remind us, the reason\n1:47\nthat calcium isn't simply sodium times two--\n1:50\nbecause you might think that because calcium\n1:52\nhas two positive charges.\n1:53\nThe reason it's not just sodium's number times two\n1:57\nis that these numbers are actually\n1:58\nbased on concentration gradients,\n2:00\nand the concentration gradient for calcium\n2:02\nmight be very different.\n2:03\nIn fact, it is very different than it is for sodium.\n2:05\nSo that's how these numbers are made, using that Nernst\n2:09\nequation that we went over previously.\n2:13\nSo now we know that these are the resting potentials\n2:16\nfor each individual ion.\n2:18\nBut what is the potential for a cell, a real cell?\n2:21\nAnd you know we're not actually using a real cell\n2:24\nas an example, because real cells are\n2:26\npermeable to multiple ions.\n2:28\nAnd so let me actually give you an example\n2:30\nof what a real cell might look like.\n2:33\nOf course, it looks slightly different than that\n2:38\nbecause you actually have potassium leaving.\n2:40\nAnd at the same time, you might have sodium entering,\n2:45\nyou might have chloride entering,\n2:47\nand you might have calcium entering.\n2:50\nSo this is what a real cell would look like.\n2:52\nAnd let's figure out, maybe using an example,\n2:55\nhow to actually work through calculating\n2:58\nthe membrane potential for a real cell like that.\n3:01\nSo I'm going to write out the four ions\n3:02\nand make it really clear so that we\n3:05\ndon't get confused about the four.\n3:08\nWe're talking about, again, potassium, sodium, chloride,\n3:13\nand calcium.\n3:13\nAnd the reason I chose these four--\n3:15\nI could have chosen others as well--\n3:17\nbut that these four probably contribute the majority\n3:21\nto the resting potential.\n3:24\nIn particular, I would say potassium,\n3:28\nbut you'll see that all of them have\n3:29\na tiny little role in contributing to it.\n3:32\nSo let's first get to the idea of permeability.\n3:35\nSo until now, we've been assuming\n3:38\nthat each cell is, in the first example,\n3:41\nonly permeable to one ion.\n3:43\nAnd now the whole difference is that now we\n3:44\nhave cells that have permeability to multiple ions.\n3:48\nSo here's how you think about it.\n3:49\nThink about the fact that all ions crossing back and forth\n3:54\nalong the membrane make up permeability.\n3:57\nSo permeability is all ions crossing back and forth.\n4:01\nPermeability is all ions crossing--\n4:08\nand I'll just write crossing, and you\n4:10\nget the idea-- crossing back and forth along the border.\n4:14\nSo what percentage is going to be from potassium?\n4:19\nWhat percentage from sodium, chloride, and calcium?\n4:23\nAnd of course, the total permeability\n4:25\nhas to be 100% right?\n4:27\nWe have to add up to 100%.\n4:28\nAnd let's assume right now that we only\n4:30\nhave four ions going back and forth.\n4:33\nSo I'm just going to make up some quick numbers.\n4:35\nSo let's say that of the 100%, potassium is 95%,\n4:42\nmeaning that 95% of all border crossings--\n4:46\nif we think about our cell border or cell membrane,\n4:48\n95% of the crossings are with the ion potassium.\n4:53\nAnd that means that only 5% of the crossings\n4:56\nare with the other three ions.\n4:58\nSo let's say that it's 1% from sodium, and 2% from chloride,\n5:04\nand 2% from calcium.\n5:06\nSo really, in terms of dominating the permeability,\n5:10\nin this case, I've set it up so that potassium\n5:12\nis dominating the permeability, right?\n5:14\nAnd actually, in most cells that's about right.\n5:18\nPotassium is the dominant ion in most cells.\n5:22\nIn fact, sometimes even more than 95%.\n5:24\nSo how do you actually calculate the membrane potential\n5:28\nbased on this?\n5:29\nSo we've started with good information.\n5:31\nWe've got the permeability.\n5:34\nAnd now we need to multiply it by potassium's ideal membrane\n5:39\npotential.\n5:40\nWhat would potassium like it to be?\n5:41\nIt would like it to be negative 92 millivolts, right?\n5:46\nAnd sodium would like it to be positive 67 millivolts.\n5:51\nAnd chloride would like the membrane potential\n5:54\nto be negative 86 millivolts.\n5:58\nAnd calcium would like it to be positive 123.\n6:02\nI mean, that's ideally where those ions would like to be.\n6:05\nBut again, 95% of the voting, in a sense, for what the cell is\n6:11\ngoing to agree upon comes from one ion.\n6:14\nIt comes from potassium.\n6:16\nAnd so we just have to add all of this up and get a total.\n6:19\nSo this part right here, 95% of the ions being permeable,\n6:25\nmultiplied by the membrane potential for potassium.\n6:29\n95% times negative 92-- I'm just going to quickly do\n6:32\nthe math on a calculator-- works out\n6:35\nto negative 87.4 millivolts.\n6:41\nAnd this bit right here, 1% of the 67, well, that's easy.\n6:44\nThat's 0.7 millivolts.\n6:47\nThat's just 1%.\n6:49\nAnd then this bit, 2% times negative 86 millivolts, that\n6:55\nworks out to about negative 1.7 millivolts.\n6:59\nAnd finally, this part right here for the calcium\n7:03\nends up being positive 2.5 millivolts.\n7:08\nSo if you add up all the stuff, what do you get?\n7:11\nYou get a total of negative 85.9 millivolts.\n7:20\nSo this would be the membrane potential\n7:24\nfor a cell that ended up having 95% permeability to potassium,\n7:30\nand only 1% and 2% to the other three ions.\n7:35\nSo if it's going to be dominated by potassium,\n7:38\nyou can see that this final number\n7:40\nis going to be really close to what potassium would like\n7:43\nit to be, that negative 92, because 95% of it\n7:47\ncame from there.\n7:49\nNow that would be one way of doing it.\n7:51\nLet me do it one more time, and you'll\n7:53\nsee how it can actually change.\n7:56\nSo just as before, let's say that in the second case-- so\n8:00\nagain, this is case one.\n8:04\nAnd let's say case two, now I make\n8:08\npotassium not very permeable at all.\n8:10\nLet's say I drop it all the way down to 16%.\n8:19\nAnd I raise sodium all the way up to 80%.\n8:24\nSo now, all of a sudden, our same cell\n8:27\nas before is very permeable to sodium.\n8:30\nAnd you might think, well, how would that be the case?\n8:33\nLet's imagine that sodium channels get put into the cell\n8:38\nmembrane so that sodium can just go right\n8:40\nthrough those channels, so something like that.\n8:42\nBut let's say that the other two ions stay about the same.\n8:45\n2% and 2%.\n8:47\nSo you've got a similar setup as before,\n8:50\nand this time you've got-- let me do the math.\n8:55\nSo we've got negative 92 millivolts.\n8:58\nAnd again, the permeability-- this is actually\n9:00\nan important point-- adds up to 100% again, right?\n9:02\nBecause you've got 16 plus 80 plus 2 plus 2.\n9:05\nSo overall, we're still talking about 100%\n9:07\npermeability, but in this case, most of that\n9:10\npermeability is going to sodium.\n9:13\nSo negative 92 millivolts for the potassium,\n9:18\nyou've got positive 67 for the sodium, negative 86 over here,\n9:24\nand you've got positive 123 over here.\n9:28\nSo I'm going to do the last two first,\n9:30\nbecause those are going to be the same as before, right?\n9:32\nAnd then we add them all together.\n9:34\nSo here, of course, as before, I have negative 1.7.\n9:38\nThat doesn't change.\n9:39\nAnd as before, I have positive 2.5.\n9:42\nThat doesn't change.\n9:44\nSo some of it's going to be the same.\n9:46\nBut some of it's going to be different.\n9:48\nSo these two numbers-- let me just\n9:49\ncheck out what my math works out to be-- this is negative\n9:54\n14.7 millivolts, so a lot less than the negative 87.\n10:00\nAnd now this is going to be a huge number compared\n10:03\nto that measly 0.7 that we had before.\n10:06\nNow we have 53.6 coming from sodium.\n10:11\nSo now sodium is playing a much bigger role\n10:13\nthan it was last time.\n10:14\nAnd if I was to add these four numbers,\n10:17\nmy overall permeability was 100%,\n10:21\nand my overall membrane potential as a result of that\n10:25\nis going to be 39.7.\n10:27\nSo let me just-- and that's positive 39.7.\n10:31\nSo we went from negative 85.9 to positive 39.7.\n10:39\nAnd here, the dominant thing was this.\n10:45\nSo you can see how it's starting to approach positive 67, simply\n10:49\nbecause we just had so much of the permeability coming\n10:53\nfrom sodium.\n10:54\nSo in a way, the permeability becomes almost like a vote.\n10:58\nLike the more permeable one of the ions\n11:01\nis relative to the other ones, the more votes\n11:03\nit gets in terms of what the final membrane\n11:05\npotential is going to be.\n11:06\nAnd in this case, the more an ion votes,\n11:11\nthe more it's going to be close-- the final membrane\n11:13\npotential will be close-- to what it wants,\n11:16\nwhich is its resting potential.\n11:19\nSo we have these two membrane potentials.\n11:21\nAnd finally, I'm just going to show you\n11:23\non a little graph what this might look like.\n11:26\nSo let's say you've got a little graph here.\n11:30\nAnd I'm going to draw a positive and negative.\n11:32\nSo this is positive, this is negative,\n11:35\nand this is millivolts.\n11:37\nAnd what I'm drawing for you is the cell's membrane potential\n11:48\nin millivolts.\n11:50\nSo at time point 1-- let's say time point one was right here,\n11:55\nand time point 2 is right here.\n11:57\nAt time point 1, we had a very negative-- I forget the number.\n12:02\nI think it was like negative 80 something.\n12:04\nI'll just say it was negative 86 or something down here.\n12:08\nAnd then at time point 2, we had a number up here.\n12:13\nThis is our 39.7.\n12:17\nAnd actually let me just double check the number,\n12:19\nI don't want to get it wrong here.\n12:20\nYup, negative 86.\n12:23\nThis is negative 86, or 85.9.\n12:28\nSo really, what you had is, in just a matter\n12:31\nof switching the permeabilities, you\n12:34\ncan actually change the membrane potential from something\n12:37\nvery low to something very high.\n12:39\nSo let's stop there and we'll pick up.",

So this one\n3:02\nmight look like that and that.\n3:06\nSo these long-- I'll go into more detail on that.\n3:17\nThe fixed portion, you can imagine is green for any kind\n3:19\nof antibody, and then there's a variable portion.\n3:22\nSo maybe this guy's variable portion is--\n3:24\nI'll do it in pink.\n3:25\nAnd every one of the antibodies bound to his\n3:28\nmembrane are going to have that same variable portion.\n3:32\nThis different B cell is going to have\n3:34\ndifferent variable portions.\n3:36\nSo I'll do that in a different color.\n3:38\nMaybe I'll do it in magenta.\n3:40\nSo his variable portions are going to be different.\n3:47\nNow he has 10,000 of these on a surface and every one of\n3:50\nthese have the same variable portions, but they're all\n3:53\ndifferent from the variable portions on this B cell.\n3:57\nThere's actually 10 billion different combinations of\n4:00\nvariable portions.\n4:14\nSo the first question-- and I haven't even told you what the\n4:16\nvariable portions are good for-- is, how do that many\n4:19\ndifferent combinations arise?\n4:21\nObviously these proteins-- or maybe not so obviously-- all\n4:23\nthese proteins that are part of most cells are produced by\n4:27\nthe genes of that cell.\n4:29\nSo if I draw-- this is the nucleus.\n4:32\nIt's got DNA inside the nucleus.\n4:34\nThis guy has a nucleus.\n4:35\nIt's got DNA inside the nucleus.\n4:37\nIf these guys are both B cells and they're both coming from\n4:41\nthe same germ line, they're coming from the same, I guess,\n4:46\nancestry of cells, shouldn't they have the same DNA?\n4:57\nIf they do have the same DNA, why are the proteins that\n5:01\nthey're constructing different?\n5:03\nHow do they change?\n5:04\nAnd this is why I find B cells-- and you'll see this is\n5:08\nalso true of T cells-- to be fascinating is, in their\n5:11\ndevelopment, in their hematopoiesis-- that's just\n5:17\nthe development of these lymphocytes.\n5:20\nAt one stage in their development, there's just a\n5:22\nlot of shuffling of the portion of their DNA that\n5:25\ncodes for here, for these parts of the protein.\n5:30\nThere's just a lot of shuffling that occurs.\n5:33\nMost of when we talk about DNA, we really want to\n5:36\npreserve the information, not have a lot of shuffling.\n5:38\nBut when these lymphocytes, when these B cells are\n5:42\nmaturing, at one stage of their maturation or their\n5:46\ndevelopment, there's intentional reshuffling of the\n5:50\nDNA that codes for this part and this part.\n5:52\nAnd that's what leads to all of the diversity in the\n5:56\nvariable portions on these membrane bound\n5:58\nimmunoglobulins.\n5:59\nAnd we're about to find out why there's that diversity.\n6:02\nSo there's tons of stuff that can infect your body.\n6:07\nViruses are are mutating and evolving and so are bacteria.\n6:12\nYou don't know what's going to enter your body.\n6:14\nSo what the immune system has done through B cells-- and\n6:18\nwe'll also see it through T cells-- it says, hey, let me\n6:22\njust make a bunch of combinations of these things\n6:24\nthat can essentially bind to whatever I get to.\n6:28\nSo let's say that there's just some new virus\n6:33\nthat shows up, right?\n6:34\nThe world has never seen this virus before this B cell,\n6:40\nit'll bump into this virus and this virus won't attach.\n6:42\nAnother B cell will bump into this virus\n6:44\nand it won't attach.\n6:45\nAnd maybe several thousands of B cells will bump into this\n6:49\nvirus and it won't attach, but since I have so many B cells\n6:52\nhaving so many different combinations of these variable\n6:55\nportions on these receptors, eventually one of these B\n6:59\ncells is going to bond.\n7:00\nMaybe it's this one.\n7:06\nHe's going to bond to part of the surface of this virus.\n7:09\nIt could also be to part of a surface of a new bacteria, or\n7:13\npart of a surface for some foreign protein.\n7:16\nAnd part of the surface that it binds on the bacteria-- so\n7:21\nmaybe it binds on that part of the bacteria-- this is called\n7:24\nan epitope.\n7:28\nSo once this guy binds to some foreign pathogen-- and\n7:33\nremember, the other B cells won't-- only the particular\n7:35\none that had the particular combination, one of\n7:37\nthe 10 to the 10th.\n7:38\nAnd actually, there aren't 10 to the 10th combinations.\n7:41\nDuring their development, they weed out all of the\n7:43\ncombinations that would bind to things that are essentially\n7:48\nyou, that there shouldn't be an immune response to.\n7:52\nSo we could say self-responding combinations\n8:00\nweeded out.\n8:02\nSo there actually aren't 10 to the 10th, 10 billion\n8:04\ncombinations of these-- something smaller than that.\n8:06\nYou have to take out all the combinations that would have\n8:08\nbound to your own cells, but there's still a super huge\n8:12\nnumber of combinations that are very likely to bond, at\n8:15\nleast to some part of some pathogen of some\n8:17\nvirus or some bacteria.\n8:19\nAnd as soon as one of these B cells binds, it says, hey\n8:22\nguys, I'm the lucky guy who happens to fit exactly this\n8:26\nbrand new pathogen.\n8:28\nHe becomes activated after binding to the new pathogen.\n8:36\nAnd I'm going to go into more detail in the future.\n8:39\nIn order to really become activated, you normally need\n8:43\nhelp from helper T cells, but I don't want to\n8:46\nconfuse you in the video.\n8:47\nSo in this case, I'm going to assume that activation can\n8:50\nonly occur-- or that it just needs to respond, it just\n8:54\nneeds to essentially be triggered by\n8:57\nbinding with the pathogen.\n8:59\nIn most cases, you actually need the\n9:00\nhelper T cells as well.\n9:01\nAnd we'll discuss why that's important.\n9:03\nIt's kind of a fail safe mechanism\n9:05\nfor your immune system.\n9:07\nBut once this guy gets activated, he's going to start\n9:11\ncloning himself.\n9:13\nHe's going to say, look, I'm the guy that can match this\n9:17\nvirus here-- and so he's going to start cloning himself.\n9:20\nHe's going to start dividing and repeating himself.\n9:24\nSo there's just going to be multiple versions of this guy.\n9:41\nSo they all start to replicate and they also differentiate--\n9:45\ndifferentiate means they start taking particular roles.\n9:48\nSo there's two forms of differentiation.\n9:51\nSo many, many, many hundreds or thousands of these are\n9:54\ngoing to be produced.\n9:55\nAnd then some are going to become memory cells, which are\n10:01\nessentially just B cells that stick around a long time with\n10:05\nthe perfect receptor on them, with the perfect variable\n10:09\nportion of their receptor on them.\n10:21\nSo some will be memory cells and they're going to be in\n10:23\nhigher quantities than they were originally.\n10:25\nSo if if this guy invades our bodies 10 years in the future,\n10:28\nthey're going to have more of these guys around that are\n10:31\nmore likely to bump into them and start and get activated\n10:34\nand then some of them are going to turn\n10:35\ninto effector cells.\n10:36\nAnd effector cells are generally cells that actually\n10:38\ndo something.\n10:44\nWhat the effector cells do is, they turn into antibody-- they\n10:50\nturn into these effector B cells-- or sometimes they're\n10:53\ncalled plasma cells.\n10:55\nThey're going to turn into antibody factories.\n11:03\nAnd the antibodies they're going to produce are exactly\n11:06\nthis combination, the date that they originally had being\n11:10\nmembrane bound.\n11:12\nSo they're just going to start producing these antibodies\n11:15\nthat we talk about with the exact-- they're going to start\n11:19\nspitting out these antibodies.\n11:22\nThey're going to start spitting out tons and tons of\n11:24\nthese proteins that are uniquely able to bind to the\n11:28\nnew pathogen, this new thing in question.\n11:35\nSo an activated effector cell will actually produce 2,000\n11:40\nantibodies a second.\n11:41\nSo you can imagine, if you have a lot of these, you're\n11:43\ngoing to have all of a sudden a lot of antibodies floating\n11:46\naround in your body and going into the body tissues.\n11:49\nAnd the value of that and why this is the humoral system is,\n11:52\nall of a sudden, you have all of these viruses that are\n11:54\ninfecting your system, but now you're producing all of these\n12:01\nantibodies.\n12:01\nThe effector cells are these factories and so these\n12:05\nspecific antibodies will start bonding.\n12:08\nSo let me draw it like this.\n12:16\nThe specific antibodies will start bonding to these viruses\n12:22\nand that has a couple of values to it.\n12:28\nOne is, it essentially tags them for pick up.\n12:31\nNow phagocytosis-- this is called opsonization.\n12:40\nWhen you tag molecules for pickup and you make them\n12:42\neasier for phagocytes to eat them up, this is what--\n12:51\nantibodies are attaching and say, hey phagocytes, this is\n12:53\ngoing to make it easier.\n12:54\nYou should pick up these guys in particular.\n12:56\nIt also might make these viruses hard to function.\n12:59\nI have this big thing hanging off the side of it.\n13:01\nIt might be harder for them to infiltrate cells and the other\n13:04\nthing is, on each of these antibodies you have two\n13:09\nidentical heavy chains and then two\n13:13\nidentical light chains.\n13:17\nAnd then they have a very specific variable portion on\n13:20\neach one and each of these branches can bond to the\n13:25\nepitope on a virus.\n13:29\nSo you can imagine, what happens if this guy bonds to\n13:31\none epitope and this guy bonds to another virus?\n13:34\nThen all of a sudden, these viruses are kind of glued\n13:37\ntogether and that's even more efficient.\n13:38\nThey're not going to be able to do what they normally do.\n13:40\nThey're not going to be able to enter cell membranes and\n13:43\nthey're perfectly tagged.\n13:45\nThey've been opsonized so that phagocytes can come\n13:48\nand eat them up.\n13:49\nSo we'll talk more about B cells in the future, but I\n13:51\njust find it fascinating that there are that many\n13:53\ncombinations and they have enough combinations to really\n13:56\nrecognize almost anything that can exist in the fluids of our\n14:00\nbody, but we haven't solved all of the problems yet.\n14:02\nWe haven't solved the problem of what happens when things\n14:04\nactually infiltrate cells or we have cancer cells?\n14:08\nHow do we kill cells that have clearly gone astray?",

    "source_material": "•\n0:02\nHank: Oh, hello there\n0:05\nI'm at the gym.\n0:06\nI don't know why you're here,\n0:07\nbut I'm going to do some push-ups.\n0:08\nSo you can join me on the floor if you want.\n0:10\nNow I'm not doing this just to show off or anything,\n0:13\nI'm actually doing this for science, okay.\n0:16\n(grunts)\n0:17\nYou see what happened there?\n0:18\nMy arms moved.\n0:19\nMy shoulders moved.\n0:20\nMy back and stomach muscles moved.\n0:22\nMy heart pumped blood to all of those different places.\n0:24\nIt's pretty neat, huh?\n0:25\nWell, it turns out that how we make and use energy is a lot like sports\n0:28\nor other kinds of exercise.\n0:30\nIt can be hard work and a little bit complicated,\n0:32\nbut if you do it right, it comes with some tremendous payoffs.\n0:35\nBut unlike hitting a ball with a stick, it's so marvelously complicated\n0:38\nand awesome that we're still unraveling the mysteries of how it all works,\n0:41\nand it all starts with a marvelous molecule\n0:43\nthat is one of your best friends,\n0:45\nATP.\n0:46\n(energetic music)\n0:56\nToday, I'm talking about the energy and the process our cells\n1:00\nand other animals' cells go through to provide themselves with power.\n1:03\nCellular respiration is how we derive energy from the food\n1:06\nthat we eat, specifically from glucose\n1:08\nsince most of what we eat ends up as glucose.\n1:11\nHere's the chemical formula for one molecule of glucose.\n1:14\nIn order to turn this glucose into energy,\n1:16\nwe're going to need to add some oxygen.\n1:18\nSix molecules of it, to be exact.\n1:20\nThrough cellular respiration, we're going to turn\n1:22\nthat glucose and oxygen into six molecules of CO2,\n1:25\nsix molecules of water, and some energy that we can use\n1:29\nfor doing all of our push-ups.\n1:31\nSo that's all well and good, but here's the thing,\n1:33\nwe can't just use that energy to run a marathon or something.\n1:36\nFirst, our bodies have to turn that energy\n1:38\ninto a really specific form of stored energy called ATP\n1:43\nor adenosine triphosphate.\n1:45\nYou've heard me talk about this before.\n1:47\nPeople often refer to ATP as the currency of biological energy.\n1:51\nThink of it as an American dollar.\n1:52\nIt's what you need to do business in the U.S.\n1:55\nYou can't just walk into a Best Buy with a handful of Chinese yuan\n1:59\nor Indian rupees and expect to be able to buy anything with them\n2:02\neven though they technically are money.\n2:04\nSame goes with energy, in order to be able to use it,\n2:06\nour cells need energy to be transferred into adenosine triphosphate\n2:10\nto be able to grow, move, create electrical impulses\n2:14\nin our nerves and brains, everything.\n2:16\nA while back, for instance, we talked about how cells use ATP\n2:19\nto transport some kinds of materials in and out of its membranes.\n2:23\nTo jog your memory about that, you can watch that episode right here.\n2:25\nNow before we see how ATP is actually put together,\n2:28\nlet's look at how cells can cash in on the energy\n2:31\nthat's stashed in there.\n2:32\nWell, adenosine triphosphate is made up of a nitrogenous base\n2:35\ncalled adenine with a sugar called ribose\n2:38\nand three phosphate groups attached to it.\n2:40\nNow one thing you need to know about these three phosphate groups,\n2:43\nis that they are super uncomfortable sitting together in a row like that,\n2:48\nlike three kids on a bus who hate each other all sharing the same seat.\n2:52\nSo because the phosphate groups are such terrible company for each other,\n2:55\nATP is able to do this nifty trick where it shoots one\n2:58\nof the phosphate groups off the end of the seat,\n3:00\ncreating ADP, or adenosine diphosphate, because now,\n3:03\nthere are just two kids sitting on the bus seat.\n3:05\nAnd this reaction when the third jerk kid is kicked off the seat,\n3:08\nenergy is released.\n3:10\nAnd since there are a lot of water molecules just floating around nearby,\n3:13\nan OH pairing, that's called a hydroxide,\n3:15\nfrom one of the H2Os comes over and takes the place\n3:18\nof that third phosphate group, and everybody is much happier.\n3:21\nBy the way, when you use water to break down a compound like this,\n3:23\nit's called hydrolysis, \"hydro\" from water and \"lysis\"\n3:26\nfrom the Greek word \"for separate\".\n3:28\nSo now that you know how ATP is spent,\n3:30\nlet's see how it is minted, nice and new, by cellular respiration.\n3:35\nLike I said, it all starts with oxygen and glucose.\n3:37\nIn fact, textbooks make a point of saying that through cellular respiration,\n3:42\none molecule of glucose can yield a bit of heat\n3:46\nand 38 molecules of ATP.\n3:48\nNow, it's worth noting that this number is kind of a best-case scenario.\n3:51\nUsually it's more like 29 or 30 ATPs, but whatever.\n3:54\nPeople are still studying this stuff,\n3:56\nso let's stick with that number, 38.\n3:58\nNow, cellular respiration isn't something\n3:59\nthat just happens all at once.\n4:00\nGlucose is transformed into ATPs over three separate stages.\n4:04\nGlycolysis,\n4:05\nthe Krebs Cycle,\n4:06\nand the electron transport chain.\n4:08\nTraditionally, these stages are described as coming one after the other\n4:11\nbut really everything in the cell,\n4:13\nis kind of happening all at the same time.\n4:15\nBut let's start with the first step, glycolysis,\n4:18\nor the breaking down of the glucose.\n4:21\nGlucose, of course, is a sugar, you know this\n4:23\nbecause it's got an \"ose\" at the end of it.\n4:25\nAnd glycolysis is just the breaking up of glucose's six-carbon ring\n4:28\ninto two three-carbon molecules called pyruvic acids\n4:32\nor pyruvate molecules.\n4:34\nNow in order to explain how exactly glycolysis works,\n4:36\nI'd need about an hour of your time, and a giant cast of finger puppets\n4:40\neach playing a different enzyme, and though it would pain me to do it,\n4:44\nI would have to use words like phosphoglucoisomerase,\n4:47\nbut a simple way of explaining it,\n4:49\nis like this,\n4:50\nif you wanna make some money,\n4:52\nyou gotta spend some money.\n4:53\nGlycolysis needs the investment of two ATPs in order to work\n4:57\nand in the end, it generates four ATPs,\n5:00\nfor a net profit if you will of two ATPs.\n5:03\nIn addition to those four ATPs, glycolysis results in two pyruvates\n5:07\nand two super energy-rich morsels called NADH,\n5:11\nwhich are sort of the love children of a B vitamin called NAD+ pairing\n5:15\nwith energized electrons and a hydrogen to create storehouses of energy\n5:20\nthat will later be tapped to make ATP.\n5:22\nTo help us keep track of all the awesome stuff we're making here,\n5:25\nlet's keep score.\n5:27\nSo far we've created two molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADH,\n5:32\nwhich will be used to power more ATP production later.\n5:35\nNow, a word about oxygen.\n5:36\nLike I mentioned, oxygen is necessary\n5:39\nfor the overall process of cellular respiration.\n5:41\nbut not every stage of it.\n5:43\nGlycolysis, for example, can take place without oxygen,\n5:46\nwhich makes it an anaerobic process.\n5:48\nIn the absence of oxygen, the pyruvates formed\n5:50\nthrough glycolysis gets rerouted into a process called fermentation.\n5:55\nIf there's no oxygen in the cell, it needs more of that NAD+\n5:58\nto keep the glycolysis going.\n6:00\nSo fermentation frees up some NAD+,\n6:02\nwhich happens to create some interesting byproducts.\n6:05\nFor instance, in some organisms, like yeasts,\n6:07\nthe product of fermentation is ethyl alcohol,\n6:10\nwhich is the same thing as all of this lovely stuff.\n6:14\nBut luckily for our day-to-day productivity,\n6:17\nour muscles don't make alcohol when they don't get enough oxygen.\n6:21\nIf that were the case, working out would make us drunk,\n6:23\nwhich actually would be pretty awesome but instead of ethyl alcohol,\n6:27\nthey make lactic acid.\n6:28\nWhich is what makes you feel sore after that workout\n6:32\nthat kicked your butt.\n6:33\nSo, your muscles used up all the oxygen they had\n6:35\nand they had to kick into anaerobic respiration in order\n6:37\nto get the energy that they needed.\n6:39\nAnd so you have all this lactic acid building up\n6:42\nin your muscle tissues.\n6:44\nHa!\n6:45\nAh!\n6:46\nAh!\n6:47\nBack to the score.\n6:48\nNow we've made two molecules of ATP through glycolysis,\n6:52\nbut your cells really need the oxygen in order\n6:55\nto make the other 30-some molecules that they need.\n6:58\nThat's because the next two stages of cellular respiration,\n7:01\nthe Krebs Cycle and the electron transport chain,\n7:03\nare both aerobic processes, which means that they require oxygen.\n7:09\nAnd so we find ourselves at the next step in cellular respiration.\n7:12\nAfter glycolysis, comes the Krebs Cycle.\n7:15\nSo, while glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm or the fluid medium\n7:18\nwithin the cell that all the organelles hang out in,\n7:20\nthe Krebs Cycle happens across the inner membrane of the mitochondria,\n7:25\nwhich are generally considered the power centers of the cell.\n7:28\nThe Krebs Cycle takes the products of glycolysis.\n7:30\nThose carbon-rich pyruvates and reworks them\n7:33\nto create another two ATPs per glucose molecule, plus some energy\n7:38\nand a couple of other forms, which I'll talk about in a minute.\n7:41\nHere's how.\n7:41\nFirst, one of the pyruvates is oxidized,\n7:43\nwhich basically means that it's combined with oxygen.\n7:45\nOne of the carbons off the three-carbon chain bonds\n7:48\nwith an oxygen molecule and leaves the cell as CO2.\n7:50\nWhat's left is a two-carbon compound called acetyl coenzyme A\n7:54\nor acetyl coA.\n7:56\nThen, another NAD+ comes along, picks up a hydrogen\n7:59\nand becomes NADH.\n8:00\nSo our two pyruvates create another two molecules\n8:03\nof NADH to be used later.\n8:05\nAs in glycolysis, and really all life, enzymes are essential here.\n8:09\nThey are the proteins that bring together the stuff\n8:12\nthat needs to react with each other,\n8:15\nand they bring them together in just the right way.\n8:17\nThese enzymes, for example, bring together a phosphate with an ADP,\n8:21\nto create another ATP molecule for each pyruvate.\n8:24\nEnzymes also help join the acetyl coA\n8:26\nand a four-carbon molecule called oxaloacetic acid.\n8:30\nI think that's how you pronounce it.\n8:32\nTogether they form a six-carbon molecule called citric acid\n8:35\nand I'm certain that that's how you pronounce that one\n8:38\nbecause yeah, it's the stuff that's in orange juice.\n8:40\n(lively piano music)\n8:46\nFun fact,\n8:47\nthe Krebs Cycle is also known as the Citric Acid Cycle\n8:50\nbecause of this very byproduct.\n8:52\nHowever, it is usually referred to by the name of the man\n8:56\nwho figured it all out.\n8:57\nHans Krebs, an ear, nose, and throat surgeon who fled Nazi Germany\n9:02\nto teach biochemistry at Cambridge,\n9:04\nwhere he discovered this incredibly complex cycle in 1937.\n9:08\nFor being such a total freaking genius,\n9:10\nhe was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1953.\n9:13\nAnyway, the citric acid is then oxidized over a bunch of intricate steps,\n9:18\ncutting carbons off left and right, to eventually get back to oxaloacetic acid,\n9:23\nwhich is what makes the Krebs Cycle\n9:26\na cycle.\n9:27\nAnd as the carbons get cleaved off the citric acid,\n9:29\nthere are leftovers in the form of CO2 or carbon dioxide,\n9:32\nwhich are exhaled by the cell, and eventually by you.\n9:37\nYou and I, as we continue our existence as people,\n9:41\nare exhaling the products of the Krebs Cycle right now.\n9:45\nGood Work.\n9:46\n(breathes out loudly)\n9:47\nThis video, by the way, I'm using a lot of ATP making it.\n9:51\nNow, each time a carbon comes off of the citric acid,\n9:53\nsome energy is made, but it's not ATP.\n9:57\nIt's stored in a whole different kind of molecular package.\n10:00\nThis is where we go back to NAD+ and its sort of colleague FAD.\n10:06\nNAD+ and FAD are chummy little enzymes\n10:09\nthat are related to B vitamins.\n10:11\nDerivatives of Niacin and Riboflavin,\n10:12\nwhich you might have seen in the vitamin aisle.\n10:14\nThese B vitamins are good at holding onto high energy electrons\n10:18\nand keeping that energy until it can get released later\n10:21\nin the electron transport chain.\n10:22\nIn fact, they're so good at it, that they show up\n10:24\nin a lot of those high-energy vitamin powders\n10:27\nthat the kids are taking these days.\n10:28\nNAD+s and FADs are like batteries,\n10:31\nbig awkward batteries that pick up hydrogen and energized electrons\n10:35\nfrom each pyruvate, which in effect charges them up.\n10:38\nThe addition of hydrogen turns them into NADH and FADH2, respectively.\n10:43\nEach pyruvate yields three NADHs and one FADH2 per cycle,\n10:49\nand since each glucose has been broken down into two pyruvates\n10:52\nthat means each glucose molecule can produce six NADHs and two FADH2s.\n10:58\nThe main purpose of the Krebs Cycle is to make these powerhouses\n11:02\nfor the next and final step, the electron transport chain.\n11:06\nAnd now comes the time when your saying, \"Sweet pyruvate sandwiches, Hank,\n11:09\n\"aren't we supposed to be making ATP here?\n11:12\n\"Let's make it happen, Capt'n! What's the holdup?\"\n11:14\nWell friends, your patience is finally paying off\n11:16\nbecause when it comes to ATPs,\n11:18\nthe electron transport chain is the real moneymaker.\n11:21\nIn a very efficient cell, it can net a whopping 34 ATPs.\n11:26\nSo, remember all those NADHs and FADH2s we made in the Krebs Cycle?\n11:30\nWell, their electrons are going to provide the energy\n11:33\nthat will work as a pump along a chain of channel proteins\n11:36\nacross the inner membrane of the mitochondria\n11:39\nwhere the Krebs Cycle occurred.\n11:40\nThese proteins will swap these electrons to send hydrogen protons\n11:44\nfrom inside the very center of the mitochondria,\n11:46\nacross its inner membrane to the outer compartment of the mitochondria.\n11:50\nBut once they're out, the protons want to get back\n11:52\nto the other side of the inner membrane,\n11:54\nbecause there's a lot of other protons out there\n11:57\nand as we've learned, nature always tends to seek a nice, peaceful balance\n12:02\non either side of a membrane.\n12:04\nSo all of these anxious protons are allowed back in\n12:06\nthrough a special protein called ATP synthase.\n12:08\nAnd the energy of this proton flow drives this crazy spinning mechanism\n12:12\nthat squeezes some ADP and some phosphates together to form ATP.\n12:17\nSo, the electrons from the 10 NADHs that come out of the Krebs Cycle,\n12:20\nhave just enough energy to produce roughly three ATPs each.\n12:25\nAnd we can't forget our friends the FADH2s.\n12:27\nWe have two of them and they make two ATPs each.\n12:30\nAnd voila!\n12:31\nThat is how animal cells, the world over,\n12:34\nmake ATP through cellular respiration.\n12:36\nNow just to check, let's reset our ATP counter\n12:39\nand do the math for a single glucose molecule once again.\n12:41\nWe made two ATPs for each pyruvate during glycolysis.\n12:45\nWe made two during the Krebs Cycle,\n12:47\nand then during the electron transport chain we made about 34.\n12:51\nAnd that is just for one molecule of glucose.\n12:55\nImagine how much your body makes and uses every single day.",

I\n3:51\nwant to say, well what really is a wave?\n3:53\nAnd a wave really is just this disturbance that's propagating\n3:57\ndown the rope.\n3:59\nSo this is a good time to actually define a wave. A\n4:02\nwave. Because once I define it, I can start calling this a\n4:05\nwave, as opposed to a disturbance\n4:07\npropagating down the rope.\n4:09\nSo a wave is a disturbance propagating through space.\n4:24\nAnd you might see other definitions of a wave. One of\n4:27\nthe most typical ones is energy or a disturbance\n4:32\npropagating energy through a medium.\n4:35\nAnd when they say medium, it's what is\n4:36\nthe wave going through?\n4:37\nSo in this example, the rope would be our medium.\n4:42\nBut the reason why I don't want to use that definition of\n4:46\na wave is because in future videos, we'll learn about\n4:49\nelectromagnetic waves and those don't propagate through\n4:52\nany medium.\n4:53\nThey propagate through a vacuum.\n4:55\nSo to keep things as general as possible, we'll just call\n4:58\nit a disturbance that propagates through space.\n5:01\nAnd it usually transfers energy.\n5:17\nWhat do I mean by transferring energy?\n5:19\nOn this left hand part of the rope, I gave a\n5:21\nlittle energy the rope.\n5:22\nI moved it up, down, and then back again.\n5:25\nAnd then after I did that, that up, down, back again is\n5:28\nhappening successively to every point to the\n5:30\nright on the rope.\n5:31\nSo if I waited long enough, at this point on the rope right\n5:34\nhere, it's going to move up, down, and then back again.\n5:38\nExactly what I did over here is going to happen to this\n5:41\npoint on the rope.\n5:41\nAnd then later on, it's going to happen to some other future\n5:43\npoint on the rope.\n5:44\nSo that energy that I originally put on the\n5:46\nleft-hand side of the rope is being\n5:48\ntransferred down the rope.\n5:49\nIf I had some type of object here sitting on the rope,\n5:54\nmaybe when the wave-- when the disturbance- passes by it,\n5:59\nthis thing could get flipped into the air; it might get\n6:01\npushed into the air, and go into a\n6:03\nhigher potential energy.\n6:05\nSo this disturbance is transferring\n6:08\nenergy in this case.\n6:10\nNow, what I've drawn here isn't the only type of wave\n6:13\nyou can have. I mean my definition is fairly general.\n6:16\nBut the definition is more general than just what I've\n6:19\ndrawn here.\n6:20\nFor example, you could have a sound wave. If you just look\n6:28\nat all of the molecules of the air, they have some density\n6:33\nthat looks something like that.\n6:35\nAnd now let's say I had some type of a membrane-- maybe\n6:38\nit's a speaker-- that jolts this\n6:41\nleft-hand side of the air.\n6:42\nSo it just pushes-- so let me see if I can draw this.\n6:46\nLet's say I had some type of surface here that just really\n6:52\nquickly jolts-- that just moves it in that direction,\n6:55\nand then just comes back.\n6:56\nSo similar to what I did here, I go up and down.\n6:58\nBut instead of doing that, it just pushes the air and then\n7:01\npushes back.\n7:02\nSo what's going to happen?\n7:03\nRight after it pushes it, the air molecules that it pushes\n7:06\nup against are going to jam together.\n7:08\nThey're going to get compressed.\n7:11\nRight here, all these air molecules that were right on\n7:13\nthe surface, they're going to get pushed next to all these\n7:15\nair molecules that are right there.\n7:17\nAnd then when it pushes back, or when the membrane goes\n7:20\nback, you're going to have fewer air molecules here,\n7:23\nbecause you're going to have a low density here.\n7:25\nAnd then these guys, that are all scrunched up together,\n7:28\nthey're going to want to get away from each other.\n7:29\nThey might even run into each other.\n7:31\nAnd so these guys are going to run into those guys, who are\n7:34\ngoing to run into the next guys.\n7:35\nAnd so on and so forth.\n7:37\nAnd after these guys bump into those guys, those guys are\n7:39\ngoing to go back to where they were.\n7:41\nSo essentially, you're going to have this disturbance\n7:43\nthat's going to be a set of molecules compressing, or\n7:48\nbumping into, its neighboring molecules.\n7:50\nSo if you look at this at some future period in time, all of\n7:54\na sudden, this area might look normal.\n7:57\nLet me clear it and draw it just the way it I started.\n8:01\nSo this area might look normal.\n8:06\nBut that compression of the particles might have reached\n8:09\nright over here.\n8:15\nAnd not only that, we saw that right after the compression,\n8:17\nyou usually have this area of low pressure.\n8:20\nSo if I were to really draw this wave, and actually, if\n8:24\nthis membrane were to keep doing it over, and over, and\n8:27\nover again-- so it kept going forward and back, forward and\n8:30\nback, or right and left, right and left-- what you would have\n8:32\nis a series of compressions.\n8:34\nThe air would just have a series of compressions.\n8:36\nSo that's one compression.\n8:38\nYou'd have another compression right there.\n8:41\nAnother compression right there.\n8:44\nAnd then, in between the compressions\n8:45\nthe air is less dense.\n8:47\nThe air is less dense like this.\n8:50\nAnd what we've essentially just generated is a sound wave\n8:53\ntravelling through air.\n8:55\nSo this right here is a sound wave. And this type of wave,\n9:02\nwhere the direction of the disturbance is the same, or\n9:06\nalong the same axis as the direction in which the wave is\n9:09\ntravelling-- the wave is travelling in that direction--\n9:12\nthis is call a longitudinal wave. So sound waves sound\n9:16\nthrough air, they're longitudinal waves.\n9:23\nSometimes called a compression wave. Same thing.\n9:28\nCompression wave. Because it's caused by compression.\n9:31\nOur example of the string, this is called a transverse\n9:35\nwave. Because the disturbance, the movement of the medium, is\n9:44\ngoing in a direction transverse to-- or at an axis\n9:48\nthat's transverse to-- the direction of our movement.\n9:50\nWe're moving in that direction, to the right.\n9:53\nActually, our wave is moving to the right, but the actual\n9:56\nmedium is moving up and down.\n9:58\nOur medium is moving up and down.\n10:00\nThat's why this is called transverse.\n10:02\nWhile here the medium is moving left and right while\n10:05\nthe wave moves to the right.\n10:06\nSo it's along the same axis.\n10:08\nSo we're dealing with the compressional or longitudinal.\n10:11\nNow in this first example, I just did one cycle.\n10:14\nI just jerked up, down, and back again.\n10:18\nAnd I created this one disturbance.\n10:20\nAnd we can call this, when you just do it once, you can view\n10:23\nthis as a wave pulse.\n10:26\nIf I kept doing that-- if I just went up, down, back\n10:29\nagain, up, down, back again, and I kept doing it\n10:31\nperiodically, over and over again, then I would generate a\n10:34\nperiodic wave. And my string would look\n10:37\nsomething like this.\n10:43\nWell actually, it would look something that right there,\n10:50\nwhere that's the disturbance generated from our first time\n10:54\nthat we moved this left-hand part of our string.\n10:59\nSo this right here is a periodic wave.\n11:03\nIn the next video, we're going to talk about a lot of the\n11:05\nproperties of a periodic wave. How the wavelength, and its\n11:09\nfrequency, and its period relate to its velocity, and\n11:12\nall of that.\n11:13\nBut I'll leave that alone in this video.\n11:14\nBut I just wanted you to appreciate what I think is a\n11:17\nconcept that we use in everyday life.\n11:20\nSo it's a wave, it's a sound wave, and all that.\n11:22\nBut it's a fairly abstract notion where we talk about a\n11:24\nwave, we're really just pointing to a disturbance\n11:27\nthat's moving, usually along a medium, at least when we\n11:30\nvisualize it, but not always.\n11:32\nBut we're just pointing to this disturbance.\n11:34\nAnd this disturbance could take many forms. It could be a\n11:37\ntransverse disturbance if we're dealing with a string.\n11:39\nIt could be a disturbance in terms of the density of air\n11:44\nmolecules in terms of a sound wave. And there is a relation.\n11:47\nSo if you wanted to just plot the density here by position--\n11:53\nif I were to mathematically represent this compression\n11:55\nwave right here-- let's say that this line represents just\n11:59\nresting before the sound wave hits, that's\n12:02\njust your normal density.\n12:03\nIf we were to plot the density it might look\n12:05\nsomething like this.\n12:07\nOver here, we have very high density.\n12:08\nOver here, we have very low density.\n12:10\nOver here, we have very high density.\n12:11\nAnd if you were to plot it, it would look a lot like that\n12:15\ntransverse wave that I did with the rope at the beginning\n12:21\nof this video.\n12:21\nAnd that's why they're even grouped together.\n12:23\nBecause mathematically, even though a compression wave\n12:26\nlooks very different, or you might visualize or\n12:29\nconceptualize it very different than a transverse\n12:31\nwave, mathematically, they're essentially the same thing.\n12:34\nYou have this quantity.\n12:35\nIn this case, it's the density of the air varying over time.\n12:39\nIn this case, it's the height, or the position, or how much\n12:43\nyour displacement from your resting position-- that's the\n12:45\nquantity varying through time, that disruption is travelling\n12:50\nover the course of the medium.\n12:51\nThat's why we call both of these things waves.\n12:54\nAnyway, I'll let you go here.\n12:56\nAnd in the next video, we'll talk a little bit more of the\n12:58\nproperties of periodic waves.",

draw the product or products\n0:10\nfor those reactions.\n0:11\nTo help us, we're gonna look\n0:12\nat this S N 1 versus S N 2 summary\n0:15\nand the first thing that we're going to look at\n0:17\nis the structure of our substrate.\n0:20\nFor example, for this reaction down here,\n0:23\nwe have a primary alkyl halides, a primary substrate,\n0:27\nso we need to think about an S N 2 reaction\n0:30\nwhich requires decreased steric hindrance\n0:32\nand that's what we have with a primary alkyl halide.\n0:36\nFrom an earlier video, we know that an S N 2 mechanism\n0:39\nhas our nucleophile attack at the same time\n0:41\nthat we get loss of a leaving group.\n0:43\nAnd for this reaction,\n0:45\nour nucleophile must be our solvent here, which is ethanol.\n0:48\nSo, our nucleophile is going to attack\n0:51\nand the oxygen is gonna form a bond with this carbon\n0:54\nwhich I'll go ahead and highlight in red.\n0:58\nSo our nucleophile attacks,\n0:59\nat the same time, we get loss of leaving group.\n1:01\nThese electrons come off to form the iodide anion\n1:04\nwhich is an excellent leaving group.\n1:07\nLet's draw what we would form.\n1:09\nLet's sketch in our carbon chain here\n1:12\nand we know that a bond forms\n1:14\nbetween the oxygen and the carbon in red,\n1:17\nso the carbon in red is this carbon\n1:20\nand let's make these electrons magenta.\n1:23\nSo those electrons form a bond\n1:25\nbetween the oxygen and the carbon in red.\n1:28\nThe oxygen is still attached to this ethyl group here,\n1:31\nso let's draw in those two carbons.\n1:34\nAnd the oxygen is still bonded to this hydrogen.\n1:37\nSo let's put in this hydrogen.\n1:39\nWe still have a lone pair of electrons left on this oxygen,\n1:42\nso I'll put in that lone pair right here.\n1:44\nAnd that gives us a plus one formal charge on the oxygen.\n1:49\nNext, we need to make a neutral molecule for our product,\n1:53\nso we need to have another molecule of ethanol come along,\n1:57\nso let's draw that in here.\n1:58\nSo, ethanol is our solvent.\n2:01\nAnd this time, the ethanol molecule\n2:02\nis going to function as a base.\n2:05\nWe need to take this proton here\n2:08\nand these electrons are left behind on the oxygen.\n2:12\nLet's draw our final product.\n2:14\nWe sketch in our carbon chain.\n2:17\nWe have our oxygen.\n2:19\nWe have these two carbons.\n2:21\nAnd now we have two lone pairs of electrons on this oxygen.\n2:25\nLet's make these electrons blue.\n2:28\nSo, our second step is an acid-base reaction\n2:31\nwhere we take a proton\n2:32\nand these are, these electrons in blue here,\n2:35\nto form our final product which is an ether.\n2:39\nNotice we don't have to worry about any stereochemistry\n2:42\nfor our final product.\n2:43\nWe don't have any chiral centers to worry about.\n2:47\nLet's look at another reaction.\n2:49\nFor this reaction,\n2:50\nwe're starting with a secondary alkyl halides.\n2:53\nIf I look at my summary over here\n2:55\nwith a secondary substrate,\n2:57\nwe could have either an S N 2 mechanism\n2:59\nor an S N 1 mechanism,\n3:01\nso we need to look at a few more things.\n3:04\nFirst, let's look at the nucleophile.\n3:06\nThis is N a plus and SH minus,\n3:09\nso let me draw in the SH minus here\n3:11\nwhich that is going to be our nucleophile\n3:14\nand that's a strong nucleophile.\n3:16\nA negative charge on a sulfur\n3:18\nwould make a strong nucleophile.\n3:20\nAnd for our solvent, we saw in an earlier video,\n3:23\nDMSO is a polar A product solvent\n3:26\nwhich favors an S N 2 reaction.\n3:29\nSo with a strong nucleophile and a polar A product solvent,\n3:34\nwe need to think about in S N 2 mechanism.\n3:38\nSo we know our nucleophile attacks\n3:40\nat the same time that we get loss of our leaving group,\n3:43\nso our nucleophile is going to attack this carbon.\n3:46\nSo again, I'll make this carbon red.\n3:48\nAt the same time that we get loss of leaving groups,\n3:51\nso these electrons are gonna come off onto the bromine\n3:53\nto form the bromide anion.\n3:55\nFor this reaction, we need to think about\n3:57\nthe stereochemistry of our S N 2 reaction.\n4:00\nOur nucleophile has to attack from the opposite side\n4:03\nof our leaving group,\n4:05\nso we get inversion of configuration.\n4:08\nSo if we have a chiral center, we have to worry\n4:10\nabout our stereochemistry for this reaction.\n4:13\nSo we have the bromine on a wedge,\n4:14\nso drawing the final product here,\n4:16\nwe need to have the SH going away from us in space,\n4:19\nso we put that on a dash.\n4:22\nAgain, we saw details about this in an earlier video.\n4:25\nSo we get inversion of configuration\n4:28\nfor this S N 2 reaction.\n4:32\nFirst, let's look at our alkyl halides.\n4:34\nThe carbon that's bonded to our bromine\n4:36\nis bonded to two other carbon.\n4:38\nSo, this is a secondary alkyl halide.\n4:41\nAnd so we know we could have either S N 1 or S N 2.\n4:44\nWe need to look at the nucleophile and the solvent next\n4:47\nto decide which mechanism it is.\n4:50\nOur nucleophile will be formic acid\n4:52\nwhich is a weak nucleophile\n4:54\nand water is a polar product solvent.\n4:57\nSo we know that these two things\n4:59\nfavor an S N 1 type mechanism.\n5:02\nThe polar product solvent water\n5:04\ncan stabilize the carbocation that would result.\n5:08\nSo the first step should be loss of our leaving group\n5:11\nto form our carbocations.\n5:13\nThese electrons come off onto our bromine\n5:15\nto form the bromide ion\n5:17\nand we're taking a bond away from this carbon in red.\n5:20\nSo the carbon in red\n5:21\nis gonna have a plus one formal charge.\n5:24\nLet's draw our carbocations.\n5:27\nLet me put in this ring here with our pi electrons.\n5:30\nAnd then let me highlight our carbon in red.\n5:34\nThe carbon in red is this one.\n5:36\nSo that should get a plus one formal charge.\n5:39\nAnd let me highlight the other carbon over here.\n5:42\nSo this carbon in magenta, I moved it up to here\n5:45\nto make it easier to see the mechanism.\n5:48\nSo this is our secondary carbocation,\n5:51\nbut this is actually a benzylic carbocation\n5:53\nwhich makes it even more stable\n5:55\nthan we would normally expect.\n5:57\nThe pi electrons in the ring\n5:59\ncan actually provide us with other resonant structures\n6:01\nto stabilize this positive charge.\n6:03\nSo I don't have the time or the space to show that here,\n6:07\nbut we have our secondary benzylic carbocation\n6:09\nwhich will be our electrophile\n6:12\nand our next step is to have our nucleophile\n6:14\nattack our electrophile\n6:16\nand our nucleophile is formic acid here.\n6:20\nWe have two oxygens in formic acid\n6:22\nand one of them is more nucleophilic than the other,\n6:25\nso it turns out that this carbonyl oxygen\n6:28\nis more nucleophilic than this oxygen down here\n6:32\nand we'll go into more detail in a couple of minutes,\n6:35\nbut for right now, let's show our nucleophile\n6:37\nattacking our electrophile.\n6:39\nSo, a lone pair of electrons on our oxygen\n6:41\nare gonna form a bond with this carbon in red.\n6:44\nSo let's draw the result of our nucleophilic attack.\n6:48\nWe have our benzene ring,\n6:50\nso I'll draw that in here\n6:52\nand our carbon in red is this one.\n6:57\nAnd let's highlight the electrons on our oxygen.\n7:00\nSo, this lone pair of electrons in blue\n7:03\nforms a bonds with our carbon in red.\n7:06\nSo now, let's draw in our oxygen.\n7:09\nOur oxygen still has a lone pair of electrons on it\n7:12\nand our oxygen is double bonded to a carbon\n7:14\nwhich is bonded to a hydrogen.\n7:16\nAnd on the right, we have our oxygen and a hydrogen.\n7:20\nNow we have a plus one formal charge on our oxygen.\n7:24\nSo this oxygen has a plus one formal charge.\n7:27\nAnd this product is resonance stabilized,\n7:31\nso we can move in a lone pair of electrons here\n7:33\nand push these electrons off onto our oxygen.\n7:36\nAnd let's go ahead and show the results of that.\n7:39\nSo we'll put in our resonance brackets here\n7:41\nand our resonance arrow.\n7:43\nSo we have our benzene ring,\n7:46\nso let's draw that in.\n7:48\nAnd we have our carbons.\n7:50\nWe have a bond to this oxygen\n7:53\nand I'll drawn on that lone pair of electrons\n7:55\non the top oxygen here.\n7:57\nShould only be one bond now to this carbon.\n7:59\nI'll put in my hydrogen,\n8:01\nand now actually, we have a double bond over here.\n8:04\nLet me draw everything in.\n8:06\nAnd let me show the movement of electrons.\n8:10\nSo first, let's start with these electrons\n8:12\nwhich I will make magenta.\n8:14\nThose electrons moved into here to form a double bond.\n8:18\nAnd then let's highlight these electrons here in red.\n8:22\nSo these electrons came off onto our oxygen right here.\n8:26\nAnd now, we have a plus one formal charge on this oxygen.\n8:30\nSo the product of nucleophilic attack\n8:33\nby the carbonyl oxygen is resonance stabilized.\n8:37\nAnd then to go to our product,\n8:39\njust think about a base coming along, something like water,\n8:42\nand we could take this proton\n8:45\nand then these electrons would be left behind.\n8:49\nThese electrons would be left behind on that oxygen.\n8:51\nSo let's draw in our product.\n8:53\nWe would have a benzene ring.\n8:55\nSo here's our benzene ring.\n8:57\nWe would have an oxygen here.\n9:01\nAnd then we would have our carbonyl\n9:05\nand then our hydrogen.\n9:07\nSo this oxygen has two lone pairs of electrons\n9:10\nand so does this one.\n9:13\nSo we could highlight some of those electrons.\n9:15\nLet me make them green.\n9:16\nSo these electrons in green here came off onto this oxygen\n9:21\nand that gives us our product.\n9:24\nNotice that in our products,\n9:25\nwe have a chiral center.\n9:27\nSo this carbon right here is a chiral center.\n9:30\nWe have four different groups attached to it.\n9:32\nSo we would expect to get a racemic mixture.\n9:35\nWe should get both in the enatiomers here\n9:37\nbecause remember, going back to our carbocation,\n9:40\nthis carbocation is planer\n9:42\nand our nucleophile can attack from either sides.\n9:46\nIf you're wondering why this oxygen\n9:48\nis not as nucleophilic as the carbonyl oxygen,\n9:51\nlet's show the result of what would happen\n9:53\nif this oxygen attacked our positively charged carbon.\n9:57\nLet me draw in our benzene ring.\n10:00\nLet's sketch that in.\n10:02\nAnd we would form a bond between the oxygen and,\n10:06\nlet me highlight our carbon which I made red below,\n10:08\nso this is our carbon in red.\n10:10\nAnd I'm gonna show this lone pair of electrons\n10:13\nforming a bond with that carbon.\n10:16\nSo, that's bonded to this oxygen\n10:18\nand the oxygen is bonded to our carbonyl\n10:22\nwhich is bonded to our hydrogen.\n10:24\nAnd our oxygen still has a hydrogen on it\n10:26\nand a lone pair of electrons.\n10:28\nSo there's still a hydrogen on it\n10:30\nand there's still a lone pair of electrons\n10:32\nwhich gives this oxygen a plus one formal charge.\n10:36\nNotice this positively charged oxygen\n10:39\nis right next to this carbonyl carbon\n10:42\nand we know that this carbonyl carbon is partially positive\n10:46\nbecause this carbonyl oxygen\n10:47\nwithdraws electron density from it.\n10:50\nSo you have a positively charged oxygen\n10:53\nnext to a partially positively charged carbon\n10:56\nand we know that like charges repel.\n10:58\nSo having these two positive charges next to each other\n11:02\nwould destabilized this structure.\n11:05\nAnd so that's the reason why\n11:06\nthis oxygen is not the nucleophile.\n11:10\nThe carbonyl oxygen is.\n11:14\nLet's look at one final example.\n11:16\nSo for this alkyl halide,\n11:17\nthis is a tertiary alkyl halide\n11:20\nand a tertiary substrate means,\n11:22\nthink about an S N 1 mechanism.\n11:25\nSo our first step here would be loss of a leaving group.\n11:28\nThese electrons come off to form the iodide anion\n11:30\nand we're taking a bond away from this carbon in red\n11:33\nto form a carbocation.\n11:36\nLet's get some more room.\n11:36\nLet's go down here\n11:38\nand let's draw our carbocation.\n11:40\nSo we have a six-membered ring,\n11:43\nso let me draw in our six-membered ring here.\n11:46\nAnd our carbon in red is this carbon,\n11:50\nso that carbon gets a plus one formal charge.\n11:54\nWe have a tertiary carbocation\n11:56\nwhich is relatively stable for a carbocation.\n11:59\nAnd in our next step,\n11:59\nour nucleophile attacks our electrophile\n12:02\nand our nucleophile is our solvent, which is methanol.\n12:06\nSo our nucleophile is going to attack our electrophile.\n12:09\nOur oxygen is gonna form a bond with this carbon in red.\n12:13\nSo let's draw the results of our nucleophilic attack.\n12:17\nI'll put in this ring here,\n12:19\nmove the methyl group over to make room for the oxygen.\n12:22\nSo here's that oxygen.\n12:24\nLet's highlight the carbon in red.\n12:26\nAnd let's also highlight some electrons.\n12:29\nSo, these electrons in magenta form the bond\n12:32\nbetween the oxygen and the carbon in red.\n12:34\nThe oxygen is still bonded to a hydrogen and a methyl group,\n12:38\nso let's put those in.\n12:39\nSo here is our hydrogen\n12:41\nand here is our methyl group.\n12:44\nWe still have a lone pair of electrons on the oxygen,\n12:47\nso let's put in that lone pair of electrons\n12:49\nand that gives the oxygen a plus one formal charge.\n12:54\nTo get to our product,\n12:55\nwe need a neutral product,\n12:57\nso another another molecule of methanol comes along\n13:01\nbut this time, instead of acting like a nucleophile,\n13:03\nit's gonna act as a base and take off that proton.\n13:07\nSo here is our molecule of methanol\n13:10\nand we're gonna take this proton\n13:12\nand leave these electrons behind on the oxygen.\n13:16\nSo let's draw in our final product up here.\n13:19\nSo, here is our ring\n13:21\nand let's move up a little bit.\n13:23\nSo, let's move up.\n13:24\nIn our ring, we have this methyl group here\n13:27\nand we have our oxygen\n13:29\nand another methyl group,\n13:30\ntwo lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen.\n13:33\nLet's show those electrons.\n13:35\nThese electrons in here in blue\n13:38\ncome off onto the oxygen to form our final product.\n13:42\nNotice that for our final product,\n13:44\nwe don't have any chiral centers to worry about,\n13:47\nso we don't need to worry\n13:48\nabout specifying any stereochemistry.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nThis is Sal here and I'm at Stanford Medical School with Dr. Andy Connelly.\n0:05\nHi there Sal, I'm here to discuss with you histology today.\n0:10\nHistology! And, and forgive me, for what is probably a simple question, but what is histology?\n0:14\nSo it will be the -ology, the study of, in this case the histo-, means tissues.\n0:20\nWe're going to be looking up the cellular components of organs.\n0:28\nCool... yeah.\n0:29\nSo what we're going to be looking at today is the histology of the colon.\n0:32\nAnd so for the colon we often have colon specimens coming in from pathology.\n0:39\nAnd so the colon, like you were saying before, is the large intestine.\n0:45\nSo if you have this piece of large intestine, and its removed from the patient because there is an area\n0:53\nof cancer.\n0:54\nIt might be cancer, they're actually pretty good now about doing colonoscopy.\n1:01\nLooking from the inside--\n1:03\nThey'll often have looked inside think it looks like cancer\n1:09\ntake a little piece and send it to us before hand, and then they remove it.\n1:12\nAnd the reason why they want to send it to you is\n1:15\neven if they know its cancer how severe is this cancer?\n1:18\nHow severe is the cancer? They also want to get a really good tissue diagnosis\n1:22\nto make sure if they're going to go remove a piece of your colon, that they really know that its cancer\n1:28\nrather than it just looks like cancer.\n1:30\nSo its the definitive proof before they remove it.\n1:32\nSo then if this is the cancer that's removed they clearly want to be able to check the margins\n1:38\nto make sure its removed in its entirety.\n1:41\nBut often inside of there, they'll find other pieces of tissues, like here's a polyp\n1:46\nAnd when we say check the margins, this is literally, just making sure\n1:50\nyou've covered enough material so that you've gotten all the cancer in it\n1:53\nthat you're not kind of cutting through the cancer and that you've missed something.\n1:56\nThat's right, because this is actually one of the traditional\n1:58\nsurgical cures of cut it out to cure.\n2:01\nColon cancer, that tends to still be the case.\n2:04\nBecause you cut it out to make sure you cure it.\n2:07\nThere are many other kinds of cancers that which spread so widely early on\n2:09\nthat you don't usually cut out.\n2:12\nSo then the polyp can be found in a piece of colon removed\n2:17\na polyp is something that just sticks up.\n2:20\nAny tissue that sticks up. It's not necessarily cancer.\n2:23\nNo, so for instance another common place you hear about is\n2:28\nsome people in the sinuses might have sinus trouble\n2:30\nand they'll have a sinus polyp\n2:32\nthose are almost always just inflamed.\n2:34\nAnd then we'll find areas in which it's just the lining\n2:40\nthat's been roughened, and we'll take sections of those.\n2:43\nAnd that can happen from just someone being allergic to food\n2:46\nYeah, irritations of such.\n2:48\nYes, irritations of certain sites.\n2:51\nSo we're going to have the areas where its kind of irritated\n2:54\nsome in which there's a polyp sticking out\n2:56\nand we'll look at it under a microscope\n2:59\nand then that's the thing that we're mainly worried about\n3:02\nSo that's what we're going to cover in the slides\n3:06\nthat we look at today.\n3:08\nSo this first one we're looking at is an example of\n3:11\na normal margin\n3:12\nAnd so it's from a little piece\n3:14\nfrom the edge\n3:16\nSo they actually call the tissue margin?\n3:18\nYeah, tissue margin\n3:20\nNormal tissue.\n3:21\nSo this is the edge of the specimen, and [the surgeons will] say, \"Is the margin clear?\"\n3:25\nDr: In this case this is an example where the margin IS clear.\n3:29\nThis is normal-looking colon.\n3:30\nS: This is a cross-section, crossing the boundary of the colon,\n3:34\nthis area at the top right here, would be the inside of the colon, where the poop is...\n3:43\nDr: Doctors say stool. That's the stool in the middle, and the supportive tissue is underneath.\n3:51\nS: Part of the structural tissue of the tube?\n3:53\nDr: Right. Now let's drive around the slide.\n3:59\nThis is a virtual slide where we took the typical glass microscope slide, and put it in a special\n4:04\nmachine which took lots and lots of photographs at high power, then stitched them all together\n4:09\nas one massive image. So that allows you to zoom in and look around.\n4:13\nS: To let me get my own bearings, this polyp...\n4:16\nDr: No, this is just regular tissue--a little bit of a fold, not a polyp.\n4:20\nS: So how large is this, about a centimeter?\n4:25\nDr: About like that. If I had to guess, about 5-6mm.\n4:31\nSo, now to drive around, these are the controls for zooming in and out.\n4:43\nSo I can look at something more closely, and this is the mucosa.\n4:55\nS: Mucosa. Sounds very similar to mucus.\n4:57\nDr: Right. The mucosa is the lining that makes the mucus, it's the slimy part.\n5:03\nS: This white stuff up here?\n5:07\nDr: This suff is the slimy mucus. So, it keeps the insides from drying out--\n5:16\nbecause it's a very hydrated gel. It also means that things can glide along without\n5:21\nabrading the surface. When you look at it, it has architecture in which\n5:25\nthese glands, they're like test-tubes sticking down, and the purpose is to increase the surface area.\n5:36\nS: And the term gland, is any structure containing fluid and releases the fluid?\n5:42\nDr: A gland is an epithelial structure, so it's made of cells that are packed tightly,\n5:49\nand the cells have a top and a bottom, and they're formed into some sort of enfolding\n5:54\nor structure, so that there is a middle and an outside.\n5:57\nS: When we say something is epithelial, it's the stuff facing the outside world?\n6:04\nDr: Yes. The epithelium is a special class of cells in which they are facing the outside world,\n6:09\nagain, tightly packed, and there's a top and a bottom.\n6:13\nS: And even though to a layperson this area right here does not seem like the outside world,\n6:19\nit seems like it's inside of you, we're kind of like big donuts.\n6:21\nDr: That's right. And the colonoscopist proves that it's connected to the outside world.\n6:27\nS: MUAHAHA!! I guess they do prove that! XD\n6:29\nDr: So that's still the outside world. This is the architecture where you have enfoldings to increase\n6:40\nthe surface area. And it's creating this mucus.\n6:42\nLet me look at the highest power. Look at these cells! When we look at these cells,\n6:50\nthere are two main types of cells. There's this one here, which is the goblet cell.\n6:56\nS: Goblet cell. It's not just this white part, it goes all the way down there?\n7:05\nDr: Yeah...let me have that pen! It has a top like that, and you see this wine glass?\n7:13\nS: It's literally shaped like a goblet! I was circling the wrong handle.\n7:20\nDr: That nucleus belonged to some other cell.\n7:23\nWhat's next to it is these thin cells here, which do not have all the mucus inside of them.\n7:32\nThese guys are the tall ones.\n7:35\nS: Where you see only the nucleus? The white part is just the mucus inside the cell.\n7:39\nDr: Yes. Mucus is the term for either the overall structure or the material that is elaborated up here,\n7:52\nchemically it is called mucin, and mucin is almost like that goo runners eat,\n7:59\nit is just a lot of sugar holding a lot of water.\n8:02\nS: I see. I guess it would be bad branding to call it Mucus-In-A-Bag. MUAHAHA!! >:-}\n8:08\nDr: Exactly! So they stick with \"goo\". But this one has a lot of sugar, takes in lots of water,\n8:13\nthat is released and it forms this surface here.\n8:16\nS: To let stuff flow by.\n8:19\nDr: What the other cell does is the other main thing in addition to letting things flow through,\n8:23\nis to absorb water. So the idea is you do not want to release the 2L of fluid you have\n8:29\naround every one of your meals. You want to get a lot of that back.\n8:32\nS: That's one of the main functions of the large intestine?\n8:35\nDr: It is. It is a consolidation process to the stool. So you're going to absorb a lot of water\n8:38\nand doing it through these cells.\n8:44\nS: The mucin comes out here, and the water absorbed by parts without mucin, so right there.\n8:54\nDr: Yupperz. That's right. The two main functions of the colon are right there with those two cells.\n9:02\nS: To get a perspective of where we are, the whole thing is about .5cm, what's our scale here?\n9:13\nDr: Our favorite scale-bar here is to look for blood vessels, for red blood cells,\n9:26\nOne right there, is 7micro- m in diameter.\n9:30\nS: 7micro-m. A micrometer is a millionth of a meter, or 1/1000th of 1mm.\n9:36\nDr: That's right. Let's round off to 1/100th of 1mm.\n9:41\nS: You put 100 of these next to each other you get 1mm. So 1mm would be bigger than our entire screen.\n9:47\nDr: Right. You see with these glands, 1mm would be this span, which we're saying is about like that,\n9:54\nThat's why from here to here it might be about 7mm.\n9:57\nDr: RBCs are found in just about every microscopic field, and they're always 7micro-m.\n10:03\nWhen looking here, this is very well formed. You can see these tubular glands,\n10:16\njust a hint over here, because they are like test-tubes, sometimes they're not going straight up and\n10:20\ndown, sometimes they look a little on an angle...\n10:22\nS: They actually are reaching the surface, we just don't see it based on the way it's cut?\n10:28\nSo this one right here, it was cut at an angle, so it looks embedded there in 2D,\n10:34\nbut in 3D we would see a full tube.\n10:37\nDr: Just to go back to the microscopy, we're seeing this because it's only 4microns thick,\n10:43\nand we're sending light through this tissue.\n10:48\nSo that's why you can get a cross-section that doesn't show you 3D. Very much 2D.\n10:53\nS: Cool! So this is what a healthy margin tissue would look like?\n11:03\nDr: Yes, this is a healthy colon, so you would thankfully say on the proximal margin,\n11:08\nwhich is up more towards the mouth, that's clear. You take another section like this from the distal\n11:13\nmargin, more towards the end, and you say that's clear, so that means they removed the cancer.\n11:17\nS: When you say proximal margin is close to the mouth,\n11:20\nyou're saying the mouth of that cut of the tube, not mouth of the person.\n11:27\nDr: That's right. So the proximal and distal margins are clear, if they look like this.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's imagine we have a huge cloud\n0:02\nof hydrogen atoms floating in space.\n0:05\nHuge, and when I say huge cloud, huge both in distance\n0:08\nand in mass.\n0:09\nIf you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,\n0:11\nit would just be this really, really massive thing.\n0:15\nSo you have this huge cloud.\n0:16\nWell, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually\n0:20\nattracted to each other.\n0:21\nIt's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.\n0:25\nBut it would slowly affect these atoms.\n0:27\nAnd they would slowly draw close to each other.\n0:30\nIt would slowly condense.\n0:31\nThey'd slowly move towards the center\n0:34\nof mass of all of the atoms.\n0:37\nThey'd slowly move in.\n0:39\nSo if we fast forward, this cloud's\n0:42\ngoing to get denser and denser.\n0:46\nAnd the hydrogen atoms are going to start\n0:48\nbumping into each other and rubbing up against each other\n0:51\nand interacting with each other.\n0:53\nAnd so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.\n0:56\nNow remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.\n0:58\nSo the temperature is going up.\n1:03\nAnd it'll-- they'll keep condensing.\n1:05\nThey'll just keep condensing and condensing\n1:07\nuntil something really interesting happens.\n1:09\nSo let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here\n1:12\nin the center.\n1:16\nAnd there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.\n1:19\nIt's really dense.\n1:20\nI could never draw the actual number of atoms here.\n1:22\nThis is really to give you an idea.\n1:24\nThere's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,\n1:28\nfrom everything that wants to get\n1:29\nto that center of mass of our entire cloud.\n1:32\nThe temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.\n1:38\nAnd at that point, something neat happens.\n1:40\nAnd to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,\n1:43\nlet's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.\n1:46\nA hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just\n1:48\ngoing to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.\n1:49\nSo the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.\n1:50\nIf you want to think about a hydrogen atom,\n1:52\nit also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.\n1:57\nAnd let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.\n1:59\nAnd obviously this distance isn't to scale.\n2:02\nThis distance is also not to scale.\n2:04\nAtoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms\n2:05\nare actually much, much, much, much smaller\n2:07\nthan the actual radius of an atom.\n2:10\nAnd so is the electron.\n2:11\nBut anyway, this just gives you an idea.\n2:13\nSo we know from the Coulomb forces,\n2:14\nfrom electromagnetic forces, that these two positively\n2:17\ncharged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere\n2:20\nnear each other.\n2:22\nBut we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four\n2:25\nforces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,\n2:28\nthat if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures\n2:31\nand huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close\n2:35\nenough to each other, then all of a sudden,\n2:37\nthe strong force will overtake.\n2:39\nIt's much stronger than the Coulomb force.\n2:41\nAnd then these two hydrogens will actually--\n2:43\nthese nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?\n2:48\nWell, anyway, they would actually fuse together.\n2:50\nAnd so that is what actually happens\n2:53\nonce this gets hot and dense enough.\n2:57\nYou now have enough pressure and enough temperature\n2:59\nto overcome the Coulomb force and bring\n3:02\nthese protons close enough to each other for fusion\n3:05\nto occur, for fusion ignition.\n3:12\nAnd the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.\n3:14\nIt's not ignition.\n3:15\nIt's not combustion in the traditional sense.\n3:16\nIt's not like you're burning a carbon molecule\n3:20\nin the presence of oxygen.\n3:22\nIt's not combustion.\n3:23\nIt's ignition.\n3:24\nAnd the reason why it's called ignition\n3:25\nis because when two of these protons,\n3:27\nor two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus\n3:32\nhas a slightly smaller mass.\n3:35\nAnd so in the first stage of this,\n3:36\nyou actually have two protons under enough pressure--\n3:42\nobviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--\n3:44\nwith enough pressure they get close enough.\n3:46\nAnd then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.\n3:51\nOne of these guys degrades into a neutron.\n3:56\nAnd the resulting mass of the combined protons\n3:59\nis lower than the mass of each of the original.\n4:01\nBy a little bit, but that little bit of mass\n4:04\nresults in a lot of energy-- plus energy.\n4:11\nAnd this energy is why we call it ignition.\n4:13\nAnd so what this energy does is it provides\n4:16\na little bit of outward pressure,\n4:17\nso that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.\n4:21\nSo once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.\n4:24\nAnd then that energy provides outward pressure\n4:26\nto balance what is now a star.\n4:30\nSo now we are at where we actually\n4:32\nhave the ignition at the center.\n4:35\nWe have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying\n4:39\nto get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.\n4:43\nNow, what is the hydrogen being fused into?\n4:46\nWell, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just\n4:50\nkind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens\n4:54\nin stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.\n5:00\nI have trouble spelling.\n5:01\nWhich is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.\n5:03\nThis is still hydrogen because it\n5:04\nhas one proton and one neutron now.\n5:07\nIt is not helium yet.\n5:08\nThis does not have two-- it does not have two protons.\n5:12\nBut then the deuterium keeps fusing.\n5:14\nAnd then we eventually end up with helium.\n5:19\nAnd we can even see that on the periodic table.\n5:21\nOh, I lost my periodic table.\n5:22\nWell, I'll show you the next video.\n5:23\nBut we know hydrogen in its atomic state\n5:30\nhas an atomic number of 1.\n5:32\nAnd it also has a mass of 1.\n5:34\nIt only has one nucleon in its nucleus.\n5:38\nBut it's being fused.\n5:39\nIt goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,\n5:42\nwhich is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.\n5:46\nAnd then that eventually gets fused--\n5:48\nand I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--\n5:50\ninto helium.\n5:51\nAnd by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.\n5:56\nSo it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,\n5:58\nin particular, that isotope of helium--\n6:00\nit has an atomic mass of 4.\n6:03\nAnd this process releases a ton of energy.\n6:06\nBecause the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced\n6:09\nis slightly lower than four times the atomic mass\n6:15\nof each of the constituent hydrogens.\n6:17\nSo all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it\n6:21\nneeds super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--\n6:24\nkeeps the star from collapsing.\n6:28\nAnd once a star is in this stage,\n6:31\nonce it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen\n6:35\nin its core, where the pressure and the temperature\n6:37\nis the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.\n6:41\nThis is now a main sequence star.\n6:48\nAnd that's actually where the sun is right now.\n6:50\nNow there's questions of, well, what if there just\n6:53\nwasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?\n6:56\nAnd there actually are things that\n6:57\nnever get to quite that threshold\n6:59\nto fuse all the way into helium.\n7:00\nThere are a few things that don't quite\n7:02\nmake the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.\n7:05\nSo they are generating some of their heat.\n7:06\nOr there are even smaller objects\n7:08\nthat just get to the point there's\n7:10\na huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually\n7:13\noccurring inside of the core.\n7:15\nAnd something like Jupiter would be an example.\n7:17\nAnd you could go several masses above Jupiter\n7:20\nwhere you get something like that.\n7:21\nSo you have to reach a certain threshold\n7:23\nwhere the mass, where the pressure and the temperature\n7:25\ndue to the heavy mass, get so large that you\n7:27\nstart this fusion.\n7:28\nAnd-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,\n7:31\nthe slower the fusion will occur.\n7:33\nBut if you're super massive, the fusion\n7:35\nwill occur really, really fast.\n7:37\nSo that's the general idea of just how stars get formed\n7:40\nand why they don't collapse on themselves\n7:43\nand why they are these kind of balls\n7:45\nof fusion reactions existing in the universe.\n7:48\nIn the next few videos, we'll talk\n7:50\nabout what happens once that hydrogen fuel in the core\n7:54\nstarts to run out.",

You have this committee of real people.\n0:23\nJefferson and Adams and Franklin are all\n0:25\npart of that committee.

But you see real\n0:59\npeople working together in these rooms on\n1:02\nMarket Street in Philadelphia,\n1:03\ntrying to craft this document.\n1:06\nMale 1: Yeah, yeah, and you see it here.\n1:07\nThis looks like someone editing a paper.\n1:09\nMale 2: Which shows you how important it is to edit,\n1:11\nin a way. Those of us who are writers and editors,\n1:15\nwe like the fact that you should really quibble\n1:19\nover each word. These are words that matter.\n1:24\nFor example, you can see they put in a little\n1:26\nphrase right here, \"separate and equal station.\"\n1:29\nIn other words, America's going to become a\n1:31\nseparate nation and an equal nation.\n1:33\nThat word \"separate and equal\" actually goes\n1:36\ndown in American history with some resonance\n1:38\nbecause it's used for a while to defend segregation.\n1:41\nEven when they get the words almost perfect,\n1:46\nthey have a resonance that they have to be careful about.\n1:49\nMale 1: Do you think they realized when\n1:51\nthey were writing it how important this\n1:53\ndocument was going to be?\n1:54\nMale 2: One of the amusing things is this was\n1:56\nnot considered the most important committee\n1:58\nto be on in June and July of 1776.\n2:02\nIn fact, John Adams thinks he's already written\n2:04\nthe great document of American Revolution,\n2:07\nwhich is a document written in May asking the\n2:10\nvarious colonies to get rid of their Royal\n2:13\ngovernors because we were going to break away.\n2:16\nSo Adams is quite willing to let Jefferson write\n2:18\nthis draft because he thinks that this is not\n2:22\nthe most important of all the documents.\n2:24\nMale 1: And on some level, to defend Adams a little bit,\n2:27\nthat does seem like a big deal. This was in\n2:29\nMay of 1776 he writes once you're getting rid of your\n2:32\nRoyal governors you really are separating yourself.\n2:34\nMale 2: And they've already had a vote to be independent.\n2:39\nSo this is just a document,\n2:41\n\"let Facts be submitted to a candid world,\"\n2:43\n\"the opinions of mankind ... they should declare the causes.\"\n2:47\nThis is really just their public relations document.\n2:50\nBut, the reason it turns out to be so important\n2:54\nis it's so beautifully written, it becomes\n2:57\nthe American creed. When they get together in\n3:01\nthese rooms and edit it, suddenly they say,\n3:04\n\"All men are created equal.\" This becomes not just\n3:08\na propaganda document, but a mission statement\n3:11\nfor who we are as a people.\n3:12\nMale 1: And to some degree the power of poetry.\n3:16\nThey could have said these exact same things\n3:18\nin very terse and ...\n3:20\nMale 2: This is why it was so good Jefferson\n3:22\nwrote it because Franklin is a very good writer,\n3:24\nbut he's a very simple, plain writer.\n3:27\nHe writes Poor Richard's Almanac,\n3:28\n\"A penny saved is a penny earned.\"\n3:30\nHe's one of the first Americans not to write\n3:33\nin a very flowery way. John Adams' letters\n3:36\nare very beautiful, but they're kind of pompous\n3:38\nand orotund and self important.\n3:41\nYou have a beautiful poet in Jefferson,\n3:44\nbut as we're looking at this document on the screen,\n3:47\neven he benefits from some good edits.\n3:51\nMale 1: This is literally Jefferson's\n3:52\nhandwriting we see here.\n3:54\nMale 2: This is Jefferson's handwriting on the\n3:55\nfirst draft. It's in the Library of Congress\n3:57\nif you want to go see it. The final document\n4:00\nis in the National Archives, about eight blocks away.\n4:03\nIt's really wonderful to look at all of these\n4:05\ndocuments, especially, I mean what do you see\n4:08\nhere where they edit the great second paragraph?\n4:11\nMale 1: \"We hold these truths to be self evident.\"\n4:15\nYou mentioned earlier that before it was\n4:17\nwritten, what, \"sacred and ...\n4:19\nMale 2: Undeniable. Yeah. They're using the word\n4:22\n\"sacred\" for the truths when Jefferson writes the\n4:26\nfirst draft. To me, if you look at the backslashes,\n4:31\nthe dark backslashes there, those are\n4:33\nBenjamin Franklin's backslashes I'm pretty sure\n4:37\nbecause he used a printer's pen and he was a\n4:39\npublisher, so he used that sort of backslashes to\n4:43\ncross things out. He writes the words \"self evident.\"\n4:47\nOne of the things is we historians never fully\n4:50\nknow. Carl Becker, who was a great historian\n4:53\nof the Declaration, he's the one who said that\n4:55\nthat was probably Franklin's edit. For me, I've spent\n4:58\na lot of time in Ben Franklin's papers, which\n5:01\nwere at Yale University Library. To me, it really\n5:04\nfeels like his handwriting. So we assume that it's\n5:07\nBen Franklin who takes out \"sacred\" because he\n5:10\ndoesn't want \"these truths\" to be based on religion.\n5:15\nHe wants \"these truths\" to be based on\n5:17\nrationality and reason.\n5:19\nMale 1: So once again it's not only the style\n5:22\nof the crossing out, this is in line with\n5:24\nFranklin's personality and beliefs.\n5:26\nMale 2: Franklin was somebody who had read\n5:28\nthe great thinkers of the British and Scottish\n5:31\nEnlightenment. That means John Locke, David Hume.\n5:35\nDavid Hume was a person who came up with the\n5:38\nconcept of \"self evident truths.\" A self evident\n5:40\ntruth would be that all bachelors aren't married,\n5:44\nas opposed to a more contingent truth like\n5:49\nPhiladelphia is smaller than London.\n5:51\nMale 1: Kind of in math an axiom.\n5:52\nMale 2: An axiom, exactly. The fact that two\n5:55\nplus three is five, that's not something that\n6:00\nhas to be further proved. These are somewhat\n6:02\n\"self evident.\" That's what Hume does and\n6:06\nFranklin loves that. Franklin loves Isaac Newton, too,\n6:10\nbecause Franklin is a scientist. He believes that\n6:13\nthere are laws of nature, of nature's God,\n6:16\nand that there are certain self evident truths,\n6:19\nso he doesn't want the word \"sacred\" in there\n6:21\nbecause that kind of seems like divine right\n6:24\nof kings. God's the one who made these truths.\n6:26\nHe's saying, \"no.\" As we've discussed that whole\n6:30\nparagraph, it's about rationality and reason\n6:33\ngetting us to those truths.\n6:35\nMale 1: Right, but they also do talk about,\n6:36\nas we talked about previously,\n6:38\nthere's a balance here because\n6:39\nthey do talk about \"created equal.\"\n6:40\nMale 2: Well, let's look. Tell us, what do you\n6:42\nsee there? This edit, it says that they were\n6:47\nhad certain inherent and inalienable rights. You see\n6:52\nJohn Adams, and we're pretty sure that's\n6:54\nJohn Adams' writing, not just because of his\n6:57\nwriting, but because of the concept.\n6:59\nHe was a little bit more religious than the\n7:00\nothers on the committee. He says,\n7:03\n\"They're endowed by their Creator.\" He puts in that phrase\n7:07\n\"by their Creator\" with certain inalienable rights.\n7:12\nIt's a balance. It's a balance between\n7:14\nrationality and reason, which is self evident,\n7:17\nand divine providence, this notion that we're all\n7:22\nchildren of the same Creator and therefore we're all\n7:25\nendowed with certain inalienable rights.\n7:29\nMale 1: Yeah, this is really amazing. Just to\n7:32\nrealize that they were human beings\n7:33\nkind of forging through this.\n7:34\nMale 2: Yeah, they're real human beings who were probably\n7:36\narguing just like you. Jefferson gets really upset\n7:39\nat someone; not at Franklin and Adams, but other\n7:41\npeople start editing it. Franklin tells them\n7:43\nthis wonderful story about when he was a young\n7:45\ntradesman in Philadelphia and somebody had a sign\n7:47\nabout selling hats and everybody tried to edit\n7:50\nthe sign for them. Franklin said, \"That's why I've\n7:52\nnever been on a committee that's going to have\n7:56\na lot of people editing what I write.\"\n7:59\nBut, those of us who are editors, we kind of think\n8:02\nthose edits actually improve the document.\n8:04\nMale 1: Yeah, it seemed like it turned out\n8:05\na pretty good result.\n8:06\nMale 2: You know, you don't get much better than\n8:07\n\"We hold these truths to be self evident.\"",

It could be\n4:21\njust this change in energy over time.\n4:23\nBut we'll learn, especially when we do quantum mechanics,\n4:25\nthat it all gets jumbled up as we start approaching the\n4:29\nscales or the size of an atom.\n4:31\nAnyway, I said this was an incorrect way of doing it.\n4:34\nWhat's the correct way?\n4:37\nSo it turns out-- this is a picture, not a picture really,\n4:40\nthis is also a depiction.\n4:42\nSo it's an interesting question, what I just said.\n4:44\nHow can you have a picture of an atom?\n4:47\nBecause is actually turns out that most wavelengths of\n4:49\nlight, especially the visible wavelengths of light, are much\n4:52\nlarger than the size of an atom.\n4:56\nEverything else we quote-unquote, observe in\n4:58\nlife, it's by reflected light.\n5:00\nBut all of a sudden when you're dealing with an atom,\n5:02\nreflected light you could almost view it as too big, or\n5:06\ntoo blunt of an instrument with which to observe an atom.\n5:09\nAnyway, this is a depiction of a helium atom.\n5:14\nA helium atom has two protons and two neutrons.\n5:18\nOr at least this helium atom has two\n5:19\nprotons and two neutrons.\n5:21\nAnd the way they depict it here in the nucleus, right\n5:24\nthere, maybe these are the two-- I'm assuming they're\n5:26\nusing red for proton and purple for neutron.\n5:32\nPurple seems like more of a neutral color.\n5:34\nAnd they're sitting at the center of this atom.\n5:39\nAnd then this whole haze around there, those are the\n5:42\ntwo electrons that helium has, or that at least\n5:45\nthis helium atom has.\n5:47\nMaybe you could gain or lose an electron.\n5:49\nBut these are the two electrons.\n5:50\nAnd you say, hey, Sal, how can two electrons be this blur\n5:55\nthat's kind of smeared around this atom.\n5:58\nAnd that's where it gets philosophically interesting.\n6:01\nSo you cannot describe an electron's path around a\n6:09\nnucleus with the traditional orbit idea that we've\n6:12\nencountered when we look at planets or if we just imagine\n6:16\nthings at kind of a larger scale.\n6:18\nIt turns out that an electron, you cannot know exactly its\n6:24\nmomentum and location at any given point in time.\n6:28\nAll you can know is a probability distribution of\n6:31\nwhere it is likely to be.\n6:33\nAnd the way they depicted this, black is a higher\n6:36\nprobability, so you're much more likely to find the\n6:39\nelectron here than you are here.\n6:42\nBut the electron really could be anywhere.\n6:43\nIt could even to be here, even though it's completely white\n6:46\nthere, with some very, very, very, very, very low\n6:49\nprobability.\n6:50\nAnd so this function of where an electron is, this is called\n6:55\nan orbital.\n6:56\nOrbital.\n6:57\nNot to be confused with orbit.\n7:00\nOrbital.\n7:02\nRemember, an orbit was something like this.\n7:05\nIt's like Venus going around the Sun.\n7:08\nSo it's very physically easy for us to imagine.\n7:12\nWhile an orbital is actually a mathematical probability\n7:16\nfunction that tells us where we're\n7:17\nlikely to find an electron.\n7:18\nWe'll deal a lot more with that when we cover quantum\n7:21\nmechanics, but that's not going to be in the scope of\n7:23\nthis kind of introductory set of chemistry lectures.\n7:26\nBut it's interesting, right?\n7:28\nAn electron's behavior is so bizarre at that scale that you\n7:32\ncan't-- I mean, to call it a particle is almost misleading.\n7:35\nIt is called a particle, but it's not a particle in the\n7:38\nsense that we're used to in our everyday life.\n7:40\nIt's this thing that you can't even say exactly where it is.\n7:45\nIt can be anywhere in this haze.\n7:47\nAnd we'll learn later that there are different shapes of\n7:49\nthe hazes is as we add more and more electrons to an atom.\n7:53\nBut to me, it starts to address philosophical issues\n7:57\nof what matter even is, or do the things we look at, how\n8:01\nreal are they?\n8:02\nOr how real are they, at least as we've defined reality?\n8:04\nAnyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.\n8:07\nBut the whole notion of electrons, protons, they're\n8:12\nall kind of predicated on this notion of charge.\n8:15\nAnd we've talked about it before when we learned about\n8:17\nCoulomb's law.\n8:18\nYou could review Coulomb's laws videos in the physics\n8:22\nplaylist. But the idea is that an electron\n8:27\nhas a negative charge.\n8:29\nA proton, sometimes written like that,\n8:31\nhas a positive charge.\n8:33\nAnd a neutron has no charge.\n8:37\nAnd so that's what was tempting about the original\n8:39\nmodel of an electron.\n8:42\nIf they say, OK, if this thing has positive charges, right?\n8:45\nSo let's say this is two neutrons and two protons.\n8:47\nLet's say it's a helium atom.\n8:48\nThen we'll have some positive charges here.\n8:51\nWe have some negative charges out here.\n8:54\nOpposite charges attract.\n8:56\nAnd so if these things had some velocity, enough\n9:03\nvelocity, they would orbit around this, just the way a\n9:08\nplanet will orbit around the Sun.\n9:10\nBut now we learn, even though this is partially true, that\n9:15\nthe further away an electron is from the nucleus, it does\n9:23\nhave more, it's true, potential energy.\n9:27\nIn that it will want to move towards the nucleus, but\n9:31\nbecause of all the mechanics at the quantum level, it won't\n9:34\njust do something simple like move in a path like that, like\n9:37\na comet would do around the Sun, it actually has this kind\n9:41\nof wave-like behavior, where it just has this probability\n9:43\nfunction that describes it.\n9:45\nBut the further away an orbital, it\n9:48\ndoes have more potential.\n9:50\nWe're going to go a lot more into that in future videos.\n9:53\nBut anyway, how do you recognize what an element is?\n9:56\nI've talked a lot about the philosophy and all of that,\n9:58\nbut how do I know that this is helium?\n10:00\nIs it by the number of neutrons it has?\n10:03\nIs it by the number of protons it has?\n10:05\nIs it by the number of electrons?\n10:07\nWell the answer is, it's by the number of protons.\n10:09\nSo if you know the number of protons in an element, you\n10:13\nknow what that element is.\n10:14\nAnd the number of protons, this is defined\n10:21\nas the atomic number.\n10:26\nNow, so let's say I said something has four protons.\n10:33\nHow do we know what it is?\n10:34\nWell if we haven't memorized it, we could look it up on the\n10:37\nperiodic table of elements, which we'll be dealing with a\n10:39\nlot in this playlist. And you'd say, oh, four protons,\n10:43\nthat is beryllium.\n10:45\nRight there.\n10:46\nAnd the atomic number is the number that you see up there.\n10:50\nAnd that' s literally the number of protons.\n10:52\nAnd that is what differentiates\n10:55\none atom from another.\n10:56\nIf you have fifteen protons, you're dealing with\n10:59\nphosphorus.\n11:00\nAnd all of a sudden, if you have seven protons, you're\n11:06\ndealing with nitrogen.\n11:07\nIf you have eight, you're dealing with oxygen.\n11:09\nThat is what defines the element.\n11:11\nNow, we'll talk in the future about what happens with charge\n11:15\nand all of that.\n11:17\nOr what happens when you gain or lose electrons.\n11:19\nBut that does not change what element you're dealing with.\n11:21\nAnd likewise, when you change the number of neutrons, that\n11:26\nalso does not change the element you're dealing with.\n11:30\nBut that leads to an obvious question of, well, how many\n11:32\nneutrons and electrons do you have?\n11:35\nWell, if an atom is charge-neutral, that means it\n11:43\nhas the same number of electrons.\n11:46\nSo let's say that I have carbon.\n11:52\nIts atomic number is six.\n11:53\nAnd let's say its mass number is twelve.\n12:00\nNow what does this mean?\n12:01\nAnd let me say further that this is a neutral particle.\n12:05\nThis is a neutral atom.\n12:07\nSo the atomic number for carbon is six.\n12:10\nThat tells us exactly how many protons it has.\n12:13\nSo if I were to draw a little model here, and this is in no\n12:16\nway an accurate model.\n12:17\nI'll draw six-- two, three, four, five, six\n12:21\nprotons in the center.\n12:23\nAnd the weight of these protons, each proton is one\n12:26\natomic mass unit, and we'll talk more about how that\n12:28\nrelates to kilograms. It's a very small\n12:31\nfraction of a kilogram.\n12:32\nRoughly I think it's 1.6 times 10 to the\n12:36\nminus 27th of a kilogram.\n12:38\nSo let's say each of these are one atomic mass unit, and\n12:45\nthat's approximately equal to, I think, 1.67 times 10 to the\n12:48\nminus 27 kilograms. This is a very small number.\n12:53\nIt's actually almost impossible to visualize.\n12:57\nAt least it is for me.\n12:58\nThis tells me the mass of the entire carbon atom, of this\n13:03\nparticular carbon atom.\n13:04\nAnd this can actually change from carbon\n13:05\natom to carbon atom.\n13:07\nAnd this is essentially the mass of all of the protons\n13:10\nplus all of the neutrons.\n13:12\nAnd each proton has an atomic mass of one, in atomic mass\n13:17\nunits, and each neutron has an atomic mass of\n13:20\none atomic mass unit.\n13:22\nSo this is really the number of protons plus\n13:28\nthe number of neutrons.\n13:33\nSo in this case we have six protons, so we must also have\n13:37\nsix neutrons.\n13:39\nSix neutrons plus six protons.\n13:42\nNow, where are the electrons?\n13:44\nWell, I said it's neutral, so the proton has an equal\n13:49\npositive charge as the electron's negative charge.\n13:51\nSo this is a neutral atom, and it has six protons, so it also\n13:55\nhas six electrons.\n13:56\nLet me draw that.\n13:57\nSo we said it has six neutrons in here.\n13:59\nOne, two, three, four, five, six.\n14:01\nSo that's the nucleus right there.\n14:04\nAnd then if we were to draw the electons-- well, I could\n14:09\ndraw it as a smear, but if we want to kind of visualize it a\n14:12\nlittle better, we could say, OK, there's going to be six\n14:13\nelectrons orbiting.\n14:15\nOne, two, three, four, five, six.\n14:18\nAnd they're going to be moving around in this unpredictable\n14:21\nway that we would have to describe with\n14:22\na probability function.\n14:24\nAnd so the interesting thing about it is, most of the mass\n14:30\nof an atom is sitting right in here.\n14:32\nI mean, you might notice that when people care about the\n14:34\nmass, when they care about the atomic mass number of an atom,\n14:40\nthey ignore the electrons.\n14:41\nAnd that's because the mass of a proton, one proton\n14:47\nmass-wise, is equal to 1,836 electons.\n14:52\nSo for thinking about the mass of an atom, for all basic\n14:58\npurposes, you can ignore the mass of an electron.\n15:01\nIt's really the mass of the nucleus that counts as the\n15:08\nmass of the atom.\n15:10\nNow, you might see this periodic table here, and you\n15:12\nsay, OK, they gave us the atomic number up there.\n15:15\nThe atomic number of oxygen is eight.\n15:18\nIt means it has eight protons.\n15:20\nThe atomic number of silicon is 14.\n15:22\nIt has 14 protons.\n15:24\nNow what is this right here?\n15:27\nLet's see, in carbon.\n15:28\nIn carbon they have this 12.0107.\n15:34\nThat is the atomic weight of carbon.\n15:36\nLet me write this.\n15:41\nAtomic weight of carbon.\n15:47\nThe atomic weight of carbon is 12.0107.\n15:56\nNow, what does that mean?\n15:57\nDoes that mean that carbon has six protons and then the\n16:03\nremainder, the remaining 6.0107 neutrons, it has kind\n16:09\nof this fraction of a neutron?\n16:11\nNo.\n16:12\nIt means if you were to average all the different\n16:16\nversions of carbon you find on the planet and you were to\n16:19\naverage the number of neutrons based on the quantity of the\n16:25\ndifferent types of carbon, this is the\n16:27\naverage you would get.\n16:28\nSo it turns out that carbon, the two major forms, the main\n16:32\none you'll find is carbon-12.\n16:35\nSo that's like this.\n16:36\nSo that has six protons and six neutrons.\n16:39\nAnd then another isotope of carbon.\n16:42\nNow an isotope is the same element with a different\n16:45\nnumber of neutrons.\n16:46\nAnother isotope of carbon is carbon-14, which is much more\n16:50\nscarce on the planet.\n16:52\nWe don't know how much in the universe, but on the planet.\n16:55\nNow, if you were to average these, not just a straight-up\n16:58\naverage, then you would get carbon-13 and then the atomic\n17:01\nweight would be 13, but you weight this one much higher\n17:04\nbecause this exists in much larger quantities on Earth.\n17:07\nI mean, this is pretty much all of the\n17:08\ncarbon that you see.\n17:09\nBut there's a little bit of this.\n17:10\nSo if you weight them appropriately, the average\n17:13\nbecomes this.\n17:14\nSo most of the carbon you'll find-- if you just found\n17:17\ncarbon someplace, on average its weight in atomic mass\n17:22\nunits is going to be 12.0107.\n17:27\nBut that idea of an isotope is an interesting one.\n17:29\nRemember, when you change the neutrons, you're not changing\n17:32\nthe actual, fundamental element.\n17:33\nYou're just getting a different isotope, a different\n17:36\nversion, of the element.\n17:37\nSo these two versions of carbon are both isotopes.\n17:41\nNow, I want to leave this video with what I think is\n17:43\nkind of the neatest idea behind atoms. And it's the\n17:46\nmost philosophically interesting things about them.\n17:49\nIt's that the relative size-- so, we have these electrons,\n17:54\nwhich represent very little of the mass of an atom.\n17:58\nIt's 1/2000 of the mass of an atom are the electrons.\n18:01\nAnd even those, it's hard to even describe them as\n18:04\nparticles, because you can't even tell me exactly where and\n18:08\nhow fast one of these particles is moving.\n18:11\nThey just have a probability function.\n18:12\nSo most of the atom is sitting inside the nucleus.\n18:16\nAnd this is the interesting thing.\n18:17\nIf you look at an atom on average, if you\n18:21\nsay this is my atom.\n18:23\nLet's say I had two atoms that are bonded to each other.\n18:26\nAnd I were to say, how much of this is actual stuff?\n18:29\nAnd when I say stuff, that's a very abstract concept, because\n18:32\nwe're talking about the nucleus, right?\n18:33\nBecause the nucleus is where all the\n18:34\nmass is, all the stuff.\n18:36\nIt turns out that it's actually an infinitesimally\n18:39\nsmall fraction of the volume of the atom where-- the volume\n18:44\nof the atom is hard to define, because the electron can\n18:45\npretty much be anywhere, but if you view the volume as\n18:48\nwhere you're most likely to find the electron, or with 90%\n18:52\nprobability you're likely to find the electron, then the\n18:55\nnucleus is, in a lot of cases and the way I think about it,\n18:59\nit's about 1/10,000 of the volume.\n19:01\nSo if you think about it, when you look at something, if you\n19:03\nlook at your hand or if you look at the wall or if you\n19:06\nlook at your computer, 99.999% of it is free space.\n19:14\nIt's nothing.\n19:15\nIt's vacuum.\n19:18\nIf you had ultra-small-- I guess we could call them\n19:20\nparticles or something-- most of them would pass straight\n19:23\nthrough whatever you look at.\n19:24\nSo it already starts to kind of\n19:26\nquestion our hold on reality.\n19:28\nWhat is there when, if-- and this is fact, this isn't\n19:32\ntheory right here-- that if you take anything down to the\n19:35\nbuilding blocks, down to the atomic level, most of the\n19:39\nspace of that kind of, quote-unquote object, is free\n19:43\nvacuum space.\n19:44\nYou could go straight through it if you could get down to\n19:46\nthat scale.\n19:47\nThis image of a helium atom, they say right here this is\n19:50\none femtometer.\n19:52\nRight?\n19:52\nOne femtometer.\n19:57\nThis is the scale of the nucleus of a\n20:00\nhelium atom, right?\n20:01\nOne femtometer.\n20:03\nThis is one angstrom, right?\n20:04\nAnd they say that equals 100,000 femtometers.\n20:06\nAnd just to get a sense of scale, one angstrom is 1 times\n20:10\n10 to the negative 10 meters, right?\n20:13\nSo the atom is roughly on the scale of an angstrom.\n20:15\nIn the case of helium, the nucleus is\n20:17\neven a smaller fraction.\n20:18\nIt's 1/100,000.\n20:20\nSo if you had-- let's say you had liquid helium, which you'd\n20:23\nhave to get very cold to get.\n20:25\nIf you're looking at that, most of it is free space.\n20:27\nIf you're looking at an iron bar, the great, great, great,\n20:30\ngreat, great, great majority of it is free space.\n20:33\nAnd we're not even talking about, maybe there's some free\n20:35\nspace inside the nucleus that we could talk\n20:37\nabout in the future.\n20:38\nBut to me, that just blows my mind that most things we look\n20:41\nat are not really solid.\n20:44\nThey're really just empty space, but they look solid\n20:47\nbecause of the way light reflects on them or the forces\n20:50\nthat repel us.\n20:51\nBut there really isn't something to touch there.\n20:55\nThat most of this right here is all free space.\n20:57\nI think I've said the word free space now, and I think\n21:00\nI'll leave further\n21:02\nmind-blowing to the next video.",

allow\n0:07\nyou to predict the solubility of compounds.\n0:11\nFor example, a polar solvent will dissolve\n0:14\na polar compound in general, so like dissolves like.\n0:18\nI also have here a polar solvent will dissolve\n0:21\nin ionic solute because you don't usually\n0:24\ndescribe ionic compounds as being polar.\n0:28\nNext, a nonpolar solvent will dissolve\n0:31\na nonpolar compound, so like dissolves like,\n0:35\nbut a polar solvent will not dissolve\n0:39\na nonpolar compound, so this would\n0:43\nbe like and unlike here.\n0:46\nAn example of a polar solvent is water.\n0:49\nAn example of a nonpolar compound\n0:51\ncould be something like oil.\n0:53\nWe know that water will not dissolve oil.\n0:56\nLet's go back to this first idea\n0:58\nof a polar solvent being able to\n1:00\ndissolve a polar compound or a\n1:02\npolar solvent dissolving an ionic compound\n1:05\nlike sodium chloride.\n1:07\nWe know from experience that sodium chloride,\n1:09\nor salt, is soluble in water.\n1:12\nOver here on the left we have part of a salt crystal.\n1:17\nWe know that crystals are held together\n1:20\nby attractive forces, the positively charged\n1:23\nsodium cation is attracted to the\n1:25\nnegatively charged chloride anion.\n1:28\nOpposite charges attract and our\n1:31\ncrystal is held together by these attracted forces.\n1:36\nIf we get some water molecules to come along,\n1:38\nwe know that water is a polar solvent,\n1:41\nwater is a polar molecule.\n1:44\nThe oxygen is more electronegative\n1:46\nthan this hydrogen, so the oxygen\n1:48\npulls some of the electron density\n1:49\nin this bond closer to it giving it\n1:51\na partial negative charge.\n1:53\nIf we are withdrawing electron density\n1:55\nfrom this hydrogen, this hydrogen\n1:57\ngets a partial positive charge.\n1:59\nSince opposite charges attract, the partially positive\n2:02\nhydrogen in water is attracted to the\n2:05\nnegatively charged chloride anion,\n2:07\nso there's an interaction here.\n2:10\nIf we get a bunch of water molecules,\n2:12\nhere's another one right here,\n2:13\nso partially negative oxygen, partially\n2:15\npositive hydrogen, so there's another attractive force.\n2:18\nWe can pull off these chloride anions\n2:20\nfrom the solid and bring the anion into solution.\n2:23\nOn the right here we have our chloride anion\n2:26\nin solution surrounded by a bunch of water molecules\n2:30\nand we have all these partially positive\n2:33\nhydrogens interacting with our\n2:35\nnegatively charged chloride anion.\n2:38\nFor the sodium cations let's go back\n2:40\nto our solid on the left.\n2:42\nSince the sodium cation is positively charged,\n2:45\nthat's going to interact with the\n2:46\npartially negatively charged oxygen\n2:49\nin the water molecule, so opposite charges\n2:51\nattract and if you get enough water molecules\n2:54\nyou can pull off these sodium cations\n2:56\nand bring the sodium cations into a solution.\n2:59\nWe have the partially negative oxygens\n3:02\non water interacting with our\n3:04\npositively charged sodium cations in our solution.\n3:09\nOur polar solvent, water, needs to be able to\n3:13\ninteract with our solutes and in this case\n3:17\nthe polar solvent attacks the solid\n3:20\nover here on the left and it replaces\n3:22\nthese ion interactions of our crystal\n3:26\nwith ion-dipole interactions in our solution.\n3:30\nBy ion-dipole, I mean we have a cation right here,\n3:33\nso that's our ion and then our di-pole\n3:35\nwould be water, water's a polar molecule,\n3:38\nit has di-pole moment, so we have all\n3:40\nof these ion di-pole interactions.\n3:43\nIonic solutes that are able to participate\n3:46\nin these interactions will dissolve in water.\n3:50\nIf you have a polar compound, right, a similar idea,\n3:54\nyou have attractive forces that allow\n3:56\nthe polar compounds to be dissolved\n3:57\nin a polar solvent like water.\n4:00\nLet's move on to a nonpolar compound,\n4:03\nso a nonpolar compound, something\n4:05\nlike this molecule on the left here\n4:08\nand this molecule's called naphthalene.\n4:10\nNaphthalene is a solid with a\n4:12\nvery distinctive smell to it.\n4:14\nThe first time I smelled naphthalene in the lab\n4:17\nit reminded me of my grandparents' house\n4:19\nbecause my grandparents, when I was a kid,\n4:20\nhad mothballs that were made of naphthalene,\n4:23\nso it's a very distinctive smell.\n4:25\nNow naphthalene is nonpolar because\n4:27\nit's composed of only carbons and hydrogens,\n4:30\nit's a hydrocarbon, so naphthalene is nonpolar\n4:34\nand you would need a nonpolar solvent\n4:36\nto get it to dissolve.\n4:38\nToluene is a nonpolar solvent, again,\n4:41\nthis is a hydrocarbon, so if you\n4:43\ntake solid naphthalene and liquid toluene,\n4:47\nnaphthalene will dissolve in toluene,\n4:50\nso like dissolves like, our nonpolar\n4:53\nsolvent will dissolve our nonpolar compound.\n4:57\nFinally, let's look at this last idea here,\n4:59\nso a polar solvent, something like water,\n5:02\nshould not dissolve a nonpolar compound,\n5:05\nsomething like naphthalene, and that's true,\n5:08\nnaphthalene will not dissolve in water,\n5:11\nso water doesn't interact well enough\n5:13\nwith the naphthalene molecules to\n5:16\nget them to dissolve and form a solution.\n5:19\nThis concept of like dissolves like is important\n5:22\nbecause it allows you to predict whether\n5:25\nor not a compound will be soluble in water.\n5:30\nLet's look at several organic compounds\n5:32\nand determine whether or not those\n5:33\ncompounds are soluble in water.\n5:35\nWe'll start with ethanol.\n5:37\nEthanol has a polar oxygen-hydrogen bond,\n5:40\nthe oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen,\n5:43\nso the oxygen withdraws some electron density\n5:45\nmaking the oxygen partially negative\n5:48\nand leaving the hydrogen partially positive.\n5:50\nIf water comes along, I'll draw in\n5:52\na water molecule here, and we know that\n5:56\nwater is a polar solvent, water is a polar molecule,\n6:00\nthe oxygen has a partial negative and the\n6:02\nhydrogens have partial positive charges.\n6:05\nWe can see that there's an opportunity\n6:07\nfor an attractive force, opposite charges\n6:09\nattract, so the partially positive\n6:12\nhydrogen on ethanol is attracted\n6:14\nto the partially negatively charged oxygen on water.\n6:17\nThis is an example of hydrogen bond density,\n6:20\nremember hydrogen bonding from earlier videos.\n6:24\nHere is a good example of that.\n6:26\nWe can even have some more hydrogen bonding,\n6:28\nI could draw in another water molecule down here,\n6:31\nso let me go ahead and do that,\n6:32\nwe know that the oxygen is partially negative,\n6:35\nhydrogens are partially positive,\n6:37\nso here's another opportunity for hydrogen bonding\n6:40\nbetween partially negative oxygen on ethanol\n6:43\nand the partially positive hydrogen on water.\n6:46\nThis portion of the ethanol molecule is polar\n6:49\nand loves water, so this is the polar region\n6:53\nand this portion loves water, we call this\n6:56\nhydrophilic, so let me write that down here\n6:59\nso this portion of the molecule is hydrophilic,\n7:02\nor water loving.\n7:04\nLet's look at the other portion of the ethanol molecule,\n7:06\nso this portion on the left.\n7:08\nWe have a CH2 here and a CH3 here,\n7:11\nso carbons and hydrogens which\n7:13\nwe know are nonpolar, so this region\n7:16\nis nonpolar, this region doesn't like water,\n7:20\nit's scared of water, we call this hydrophobic,\n7:24\nor water fearing.\n7:26\nWe know that ethanol is soluble in water\n7:28\njust by experience, so that must mean\n7:31\nthis hydrophobic region doesn't\n7:33\novercome the hydrophilic region,\n7:36\nso the hydrophilic region is polar region\n7:38\nof the ethanol molecule, it's enough\n7:40\nto make ethanol soluble in water.\n7:42\nIf you think about that same concept\n7:44\nand look at a different molecule,\n7:46\nso on the right here's 1-octanol.\n7:48\n1-octanol has an opportunity for hydrogen bonding\n7:51\nwe have this OH here, so it's the\n7:53\nsame situation as the ethanol on the left,\n7:56\nso we have a polar or hydrophilic region of the molecule.\n8:00\nHowever, the difference is this time\n8:02\nwe have extremely large nonpolar\n8:05\nhydrophobic portion of the molecule.\n8:08\nThis nonpolar region overcomes\n8:10\nthe slightly polar region making the\n8:13\n1-octanol molecule nonpolar overall,\n8:17\nso 1-octanol will not dissolve in water.\n8:21\nThis one is a no and this one over here\n8:24\nwas a yes, ethanol is a yes.\n8:27\nNext, let's look at cinnamaldehyde,\n8:29\nso down here on the left is cinnamaldehyde,\n8:32\nlet's focus in on, let's focus in on\n8:33\nthis carbon oxygen double bond first.\n8:36\nWe know that oxygen is more\n8:38\nelectronegative than this carbon here,\n8:40\nso the oxygen withdraws from the electron density\n8:43\nmaking it partially negative and this\n8:45\ncarbon would be there for partially positive.\n8:48\nThis very small portion of the molecule\n8:50\nis polar, this small portion could interact with water.\n8:54\nHowever, we have an extremely large,\n8:56\nnonpolar region of the molecule, all of these\n8:59\ncarbons and hydrogens over here on the left.\n9:03\nThis very hydrophobic region, or nonpolar region,\n9:06\novercomes the small polar region\n9:08\nmaking cinnamaldehyde overall nonpolar.\n9:12\nSince it's overall nonpolar, cinnamaldehyde\n9:14\nwill not dissolve in water.\n9:17\nIf it's nonpolar, you would need a more nonpolar solvent\n9:20\nto get cinnamaldehyde to dissolve\n9:22\nand there are several examples of\n9:23\nnonpolar organic solvents that will do that.\n9:27\nNext let's look at sucrose, so over here\n9:30\non the right is sucrose or one way\n9:32\nto draw or represent the sucrose compound.\n9:36\nNow we see lots of carbons and hydrogens,\n9:39\nso all of these right here, let me just\n9:41\ngo ahead and highlight all these carbons in this ring\n9:43\nand so all these carbons in these rings,\n9:45\nall these hydrogens, so at first you might think\n9:49\nokay, there's lots of carbons and hydrogens,\n9:51\nthis might be nonpolar, but of course we have\n9:54\nlots of these OH groups, so I'm gonna\n9:57\ngo ahead and circle a few of them,\n9:58\nright, we have all of these OH groups\n10:00\nin the sucrose molecules, so lots of them.\n10:03\nThat means opportunities for hydrogen bonding.\n10:07\nBecause of all these opportunities\n10:09\nfor hydrogen bonding, sucrose is soluble in water\n10:13\nwhich we know from experience.\n10:14\nOf course sucrose, or sugar, sugar will\n10:16\ndissolve in water, so the opportunity\n10:19\nfor hydrogen bonding is the reason for that.\n10:23\nBenzoic acid is a solid at room temperature.\n10:26\nIf you take some benzoic acid crystals\n10:28\nand you put them in some room temperature water,\n10:30\nthe crystals won't dissolve.\n10:32\nWe can explain that by looking\n10:34\nat the structure for benzoic acid.\n10:36\nWhile we do have this portion of the compound\n10:39\nwhich we know is polar and hydrophilic\n10:41\ndue to the presence of the electronegative oxygens,\n10:44\nwe also have this portion of the compound\n10:47\non the left which is nonpolar and hydrophobic\n10:50\ndue to the presence of all the carbons and hydrogens.\n10:53\nSince the benzoic acid crystals don't\n10:55\ndissolve at room temperature water,\n10:57\nthe hydrophobic portion of the compound\n10:59\nmust overcome the hydrophilic portion of the compound.\n11:03\nYou actually can get benzoic acid\n11:05\ncrystals to dissolve in water if you heat up the water,\n11:08\nif you increase the solubility of the compound\n11:11\nby increasing the temperature of the solvent.\n11:14\nLet's think about benzoic acid crystals\n11:16\nin room temperature water and let's add a base,\n11:19\nlet's add sodium hydroxide.\n11:22\nThe sodium hydroxide's going to react\n11:24\nwith the most acidic proton on benzoic acid,\n11:27\nso benzoic acid is acidic, it will\n11:29\ndonate this proton right here.\n11:32\nThat means the electrons in red in this bond\n11:34\nare left behind on the oxygen,\n11:36\nso I'll show those electrons in red over here.\n11:39\nThat's gives this oxygen a negative charge\n11:41\nand we form sodium benzoate.\n11:44\nI won't get too much into acid base chemistry,\n11:47\nbut we took the most acidic proton off of benzoic acid\n11:50\nto give us the conjugate base sodium benzoate.\n11:53\nSodium benzoate is highly soluble\n11:56\nin room temperature water.\n11:58\nThat must mean we increase this\n12:01\nhydrophilic portion because now we have\n12:04\na negative charge, so the hydrophilic portion\n12:07\nnow is able to overcome the hydrophobic portion.\n12:11\nSodium benzoate is soluble,\n12:14\nthis negative charge is better able\n12:16\nto interact with our solvent which is water.",

They had even bigger brains.\n3:36\nThey made spears and stone tools, similar to those\n3:40\nfound in Africa, and we suspect they had strong social relationships.\n3:47\nThey cared for the sick, and infirm, and buried their dead.\n3:53\nNot so very different, culturally, from early Homo sapiens, it seems\n3:59\nthat our human anatomy developed before our complex human culture.\n4:06\nBut things were about to change.\n4:10\nToday, we live in all climates, all over the world;\n4:14\nand are unique, in our dependence on our cultures for survival.\n4:19\nHow we got from there, to here,\n4:25\nforms the next chapters in our human story.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\n- [Instructor] Before we get into electron affinity,\n0:04\nlet's really quickly review ionization energy.\n0:07\nAnd let's start with a neutral lithium atom,\n0:10\nwith an electron configuration of one s two, two s one.\n0:13\nA lithium atom has three protons in the nucleus,\n0:16\nso a positive three charge.\n0:18\nTwo electrons in the one s orbital,\n0:21\nso here are the two electrons in the one s orbital,\n0:24\nor our core electrons,\n0:26\nand one electron in a two s orbital.\n0:28\nThis is our outermost electron, our valence electron.\n0:32\nThe valence electron is shielded\n0:35\nfrom the full positive three charge of the nucleus\n0:37\nby the presence of the core electrons.\n0:40\nSo like charges repel,\n0:41\nand these core electrons repel this outer electron,\n0:45\nand shield it from the full positive three charge.\n0:48\nBut there still is an attractive force\n0:50\nbetween the positively charged nucleus\n0:52\nand this outermost electron.\n0:54\nSo opposite charges attract, and our outermost electron\n0:58\nstill feels a pull from the nucleus.\n1:01\nTherefore, since the outer electron is attracted\n1:04\nto the nucleus, it takes energy\n1:06\nto completely pull away this valence electron\n1:08\nfrom the neutral atom.\n1:10\nSo if we pull away the outermost electron,\n1:13\nwe lose our valence electron,\n1:15\nand we're left with a lithium ion, with a positive charge.\n1:19\nPositive one charge, because we still have three protons,\n1:22\nbut only two electrons now,\n1:24\nso overall a plus one charge.\n1:26\nSince this ionization takes energy to rip away the electron,\n1:30\nthe energy, the ionization energy, is positive,\n1:34\nand is measured in kiloJoules per mol.\n1:36\nLet's compare that with electron affinity.\n1:39\nSo, in electron affinity, let's say we're starting\n1:42\nwith our neutral lithium atom again,\n1:44\nbut this time, instead of taking an electron away,\n1:47\nwe are adding an electron.\n1:50\nSo, we would add an electron to the two s orbital.\n1:54\nSo we started off with three electrons\n1:55\nin the neutral lithium atom, and we're adding one more.\n1:59\nSo the electron configuration for the lithium ion\n2:02\nwould be one s two, two s two.\n2:06\nSo still three positive charges in the nucleus,\n2:09\ntwo electrons in the one s orbital,\n2:12\nbut now we've added an electron,\n2:13\nso we have four electrons total,\n2:16\ntwo in the two s orbital.\n2:19\nSo let me highlight the electron that we added in magenta.\n2:22\nSo this is the electron that we added\n2:24\nto a neutral lithium atom.\n2:27\nAnd this electron, we know, is shielded\n2:30\nfrom the full positive three charge of the nucleus\n2:32\nby our two core electrons in here, right?\n2:35\nSo like charges repel.\n2:37\nIt's also going to be repelled a little bit\n2:39\nby this electron, that's also in the two s orbital.\n2:43\nSo this electron's going to repel this one as well.\n2:47\nBut, there is an attractive force\n2:49\nbetween our positively charged nucleus\n2:51\nand our negative charge on the electron.\n2:55\nSo this electron that we added\n2:57\nstill feels an attractive force that's pulling on it\n3:00\nfrom the nucleus.\n3:03\nAnd so, if you add this fourth electron,\n3:06\nenergy is given off.\n3:08\nAnd since energy is given off, this is going to have\n3:11\na negative value for the electron affinity.\n3:14\nFor adding an electron to a neutral lithium atom,\n3:17\nit turns out to be -60 kiloJoules per mol.\n3:22\nSo energy is released when an electron is added,\n3:26\nand that is because the electron that we added\n3:29\nis still able to be attracted to the charged nucleus.\n3:33\nSo if the nucleus has an attraction for the added electron,\n3:36\nyou're going to get a negative value\n3:38\nfor the electron affinity.\n3:40\nOr that's one way to measure electron affinity.\n3:43\nNote that the lithium anion is larger\n3:46\nthan the neutral lithium atom.\n3:48\nIt's just hard to represent it here with those diagrams.\n3:51\nSo as long as the added electron\n3:53\nfeels an attractive force from the nucleus,\n3:55\nenergy is given off.\n3:58\nLet's look at one more comparison\n4:00\nbetween ionization energy and electron affinity.\n4:03\nIn ionization energy, since the outer electron here\n4:06\nis attracted to the nucleus, we have to work hard\n4:10\nto pull that electron away.\n4:12\nIt takes energy for us to rip away that electron.\n4:15\nAnd since it takes us energy, we have to do work,\n4:18\nand the energy is positive, in terms of ionization energy.\n4:22\nBut for electron affinity, since the electron\n4:25\nthat we're adding is attracted\n4:26\nto the positive charge of the nucleus,\n4:28\nwe don't have to force this,\n4:30\nwe don't have to do any work.\n4:31\nEnergy is given off in this process, and that's why\n4:34\nit's a negative value for the electron affinity.\n4:38\nElectron affinities don't have to be negative.\n4:41\nFor some atoms, there's actually no attraction\n4:43\nfor an extra electron.\n4:45\nLet's take neon, for example.\n4:47\nNeon has an electron configuration\n4:49\nof one s two, two s two, and two p six.\n4:54\nSo there's a total of two plus two plus six,\n4:57\nor 10 electrons, and a positive 10 charge in the nucleus\n5:00\nfor a neutral neon atom.\n5:03\nSo let's say this is our nucleus here,\n5:05\nwith a positive 10 charge, 10 protons.\n5:07\nAnd then we have our 10 electrons here,\n5:10\nsurrounding our nucleus.\n5:13\nSo this is our neutral neon atom.\n5:16\nIf we try to add an electron,\n5:18\nso here let's add an electron.\n5:20\nSo we still have our 10 protons in the nucleus.\n5:23\nWe still have our 10 electrons,\n5:25\nwhich would now be our core electrons.\n5:27\nTo add a new electron, this would be the neon anion here,\n5:32\nso one s two, two s two, two p six.\n5:36\nWe've filled the second energy level.\n5:38\nTo add an electron, we must go to a new energy level.\n5:42\nSo it would be the third energy level,\n5:44\nit would be an s orbital,\n5:46\nand there would be one electron in that orbital.\n5:48\nSo, here is, let's say this is the electron\n5:51\nthat we just added.\n5:52\nSo we have to try to add an electron to our neon atom.\n5:57\nBut if you think about the effective nuclear charge\n6:01\nthat this electron in magenta feels,\n6:04\nalright, so the effective nuclear charge,\n6:06\nthat's equal to the atomic number, or the number of protons,\n6:09\nand from that, you subtract\n6:11\nthe number of shielding electrons.\n6:13\nSince we have 10 protons in the nucleus, this would be 10.\n6:17\nAnd our shielding electrons would be 10, as well.\n6:20\nSo those 10 electrons shield this added electron\n6:23\nfrom the full positive 10 charge of the nucleus.\n6:28\nAnd for a quick calculation, this tells us\n6:30\nthat the effective nuclear charge is zero.\n6:34\nAnd this is, you know, simplifying things\n6:36\na little bit, but you can think\n6:37\nabout this outer electron that we tried to add,\n6:40\nof not having any attraction for the nucleus.\n6:43\nThese 10 electrons shield it completely\n6:45\nfrom the positive 10 charge.\n6:47\nAnd since there's no attraction for this electron,\n6:50\nenergy is not given off in this process.\n6:53\nActually, it would take energy\n6:55\nto force an electron onto neon.\n6:58\nSo if you wrote something out here,\n7:00\nand if we said, alright, I'm trying to go from,\n7:02\nI'm trying to add an electron to neon,\n7:04\nto turn it into an anion.\n7:06\nInstead of giving off energy,\n7:08\nthis process would take energy.\n7:10\nSo we would have to force,\n7:12\nwe would have to try to force this to occur.\n7:15\nSo it takes energy to force an electron\n7:17\non a neutral atom of neon.\n7:19\nAnd we say that neon has no affinity for an electron.\n7:24\nSo it's unreactive, it's a noble gas, and this is one way\n7:28\nto explain why noble gases are unreactive.\n7:31\nThis anion that we intended\n7:33\nisn't going to stay around for long.\n7:35\nSo it takes energy to force this onto our neutral neon atom.\n7:39\nSo you could say that the electron affinity\n7:41\nis positive here, it takes energy.\n7:44\nBut usually, you don't see positive values\n7:46\nfor electron affinity, for this sort of situation.\n7:49\nAt least, most textbooks I've looked at would just say\n7:51\nthe electron affinity of neon is zero,\n7:54\nsince I believe it is hard to measure\n7:57\nthe actual value of this.\n7:59\nHere we have the elements in the second period\n8:01\non the periodic table, and let's look\n8:02\nat their electron affinities.\n8:04\nWe've already seen that adding an electron\n8:06\nto a neutral atom of lithium\n8:08\ngives off 60 kiloJoules per mol.\n8:12\nNext, we have beryllium, with a zero value\n8:14\nfor the electron affinity.\n8:16\nThat means it actually takes energy.\n8:18\nSo this number is actually positive,\n8:20\nand it takes energy to add an electron\n8:23\nto a neutral atom of beryllium.\n8:25\nSo if you think about going from a neutral atom of beryllium\n8:28\nto form the beryllium anion,\n8:30\nwhen we look at electron configurations,\n8:33\nneutral atom of beryllium is one s two, two s two,\n8:36\nand so, to form the negatively charged beryllium anion,\n8:39\nit would be one s two, two s two,\n8:42\nand to add the extra electron, it must go\n8:45\ninto a two p orbital, which is of higher energy.\n8:50\nAnd so, this is actually the same thing, or very similar,\n8:53\nto neon, which we just discussed.\n8:56\nFor neon, the electron configuration was one s two,\n8:59\ntwo s two, two p six, and to add an extra electron,\n9:04\nwe had to go to the third energy level.\n9:06\nWe had to open up a new shell.\n9:08\nAnd the electron that we added was effectively screened\n9:11\nfrom the full nuclear charge by these other electrons.\n9:15\nAnd a similar thing happens here for the beryllium anion.\n9:18\nTo add this extra electron, we have to open up\n9:21\na higher energy p orbital.\n9:23\nThis electron is, on average, further away from the nucleus,\n9:26\nand is effectively shielded from the full positive\n9:29\ncharge of the nucleus, and therefore, there's no affinity\n9:33\nfor this added electron.\n9:35\nSo there's no affinity for this electron,\n9:37\nso it takes energy to form the beryllium anion.\n9:41\nAnd that's why we see this zero value here for beryllium.\n9:44\nBeryllium has no value for electron affinity,\n9:47\nor, it's actually a very positive value,\n9:49\nand we just say it has a zero value.\n9:51\nNext, let's look at boron here.\n9:53\nSo this gives off -27 kiloJoules per mol.\n9:56\nAnd we can see a little bit of a trend here,\n9:59\nas we go from boron to carbon to oxygen to fluorine.\n10:04\nSo as we go across the period on the periodic table,\n10:10\nmore energy is given off, and therefore,\n10:13\nfluorine has the most affinity for an electron.\n10:17\nSo as we go across a period, we get an increase\n10:20\nin the electron affinity.\n10:22\nSo the negative sign just means that energy is given off,\n10:25\nso we're really just looking at the magnitude.\n10:27\nMore energy is given off when you add\n10:29\nan electron to a neutral atom of fluorine,\n10:32\nthan if you add an electron to a neutral atom of oxygen.\n10:37\nAnd we can explain this general trend\n10:39\nin terms of effective nuclear charge.\n10:41\nAs we go across our period, we also have an increase\n10:45\nin the effective nuclear charge.\n10:48\nAnd if the added electron is feeling more of a pull\n10:51\nfrom the nucleus, which is what we mean here\n10:54\nby increased effective nuclear charge,\n10:57\nmore energy will be given off when we add that electron.\n11:01\nSo this idea explains the general trend\n11:04\nwe see for electron affinity, as you go across a period,\n11:08\nwe get an increase in the electron affinity.\n11:11\nWe've already talked about beryllium as an exception,\n11:14\nneon as an exception, but what about nitrogen in here?\n11:18\nWe can see that nitrogen doesn't really have\n11:21\nan affinity for an electron, and you'll see\n11:24\nmany different values for this one,\n11:25\ndepending on which textbook you're looking in.\n11:28\nBut if we look at some electron configurations\n11:30\nreally quickly, we can try to explain this.\n11:33\nSo, for nitrogen, the electron configuration\n11:37\nis one s two, two s two, and then two p three.\n11:42\nSo if we draw out our orbitals,\n11:44\nlet's just say this is the two s orbital,\n11:46\nand then these are the three two p orbitals.\n11:49\nSo we'll just do these electrons here.\n11:51\nTwo electrons in the two s orbital,\n11:53\nand then we have three electrons in the p orbital.\n11:56\nSo let's draw those in there.\n11:58\nIf we try to add an electron to a neutral nitrogen atom,\n12:02\nwe're adding an electron to one of these orbitals,\n12:05\nwhich already has an electron in it.\n12:08\nSo adding an electron to one of these orbitals, right,\n12:12\nthe added electron would be repelled\n12:14\nby the electron that was in there to start with.\n12:16\nAnd this is the reason that you usually see in textbooks\n12:19\nfor the fact that this does not follow the trend.\n12:22\nNitrogen doesn't have an affinity for one added electron.\n12:27\nSo after going through all of that,\n12:28\nit's obvious that electron affinity\n12:30\nis a little more complicated than ionization energy.\n12:34\nIn ionization energy, we had a pretty clear trend,\n12:36\nand it was a little easier to explain why.\n12:39\nFor electron affinity, going across a period\n12:42\non the periodic table, we see a little bit of a trend,\n12:45\nbut there are many exceptions to this,\n12:47\nand perhaps our explanations are a little bit too simplistic\n12:51\nto explain actually what's going on.\n12:54\nBut across a period, you do see a little bit of a trend.\n12:57\nGoing down a group is much harder.\n12:59\nYou see more inconsistencies, and it's not really even worth\n13:02\ngoing over a general trend for that.",

mass.\n0:09\nIf you were to combine all of the hydrogen atoms,\n0:11\nit would just be this really, really massive thing.\n0:15\nSo you have this huge cloud.\n0:16\nWell, we know that gravity would make the atoms actually\n0:20\nattracted to each other.\n0:21\nIt's-- we normally don't think about the gravity of atoms.\n0:25\nBut it would slowly affect these atoms.\n0:27\nAnd they would slowly draw close to each other.\n0:30\nIt would slowly condense.\n0:31\nThey'd slowly move towards the center\n0:34\nof mass of all of the atoms.\n0:37\nThey'd slowly move in.\n0:39\nSo if we fast forward, this cloud's\n0:42\ngoing to get denser and denser.\n0:46\nAnd the hydrogen atoms are going to start\n0:48\nbumping into each other and rubbing up against each other\n0:51\nand interacting with each other.\n0:53\nAnd so it's going to get denser and denser and denser.\n0:56\nNow remember, it's a huge mass of hydrogen atoms.\n0:58\nSo the temperature is going up.\n1:03\nAnd it'll-- they'll keep condensing.\n1:05\nThey'll just keep condensing and condensing\n1:07\nuntil something really interesting happens.\n1:09\nSo let's imagine that they've gotten really dense here\n1:12\nin the center.\n1:16\nAnd there's a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over.\n1:19\nIt's really dense.\n1:20\nI could never draw the actual number of atoms here.\n1:22\nThis is really to give you an idea.\n1:24\nThere's a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity,\n1:28\nfrom everything that wants to get\n1:29\nto that center of mass of our entire cloud.\n1:32\nThe temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin.\n1:38\nAnd at that point, something neat happens.\n1:40\nAnd to kind of realize the neat thing that's happening,\n1:43\nlet's remember what a hydrogen atom looks like.\n1:46\nA hydrogen-- and even more, I'm just\n1:48\ngoing to focus on the hydrogen nucleus.\n1:49\nSo the hydrogen nucleus is a proton.\n1:50\nIf you want to think about a hydrogen atom,\n1:52\nit also has an electron orbiting around or floating around.\n1:57\nAnd let's draw another hydrogen atom over here.\n1:59\nAnd obviously this distance isn't to scale.\n2:02\nThis distance is also not to scale.\n2:04\nAtoms are actually-- the nucleus of atoms\n2:05\nare actually much, much, much, much smaller\n2:07\nthan the actual radius of an atom.\n2:10\nAnd so is the electron.\n2:11\nBut anyway, this just gives you an idea.\n2:13\nSo we know from the Coulomb forces,\n2:14\nfrom electromagnetic forces, that these two positively\n2:17\ncharged nucleuses will not want to get anywhere\n2:20\nnear each other.\n2:22\nBut we do know from our-- from what we learned about the four\n2:25\nforces-- that if they did get close enough to each other,\n2:28\nthat if they did get-- if somehow under huge temperatures\n2:31\nand huge pressures you were able to get these two protons close\n2:35\nenough to each other, then all of a sudden,\n2:37\nthe strong force will overtake.\n2:39\nIt's much stronger than the Coulomb force.\n2:41\nAnd then these two hydrogens will actually--\n2:43\nthese nucleuses would actually fuse-- or is it nuclei?\n2:48\nWell, anyway, they would actually fuse together.\n2:50\nAnd so that is what actually happens\n2:53\nonce this gets hot and dense enough.\n2:57\nYou now have enough pressure and enough temperature\n2:59\nto overcome the Coulomb force and bring\n3:02\nthese protons close enough to each other for fusion\n3:05\nto occur, for fusion ignition.\n3:12\nAnd the reason why-- and I want to be very careful.\n3:14\nIt's not ignition.\n3:15\nIt's not combustion in the traditional sense.\n3:16\nIt's not like you're burning a carbon molecule\n3:20\nin the presence of oxygen.\n3:22\nIt's not combustion.\n3:23\nIt's ignition.\n3:24\nAnd the reason why it's called ignition\n3:25\nis because when two of these protons,\n3:27\nor two of the nucleuses fuse, the resulting nucleus\n3:32\nhas a slightly smaller mass.\n3:35\nAnd so in the first stage of this,\n3:36\nyou actually have two protons under enough pressure--\n3:42\nobviously, this would not happen with just the Coulomb forces--\n3:44\nwith enough pressure they get close enough.\n3:46\nAnd then the strong interaction actually keeps them together.\n3:51\nOne of these guys degrades into a neutron.\n3:56\nAnd the resulting mass of the combined protons\n3:59\nis lower than the mass of each of the original.\n4:01\nBy a little bit, but that little bit of mass\n4:04\nresults in a lot of energy-- plus energy.\n4:11\nAnd this energy is why we call it ignition.\n4:13\nAnd so what this energy does is it provides\n4:16\na little bit of outward pressure,\n4:17\nso that this thing doesn't keep collapsing.\n4:21\nSo once you get pressure enough, the fusion occurs.\n4:24\nAnd then that energy provides outward pressure\n4:26\nto balance what is now a star.\n4:30\nSo now we are at where we actually\n4:32\nhave the ignition at the center.\n4:35\nWe have-- and we still have all of the other molecules trying\n4:39\nto get in providing the pressure for this fusion ignition.\n4:43\nNow, what is the hydrogen being fused into?\n4:46\nWell, in the first step of the reaction-- and I'm just\n4:50\nkind of doing the most basic type of fusion that happens\n4:54\nin stars-- the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium.\n5:00\nI have trouble spelling.\n5:01\nWhich is another way of calling heavy hydrogen.\n5:03\nThis is still hydrogen because it\n5:04\nhas one proton and one neutron now.\n5:07\nIt is not helium yet.\n5:08\nThis does not have two-- it does not have two protons.\n5:12\nBut then the deuterium keeps fusing.\n5:14\nAnd then we eventually end up with helium.\n5:19\nAnd we can even see that on the periodic table.\n5:21\nOh, I lost my periodic table.\n5:22\nWell, I'll show you the next video.\n5:23\nBut we know hydrogen in its atomic state\n5:30\nhas an atomic number of 1.\n5:32\nAnd it also has a mass of 1.\n5:34\nIt only has one nucleon in its nucleus.\n5:38\nBut it's being fused.\n5:39\nIt goes to hydrogen-2, which is deuterium,\n5:42\nwhich is one neutron, one proton in its nucleus, two nucleons.\n5:46\nAnd then that eventually gets fused--\n5:48\nand I'm not going into the detail of the reaction--\n5:50\ninto helium.\n5:51\nAnd by definition, helium has two protons and two neutrons.\n5:56\nSo it has-- or we're talking about helium-4,\n5:58\nin particular, that isotope of helium--\n6:00\nit has an atomic mass of 4.\n6:03\nAnd this process releases a ton of energy.\n6:06\nBecause the atomic mass of the helium that gets produced\n6:09\nis slightly lower than four times the atomic mass\n6:15\nof each of the constituent hydrogens.\n6:17\nSo all of this energy, all this energy from the fusion-- but it\n6:21\nneeds super high pressure, super high temperatures to happen--\n6:24\nkeeps the star from collapsing.\n6:28\nAnd once a star is in this stage,\n6:31\nonce it is using hydrogen-- it is fusing hydrogen\n6:35\nin its core, where the pressure and the temperature\n6:37\nis the most, to form helium-- it is now in its main sequence.\n6:41\nThis is now a main sequence star.\n6:48\nAnd that's actually where the sun is right now.\n6:50\nNow there's questions of, well, what if there just\n6:53\nwasn't enough mass to get to this level over here?\n6:56\nAnd there actually are things that\n6:57\nnever get to quite that threshold\n6:59\nto fuse all the way into helium.\n7:00\nThere are a few things that don't quite\n7:02\nmake the threshold of stars that only fuse to this level.\n7:05\nSo they are generating some of their heat.\n7:06\nOr there are even smaller objects\n7:08\nthat just get to the point there's\n7:10\na huge temperature and pressure, but fusion is not actually\n7:13\noccurring inside of the core.\n7:15\nAnd something like Jupiter would be an example.\n7:17\nAnd you could go several masses above Jupiter\n7:20\nwhere you get something like that.\n7:21\nSo you have to reach a certain threshold\n7:23\nwhere the mass, where the pressure and the temperature\n7:25\ndue to the heavy mass, get so large that you\n7:27\nstart this fusion.\n7:28\nAnd-- but the smaller you are above that threshold,\n7:31\nthe slower the fusion will occur.\n7:33\nBut if you're super massive, the fusion\n7:35\nwill occur really, really fast.\n7:37\nSo that's the general idea of just how stars get formed\n7:40\nand why they don't collapse on themselves\n7:43\nand why they are these kind of balls\n7:45\nof fusion reactions existing in the universe.\n7:48\nIn the next few videos, we'll talk\n7:50\nabout what happens once that hydrogen fuel in the core\n7:54\nstarts to run out.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWhat I want to do in this video is talk a little bit\n0:02\nabout quasars.\n0:06\nAnd that's a short form for quasi-stellar radio sources.\n0:16\nAnd this name is just a byproduct\n0:18\nof the first observations of quasars.\n0:20\nBecause all they looked like were\n0:22\nthese kind of point-like sources of electromagnetic radiation,\n0:26\nmainly in the radio part of the spectrum.\n0:29\nSo that's why we called them quasi-stellar radio sources.\n0:32\nNow, it turns out that they are neither stars, or even\n0:36\nquasi-stellar.\n0:37\nAnd actually, their main energy isn't even\n0:39\nbeing released in the radio band of\n0:43\nthe electromagnetic spectrum.\n0:44\nThey're far more energetic than that.\n0:47\nWhat they really are are the active nucleuses of galaxies.\n0:52\nSo let's think about that a little bit.\n0:54\nSo if we have a supermassive black hole\n0:56\nat the center of a galaxy-- so let\n0:58\nme draw that right over here.\n1:00\nSo that's our supermassive black hole.\n1:02\nAnd maybe that's the surface of the event horizon\n1:04\nof the supermassive black hole.\n1:06\nThe actual mass of the black hole\n1:08\nis in the center of that event horizon.\n1:11\nIf there is material that's passing by this black hole,\n1:14\nit's going to get attracted to it.\n1:15\nAnd it's going to form an accretion disk around it.\n1:19\nThis material is going to start rotating\n1:21\naround this black hole.\n1:22\nAnd some of it, if it doesn't have enough velocity,\n1:25\nis going to actually fall into the black hole.\n1:27\nSo you have all of this material going around the black hole.\n1:32\nAnd some of it, if it doesn't have enough angular velocity\n1:35\nand not enough to orbit around the black hole,\n1:38\nit's actually going to fall in.\n1:41\nLet me label this.\n1:42\nThis is the accretion disk.\n1:47\nSo as things are getting faster and faster as they fall closer\n1:51\nand closer to this black hole, and bumping\n1:53\ninto each other more and more, that gravitational potential\n1:56\nenergy from things falling into it\n1:58\nis being turned into actual energy, actual temperature.\n2:02\nAnd so what you have is things start\n2:05\nto get really, unbelievably hot near the surface.\n2:12\nThey get hotter and hotter as they fall closer and closer\n2:15\nto that event horizon.\n2:17\nAnd so near the event horizon itself,\n2:19\nthings are so intense that they're actually\n2:23\nreleasing high-frequency electromagnetic radiation,\n2:27\nmainly in the X-ray part of the spectrum.\n2:30\nNow, I want to been very clear.\n2:32\nSo there's two things here.\n2:33\nOne is when you learn about quasars,\n2:36\nor when I first was exposed to quasars in like a Nova special,\n2:42\nthey make you think that the quasar, that the radiation is\n2:44\nsomehow being released by the black hole itself.\n2:48\nAnd I would scratch my head because I was just\n2:50\ntold that nothing can escape the event horizon of a black hole,\n2:53\nincluding electromagnetic radiation.\n2:56\nSo how could that be being emitted by the black hole?\n2:59\nAnd the answer is, it's not being\n3:00\nemitted by the black hole.\n3:02\nIt's being emitted by the matter in the accretion disk that\n3:05\nhasn't quite gotten to the event horizon yet.\n3:08\nOnce it's inside of the event horizon,\n3:11\nany electromagnetic radiation that it might emit\n3:14\nwill not be able to escape the black hole anymore,\n3:17\nwill not be able to escape the actual event horizon.\n3:20\nSo all of this is from the accretion disc\n3:22\naround the supermassive black hole.\n3:27\nAnd the other question that used to pop in my mind\n3:29\nis why does it come out at these kind of perpendicular,\n3:34\northogonal to the plane of the actual accretion disk?\n3:40\nAnd at least my logic tells me, well, things\n3:42\naren't going to pop out-- they're not\n3:44\ngoing to pop out along the direction of the accretion disk\n3:46\nbecause then they're going to be absorbed by other things.\n3:48\nIn fact, that's what's going to cause other things to get\n3:50\nheated up closer to the actual event horizon.\n3:55\nSo any energy that's going out in that direction\n3:57\nis just going to be absorbed and make other things hotter.\n4:01\nAnd only when you go roughly perpendicular to the plane\n4:04\nof the accretion disk is that energy\n4:06\nallowed to kind of go and transmit freely into space.\n4:10\nNow, I want to be very clear.\n4:11\nQuasars, these are the most luminous things\n4:15\nthat we know of in the universe.\n4:26\nThe brightest-- or actually, many quasars\n4:29\nare on the order of a trillion suns in luminosity.\n4:32\nSo they can be brighter than an entire galaxy.\n4:35\nAnd that's just coming from material\n4:37\naround a fairly small region of space,\n4:41\nmuch, much, much smaller than an actual galaxy.\n4:43\nIt's the very center.\n4:44\nIt's kind of just the galactic core.\n4:46\nNow another interesting thing about quasars,\n4:49\nand this kind of gives credence to this notion\n4:51\nof a constantly changing universe,\n4:53\nand even to some degree the Big Bang itself,\n4:56\nis you have these supermassive black holes that\n4:59\nmay be formed shortly after the Big Bang.\n5:01\nNow you can imagine, at an early stage in the universe's\n5:04\ndevelopment there would have been a lot of mass that\n5:08\nwould have been near these black holes, that didn't have quite\n5:10\nthe velocities to be able to escape them or be\n5:12\nable to orbit around them.\n5:14\nAnd so these would actually start\n5:15\nfalling into the black hole.\n5:17\nAnd then over time, all of the mass that\n5:19\nhad to fall into the black hole, into the supermassive black\n5:22\nhole, will have fallen into the supermassive black hole.\n5:25\nAnd if you imagine at some future period of time,\n5:27\nyou should still have the supermassive black hole.\n5:30\nBut all you should see is mostly things orbiting around it.\n5:34\nAnything that had to fall into it,\n5:35\nwould have already fallen into it.\n5:37\nSo you're just going to see things orbiting around it.\n5:40\nAnd this is actually what we see if we look around us.\n5:43\nIf we look at our Milky Way Galaxy,\n5:44\nwe don't observe a lot of things falling in.\n5:47\nFor example, the Milky Way Galaxy\n5:51\ndoes not have an active nucleus, an active core.\n5:55\nIt is not currently a quasar, the center of the Milky Way\n5:58\nGalaxy.\n5:59\nThe supermassive black hole there is not,\n6:02\nI guess we could say, digesting, is not digesting or consuming\n6:06\nmaterial.\n6:06\nBut you could imagine at some point in the Milky Way's past,\n6:09\nthere might have been a lot of material\n6:11\nthat didn't have quite the velocity to be able to orbit.\n6:15\nAnd so that was consumed.\n6:16\nAnd as it was consumed, it would emit all of this X-ray\n6:21\nradiation and could be observed as a quasar.\n6:24\nAnd that's actually what we observe.\n6:25\nThe closest quasars-- and we've observed\n6:27\nmore than 200,000 quasars-- the closest quasars are\n6:32\non the order of 780 million light years away.\n6:39\nSo what does that mean?\n6:39\nWe don't observe quasars closer than 700 million light years.\n6:43\nSo what that tells us is, at least\n6:46\nin our region of the universe, the most recent quasars\n6:49\nwere 780 million years in the past.\n6:53\nWhen we look at closer parts of the universe-- let me draw,\n6:57\nlet's say this is the observable universe.\n7:00\nThis is us.\n7:01\nSo we only start to observe quasars\n7:03\nat a certain distance away from us.\n7:05\nAnd that distance is actually also\n7:06\na certain time in the past.\n7:08\nBecause it took the light 780 million years to get to us.\n7:10\nAnd actually, most of the quasars\n7:12\nare more than 3 billion light years away.\n7:15\nWhich tells us that they only existed more than 3\n7:18\nbillion years in the past, at a younger\n7:22\nstage of the actual universe, when there\n7:25\nwas actual material for these supermassive black holes\n7:28\nto consume at the center of galaxies.\n7:30\nYou move closer in time to us, and most of that material\n7:34\nhas actually been consumed.\n7:36\nAnd we just have material orbiting\n7:38\naround these supermassive black holes, which we call galaxies.\n7:42\nAnd so we don't observe quasars anymore.\n7:45\nAnd just to give an idea.\n7:46\nI mean these are, as everything we learn in cosmology,\n7:49\nkind of these mind-bending concepts,\n7:50\nunbelievable distances, unbelievable masses,\n7:54\nunbelievable brightnesses, I guess you could think about it.\n7:57\nBut just to give a sense, the brightest quasars,\n7:59\nthe brightest known quasars, devour\n8:02\non the order of 1,000 solar masses per year.\n8:11\nSo that's on the order of 10 Earths, 10 Earths per second,\n8:16\nif I did my math right.\n8:19\n10 Earths per second are being devoured\n8:23\nby the brightest quasars.\n8:25\nAnd it's that energy of that mass that's acreting around it\n8:30\nthat's generating all of that energy.\n8:32\nAnd actually, I should say-- I shouldn't even\n8:34\ntalk about it in the present tense.\n8:36\nThis happened in the past.\n8:38\nWe're just observing it now.\n8:40\nFor all we know, the rest of the universe\n8:42\nlooks fairly similar to the way our universe does.\n8:44\nAnd so there really aren't that many quasars around.\n8:47\nAlthough the other side of the coin might be,\n8:49\neven though most of the material has already\n8:51\nbeen consumed, maybe even by our own supermassive black hole\n8:54\nin the center of the Milky Way, at some point in the future,\n8:58\nmaybe it will be able to consume on some more stellar material,\n9:01\nsome more-- well, any type of material in the future.\n9:06\nAnd that might happen about 4 or 5 billion years\n9:08\nin the future when we actually collide with the Andromeda\n9:10\nGalaxy.\n9:11\nSo anyway, hopefully that gave you some food for thought.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- Let's now jump into understanding meiosis in some depth.\n0:04\nSo let's start with the germ cell.\n0:07\nAs we mentioned already, a germ cell is a cell that\n0:10\nit can either go to mitosis to produce other germ cells\n0:14\nor it can undergo meiosis in order to produce gametes.\n0:18\nSo this is a germ cell right over here.\n0:21\nLet me draw the nuclear membrane.\n0:25\nLet me draw the nucleus larger because that's where\n0:28\nwe care a lot about the chromosomes in it.\n0:31\nAnd let me draw a centrosome\n0:33\nwhich will play a role later on.\n0:35\nI wanna do that in ...\n0:37\nLet's see, I'll do that in this blue color.\n0:39\nEach centromosome has two centrioles in it.\n0:43\nI just wanna clarify some of the terminology.\n0:45\nAnd in the mitosis videos, I focused on\n0:49\ncells of an organism, I just kind of made it up,\n0:52\nthat had two chromosomes, that had a diploid number of two\n0:56\nthat had one homologous pair, that had one chromosome\n0:59\nfrom each of its parents.\n1:01\nFor this video, I'm gonna focus on a species,\n1:04\nnot human beings, that would have\n1:06\n23 pairs or 46 chromosomes.\n1:08\nI'm gonna focus on a species that has,\n1:10\nthat's diploid number is four.\n1:13\nAnd so, let's say it has two chromosomes from the father.\n1:17\nAnd let me do that.\n1:18\nI'll do that in this orange color.\n1:20\nNow, I'll do that in the chromatin,\n1:21\nI'll kind of depict the chromatin sate,\n1:23\nit's kind of unwound.\n1:24\nSo maybe it has a long one from the father\n1:25\nand it has a short one from the father.\n1:28\nAnd then it has homologous chromosomes from the mother.\n1:31\nSo it would have the long one from the mother\n1:33\nand it would have the short one\n1:37\nfrom the mother just like that.\n1:39\nAnd obviously this is a huge simplification\n1:42\nbut hopefully this discuss the point across.\n1:44\nSo here, it has a diploid number of chromosomes.\n1:47\nSo this is, let me write this down.\n1:50\nThis is diploid\n1:55\nnumber is equal to,\n1:57\nwe have four chromosomes.\n2:00\nAnd then this thing, this germ cell.\n2:02\nLet me write this down.\n2:02\nThis is a germ cell right over here.\n2:05\nIt will go through interphase.\n2:08\nSo let me draw that.\n2:09\nSo it will go through interface in which\n2:13\nit grows and it can replicate its DNA and its centrosome.\n2:18\nAnd so, let me draw that.\n2:19\nSo after it goes through interface,\n2:22\nI wanna use my space carefully because I have a lot\n2:24\nof steps to go through.\n2:26\nAfter it goes through interface, I am going to have\n2:31\nin my nucleus here,\n2:36\nmy DNA will have replicated.\n2:38\nSo this long chromosome from my father,\n2:42\nnow all the DNA will have replicated so\n2:46\nit may look something like that.\n2:49\nAnd it's attached\n2:54\nat a centromere,\n2:56\nAll these centro words,\n2:58\nat a centromere right here.\n2:59\nBut I'm still trying to draw it in kind of\n3:01\nthe chromatin state.\n3:02\nIt's actually all spread out.\n3:03\nIt's not bunched up so that you can see it very clearly\n3:06\nas these X's in a simple microscope.\n3:10\nSo it's just replicated.\n3:11\nAnd after replicating, it is still one chromosome.\n3:14\nIt has twice the genetic material\n3:16\nbut it is still one chromosome.\n3:19\nThat one chromosome is now made up of\n3:21\ntwo sister chromatids.\n3:24\nwe talked a lot about that in the mitosis video,\n3:27\nbut it doesn't hurt to reinforce\n3:28\nbecause it can get a little bit confusing.\n3:30\nAnd then you have that shorter chromosome from the father\n3:34\nand then that also replicates into two sister chromatids\n3:40\nattached at a centromere.\n3:43\nSo these are still two chromosomes from the father.\n3:45\nIt has twice the amount of DNA but it's containing\n3:48\nthe same information,\n3:49\njust duplicate versions of that same information.\n3:52\nAnd the same thing's gonna happen from the mother.\n3:54\nYou had that long chromosome from the mother,\n3:57\nhomologous to this right over here.\n3:59\nIt's going to replicate.\n4:01\nSo it's now going to be two sister chromatids.\n4:06\nAnd then you have a short strand from the mother\n4:08\nthat was homologous to this one from your father.\n4:11\nAnd that's also gonna replicate.\n4:13\nAnd so, it's like that.\n4:14\nAnd at the end of interface,\n4:15\nit would actually all be spread out.\n4:18\nOnce again, it won't be bunched up into these\n4:20\nclearly discernible X's.\n4:22\nI drew them a little bit that way, otherwise,\n4:23\nbecause you would have trouble seeing how that replicated.\n4:26\nAnd we also have replicated our centrosome\n4:30\nas we've gone through interface.\n4:33\nNow, we are ready.\n4:34\nIn fact, now we are ready for either mitosis or meiosis.\n4:38\nBut as I said, the focus of this video\n4:40\nis going to be meiosis so let's do some meiosis.\n4:45\nSo the first phase,\n4:46\nso the first several phases we call meiosis I.\n4:49\nAnd the beginning of meiosis I is prophase I.\n4:52\nSo let's see what happens in prophase I.\n4:55\nSo prophase I.\n4:57\nAnd so, let me draw the cell right over here.\n5:02\nSo prophase I.\n5:04\nA couple of things happen.\n5:06\nThe nuclear membrane begins to dissolve.\n5:09\nThis is very similar to prophase\n5:12\nwhen we're looking at mitosis.\n5:15\nSo the nuclear envelope begins to dissolve.\n5:19\nThese things start to maybe migrate a little bit.\n5:22\nSo these characters are trying to go at different ends.\n5:27\nAnd the DNA starts to bunch up into kind of\n5:31\nits condensed form.\n5:32\nSo now I can draw it.\n5:34\nSo now I can start to draw it as proper.\n5:37\nSo this is the one from the father\n5:42\nright over here.\n5:43\nAnd this is the one from the mother.\n5:46\nAnd I'm drawing, I'm overlapping on purpose\n5:48\nbecause something very interesting happens\n5:50\nespecially in meiosis.\n5:52\nSo it's the mother right over here.\n5:57\nLet me see.\n5:58\nLet's now do the centromere in blue now.\n5:59\nThat's the centromere.\n6:02\nNow this is the shorter ones from the father.\n6:07\nThese are the shorter ones from the mother.\n6:10\nAnd actually, let me just do draw them on opposite sides\n6:12\njust to show that they don't have to,\n6:14\nthe ones from the father aren't always\n6:15\non the left hand side.\n6:16\nSo this is the shorter one from the father.\n6:20\nThey couldn't be all on the left hand side\n6:21\nbut doesn't this all they have to be.\n6:23\nAnd this is the shorter one from the mother.\n6:24\nAnd I will draw this overlapping although they could have.\n6:27\nShorter one from the mother.\n6:29\nAnd once again, each of these, this is a homologous pair,\n6:31\nthat's a homologous pair over there.\n6:33\nNow, the DNA has been replicated so\n6:37\nin each of the chromosomes in a homologous pair,\n6:40\nyou have two sister chromatids.\n6:42\nAnd so, in this entire homologous pair,\n6:44\nyou have four chromatids.\n6:47\nAnd so, this is sometimes called a tetrad.\n6:49\nSo let me just give ourselves some terminology.\n6:53\nSo this right over here is called a tetrad\n6:56\nor often called a tetrad.\n6:59\nNow, the reason why I drew this overlapping\n7:01\nis when we are in prophase I in meiosis I.\n7:04\nLet me label this.\n7:05\nThis is prophase I.\n7:09\nYou can get some genetic recombination,\n7:11\nsome homologous recombination.\n7:13\nOnce again, this is homologous pair.\n7:16\nOne chromosome from the father\n7:18\nthat I've gotten from the father.\n7:19\nThe species or the cell got it from its father's cell\n7:22\nand one from the mother.\n7:24\nAnd they're homologous.\n7:26\nThey might contain different base pairs,\n7:28\ndifferent actual DNA, but they code for the same genes.\n7:34\nOver simplification, but in a similar place on each of these\n7:38\nit might code for eye color or I don't know,\n7:41\npersonality.\n7:42\nNothing is that simple in how tall you get\n7:45\nand it's not that simple in DNA but just to give you\n7:48\nan idea of how it is.\n7:49\nAnd the reason why I overlapped them like this\n7:51\nis to show how the recombination can occur.\n7:54\nSo actually, let me zoom in.\n7:56\nSo this is the one from the father.\n7:59\nOnce again, it's on the condensed form.\n8:00\nThis is one chromosome made up of two sister chromatids\n8:05\nright over here.\n8:06\nAnd I drew the centromere,\n8:08\nnot to be confused with centrosomes.\n8:10\nThat's where they are, those sister chromatids are attached.\n8:13\nAnd then, I will draw the homologous\n8:17\nchromosome from the mother.\n8:19\nSo the homologous chromosome from the mother\n8:23\njust like that.\n8:28\nHomologous chromosome from the mother.\n8:30\nAnd the recombination can occur at a point\n8:33\nright over here.\n8:35\nSo after you're done with the recombination,\n8:38\nthis side might look something more like this.\n8:41\nSo let me draw it like this.\n8:46\nSo, they essentially break up\n8:48\nand they swap those little sections.\n8:50\nThere's one way to think about it.\n8:52\nSo this one, we'll now have a little piece from the mother.\n8:56\nIt might code for similar genes.\n8:58\nBut now it contains the mother's genetic information.\n9:00\nAnd then this one over here\n9:06\nwill now have the piece.\n9:10\nAnd you could say even homologous piece from the father.\n9:16\nLet me do these two centromeres.\n9:18\nAnd this is really interesting.\n9:21\nAll the time, there couldn't be recombination\n9:23\nand often times it can lead to kind of none optimal things,\n9:26\nnonsense code and DNA.\n9:28\nIt might lead to a nonfunctional organism.\n9:31\nBut this happens fairly common in the meiosis\n9:36\nand it's a way, once again, to get more variation.\n9:38\nWe've talked about sexual reproduction before.\n9:40\nAnd sexual reproduction introduces variation\n9:43\ninto a population.\n9:44\nAnd this, obviously, when different sperms\n9:46\nfind different eggs that introduces variation.\n9:48\nBut then, even amongst homologous pairs\n9:50\nyou can actually have exchange between this chromosome.\n9:54\nAnd that's interesting because as we mentioned,\n9:57\neach of these chromosomes,\n9:58\nthey code for a bunch of different genes.\n10:00\nAnd a gene is kinda looking code for a specific\n10:03\nor a set of proteins.\n10:05\nSo this right over here,\n10:09\nand this is what I'm about to say is gonna be huge\n10:11\nover simplification.\n10:12\nMaybe right over here you coded for eye color\n10:15\nor it was related to, or it helps code for eye color.\n10:18\nAnd then you got that from your dad.\n10:19\nAnd here, it helped code for eye color.\n10:21\nAnd you got that from your mom.\n10:22\nYour mom might have trended you towards a lighter eye color\n10:26\nand your dad might have trended you\n10:27\ntowards a darker eye color.\n10:28\nBut now, the one from your mom is on this chromosome,\n10:32\nthis gene, and then the one\n10:34\nor they've both the same gene.\n10:35\nThey're just different allele.\n10:36\nThey're coding for different variance of that gene.\n10:38\nAnd then the allele from your dad is over here.\n10:41\nAnd once again, some people get confused with genes\n10:44\nand chromosomes and all of these.\n10:45\nEach of these chromosomes contain a bunch of genes.\n10:48\nThese are very long DNA molecules.\n10:50\nThis code for a bunch of different genes.\n10:53\nSo gene will be a little section of here that could code for\n10:57\na particular protein.\n10:59\nSo that's what happens in prophase I.\n11:01\nIn prophase I, you have this condensation\n11:05\nof your chromosomes, of your homologous pairs.\n11:09\nYou can have this recombination.\n11:12\nAnd it's really interesting, this recombination\n11:14\ndoesn't tend to happen at just random points\n11:16\nthat would kind of break the genetic information.\n11:20\nIt tends to happen at fairly clean points.\n11:22\nAnd the places where this breakup is happening,\n11:25\nthese are called the plural,\n11:27\nif you just talk about one point, it's a chiasma,\n11:30\nor if you're talking about the plural, it's chiasmata.\n11:32\nSounds like it could be a horror movie.\n11:34\nSo, chiasma.\n11:36\nChiasma.\n11:37\nAnd the fact that they happen,\n11:38\nthey tend to happen fairly clearly, this is once again,\n11:41\nkind of the beauty of the universe or at least\n11:43\nof biology is that through\n11:46\nbillions of years of evolution, these things have kind of\n11:50\noptimized for more variation and to happen\n11:54\nin fairly clean ways.\n11:56\nSo I'm gonna leave this video right there.\n11:58\nI know I just got to prophase I.\n11:59\nBut this was a really, really important idea of\n12:01\nthis homologous recombination or this chromosomal crossover\n12:06\nthat we see right over here.\n12:07\nAnd then from there, we can continue\n12:09\nthrough the rest of meiosis I and then meiosis II.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nNow that we've touched on all of the major players in the\n0:02\nspecific immune system, what I thought I would do in this\n0:05\nvideo is do a summary so it all fits\n0:08\ntogether a little bit.\n0:09\nSo the first person or character we got exposed to\n0:12\nwas the B cell, which I always do in blue.\n0:18\nAnd what made that interesting is that every B cell has its\n0:22\nown specific-- or they have membrane bound antibodies, but\n0:28\nfor each B cell, the membrane bound antibodies on each\n0:33\nspecific B cell had its own variable portion.\n0:36\nSo this B cell-- it'll be variable right like that.\n0:41\nAnd if I were to draw another B cell right here, I would\n0:45\ndraw the variable portion a little bit different.\n0:47\nThis is why different actual B cells will respond to\n0:51\ndifferent antigens or different pathogens that have\n0:54\nentered our system.\n0:55\nAnd a B cell gets activated-- let's talk about what happens\n1:05\nwhen it gets activated or what needs to happen.\n1:10\nIt needs binding of the pathogen onto one of these\n1:15\nmembrane bound antibodies.\n1:28\nBut that's not all.\n1:29\nI mean, sometimes that's all you need, but usually you also\n1:33\nneed to be stimulated by a T cell.\n1:41\nAnd you might say, where's the helper T cell\n1:44\nstimulate this guy?\n1:46\nWell, B cells were also antigen presenting cells so\n1:49\nhe'll suck this guy in, break him out, and present him on an\n1:53\nMHC II complex.\n2:00\nLet's say this is an MHC II complex.\n2:03\nThis guy gets cut up, part of him gets presented right here,\n2:06\nand then an activated helper T cell whose variable portion of\n2:12\ntheir T cell receptor is specific to this could come\n2:15\nalong and activate this character.\n2:20\nI'm not drawing that receptor well, but that right there is\n2:24\na helper T cell and that is the B cell.\n2:28\nNow, once it's activated, it starts differentiating-- and\n2:33\nit starts cloning itself and it can either turn into\n2:35\neffector cells-- and this true of B cells or T cells.\n2:41\nOnce they get activated, they keep cloning or they either\n2:43\nturn into effector cells or memory cells.\n2:46\nMemory cells stick around a lot longer so that in the\n2:49\nfuture you're going to have many more of this\n2:51\nversion of B cells.\n2:52\nSo if you get the same antigen or pathogen in the future, the\n2:56\nlikelihood of it bumping into this type of B cell is going\n2:59\nto be higher so the response will occur faster.\n3:02\nThe effector B cells produce-- they essentially turn into\n3:10\nantibody making machines.\n3:12\nSo they'll say, gee, this antibody bonds to this antigen\n3:16\nthat we have in the system now.\n3:18\nLet me just produce a ton of them.\n3:20\nSo it starts building up all of the cellular machinery and\n3:23\nit starts producing antibodies like crazy.\n3:26\nI want to point out one thing that my wife pointed out to me\n3:29\nwhen I was-- she overheard me making the last video and\n3:32\nshe's a fellow in hematology and a lot of hematology is\n3:35\nimmunology.\n3:36\nSo I definitely have to defer to her.\n3:38\nShe is the expert on this.\n3:41\nIn the last video, I kind of very hand-wavingly said, B\n3:45\ncells, once they get activated, if they're the\n3:47\neffector B cells, they produce antibodies.\n3:49\nI want to be very clear.\n3:50\nIt is only the effector B cells that produce the\n3:52\nantibodies and the common term for them-- if someone were to\n3:57\nwalk up to you and say, what cells in the body are\n4:01\nproducing antibodies?\n4:02\nYou wouldn't be wrong if you said effector B cells, but the\n4:05\ncommon term that people expect to hear are plasma cells.\n4:12\nPlasma cells and effector B cells are the same thing, but\n4:16\nnormally when they say, what happens to a B cell when it\n4:18\nstarts producing antibodies?\n4:20\nThey then call it a plasma cell.\n4:21\nThey don't call it a B cell anymore and I want to make\n4:23\nthat very clear because my wife's like, well, I have\n4:24\nattendings that if they asked me, what cell in the body\n4:28\nproduces antibodies?\n4:29\nAnd if you said, B cell, they would say, no, wrong.\n4:32\nIt's a plasma cell-- or if you said effector B cell, they\n4:34\nwouldn't be happy.\n4:35\nThey wanted to hear plasma cell.\n4:36\nThis is the common term used in immunology and apparently\n4:44\nrheumatology circles.\n4:45\nDid I just say my wife is a hematologist?\n4:47\nNo, no.\n4:47\nShe's studying rheumatology.\n4:48\nI get confused with all the tologies sometimes.\n4:51\nAnyway, that's what the B cells do.\n4:52\nAnd these antibodies can then go attach things and mess up\n4:55\nviruses and antigen-- well, viruses or instances of\n4:58\nantigens and bacteria-- and tag them for pick up by\n5:02\nmacrophages or other types of phagocytes.\n5:04\nThose were the B cells.\n5:06\nThen you have your T cells.\n5:09\nAnd here I'm going to talk about T cells a little bit\n5:11\ndifferently than I had in the last few videos.\n5:14\nJust to give a little bit more of a nuance-- so there's two\n5:18\ntypes of T cells.\n5:19\nYou'll say, hey, they are helper T cells and cytotoxic T\n5:21\ncells-- and you're not wrong, but what I'm going to do is do\n5:24\na slightly different differentiation just so that\n5:28\nyou are familiar with these terms. So there's\n5:30\ntwo types of T cells.\n5:33\nAll T cells have T cell receptors.\n5:44\nBut they also have these other proteins on them and some of\n5:50\nthem have these proteins called-- CD4 proteins and some\n5:58\nof them have what's called CD8.\n6:09\nSo this one right here would be called a\n6:11\nCD8 positive T cell.\n6:15\nIt has the CD8 proteins on it.\n6:18\nAnd this would be called a CD4 positive T cell.\n6:23\nI've never used these words before.\n6:25\nYou're like, gee, where are these coming from?\n6:27\nNow, the CD4 receptor is the thing that wants to bind--\n6:32\nthis is the thing that helps to go to the MHC II complexes.\n6:38\nSo most CD4 T cells are helper T cells.\n6:45\nMost of the time-- and I want to make it very clear--\n6:47\nimmunology is a very-- I mean, this field, people are\n6:49\ndiscovering things on a regular basis.\n6:51\nSo people are still understanding these things and\n6:53\nthere's all sorts of special cases, but usually when people\n6:57\ntalk about CD4 positive T cells, they're talking about\n7:00\nhelper T cells.\n7:02\nSo this is normally going to be a helper T cell-- or you\n7:07\ncould call it T helper, just like that.\n7:10\nLikewise, the CD8 proteins, these are attracted\n7:13\nto the MHC I complex.\n7:21\nThis is what brings them to the cells that have the\n7:24\ncancer, that have expressed antigens\n7:26\non their MHC I complex.\n7:28\nSo most of the time CD8\n7:30\npositive T cells are cytotoxic.\n7:39\nAnd oftentimes, before a cell gets activated, they just\n7:42\ndescribe it as a CD4 T cell or a CD8 cell and after it\n7:45\nbecomes activated and starts wanting to kill things, then\n7:53\nmaybe you call it cytotoxic.\n7:54\nBut this is all wordplay.\n7:56\nI think you get the general idea.\n7:58\nBut just to remember what they do, this guy-- we just said he\n8:04\nwants to bond to the MHC complex, so you have MHC\n8:08\ncomplex plus presenting some antigen.\n8:13\nThis is MHC I right here.\n8:15\nWe learned in the last video, every nucleated cell in the\n8:19\nbody expresses an MHC I complex.\n8:22\nSo this is the case where something wacky is happening\n8:25\ninside this cell.\n8:26\nMaybe a virus has infected it.\n8:28\nMaybe it's cancerous.\n8:30\nIt needs to die, otherwise it's going to keep producing\n8:34\nviruses if it's infected by a virus, or otherwise it's going\n8:37\nto keep dividing if it's a cancer and infect\n8:39\nthe rest of the body.\n8:40\nSo the CD8 kills infected cells.\n8:45\nI'll just say bad cells because I don't if you can--\n8:48\ncancer really isn't an infection.\n8:50\nKills bad cells-- cells that are-- if you don't kill them,\n8:53\nthey're going to keep producing viruses or keep\n8:54\nsplitting and spreading the cancer, while T cells--\n9:00\nthey're attracted to professional antigen\n9:03\npresenting cells.\n9:04\nAnd I always do a dendritic cell right here because those\n9:06\nare the best antigen presenting cells.\n9:09\nAnd they have MHC II complexes and it's digested some antigen\n9:16\nand it presents it right there and then that activates the\n9:21\nhelper T cell.\n9:22\nAnd then when the helper T cell-- all of these guys, once\n9:26\nthey're activated, they all go into effector-- they all start\n9:31\ndifferentiating into effector and memory cells.\n9:35\nAn effector helper T cell does a couple of things.\n9:40\nSo if we're talking about a helper T cell, it can activate\n9:46\nB cells and it also releases cytokines.\n9:51\nLet's say this guy gets activated.\n9:53\nHe'll also start releasing these chemicals, which are\n9:56\nreally those alarm bells that tell other people to really\n10:00\nget in gear-- maybe B cells and cytotoxic T cells start\n10:03\nproliferating more rigorously.\n10:05\nActually, part of the cytotoxic T cell activation\n10:10\ncan be assisted or kind of given a boost by these\n10:14\ncytokines-- of so by these alarm bells.\n10:17\nSo this guy's the alarm ringer, while the CD8 cells or\n10:24\nthe cytotoxic T cells-- in their effector\n10:27\nmode, they kill cells.\n10:31\nAnd of course in the memory mode, there's just a bunch of\n10:33\ncopies of these originals around that are ready and more\n10:36\nthan they were originally were, so that in the future if\n10:39\nsomething like this or something like this occurs,\n10:41\nthey're going to be activated faster because they're going\n10:43\nto be bumped into faster.\n10:45\nSo hopefully that clears up a little bit and I introduced a\n10:47\nlittle bit more tough terminology, but I really want\n10:48\nto stress my wife's point because she said, hey, you\n10:50\ndon't want people out there saying B cells produce\n10:53\nantibodies even though it is effector B cells-- activated B\n10:57\ncells that have differentiated into effector B cells.\n10:59\nThose are what are producing antibodies-- because when they\n11:01\ngo to medical school, people are going to want to hear\n11:03\nplasma cell.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nVoiceover: Let's look at how to name aldehydes and ketones\n0:03\nAnd let's start with an aldehyde and just to refresh\n0:05\nyour memory about how to recognize an aldehyde\n0:07\nright there's a carbonyl present right.\n0:09\nA carbon double bonded to an oxygen\n0:11\nand there's an alkyl group on one side\n0:13\nand a hydrogen on the other side.\n0:16\nAnd so if we wanted to name this extremely\n0:17\nsimple molecule over here on the left,\n0:19\nright we know there are total of four carbons\n0:21\nand it's an alkane, so we call this \"butane.\"\n0:24\nSo if we look at a four-carbon aldehyde\n0:28\nright over here on the right so when you number\n0:31\nan aldehyde you want to make\n0:32\nyour carbonyl carbon number one.\n0:33\nSo, one, two, three and four.\n0:36\nSo we have a four-carbon aldehyde.\n0:38\nAnd what we're going to do is drop the E\n0:40\nand add \"-AL\" for aldehyde.\n0:42\nSo this would be \"Butanal,\" right.\n0:45\nSo a four-carbon aldehyde is \"butanal\"\n0:49\nwith an \"-AL\"ending like that.\n0:50\nLet's go ahead and look at some more examples.\n0:52\nSo once again we're going to number to give our\n0:55\ncarbonyl carbon the lowest number possible.\n0:58\nAnd the aldehyde is going to take priority\n1:01\nover things like double-bonds and alkyl groups\n1:05\nand halogens and so let's go ahead\n1:07\nand look at this one on the top left here.\n1:09\nAnd so we want to number to give our carbonyl carbon\n1:13\nthe lowest number possible so one, two,\n1:15\nthree, four and five.\n1:18\nAnd so we have a five-carbon aldehyde right.\n1:21\nWell a five-carbon alkane would be \"pentane.\"\n1:24\nSo if our five-carbon aldehyde would be \"pentanal\".\n1:27\nSo let's go ahead and write \"pentanal\" here.\n1:29\nSo \"pentanal.\"\n1:31\nAnd then we also have a substituent right\n1:34\nat carbon four, we have a bromine\n1:36\nso we have to go ahead and put that in.\n1:38\nSo a \"four-bromopentanal\" would be\n1:42\nthe iupac name for this molecule.\n1:44\nLet's do this one over here on the right.\n1:46\nAnd so once again we're going to number\n1:48\ngiving our carbonyl carbon the lowest number\n1:51\npossible so one, two, and three.\n1:54\nSo we have three-carbon aldehyde but this one has\n1:57\na double bond in it so a three-carbon aldehyde\n2:00\nwould be called a \"propanal\" but since we have\n2:02\na double bond present we're going to call it \"propenal.\"\n2:05\nAlright, so we have \"propenal\" here.\n2:07\nSo let's go ahead and write that.\n2:09\nSo, \"propenal.\"\n2:11\nAnd then the double bond starts at carbon two\n2:13\nright here so we can write \"two-propenal.\"\n2:16\nWe also have a phenyl group coming off of carbon three.\n2:20\nSo we can write \"three-phenyl,\" so \"three-phenyl\" in here.\n2:25\nAnd if you wanted to specify the stereochemistry\n2:27\nof the double bonds, right you think about hydrogen\n2:30\nbeing here and hydrogen being here.\n2:33\nAnd so when you think about this double bond here,\n2:35\nthe hydrogens are on opposite sides\n2:37\nso you can say that's their [trans] or you could use\n2:41\nthe easy system and your highest priority groups\n2:43\nare on opposite sides here, so this would be E.\n2:46\nSo go ahead and write E.\n2:48\nSo \"E three-phenyl two-propenal\" is one way\n2:51\nto name this molecule.\n2:53\nIt's kind of the old way of doing it.\n2:54\nIf you want to do it the newer way, you would write\n2:57\nE, and then you still have a phenyl group here\n3:00\nso \"three-phenyl\" and for the new way you would write\n3:06\n\"Prop\" and put the two in here so \"Prop-two-en\"\n3:11\nand then \"-al\".\n3:12\nSo once again the two specifies where the double-bond is\n3:14\nand you still have your \"-al\" ending.\n3:16\nAnd since this is the more modern way of doing it.\n3:19\nSo these are both iupac names for cinnamaldehyde.\n3:23\nSo this molecule here is actually cinnamaldehyde\n3:27\nwhich is the molecule that gives cinnamon it's smell.\n3:31\nSo this a fantastic smell, and you can steam distill\n3:34\ncinnamon bark and isolate this molecule\n3:37\nwhich is a great undergraduate organic chemistry\n3:39\nlab to do and so that's cinnamaldehyde.\n3:43\nAlright so another great smelling aldehyde over here\n3:46\non the left, is \"benzaldehyde.\"\n3:49\nSo here we have \"benzaldehyde.\"\n3:51\nWhich is such a common name that it's been\n3:53\nincorporated into iupac nomenclature\n3:56\nand benzaldehyde smells like almonds.\n3:59\nThis is another fantastic smell so labs\n4:02\nof benzaldehyde are a lot of fun too.\n4:05\nSo if you see benzaldehyde,\n4:07\nyou can use that in your iupac name.\n4:09\nAnd so if we look at it over here on the right\n4:11\nyou can see that benzaldehyde can form the base\n4:13\nfor the name for this molecule.\n4:14\nSo let's go ahead and write that over here.\n4:16\nSo we have \"benzaldehyde.\".\n4:20\nAnd then we're going to number to give\n4:23\nthis carbon on our ring, number one.\n4:26\nRight so we have two choices we can go around\n4:28\nthe ring clockwise or counterclockwise.\n4:31\nAnd we know we want to give the lowest number\n4:32\npossible to our substituents and so that would be\n4:35\nby going around clockwise.\n4:37\nSo let's do that, so two, three and then four.\n4:40\nSo we have two substituents, right.\n4:43\nWe have a methoxy substituent here at carbon three.\n4:47\nWe have a hydroxy substituent here at carbon four.\n4:50\nAnd so we need to put those into alphabetical order\n4:53\nso H comes before M and so we're going to start\n4:56\nwith the hydroxies, so let's,\n4:58\nhopefully we'll have enough room here.\n4:59\nSo \"four-hydroxy\" and then we have a \"three-methoxy\n5:08\n\"Benzaldehyde\" is the iupac name for vanillin.\n5:13\nSo vanillin of course is where\n5:16\nwe get our vanilla flavor from.\n5:18\nSo a fantastic vanilla smell so these are white crystals\n5:22\nwhich have an amazing vanilla scent to them.\n5:26\nSo also a lot of fun to do labs with.\n5:28\nAlright so a lot of aldehydes have nice smells to them.\n5:32\nLet's look at two more aldehydes.\n5:36\nAlright so let's look at the one on the left here right.\n5:38\nSo it's not benzaldehyde, we don't have benzene ring\n5:41\nhere anymore, we have a cyclohexene,\n5:43\nso this one is going to be called\n5:45\n\"cyclohexane carbaldehyde.\"\n5:49\nSo, \"cyclohexane carbaldehyde\"\n5:52\nis the iupac name for this.\n5:55\nSo, \"carbaldehyde.\"\n5:57\nAlright, let's look at this molecule over here\n5:59\non the right so this is two aldehydes\n6:02\nin the same molecule.\n6:04\nAlright so let's look at this, so it'll be\n6:06\none, two, three, four and five total carbons.\n6:11\nAnd so it's two aldehydes, so it's going to be\n6:13\n\"dial\" and it's five carbons total so it's going\n6:16\nto be \"pentane\", so we could write \"pentane.\"\n6:20\nWe could write \"pentanedial\" here.\n6:23\nAnd if you wanted to put where the numbers are,\n6:26\nso it'll be one, five, so you can put that in there.\n6:29\nSo \"one-five-pentanedial\" for two aldehydes.\n6:33\nAlright, let's look at ketone nomenclature next\n6:36\nand so just to remind you\n6:38\nof the general structure of ketones.\n6:40\nSo once again you have a carbonyl, a carbon\n6:43\ndouble bonded to an oxygen.\n6:44\nThis time you have two alkyler groups right,\n6:46\nso you have two alkyler groups here and they can\n6:50\nbe the same or they can be different right.\n6:51\nSo I can write \"R prime\" here\n6:53\nand either one would still be a ketone.\n6:57\nSo once again we looked at butane earlier,\n7:00\nso our four-carbon alkane, \"butane.\"\n7:04\nAnd what about if we had a four-carbon ketone?\n7:06\nSo this right here is a four-carbon ketone\n7:10\nso it wouldn't be butane it's an O N E ending.\n7:13\nIt's an \"-one\", so it would be \"butanone.\"\n7:15\nSo we're going to drop the E here and add O N E.\n7:19\nSo \"butanone.\"\n7:22\nThat gives us the iupac name for this molecule.\n7:25\nSo there's an old way of naming ketones which is\n7:29\nto think about the two alkyl groups, right.\n7:32\nSo let's go ahead and look at that.\n7:33\nThere's a methyl group on this side,\n7:35\nso let's go ahead and write \"methyl\" right here.\n7:38\nand then on this side there is an ethyl group.\n7:41\nright, two carbons so \"methylethyl\".\n7:44\nand then \"ketone\" gives you the structure\n7:47\nfor this molecule too, so \"methylethylketone\"\n7:50\nis kind of the old way of doing it.\n7:51\nAnd normally you would put the E before the M\n7:54\njust thinking about the alphabet but for this one\n7:57\nit doesn't really matter, everyone knows\n7:59\nwhat \"methylethylketone\" is, also abbreviated \"MEK.\"\n8:04\nSo naming the alkyl groups is an old way\n8:07\nof naming ketones which you will sometimes still see.\n8:11\nAlright so let's do another one here.\n8:13\nLet's look at a longer ketone so we want to number\n8:17\nto give the ketone, the carbonyl carbon lowest\n8:20\nnumber possible and so we start from the left.\n8:22\nAlright so one, two three, four, five and six.\n8:28\nSo we have a six-carbon ketone.\n8:32\nSo it's going to be \"hexanone.\"\n8:34\nSo let's go ahead and write that.\n8:35\nSo this would be \"hexanone\".\n8:37\nAnd we need to identify where the ketone is this time.\n8:40\nSo, it's on carbon three here, so for longer molecules\n8:46\nit's important to specify where it is.\n8:48\nSo it would be three-hexanone\n8:50\nis one the ways to name this molecule.\n8:52\nAgain this is kind of the old way of doing it.\n8:54\nSo the newer way would be to write for this one,\n8:58\n\"hexan-three-one\".\n9:02\nAnd if you wanted to use the alkyl way of naming\n9:04\nthis molecule, you could say this is an ethyl.\n9:08\nSo you're gonna write \"ethyl\" here, so \"ethyl.\"\n9:11\nand on this side a three-carbonyl alkyl group is \"propyl.\"\n9:14\nSo \"ethylpropylketone\" is just another way to name it.\n9:22\nSo several names for the same molecule.\n9:25\nAlright ketones take priority over things like double\n9:28\nbonds and alkyl groups and halogens once again.\n9:30\nSo if you look at this molecule you want to number\n9:32\nto give your ketone the lowest number possible\n9:34\nand not your double bond so we're going to start\n9:36\nfrom the left again so one, two, three, four, five and six.\n9:44\nSo we have a six-carbon ketone.\n9:47\nSo that would be \"hexanone\" but we have a double\n9:49\nbond present so it's going to be \"hexenone\"\n9:53\nSo we have \"hexenone\" as thinking\n9:55\nabout our base name here.\n9:56\nAnd once again two ways to think about naming it\n9:59\nright, so I can do \"hexenone\", so \"hexene\"\n10:04\nand then we have our ketone, carbon-two.\n10:07\nSo \"hexene-two-one\" so the two goes with the \"-one\",\n10:10\nto tell you where the ketone is.\n10:12\nAnd then the double bond\n10:13\nstarts at carbon-four right here so,\n10:15\n\"four hexene-two-one.\"\n10:18\nIf you want to specify the stereochemistry\n10:21\nof the double bonds, so once again\n10:22\nyou have the hydrogens on opposite sides\n10:24\nso that would be trans or E, right.\n10:27\nSo you could just write \"E\" here.\n10:28\nSo \"E-four-hexene-two-one\" is one way to name this.\n10:32\nAgain, kind of the old way of doing it.\n10:34\nIf you wanted to name it another way,\n10:37\nYou could write \"E\" and then you can write \"hex,\"\n10:42\nand then \"four-ene\", so once again the four\n10:44\nis going with the \"-ene\" part telling you where the double\n10:47\nbond is and then you have the \"two-one\" as well.\n10:50\nSo whichever way you prefer.\n10:53\nAlright, so let's look at two more examples here,\n10:57\nfor nomenclature of ketones.\n11:00\nSo what if you have a ketone in a cyclic molecule here?\n11:03\nSo if I just, if I think about what I have,\n11:08\nit would be \"cyclohexane\", but I have a ketone\n11:10\nin my ring so it would be \"cyclohexanone.\"\n11:14\nSo let's go ahead and write that.\n11:15\nSo, \"cyclohexanone\" indicating we have\n11:21\na ketone present and so we know the ketones\n11:24\ntake priority over alkyl groups so we're going\n11:26\nto give this carbon a number one on our ring.\n11:29\nAnd we're going to choose to around clockwise\n11:30\nbecause that gives the lowest number to our alkyl group.\n11:33\nSo we go two and three.\n11:35\nAnd so we have a methyl group at carbon three.\n11:37\nSo it'd be \"three-methylcyclohexanone\"\n11:42\nas the iupac name.\n11:44\nAlright, and then finally what happens if you\n11:46\nhave two ketones in the same molecule here?\n11:49\nSo we want to give the lowest number possible\n11:52\nso we start numbering from the left side\n11:54\nso one, two, three, four, five and six.\n11:59\nSo we have two ketones, so that's going\n12:01\nto be a \"dione.\"\n12:02\nSo one way to name it would be to say\n12:05\nwell it will be, \"hexane\" and then we have\n12:06\ntwo ketones, right, so \"dione\".\n12:09\nSo \"hexanedione,\" the ketones are at two and four\n12:12\nthe carbonyl carbons are at two and four.\n12:14\nSo \"two-four-hexanedione\" is one way to do it.\n12:19\nAnd of course you can also do it the more modern way,\n12:22\nyou can just write \"hexane\" right,\n12:24\nand then after hexane, so hexane [as I've] told you\n12:27\nsix carbons, so you could write\n12:28\n\"two-four-dione\"\n12:32\nAlright so that's it for nomenclature\n12:34\nof aldehydes and ketones.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:02\nI want to figure out how blood gets from my heart, which\n0:05\nI'm going to draw here, all the way to my toe.\n0:08\nAnd I'm going to draw my foot over here and show you\n0:11\nwhich toe I'm talking about.\n0:13\nLet's say this toe right here.\n0:16\nNow, to start the journey, it's going\n0:19\nto have to go out of the left ventricle\n0:20\nand into the largest artery of the body.\n0:24\nThis is going to be the aorta.\n0:25\nAnd the aorta is very, very wide across.\n0:29\nAnd that's why I say it's a large artery.\n0:31\nAnd from the aorta-- I'm actually\n0:34\nnot drawing all the branches of the aorta.\n0:35\nBut from the aorta, it's going to go down into my belly.\n0:39\nAnd it's going to branch towards my left leg and my right leg.\n0:45\nSo let's say we follow just the left leg.\n0:48\nSo this artery over here on the top,\n0:50\nit's going to get a little bit smaller.\n0:52\nAnd maybe I'd call this a medium-sized artery\n0:55\nby this point.\n0:56\nThis is actually now getting down towards my ankle.\n1:00\nLet's say we've gone quite a distance down in my ankle.\n1:04\nAnd then there are, of course, little branches.\n1:06\nAnd let's just follow the branch that\n1:08\ngoes towards my foot, which is this top one.\n1:10\nLet's say this one goes towards my foot,\n1:12\nand this is going to be now an even smaller artery.\n1:15\nLet's call it small artery.\n1:20\nFrom there, we're actually going to get\n1:23\ninto what we call arterioles, so it's going to get even tinier.\n1:27\nIt's going to branch.\n1:28\nNow, these are very, very tiny branches\n1:31\ncoming off my small artery.\n1:33\nAnd let's follow this one right here,\n1:34\nand this one is my arteriole.\n1:38\nSo these are all the different branches I have to go through.\n1:42\nAnd finally, I'm going to get into tiny little branches.\n1:46\nI'm going to have to draw them very, very skinny\n1:48\njust to convince you that we're getting smaller and smaller.\n1:51\nLet me draw three of them.\n1:53\nNo.\n1:53\nLet's draw four just for fun.\n1:57\nAnd this is actually going to now get\n1:59\ntowards my little toe cells.\n2:01\nSo let me draw some toes cells in here\n2:03\nto convince you that I actually have gotten there.\n2:05\nLet's say one, two over here, and maybe one over here.\n2:09\nThese are my toes cells.\n2:12\nAnd after the toe cells have kind of\n2:14\ntaken out whatever they need-- maybe they need glucose\n2:17\nor maybe they need some oxygen.\n2:19\nWhatever they've taken out, they're\n2:22\nalso going to put in their waste.\n2:24\nSo they have, of course, some carbon dioxide\n2:25\nwaste that we need to drag back.\n2:29\nThis is now going to dump into what we call a venule.\n2:34\nAnd this venule is going to basically then feed\n2:37\ninto many, many other venules.\n2:38\nMaybe there's a venule down here coming in,\n2:41\nand maybe a venule up here coming in maybe\n2:43\nfrom the second toe.\n2:45\nAnd it's going to basically all kind of gather\n2:47\ntogether, and again, to a giant, giant set of veins.\n2:50\nMaybe veins are dumping in here now, maybe another vein\n2:53\ndumping in here.\n2:55\nAnd these veins are all going to dump into an enormous vein\n2:58\nthat we call the inferior vena cava.\n3:01\nI'll write that right here, inferior vena cava.\n3:06\nAnd this is the large vein that brings back all the blood\n3:10\nfrom the bottom half of the body.\n3:12\nThere's also another one over here called the superior vena\n3:15\ncava, and this is bringing back blood from the arms and head.\n3:20\nSo these two veins, the superior vena cava and the inferior vena\n3:23\ncava, are dragging the blood back to the heart.\n3:26\nAnd generally speaking, these are all\n3:28\nconsidered, of course, veins.\n3:30\nLet's back up now and start with the large and medium arteries.\n3:33\nThese guys together are sometimes\n3:36\nreferred to as elastic arteries.\n3:40\nAnd the reason they're called elastic arteries, one\n3:43\nof the good reasons why they're called\n3:45\nthat is that they have a protein in the walls of the blood\n3:48\nvessel called elastin.\n3:49\nThey have a lot of this elastin protein.\n3:53\nAnd if you think about the word elastin or elastic-- obviously\n3:57\nvery similar words-- you might think of something\n4:00\nlike a rubber band or a balloon.\n4:02\nAnd that's probably the easiest way to think about it.\n4:04\nIf you have a blood vessel, one of these large arteries,\n4:07\nfor example, and let's say blood is under a lot of pressure\n4:12\nbecause the heart is squeezing out a lot of high pressure\n4:16\nblood, this artery is literally going to balloon out.\n4:19\nAnd if you actually looked at it from the outside,\n4:22\nit would look like a little sausage, something\n4:24\nlike this where it's puffed out.\n4:26\nSo what's happened there between the first and second picture\n4:31\nis that the pressure energy-- so the heart\n4:34\nis squeezing out a lot of pressurized blood.\n4:36\nAnd, of course, there's energy in that blood.\n4:39\nThat pressure energy has been converted over\n4:42\ninto elastic energy.\n4:44\nIt's actually converting energy.\n4:46\nWe don't really always think about it that way,\n4:47\nbut that's exactly what's happening.\n4:49\nAnd when you convert from pressure energy\n4:51\nto elastic energy, what you're really then doing\n4:54\nis you're balancing out those high pressures.\n4:57\nSo you're balancing out high pressures.\n5:02\nAnd this is actually very important,\n5:03\nbecause the blood that's coming into our arteries\n5:07\nis under, let's not forget, high pressure.\n5:10\nSo the arterial system we know is a high-pressure system.\n5:14\nSo this makes perfect sense that the first few arteries,\n5:17\nthose large arteries and even those medium-sized arteries,\n5:21\nare going to be able to deal with the pressure really well.\n5:23\nNow, let me draw a little line here just to keep it straight.\n5:26\nThe small artery and the arteriole,\n5:29\nthese two are actually sometimes called the muscular arteries.\n5:35\nAnd the reason, again, if you just\n5:37\nwant to look at the wall of the artery, you'll get the answer.\n5:42\nThe wall of the artery is actually very muscular.\n5:45\nIn fact, specifically, it's smooth muscle.\n5:48\nSo not the kind of muscle you have in your heart\n5:50\nor in your biceps, but this is smooth muscle\n5:54\nthat's in the wall of the artery.\n5:56\nAnd there's lots of it.\n5:57\nSo again, if you have a little blood vessel like this,\n6:00\nif you imagine tons and tons of smooth muscle on the outside--\n6:03\nso let's draw it like this, little bands of smooth muscle.\n6:07\nIf those bands decide that they want to contract down,\n6:10\nthat they want to squeeze down, you're\n6:11\ngoing to get something that looks like a little straw,\n6:14\nbecause those muscles are now tight.\n6:16\nThey're tightly wound, so you're going\n6:19\nto create like a little straw.\n6:20\nAnd this process is called vasoconstriction.\n6:24\nVaso just means blood vessel.\n6:25\nAnd constriction is kind of tightening down.\n6:29\nSo vasoconstriction, tightening down of the blood vessel.\n6:32\nAnd what that does is it increases resistance.\n6:36\nJust like if you're trying to blow\n6:37\nthrough a tiny, tiny little straw,\n6:40\nthere's a lot of resistance.\n6:41\nWell, it's the same idea here.\n6:43\nAnd actually, a lot of that resistance and change\n6:46\nin the vasoconstriction is happening\n6:49\nat the arteriole level.\n6:51\nSo that's why they're very special\n6:52\nand I want you to remember them.\n6:54\nFrom there, blood is going to go through the capillaries.\n6:56\nI didn't actually label them the first time,\n6:57\nbut let me just write that here.\n6:59\nSome, as they call them, capillary beds.\n7:02\nI'll write that out.\n7:03\nAnd then it's going to go and get collected in the venules\n7:06\nand eventually into the veins.\n7:07\nAnd the important thing about the veins--\n7:09\nI'm going to stop right here and just\n7:11\ntalk about it very briefly-- is that they\n7:13\nhave these little valves.\n7:14\nAnd these valves make sure that the blood continues\n7:16\nto flow in one direction.\n7:19\nSo one important thing here is the valves.\n7:22\nAnd remember, the other important thing\n7:24\nis that they are able to deal with large volumes.\n7:27\nSo unlike the arterial side where\n7:29\nit was all about large pressure, down here with the vein side,\n7:33\nwe have to think about large volumes.\n7:34\nRemember about 2/3 of your blood at any point in time\n7:38\nis sitting in some vein or venule somewhere.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\n- [Voiceover] Ok, so let's say you have some kind of letter\n0:04\nthat you wanna, that you wanna deliver, right?\n0:05\nSo you have a letter that's in your mailbox,\n0:07\nand let's say that this is the sender of the letter, right?\n0:11\nAnd so the sender of that letter is gonna deliver that mail\n0:14\nall the way over here to the recipient, right?\n0:16\nAnd the way that they're gonna do that is you're gonna have\n0:18\nthis mailman in this truck deliver it from the sender\n0:23\nto the recipient, and they're gonna drive along this road.\n0:26\nBut then let's say something happens.\n0:28\nLet's say, for some reason, an earthquake happens, right?\n0:31\nAnd the earthquake actually destroys the road over here.\n0:34\nAnd so now, the mailman can't really get to\n0:35\nwhere they need to go anymore, right?\n0:37\nBecause the road has been damaged.\n0:39\nSo why am I giving this extremely hypothetical scenario?\n0:42\nWell I think that it serves as a pretty good analogy\n0:44\ntowards understanding a disease called Multiple Sclerosis.\n0:49\nSo Multiple Sclerosis is a disease of the brain.\n0:51\nAnd more specifically, it affects the communication\n0:54\nwithin the brain.\n0:55\nSo what do I mean by communication in the brain?\n0:57\nWell in the brain, you have all these neurons, right?\n1:00\nYou have all these neurons that are constantly talking\n1:02\nto each other, kinda like these two neurons over here.\n1:04\nAnd so this neuron is going to send an electrical signal\n1:07\ndown the length of a diaxon.\n1:09\nAnd that electrical signal is in the form\n1:11\nof an action potential.\n1:12\nAnd so to improve the efficiency of the communication,\n1:14\nyou have this stuff that kind of insulates the axon,\n1:16\nso, this stuff that I've drawn here in red\n1:18\nis called myelin.\n1:20\nAnd it really just makes the action potential\n1:22\nmove down the axon much more quickly.\n1:24\nSo we can actually kind of compare this\n1:27\ntwo-way communication system, right, with our mailman.\n1:30\nSo, you know we have kind of the sender of the message,\n1:32\nthat would be the first neuron,\n1:35\nwe have the message, that would be\n1:37\nkind of like the action potential,\n1:38\nwe have the road, which would be, you know,\n1:40\nthe myelin and the axon together,\n1:43\nand we have the recipient.\n1:45\nNow, in our analogy, we had an earthquake\n1:47\nthat actually destroyed the road somehow.\n1:49\nSo, in Multiple Sclerosis, what happens is, well,\n1:52\nyou get destruction of the road, and more specifically,\n1:54\nyou get a degradation of the myelin.\n1:58\nAnd so because there's degradation of the myelin,\n2:00\nwe can call Multiple Sclerosis a Demyelinating Disease.\n2:04\nSo this is really where that disruption\n2:05\nin the communication goes on, right?\n2:07\nAnd when the myelin is degraded, the action potential\n2:10\nwon't really travel down the axon as quickly anymore,\n2:14\nand sometimes it may not even travel down to begin with.\n2:16\nSo what's causing that degradation?\n2:18\nWell as it turns out, in Multiple Sclerosis,\n2:20\nthe immune system actually sneaks its way into the brain,\n2:25\nand when the immune system sneaks its way into the brain,\n2:27\nfor some reason it mistakenly recognizes that myelin,\n2:31\nright, this myelin over here, as foreign.\n2:34\nAnd when it mistakenly recognizes it as foreign,\n2:36\nit starts to attack the myelin, hence this degradation.\n2:40\nAnd because the immune system is attacking the body itself,\n2:43\nwe call Multiple Sclerosis an Autoimmune Disease as well.\n2:47\nSo that's kind of a cellular perspective\n2:48\non Multiple Sclerosis, but now I kind of want to give you\n2:51\na more macroscopic perspective\n2:53\non what the disease does to the brain, right?\n2:56\nSo let me clear up some space over here.\n2:59\nAnd let me actually show you now two different brains.\n3:02\nSo this is just really a brain scan,\n3:04\nor two different brain scans of, well,\n3:06\ntwo different brains.\n3:07\nSo on the left, we have a perfectly healthy brain.\n3:09\nAnd on the right, we have the brain of someone\n3:12\nwho's suffering from Multiple Sclerosis.\n3:15\nImmediately on the right brain you can tell\n3:16\nthat you have these bright spots over here, right,\n3:19\ncalled Plaques.\n3:20\nSo Plaque is also really referred to as a Lesion.\n3:23\nAnd a Lesion is really just a piece of tissue\n3:25\nthat's been damaged.\n3:26\nSo let's say, for example, you know,\n3:27\nyou have a hand over here,\n3:29\nyou know, maybe you get a cut on your hand somehow.\n3:32\nRight, you can call that cut kind of a Lesion of the skin.\n3:36\nIn Multiple Sclerosis you have a Lesion in the brain, right?\n3:39\nAnd those Lesions are really coming from the damaged myelin\n3:42\nfrom the immune system.\n3:44\nSo what happens is, you have all these immune cells\n3:47\nthat kind of come together, right, they kind of\n3:50\ncluster around certain parts of the brain,\n3:52\nand they attack it.\n3:54\nAnd when you have a whole bunch of immune cells\n3:55\ncoming together to attack a certain part of the body,\n3:58\nwe call this Inflammation, and because it's happening\n4:00\nin the brain, we call it Neuroinflammation.\n4:03\nNow, the condition in which you have these Lesions,\n4:06\nin the brain, is called Sclerosis.\n4:08\nIn the case of Multiple Sclerosis, you have multiple Lesions\n4:12\nhence why we call it Multiple Sclerosis.\n4:15\nNow notice how you're getting these Lesions\n4:16\nin different parts of the brain, ok.\n4:18\nDifferent parts of the brain are gonna be responsible\n4:20\nfor different functions.\n4:22\nSome may be responsible for Vision,\n4:24\nothers may be responsible for Cognition,\n4:27\nfor moving around, for Movement, for Touch,\n4:32\nand so on and so forth.\n4:34\nAnd depending on where these Lesions form in the brain,\n4:36\nyou can get a variety of different symptoms\n4:37\nthat can affect all of these functions.\n4:40\nNow, why do these Lesions form?\n4:41\nWhy does the immune system attack the brain?\n4:44\nThe problem is that we don't actually know.\n4:46\nWe're not really sure with 100% certainty\n4:48\nwhat causes Multiple Sclerosis.\n4:51\nAll we know is that some people may have\n4:53\na kind of Genetic Predisposition\n4:55\ntowards developing the disease,\n4:58\nand that there are also probably some\n4:59\nEnvironmental Factors that may be involved as well.\n5:02\nAnd the fact of the matter is that your genetics\n5:06\ncan really interact with the environment,\n5:08\nand that can kinda stimulate the progression of the disease.\n5:11\nNow the exact types of genes that are involved,\n5:13\nand the exact types of Environmental Factors\n5:15\nthat may be involved will be a talk that I'll cover\n5:17\nin a later video, but for now this is really\n5:19\nall that we know about the causes of Multiple Sclerosis.\n5:23\nNow even though we don't really know perfectly\n5:26\nwhat causes Multiple Sclerosis, we do know\n5:28\nwho is more likely to develop the disease.\n5:30\nSo I'm gonna actually clear up some more space here again.\n5:33\nAnd so now I'm gonna show you a picture of the earth.\n5:35\nAnd the reason is because I wanna give you\n5:36\na global perspective on, you know, the prevalence,\n5:39\nand the incidence of Multiple Sclerosis.\n5:41\nSo the disease affects about 2.5 million people worldwide.\n5:46\nNow, is everyone on the planet equally likely\n5:48\nto develop the disease?\n5:50\nWell, no.\n5:50\nAs it turns out, if you move north from the equator, right,\n5:54\nso if you move north from here,\n5:55\nyou'll notice that the incidence of MS actually increases.\n5:59\nAnd the incidence is actually pretty high, you know,\n6:01\nin these northern areas, right, so here in Canada,\n6:04\nand in the northern United States, and here\n6:07\nin a lot of Europe and Russia as well.\n6:10\nSo it often affects Caucasians more than other races.\n6:14\nAnd more specifically among the Caucasians,\n6:16\nit affects people of Northern European Descent more often.\n6:20\nThe disease is also more common in women than it is in men.\n6:25\nRight, and it's thought that of the 2.5 million people\n6:27\nworldwide about two thirds of them are women.\n6:31\nSo 66% of them are women.\n6:33\nSo what age do people start to develop MS?\n6:35\nIt's usually in the age range of 20 to 50 years old.\n6:40\nAnd it's usually on the earlier end of that spectrum.\n6:42\nAnd lastly, one thing that I really want to emphasize\n6:45\nis that the disease itself is NOT FATAL.\n6:49\nSo the disease itself won't actually kill you, right,\n6:51\nbut the Life expectancy is a bit lower.\n6:54\nAnd it's thought to be lowered by about, you know,\n6:56\na few months to a few years.\n6:57\nNow even though it's not fatal, the disease itself\n7:00\nis quite debilitating, and it can really affect\n7:02\nthe person's lifestyle through a number of different\n7:04\nsigns and symptoms, and that'll be a topic\n7:06\nthat I'll cover in the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the videos on massive stars and on black holes,\n0:04\nwe learned that if the remnant of a star, of a massive star,\n0:08\nis massive enough, the gravitational contraction,\n0:12\nthe gravitational force, will be stronger\n0:15\nthan even the electron degeneracy pressure,\n0:18\neven stronger than the neutron degeneracy pressure,\n0:20\neven stronger than the quark degeneracy pressure.\n0:23\nAnd everything would collapse into a point.\n0:27\nAnd we called these points black holes.\n0:32\nAnd we learned there's an event horizon\n0:34\naround these black holes.\n0:36\nAnd if anything gets closer or goes\n0:37\nwithin the boundary of that event horizon,\n0:40\nthere's no way that it can never escape from the black hole.\n0:43\nAll it can do is get closer and closer to the black hole.\n0:46\nAnd that includes light.\n0:47\nAnd that's why it's called a black hole.\n0:49\nSo even though all of the mass is\n0:50\nat the central point, this entire area,\n0:53\nor the entire surface of the event horizon,\n0:57\nthis entire surface of the event horizon--\n0:59\nI'll do it in purple because it's\n1:01\nsupposed to be black-- this entire thing will appear black.\n1:06\nIt will emit no light.\n1:08\nNow these type of black holes that we described,\n1:11\nwe call those stellar black holes.\n1:16\nAnd that's because they're formed\n1:17\nfrom collapsing massive stars.\n1:20\nAnd the largest stellar black holes that we have observed\n1:24\nare on the order of 33 solar masses, give or take.\n1:30\nSo very massive to begin with, let's just be clear.\n1:33\nAnd this is what the remnant of the star has to be.\n1:35\nSo a lot more of the original star's mass\n1:37\nmight have been pushed off in supernovae.\n1:41\nThat's plural of supernova.\n1:42\nNow there's another class of black holes here\n1:45\nand these are somewhat mysterious.\n1:47\nAnd they're called supermassive black holes.\n1:56\nAnd to some degree, the word \"super\"\n1:58\nisn't big enough, supermassive black holes,\n2:01\nbecause they're not just a little bit more massive\n2:04\nthan stellar black holes.\n2:05\nThey're are a lot more massive.\n2:07\nThey're on the order of hundreds of thousands\n2:12\nto billions of solar masses, hundred thousands to billions\n2:21\ntimes the mass of our Sun, solar masses.\n2:24\nAnd what's interesting about these, other than the fact\n2:26\nthat there are super huge, is that there\n2:28\ndoesn't seem to be black holes in between or at least\n2:31\nwe haven't observed black holes in between.\n2:33\nThe largest stellar black hole is 33 solar masses.\n2:36\nAnd then there are these supermassive black holes\n2:39\nthat we think exist.\n2:40\nAnd we think they mainly exist in the centers of galaxies.\n2:44\nAnd we think most, if not all, centers of galaxies\n2:47\nactually have one of these supermassive black holes.\n2:50\nBut it's kind of an interesting question,\n2:52\nif all black holes were formed from collapsing stars,\n2:55\nwouldn't we see things in between?\n2:57\nSo one theory of how these really massive black holes form\n3:02\nis that you have a regular stellar black hole\n3:04\nin an area that has a lot of matter\n3:06\nthat it can accrete around it.\n3:09\nSo I'll draw the-- this is the event horizon around it.\n3:12\nThe actual black hole is going to be in the center of it,\n3:14\nor rather the mass of the black hole\n3:16\nwill be in the center of it.\n3:17\nAnd then over time, you have just more and more mass just\n3:21\nfalling into this black hole.\n3:23\nJust more and more stuff just keeps\n3:24\nfalling into this black hole.\n3:26\nAnd then it just keeps growing.\n3:30\nAnd so this could be a plausible reason, or at least the mass\n3:34\nin the center keeps growing and so the event horizon will also\n3:37\nkeep growing in radius.\n3:39\nNow this is a plausible explanation\n3:40\nbased on our current understanding.\n3:42\nBut the reason why this one doesn't\n3:43\ngel that well is if this was the explanation\n3:47\nfor supermassive black holes, you\n3:49\nexpect to see more black holes in between,\n3:52\nmaybe black holes with 100 solar masses,\n3:54\nor a 1,000 solar masses, or 10,000 solar masses.\n3:57\nBut we're not seeing those right now.\n3:59\nWe just see the stellar black holes,\n4:01\nand we see the supermassive black holes.\n4:03\nSo another possible explanation--\n4:07\nmy inclinations lean towards this one\n4:09\nbecause it kind of explains the gap--\n4:11\nis that these supermassive black holes actually formed shortly\n4:15\nafter the Big Bang, that these are primordial black holes.\n4:19\nThese started near the beginning of our universe,\n4:24\nprimordial black holes.\n4:26\nNow remember, what do you need to have a black hole?\n4:29\nYou need to have an amazingly dense amount of matter\n4:33\nor a dense amount of mass.\n4:35\nIf you have a lot of mass in a very small volume,\n4:38\nthen their gravitational pull will\n4:40\npull them closer, and closer, and closer together.\n4:42\nAnd they'll be able to overcome all\n4:44\nof the electron degeneracy pressures,\n4:48\nand the neutron degeneracy pressures,\n4:49\nand the quark degeneracy pressures,\n4:51\nto really collapse into what we think is a single point.\n4:55\nI want to be clear here, too.\n4:56\nWe don't know it's a single point.\n4:57\nWe've never gone into the center of a black hole.\n5:00\nJust the mathematics of the black holes, or at least\n5:02\nas we understand it right now, have everything colliding\n5:05\ninto a single point where the math starts to break down.\n5:08\nSo we're really not sure what happens\n5:10\nat that very small center point.\n5:13\nBut needless to say, it will be an unbelievably, maybe\n5:16\ninfinite, maybe almost infinitely,\n5:18\ndense point in space, or dense amount of matter.\n5:23\nAnd the reason why I kind of favor\n5:24\nthis primordial black hole and why this would make sense\n5:27\nis right after the formation of the universe, all\n5:30\nof the matter in the universe was in a much denser space\n5:35\nbecause the universe was smaller.\n5:36\nSo let's say that this is right after the Big\n5:38\nBang, some period of time after the Big Bang.\n5:41\nNow what we've talked about before when\n5:43\nwe talked about cosmic background is that\n5:45\nat that point, the universe was relatively uniform.\n5:49\nIt was super, super dense but it was relatively uniform.\n5:53\nSo a universe like this, there's no reason\n5:55\nwhy anything would collapse into black holes.\n5:57\nBecause if you look at a point here,\n5:59\nsure, there's a ton of mass very close to it.\n6:02\nBut it's very close to it in every direction.\n6:04\nSo the gravitational force would be the same in every direction\n6:09\nif it was completely uniform.\n6:11\nBut if you go shortly after the Big Bang, maybe because\n6:13\nof slight quantum fluctuation effects,\n6:15\nit becomes slightly nonuniform.\n6:18\nSo let's say it becomes slightly nonuniform,\n6:21\nbut it still is unbelievably dense.\n6:24\nSo let's say it looks something like this, where you have areas\n6:27\nthat are denser, but it's slightly nonuniform,\n6:31\nbut extremely dense.\n6:35\nSo here, all of a sudden, you have the type\n6:36\nof densities necessary for a black hole.\n6:39\nAnd where you have higher densities,\n6:42\nwhere it's less uniform, here, all of a sudden,\n6:44\nyou will have inward force.\n6:46\nThe gravitational pull from things outside of this area\n6:49\nare going to be less than the gravitational pull\n6:51\ntowards those areas.\n6:54\nAnd the more things get pulled towards it, the less uniform\n6:58\nit's going to get.\n6:59\nSo you could imagine in that primordial universe,\n7:01\nthat very shortly after the Big Bang\n7:04\nwhen things were very dense and closely packed together,\n7:09\nwe may have had the conditions where\n7:11\nthese supermassive black holes could have formed.\n7:13\nWhere we had so much mass in such a small volume,\n7:16\nand it was just not uniform enough,\n7:18\nso that you could kind of have this snowballing effect,\n7:21\nso that more and more mass would collect\n7:24\ninto these supermassive black holes that\n7:29\nare hundreds of thousands to billions of times the mass\n7:32\nof the Sun.\n7:33\nAnd, this is maybe even the more interesting part,\n7:35\nthose black holes would become the centers of future galaxies.\n7:41\nSo you have these black holes forming,\n7:42\nthese supermassive black holes forming.\n7:45\nAnd not everything would go into a black hole.\n7:48\nOnly if it didn't have a lot of angular velocity,\n7:53\nthen it might go into the black hole.\n7:55\nBut if it's going pass it fast enough,\n7:56\nit'll just start going in orbit around the black hole.\n7:58\nAnd so you could imagine that this\n8:00\nis how the early galaxies or even our galaxy formed.\n8:03\nAnd so you might be wondering, well,\n8:06\nwhat about the black hole at the center of the Milky Way?\n8:08\nAnd we think there is one.\n8:10\nWe think there is one because we've\n8:11\nobserved stars orbiting very quickly around something\n8:17\nat the center of the universe-- sorry,\n8:19\nat the center of our Milky Way.\n8:21\nI want to be very clear, not at the center of the universe.\n8:23\nAnd the only plausible explanation\n8:25\nfor it orbiting so quickly around something\n8:29\nis that it has to have a density of either a black hole\n8:33\nor something that will eventually\n8:34\nturn into a black hole.\n8:35\nAnd when you do the math for the middle\n8:37\nof our galaxy, the center of the Milky Way,\n8:40\nour supermassive black hole is on the order of 4 million times\n8:44\nthe mass of the Sun.\n8:49\nSo hopefully that gives you a little bit of food for thought.\n8:52\nThere aren't just only stellar collapsed black holes.\n8:54\nOr maybe there are and somehow they\n8:56\ngrow into supermassive black holes\n8:57\nand that everything in between we just can't observe.\n8:59\nOr that they really are a different class of black holes.\n9:02\nThey're actually formed different ways.\n9:04\nMaybe they formed near the beginning\n9:06\nof the actual universe.\n9:08\nWhen the density of things was a little uniform,\n9:11\nthings condensed into each other.\n9:12\nAnd what we're going to talk about in the next video\n9:15\nis how these supermassive black holes can help generate\n9:19\nunbelievable sources of radiation,\n9:21\neven though the black holes themselves\n9:23\naren't emitting them.\n9:24\nAnd those are going to be quasars.",

    "question_type": "MCQ",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the last video we defined internal energy as literally\n0:04\nall the energy that's in a system.\n0:06\nThat's kind of the most inclusive version,\n0:08\nat least in my head.\n0:09\nSo that's my system, it's some type of container.\n0:11\nAnd I have a bunch of particles in here.\n0:15\nIt's literally the sum of the kinetic energies\n0:17\nof all these particles.\n0:18\nIf they had potential energies, we'd\n0:20\nthrow that in there.\n0:21\nIf they have electrical potential, we'd\n0:23\nthrow that in there.\n0:24\nIf they have bonds with each other, the energies in that\n0:27\nbond, we would throw it in there.\n0:28\nIt's everything.\n0:29\nIt's all inclusive.\n0:31\nAnd, I told you in the last video it's unintuitive that U\n0:34\nstands for internal energy.\n0:35\nBut I kind of think that, you know, U, it contains the\n0:37\nuniverse of energy.\n0:39\nYou know, that's just for me to memorize it.\n0:40\nDon't think too deeply into what I just said.\n0:43\nBut this is internal energy.\n0:46\nIf you show me a system, it has some internal energy.\n0:52\nIt's a function of its state.\n0:53\nI don't care how it got to that state, but if you told me\n0:57\na system at a certain state, maybe with a certain pressure,\n0:59\nor a certain volume, or at a certain temperature-- although\n1:02\nif you give me pressure and volume that should be enough--\n1:04\nI can tell you what its internal energy is.\n1:06\nEspecially if you tell me the type of molecule I have, and\n1:08\nthings like that.\n1:09\nNow we also said in the last video that because internal\n1:12\nenergy is all the energy in the system, it can't be\n1:16\nrandomly created or destroyed.\n1:18\nIt can just be transformed from one form to another.\n1:23\nSo if I have a change in internal energy, it can only\n1:28\nbe due to-- well, it can be due to more than what I'm\n1:31\ndescribing.\n1:31\nBut in our simple world where all of the energy in a\n1:34\nsystem-- and maybe we're dealing with gases, because\n1:36\nthat's normally what you deal with in a first-year chemistry\n1:39\ncourse-- it's going to be the heat that could be added to\n1:42\nthe system, plus the work done on the system.\n1:48\nAnd like I said in the last video, sometimes they'll say,\n1:50\ninstead of plus the work done on the system, sometimes\n1:53\nthey'll say, minus the work that the system does.\n1:57\nEither way.\n1:57\nAnd here I just want to make another side discussion here,\n2:02\nbecause I decided to write it without the\n2:04\nlittle deltas here.\n2:05\nAnd the reason why I did that is if you were to write this\n2:08\nequation, which you will see, you'll see it in textbooks,\n2:10\nteachers will do it-- nothing inherently criminal about\n2:13\nthat-- but I just do that because it clears in my mind\n2:17\nwhat heat and what work are relative to internal energy.\n2:20\nIf I were to write delta U is equal to heat delta Q plus\n2:31\ndelta W to me this implies that at some point I had some\n2:38\namount of heat in my system, and then I have a different\n2:41\namount of heat in my system, and I took the difference\n2:43\nbetween the two and I got a change in heat.\n2:46\nSo this implies that heat is somehow an inherent macrostate\n2:51\nof the system, and that's not the case.\n2:57\nI can tell you what the internal energy\n2:59\nof this system is.\n3:00\nI can tell you its pressure.\n3:02\nI can tell you its volume.\n3:03\nI can tell you its temperature.\n3:05\nThese are all macrostates of the system.\n3:07\nI don't know how it got to this situation, but I can tell\n3:10\nyou about it.\n3:10\nI cannot tell you what the heat is of this system.\n3:14\nAnd that might be a little unintuitive, because if I ask\n3:19\nyou, hey I have a cup of coffee, what's the heat of it?\n3:21\nYou might say, oh, it's, you know, you might give me the\n3:22\ntemperature.\n3:23\nBecause in our everyday language we use things like\n3:25\nheat and temperature interchangeably.\n3:27\nBut in thermodynamics, heat is a transfer of energy.\n3:30\nA way to think about it is, if internal energy\n3:34\nis your bank account.\n3:36\nSo you could say change in bank account.\n3:45\nAnd it really is like the energy bank\n3:48\naccount of a system.\n3:50\nIf you have a change in a bank account, you had some deposits\n3:54\nor withdrawals.\n3:55\nAnd heat and work are really just deposits or withdrawals\n3:59\ninto our energy bank account.\n4:01\nHeat is one kind.\n4:02\nMaybe heat is like a wire transfer.\n4:04\nSo you could say it's wire transfers to your account.\n4:10\nTransfers to your account plus check deposits.\n4:20\nNow it makes a lot of sense to say, you could say, what is my\n4:24\nvalue of my bank account?\n4:26\nOr you could say what is my change in my bank account?\n4:28\nYou take two snapshots of your bank account at\n4:30\ntwo different times.\n4:32\nBut would it make sense to say-- you know, I could say I\n4:35\nwire transferred $10, right?\n4:37\nSo I could say, this statement would be plus $10.\n4:42\nAnd I could say that I wrote $20 in checks,\n4:46\nminus $20 in checks.\n4:47\nIn which case, my change in my bank account\n4:50\nwould be minus $10.\n4:53\nNow would it make sense for me to say\n4:55\nchange in wire transfer?\n4:56\nThat implies that when I started off maybe my bank\n4:59\naccount had $100 in it and now it has $90.\n5:04\nWhen my bank account had $100 in it, did it have any wire\n5:08\ntransfer amount?\n5:10\nNo, wire transfer was how money was deposited or taken\n5:14\naway from my account.\n5:14\nLikewise, it didn't have a checking deposit account, so I\n5:17\ncan't really-- it just seems weird to me to say change in\n5:21\nwire transfer is $10, or change in check deposits is\n5:25\n$20 or minus $20.\n5:27\nWould you say, I made a $10 wire transfer and\n5:30\nI paid $20 in checks.\n5:32\nSo I had a net change in my bank account of $10.\n5:36\nLikewise, I say how much work was done to me or I did, which\n5:40\nis essentially a deposit or withdrawal of energy.\n5:43\nOr I could say much heat was given to me or how much heat\n5:45\nwas released, which is another way of depositing or\n5:48\nwithdrawing energy from my energy bank account.\n5:51\nSo that's why I like to stick to this.\n5:53\nAnd I like to stay away from this.\n5:56\nAnd just like I said, you can't say how much heat is in\n5:58\nthe system.\n5:59\nSo someone will say, oh, how much heat is in this?\n6:02\nYou cannot say that.\n6:03\nThere's no heat state variable for that system.\n6:06\nYou have internal energy.\n6:08\nThe closest thing to heat, we'll talk about it in a\n6:10\nfuture video, is enthalpy.\n6:11\nEnthalpy is essentially a way of measuring how much heat is\n6:15\nin a system, but we won't talk about that just now.\n6:18\nAnd you can't say how much work is in a system.\n6:20\nYou can't say, oh I have x amount of work in a system.\n6:24\nThe system can do work or have work done to it, but there's\n6:27\nnot a certain amount of work, because that energy in the\n6:29\nsystem could be all used for work, it could all be used for\n6:32\nheat, it could all be used for a ton of different things.\n6:34\nSo you can't say those things.\n6:35\nAnd that's why I don't like treating them like state\n6:38\nvariables, or state functions.\n6:39\nSo with that said, this is our definition.\n6:42\nLet's do a couple of simple problems,\n6:44\njust to give you intuition.\n6:45\nAnd I really want to make you comfortable.\n6:49\nMy real goal is to make you comfortable with, when to know\n6:52\nto use plus or minus on the work.\n6:54\nAnd the best way to do it is not to memorize a formula, but\n6:57\njust to kind of think about what's happening.\n6:59\nSo let's say that I have some system here and, I don't know,\n7:02\nit's a balloon.\n7:03\nAnd let's say that I have no change in internal energy.\n7:09\nInternal energy is 0.\n7:10\nAnd for our purposes we can kind of view it as the kinetic\n7:13\nenergy of the particles haven't changed.\n7:15\nAnd let's say by expanding a bit, by my balloon expanding a\n7:20\nbit-- I did some work.\n7:21\nI'll do this in more detail in the next video.\n7:25\nSo the system does 10 joules of work.\n7:35\nMy question is, how much heat was added or taken away from\n7:39\nthe system?\n7:45\nSo the way I can think about it-- you don't even have to\n7:46\nwrite the formula down, or you can write it-- you could say,\n7:49\nlook, the internal energy, the amount of energy in the system\n7:52\nhasn't changed.\n7:53\nThe system did 10 joules of work.\n7:56\nSo that's energy going out of the system.\n7:58\nIt did 10 joules.\n8:00\nSo 10 joules went out in the form of work.\n8:03\nIf the internal energy did not change, then essentially 10\n8:08\njoules of energy had to go into the system.\n8:11\n10 joules had to go into the system.\n8:13\nIf it didn't, the internal energy would have gone down by\n8:16\nthe amount of work we had.\n8:20\nAnd the only way, if is this is the net work, the only way\n8:22\nthat we're talking about, that we can add energy outside of\n8:24\nwork, is through heat.\n8:26\nSo 10 joules of heat must have been added.\n8:28\nSo we can write 10 joules of heat added to system.\n8:36\nNow let's look at that from the point of view of the\n8:38\nactual formula.\n8:40\nIf we have delta U is equal to heat added, plus work done to\n8:49\nthe system, then we would say, OK, this was 0.\n8:53\nIt's equal to the heat added to the system.\n8:59\nRemember, in this way we're saying this is the heat done,\n9:02\nor the work done, to the system.\n9:04\nW is work done.\n9:06\nNow, the system did work to something else.\n9:09\nIt didn't have work done to it.\n9:12\nSo if this is work done to the system, and it did work, then\n9:17\nthis is going to be a minus 10.\n9:20\nMinus 10 joules.\n9:21\nAnd then you solve both sides of this.\n9:24\nYou add 10 to both sides and you get 10 is equal to Q,\n9:31\nwhich is exactly what we got up here.\n9:33\nBut this can get confusing sometimes, because you're\n9:35\nlike, oh, is this heat that the system did?\n9:38\nIs this heat that was added to the system or taken away?\n9:43\nThe convention tends to be that this is heat added.\n9:48\nBut then sometimes it's confusing.\n9:49\nIs this the work done to the system or work done by?\n9:52\nAnd that's why I like just doing it this way.\n9:53\nIf the system does work it loses energy.\n9:55\nIf the system has work done to it, it gains energy.\n9:59\nSo let's do another problem.\n10:01\nI mean, I could have done this exact same thing using the\n10:03\nother formula that you'll sometimes see.\n10:05\nDelta U is equal to Q minus the work that the system does\n10:14\nby the system-- Work done by the system.\n10:18\nAnd in this case, once again, change in\n10:21\ninternal energy was 0.\n10:23\nThat is equal to heat added to the system,\n10:27\nminus the work done.\n10:30\nSo minus-- I told you at the beginning of the problem that\n10:33\nthe system did 10 joules of work-- so minus the work done.\n10:38\nMinus 10 joules.\n10:39\nWe get the same situation up here from\n10:42\ntwo different formulas.\n10:43\nAnd we got 10 is equal to Q.\n10:46\nEither way, the heat added to the system is 10 joules.\n10:49\nLet's do one more.\n10:51\nLet's say that, I don't know, 5 joules of heat taken away\n11:02\nfrom system.\n11:09\nAnd let's say that 1 joule of work done on system.\n11:16\nSo maybe we're compressing the balloon on the system.\n11:20\nWhat is our change in internal energy?\n11:25\nLet's just figure out our change.\n11:27\nSo the way I think of it is 5 joules of heat taken away from\n11:30\nthe system, that's going to reduce our internal\n11:31\nenergy by minus 5.\n11:33\nAnd if 1 joule work is done onto the system, we're putting\n11:37\nenergy into it so that'll be plus 1.\n11:40\nSo minus 5, plus 1, is going to be minus 4.\n11:44\nOr enter our change in internal\n11:46\nenergy is minus 4 joules.\n11:48\nNow we could have done that a little bit more formally with\n11:50\nthe formula, change in internal energy is equal to\n11:55\nheat added to the system, plus work done on the system.\n12:03\nSo it's equal to heat added to the system.\n12:06\nWe had 5 joules heat taken away, so this is minus 5, plus\n12:11\nwork done on the system.\n12:13\nWe have 1 joule of work done on the system, and there we\n12:17\nget, once again, minus 4.\n12:19\nNow, I could have written that same formula the other way.\n12:22\nI could have said change in internal energy is equal to\n12:27\nheat added to the system minus the work that the system does.\n12:31\nI want to do this both ways, because I don't want you to\n12:33\nget confused, either way you see it on problems or in\n12:37\nschool, or maybe you take one class that does it one way and\n12:39\none class that does it the other.\n12:40\nIf you use it this way, what was the heat\n12:43\nadded to the system?\n12:44\nWe had heat taken away, so it's minus 5.\n12:47\nSo minus the work that the system does, how much work\n12:51\ndoes the system do?\n12:54\nWell, the system had 1 joule of work done to it.\n12:58\nSo it did itself minus 1 joules of work.\n13:03\nSo it's minus minus 1.\n13:06\nI want to be clear, when I use this formula, this is work\n13:10\ndone by system, done by.\n13:13\nThis is work done to.\n13:16\nThe system had work done to it.\n13:19\nSo it had minus 1 joules of work done by the system, so\n13:22\nthese become pluses, and you get back to a minus 4.\n13:25\nDo whatever's intuitive for you.\n13:27\nFor me, this tends to be the most intuitive, where you\n13:29\ndon't even use a formula.\n13:30\nWe just think, if I'm doing work, I'm using up energy.\n13:33\nIf I get work done to me, I'm being handed over energy.\n13:37\nIf I have heat taken away from me, I'm giving away energy.\n13:40\nIf I have heat added to me, I'm getting energy.\n13:43\nSee you in the next video.",

    "question_type": "MCQ",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nI think we've all heard of the word bacteria.\n0:07\nAnd we normally associate it with negative things.\n0:11\nYou say bacteria,those are germs.\n0:13\nSo we normally associate those with germs,and they indeed are germs,\n0:17\nand they cause a whole set of negative things.\n0:20\nOr at least from the standard point of view,\n0:23\npeople believe that they cause a whole bunch of negative things.\n0:26\nSo let's just list them all just to make sure we know about them,\n0:30\nwe're all on the same page.So the bad things they do,\n0:33\nthey cause a lot of diseases:tuberculosis,Lyme disease.\n0:44\nI mean,I could go on and on.\n0:45\nYou know,pretty much any time--well,I'll be careful here.\n0:48\nWhenever people talk about an infection,\n0:50\nit's often caused by a bacteria.It can also be caused by a virus.\n0:54\nAn infection is,in general,anything entering you\n0:56\nand taking advantage of your body to kind of replicate itself,\n1:00\nand in the process,making you sick.\n1:02\nBut bacterial infections,let me write that down.\n1:10\nAnd this whole perception of bacteria being a bad thing\n1:13\nis probably a good reason\n1:15\nwhy almost any soap you see now will say antibacterial on it.\n1:24\nBecause the makers of the soap know that in conventional thinking,\n1:28\nbacteria are viewed as a negative thing.\n1:32\nAnd you're like,OK,Sal,I know where you're going with this.\n1:34\nBacteria isn't all bad.There are some good traits of bacteria.\n1:41\nFor example,I could stick some yogurt in some--\n1:44\nor I could stick some bacteria in some milk\n1:47\nand it'll help produce some yogurt,sometimes spelled yoghurt.\n1:57\nAnd that's obviously a good thing.It's a delicious thing to eat.\n2:01\nYou say,well,I know I have bacteria in my gut.It helps me digest food.\n2:09\nAnd these are all true,but you're like,look,you know,\n2:11\non balance,I still think bacteria is a bad thing.\n2:16\nI'm not going to take sides on that debate,\n2:18\nas I tend to avoid taking sides on debates in these science videos.\n2:22\nMaybe I'll do a whole playlist where I do nothing\n2:24\nbut take sides on debates,but here I won't take any sides on that.\n2:28\nBut I'll just point out that\n2:29\nyou are to a large degree made up of bacteria.It's not just your gut.\n2:35\nIt's not just the gut or the yogurt you might eat\n2:38\nor the plaque on your teeth,which is caused by bacteria.\n2:43\nIt's this kind of film that's created by bacteria\n2:45\nBacteria actually represents a majority of the cells on your body.\n2:48\nAnd it's not just the pimples on your face.\n2:54\nBacteria actually represents a majority of the cells on your body.\n3:00\nSo for every--and this is kind of an astounding fact.\n3:04\nFor every one cell on the human body,every one human cell--\n3:09\nso these are all cells that all have your DNA in them\n3:14\nand they'll have nucleuses,and I'll talk about that in a second--\n3:18\nyou have 20 bacteria.Now,your response there is to say,\n3:25\nOK,that's fair enough,\n3:27\nbut these bacteria must be much smaller than the human cell,\n3:30\nso it must be a very small fraction of my mass.And you're right.\n3:35\nIt's not like we're mostly bacteria by mass,\n3:37\nalthough we are mostly bacteria by actual cells.\n3:41\nBut even if you were to take out all of the water in your body,\n3:44\nthen by mass,bacteria is going to be roughly 10% of your mass.\n3:53\nSo I weigh about 150 pounds,\n3:55\nI've got 15 pounds of bacteria walking around with me.\n3:59\nSo we always kind of think of ourselves\n4:01\nas like the bacteria is riding on us,\n4:03\nbut to a large degree,we're kind of in symbiosis.\n4:06\nWe're kind of two creatures,or not just two creatures,\n4:09\ntwo types of creatures living together,\n4:11\nbecause I don't have just one type of bacteria on me.\n4:14\nI have thousands of types of bacteria on me.\n4:16\nThere's a huge amount of diversity,\n4:18\nand we're just scratching the surface in terms of\n4:21\nthe number and types and diversity of bacteria that exist.\n4:25\nSo I've talked a lot about bacteria,and hopefully,\n4:27\nthis fact right here will make you realize that\n4:30\nthey're super important to just our everyday existence.\n4:33\nJust to make sure we understand the magnitude of this,\n4:35\nin a previous video,and I looked this up again,\n4:38\nwe have on the order of 10 to a 100 trillion cells,human cells.\n4:47\nSo for every one of these we have 20 bacteria,\n4:50\nwe're talking about having on the order of\n4:56\n200 to 2,000 trillion bacteria on us at any time.\n5:04\nAnd I'm a hygienic person.I take showers daily,and that's even me.\n5:09\nIt's not like you can somehow eliminate them.\n5:10\nAnd even more,it's not like you even want to eliminate them.\n5:13\nBut that's fair enough.You're probably asking,OK,Sal,\n5:15\nI'm convinced that bacteria are important.\n5:17\nWhat do they actually look like?\n5:18\nAnd they're these small unicellular organisms.\n5:22\nThat's my bacteria right there.\n5:25\nAnd they're different from the cells that make up us.\n5:29\nWhen I say us,I'll throw in all plants,animals and funguses,fungi.\n5:35\nAnd the big difference,or the one that people noticed first,\n5:39\nis that all of the Eukarya,which includes plants,animals and fungi,\n5:47\nall of their DNA is inside of a nucleus,a cellular nucleus.\n5:54\nSo that's the nucleus right there.\n5:59\nAnd all of our DNA,it's normally in its chromatin form.\n6:02\nIt's all just spread around something like that.\n6:07\nIn bacteria,which are what people originally just\n6:11\nclassify it on whether or not you have a nucleus,\n6:15\nin bacteria,there is no membrane surrounding the DNA.\n6:20\nSo what they have is just a big bundle of DNA.\n6:25\nThey just have this big bundle of DNA.\n6:29\nIt's sometimes in a loop all in one circle called a nucleoid.\n6:40\nNow,whenever we look at something,and we say,oh,\n6:43\nwe have this thing;it doesn't;there's this assumption that\n6:46\nsomehow we're superior or we're more advanced beings.\n6:51\nBut the reality is that bacteria have infiltrated far more ecosystems\n6:55\nin every part of the planet than Eukarya have,\n6:58\nand there's far more diversity in bacteria than there is in Eukarya.\n7:05\nSo when you really think about it,\n7:07\nthese are the more successful organisms.\n7:11\nIf a comet were to hit the Earth--God forbid--\n7:17\nthe organisms more likely to survive are going to be the bacteria\n7:20\nthan the Eukarya,than the ones with the larger--not always larger,\n7:26\nbut the organisms that do have this nucleus\n7:28\nand have membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria and all that.\n7:31\nWe'll talk more about it in the future.\n7:33\nBacteria,for the most part,are just big bags of cytoplasm.\n7:36\nThey have their DNA there.\n7:37\nThey do have ribosomes because they have to code for proteins\n7:41\njust like the rest of us do.\n7:42\nSome of those proteins,they'll make some from--\n7:45\nbacteria,they'll make these flagella,\n7:46\nwhich are tails that allow them to move around.\n7:51\nThey also have these things called pili.\n7:54\nPili is plural for pilus or pee-lus,so these pili.\n8:00\nAnd we'll see in a second that the pili are kind of\n8:02\nhow the bacteria are able to do one form of\n8:06\nintroducing genetic variation into their populations.\n8:13\nActually,I'll take a little side note here.\n8:15\nI'm pointing out bacteria as not having a cell wall.\n8:17\nThere's actually another class that used to be categorized\n8:19\nas type of a bacteria,and they're called Archaea.\n8:23\nI should give them a little bit of justice.\n8:25\nThey're always kind of the stepchild.\n8:30\nThey used to be called Archaea bacteria,\n8:32\nbut now people realize,they've actually looked at the DNA,\n8:34\nbecause when they originally looked at these,they said,OK,\n8:36\nthese guys also have no nucleus and a bunch of DNA running around.\n8:41\nThese must be a form of bacteria.\n8:43\nBut now that we've actually been able to look into the DNA\n8:46\nof the things,we've seen that they're actually quite different.\n8:48\nBut all of these,both bacteria and Archaea,are considered prokaryotes.\n8:58\nAnd this just means no nucleus.\n9:01\nNo nucleus,and more generally,this is what most people refer to,\n9:04\nbut more generally,they don't have these membrane-bound organelles\n9:08\nthat our cells have.\n9:11\nNow,the next question you might say is,well,\n9:14\nhow do these bacteria reproduce?And for the most part,\n9:17\nthey do something not completely different from mitosis,\n9:20\nalthough I want to call it mitosis.\n9:22\nWe call it binary fission.\n9:31\nI'm not going to go into the deep mechanism here,\n9:33\nbut the idea is fairly simple.I have a bacteria right here.\n9:37\nIt replicates its DNA,so it'll have two of these nucleoids here,\n9:43\nand then the cytoplasm essentially splits,\n9:46\nor it's kind of a form of cleavage right there.\n9:49\nIt splits and then you have two of them.You have two of them then.\n9:55\nAnd then each of them,they can code for the proteins necessary\n9:59\nto produce all of their extra appendages,the flagellum,\n10:02\nwhich is this long tail-like thing that can help it move.\n10:06\nAnd it's actually fascinating\n10:07\nbecause it's operating at such a small scale,\n10:08\nbut you can still kind of get this motor movement going on.\n10:12\nEven at this very,very small scale,using very primitive--\n10:16\nI won't say primitive,because that's making a value judgment\n10:18\non these things,but using--you know,\n10:20\nthese flagellum are on the order of several nanometers,\n10:22\non the order of tens of nanometers wide.\n10:25\nSo you don't have a lot of atoms to deal with,\n10:27\nbut you're still able to get this kind of wave-like motion\n10:31\nthat can move the bacteria around.\n10:33\nNow,you're saying,hey,Sal,in that first video on evolution,\n10:36\nyou told me that we see evolution every day\n10:39\nand bacteria is one example.\n10:42\nWhen we use antibiotics,we think it'll help eliminate bacteria,\n10:45\nbut that one bacteria that has some type of resistance,\n10:47\nit'll survive,so it is more fit.\n10:50\nHow did these guys get variation?\n10:53\nWell,the one way,and this is the way everything can get variation,\n10:55\nis they can get mutations.\n10:58\nAnd bacteria replicate so quickly,they reproduce so quickly that\n11:02\neven if you have a mutation that's one in every thousand times,\n11:06\nby the time you have a million bacteria,\n11:07\nyou'll have a thousand mutations.\n11:09\nSo they have mutations,but they also have this form.\n11:12\nI don't want to call it sexual reproduction,\n11:14\nbecause it's not sexual reproduction.\n11:15\nThey don't form gametes and the gametes\n11:17\ndon't fertilize each other and then produces a zygote.\n11:20\nBut two bacteria can get near each other\n11:27\nand then one of their piluses--I'll do that right here.\n11:35\nSo the piluses are these little structures on the side of the bacteria\n11:39\nThey're these little tubes,really.\n11:42\nOne of the piluses can connect from one bacteria to another,\n11:46\nand then essentially you have a mixing of\n11:48\nwhat's inside one bacteria with another.\n11:50\nSo let me draw their nucleoids.\n11:55\nAnd then they have these other pieces of just DNA\n11:58\nthat hangs out called plasmids.\n12:01\nThese are just circular pieces of DNA.\n12:04\nMaybe this guy has got this extra neat plasmid.\n12:07\nHe got it from someplace,\n12:08\nand it's making him able to do things that this guy couldn't do.\n12:11\nMaybe this is the R plasmid,which is known for\n12:16\nmaking a bacteria resistant to a lot of antibiotics.\n12:19\nAnd what happens is,that bacteria--and actually,\n12:21\nthere's mechanisms where the bacteria know that,hey,\n12:23\nthis guy doesn't have the R plasmid.\n12:24\nAnd we're just beginning to understand how it actually works,\n12:26\nbut this will actually replicate itself\n12:29\nand give this guy a version of the R plasmid.\n12:33\nYou could also have these things,transposons,\n12:34\nand I should make a whole video on this\n12:36\nbecause we have transposons,too.\n12:38\nBut there's parts of DNA that can jump from\n12:40\none part of a fragment of DNA to another,\n12:42\nand these can also end up in the other one.\n12:44\nSo what you have is kind of--it's not formal sexual reproduction,\n12:47\nbut what you essentially have is a connection,\n12:48\nand these bacteria are just constantly swapping DNA with each other\n12:52\nand DNA is jumping back and forth,so you can imagine\n12:55\nall sorts of combinations of DNA happen even within\n12:58\nwhat you used to call one bacterial species\n13:02\nand very quickly can turn to multiple species\n13:04\nand become resistant to different things.\n13:06\nIf this makes it resistant to an antibiotic,\n13:08\nthen it can kind of spread the information to produce\n13:11\nthose resistant proteins or whatever to the other bacteria.\n13:15\nSo this is kind of a form of introducing variation.\n13:19\nAnd so when you transfer stuff via this pilus,or the plural is pili,\n13:23\nthis is called conjugation,bacterial conjugation.\n13:32\nNow,the last thing I want to talk about,\n13:33\nbecause it's something that you've heard a lot about,are antibiotics.\n13:38\nA lot of people,they get sick.\n13:39\nThe first thing they want to get is an antibiotic.\n13:44\nAnd an antibiotic is just a whole class of chemicals and compounds,\n13:47\nsome of them naturally derived,some of them not,that kill bacteria.\n13:54\nSo now if someone is undergoing a surgery and they get a cut,\n13:58\ninstead of them having to worry about getting an infection,\n14:01\nthey'll take some antibiotics\n14:03\nto prevent the bacteria from growing on them.\n14:06\nBut the question is how was this discovered\n14:09\nor where does it come from?\n14:12\nIt actually came from Alexander Fleming.Let me write him down.\n14:17\nVery important,because the discovery of antibiotics is,\n14:20\nin my opinion,the most important discovery in medicine so far.\n14:23\nSo,Alexander Fleming.He was studying--I think it was Staphylococcus.\n14:33\nI forget which bacteria it was,but it was in a Petri dish.\n14:36\nHe was using a Petri dish.Let me draw a Petri dish.\n14:38\nThere's a little circle.\n14:40\nThere's some nutrients that the bacteria can grow on.\n14:42\nSo let's say the bacteria,you know,\n14:44\nit's growing on this Petri dish.\n14:47\nAnd he went out,and he came back into the room,\n14:48\nand he saw that some mold,some fungus had grown on this,\n14:55\nkind of a bluish-greenish fungus\n14:59\nhad grown on the center of his Petri dish.\n15:04\nAnd the bacteria,there was kind of this space around it,\n15:06\nand the bacteria couldn't get close to it.\n15:08\nAnd this mold,this fungus was called Penicillium,\n15:13\nthe Penicillium fungus.He was able to figure that out.\n15:16\nHe took a sample of this and then he cultured it,\n15:18\nwhich means letting it grow and then seeing what it is.\n15:21\nThis was Penicillium.And he figured out that,gee,\n15:24\nthis fungus must have something,some chemical that it's emitting\n15:28\nthat's essentially killing the bacteria around it,\n15:30\nthat's not allowing the bacteria to get near it.\n15:33\nAnd so that led to the discovery of penicillin.\n15:47\nThis was in the late 20s,1920s.\n15:51\nBy the time World War II came around,\n15:52\nnow people had gunshot wounds and they had to get things amputated,\n15:55\nwhatnot,but for the first time,\n15:57\nthey could actually give people antibiotics and not worry about--\n16:00\nor they probably still worried about it,\n16:03\nbut didn't have to worry about this thing as much as they did before.\n16:07\nAnd now,you know,if you have bacteria,\n16:08\nif you have tuberculosis or Lyme disease or anything,\n16:12\nthe treatment all involves taking antibiotics.\n16:16\nAnd there are many,many more types of antibiotics\n16:18\nnow coming from many, many more different sources,\n16:20\nbut the general idea is the same.You want to kill bacteria.\n16:24\nAlthough you don't want to kill all bacteria,\n16:25\nbecause some of it's good.\n16:26\nIn fact,we are made up a whole lot of bacteria.\n16:30\nI don't know if I even mentioned this earlier in the video.\n16:31\nThere's bacteria in our skin that helps take up oil\n16:33\nand moisturizes and make our skin nice and supple.\n16:37\nSo,you know,the way you think about it,\n16:38\nyou could view them as negative or you could view them as positive\n16:40\nor you could view them as something in between,\n16:42\nbut the really amazing thing,at least in my mind,\n16:44\nis that we're living in symbiosis with them.\n16:46\nI remember I saw a Star Trek episode once where you had these people.\n16:52\nYou had these people,and they were some alien race.\n16:56\nJean Luc Picard had--they ran into them.\n16:59\nThey looked very humanoid like that.\n17:02\nBut it turns out--let me draw this human--\n17:04\nthat they had these little bugs in their brain stem.\n17:07\nSo they had these big insects in their brain stem\n17:09\nand these insects started infecting the crew of the Enterprise,\n17:13\nand they were controlling their brains and making them act weird\n17:17\nand whatever not,and this seemed like a very bizarre alien concept\n17:20\nof some creepy-crawlie living in us\n17:24\nand affecting our brains and affecting us in some ways.\n17:26\nBut if you really think about it,we are doing this,\n17:28\nand it's not just with one little bug,\n17:30\nit's on the order of trillions.\n17:32\nHundreds of trillions of bugs are with us every day\n17:35\nand they make us us.\n17:37\nI mean,I'm here recording videos along with--\n17:39\nor maybe I should even say the bacteria is recording videos\n17:43\nor it's maybe partially responsible for controlling bacteria.\n17:46\nAnd it's known that the bacteria can even affect our mental state.\n17:49\nThere's a whole bunch of research now that\n17:51\ncertain types of bacteria can cause schizophrenia.\n17:54\nActually,syphilis does.Bacteria can cause depression.\n17:58\nLyme disease,it's known that\n18:01\nwhen you go into later phases of Lyme disease,\n18:04\nit can affect the mental condition of the person who has the infection\n18:09\nso it affects every part of who we are.\n18:11\nI mean,it would be hard to even talk of being a human being\n18:15\nwithout the 10% of our mass or the 2,000 trillion cells\n18:20\nor 2,000 trillion bacteria that really make us us.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nRewrite the expression 4 times, and then in parentheses\n0:03\nwe have 8 plus 3, using the distributive law of\n0:07\nmultiplication over addition.\n0:09\nThen simplify the expression.\n0:11\nSo let's just try to solve this or evaluate this\n0:16\nexpression, then we'll talk a little bit about the\n0:18\ndistributive law of multiplication over addition,\n0:20\nusually just called the distributive law.\n0:23\nSo we have 4 times 8 plus 8 plus 3.\n0:34\nNow there's two ways to do it.\n0:36\nNormally, when you have parentheses, your inclination\n0:38\nis, well, let me just evaluate what's in the parentheses\n0:41\nfirst and then worry about what's outside of the\n0:43\nparentheses, and we can do that fairly easily here.\n0:46\nWe can evaluate what 8 plus 3 is.\n0:48\n8 plus 3 is 11.\n0:49\nSo if we do that-- let me do that in this direction.\n0:52\nSo if we do that, we get 4 times, and in parentheses we\n0:58\nhave an 11.\n1:00\n8 plus 3 is 11, and then this is going to be equal to--\n1:04\nwell, 4 times 11 is just 44, so you can\n1:08\nevaluate it that way.\n1:09\nBut they want us to use the distributive law of\n1:11\nmultiplication.\n1:12\nWe did not use the distributive law just now.\n1:14\nWe just evaluated the expression.\n1:17\nWe used the parentheses first, then multiplied by 4.\n1:20\nIn the distributive law, we multiply by 4 first. And it's\n1:24\ncalled the distributive law because you distribute the 4,\n1:27\nand we're going to think about what that means.\n1:29\nSo in the distributive law, what this will become, it'll\n1:33\nbecome 4 times 8 plus 4 times 3, and we're going to think\n1:37\nabout why that is in a second.\n1:38\nSo this is going to be equal to 4 times 8 plus 4 times 3.\n1:52\nA lot of people's first instinct is just to multiply\n1:54\nthe 4 times the 8, but no!\n1:56\nYou have to distribute the 4.\n1:58\nYou have to multiply it times the 8 and times the 3.\n2:03\nThis is right here.\n2:04\nThis is the distributive property in action right here.\n2:07\nDistributive property in action.\n2:10\nAnd then when you evaluate it-- and I'm going to show you\n2:11\nin kind of a visual way why this works.\n2:14\nBut then when you evaluate it, 4 times 8-- I'll do this in a\n2:17\ndifferent color-- 4 times 8 is 32, and then so we have 32\n2:23\nplus 4 times 3.\n2:25\n4 times 3 is 12 and 32 plus 12 is equal to 44.\n2:32\nThat is also equal to 44, so you can get it either way.\n2:36\nBut when they want us to use the distributive law, you'd\n2:38\ndistribute the 4 first. Now let's think\n2:41\nabout why that happens.\n2:42\nLet's visualize just what 8 plus 3 is.\n2:45\nLet me draw eight of something.\n2:47\nSo one, two, three, four, five, six,\n2:53\nseven, eight, right?\n2:58\nAnd then we're going to add to that three of something, of\n3:04\nmaybe the same thing.\n3:05\nOne, two, three.\n3:07\nSo you can imagine this is what we have inside of the\n3:10\nparentheses.\n3:11\nWe have 8 circles plus 3 circles.\n3:14\nNow, when we're multiplying this whole thing, this whole\n3:16\nthing times 4, what does that mean?\n3:20\nWell, that means we're just going to add this to itself\n3:22\nfour times.\n3:23\nLet me do that with a copy and paste.\n3:26\nCopy and paste.\n3:28\nLet me copy and then let me paste.\n3:31\nThere you go.\n3:32\nThat's two.\n3:33\nThat's one, two, three, and then we have four, and we're\n3:39\ngoing to add them all together.\n3:41\nSo this is literally what?\n3:42\nFour times, right?\n3:45\nLet me go back to the drawing tool.\n3:47\nWe have it one, two, three, four times this expression,\n3:50\nwhich is 8 plus 3.\n3:52\nNow, what is this thing over here?\n4:00\nIf you were to count all of this stuff, you would get 44.\n4:03\nBut what is this thing over here?\n4:05\nWell, that's 8 added to itself four times.\n4:09\nYou could imagine you're adding all of these.\n4:11\nSo what's 8 added to itself four times?\n4:14\nThat is 4 times 8.\n4:16\nSo this is 4 times 8, and what is this\n4:22\nover here in the orange?\n4:24\nWe have one, two, three, four times.\n4:27\nWell, each time we have three.\n4:28\nSo it's 4 times this right here.\n4:32\nThis right here is 4 times 3.\n4:37\nSo you see why the distributive property works.\n4:39\nIf you do 4 times 8 plus 3, you have to multiply-- when\n4:44\nyou, I guess you could imagine, duplicate the thing\n4:46\nfour times, both the 8 and the 3 is getting duplicated four\n4:50\ntimes or it's being added to itself four times, and that's\n4:53\nwhy we distribute the 4.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nSo we've got the function, f of x is equal to x squared.\n0:05\nAnd what I'm concerned with, is finding the area under the curve,\n0:09\ny is equal to f of x, so that's my y axis.\n0:13\nThis is my, my, x axis.\n0:18\nThen let me draw my function.\n0:20\nMy function looks like this.\n0:22\nAt least in the, in the first quadrant.\n0:24\nThat's where I'll graph it for now.\n0:26\nI could also graph it, obviously in the second quadrant.\n0:29\nBut, what I care about is the area under this curve and above the positive x axis,\n0:34\nbetween, between x equals 1 and x equals 4, x equals 4.\n0:41\nAnd I'm tired of approximating areas.\n0:44\nI wanna find the exact area under this curve above the x axis.\n0:50\nAnd the way we denote the exact area under the\n0:52\ncurve, this little brown shaded area, is using the definite integral.\n0:56\nThe definite integral from 1 to 4 of f of x, dx.\n1:02\nAnd the way that, or the way I conceptualize\n1:04\nwhere this notation comes from, is we imagine a\n1:07\nbunch of infinite, an infinite number of infinitely thin\n1:10\nrectangles that we sum up to find this area.\n1:13\nLet me draw one of those infinitely thin rectangles, maybe not so infinitely thin.\n1:18\nSo, let me draw it like this.\n1:20\nSo, that would be one of the rectangles, that would be another rectangle.\n1:23\nThis should be reminiscent of a Riemann sum.\n1:25\nIn fact, that's where the Riemann integral comes from.\n1:27\nThink of a Riemann sum where you have an infinite number\n1:30\nof these rectangles, where the width of each of the rectangles.\n1:33\nThis is how I conceptualize it, is dx, and the height of this rectangle is the\n1:38\nfunction evaluated at an x that's within this interval right over here.\n1:43\nAnd so, this part right over here is the area of\n1:46\none of those rectangles, and we were summing them all up.\n1:49\nAnd this kind of an elongated s, reminiscent of a sigma for summing.\n1:54\nWe're summing up the infinite number, of those infinitely thin rectangles,\n1:58\nor the areas of those infinitely thin rectangles between 1 and 4.\n2:02\nSo that's where the notation of the definite integral comes from.\n2:05\nBut we still haven't done anything.\n2:06\nWe've just written some notation that says the exact area of the un-\n2:10\nBetween 1 and 4, under the curve f of x, and above the x axis.\n2:15\nIn order to actually do anything really productive with this, we have to turn to\n2:19\nthe second fundamental theorem of calculus, sometimes called\n2:22\npart two of the fundamental theorem of calculus.\n2:24\n>> Which tells us, that if f has an antiderivative, so if we\n2:29\nhave the antiderivative of f, so f of x is derivative,\n2:35\nderivative of some function capital F of x, or another way of saying it is,\n2:40\nf, capital F of x is the antiderivative,\n2:45\nantiderivative of lower case f of x.\n2:51\nThen I can evaluate this thing, and we do\n2:52\na whole video on conceptually understanding why this makes sense.\n2:56\nWe could evaluate this, by evaluating the antiderivative\n3:00\nof f, or an antiderivative of f, at 4.\n3:04\nAnd from that, subtract the antiderivative evaluated at 1.\n3:09\nSo, let's do it for this particular case right over here.\n3:14\nSo we are taking, I'll just rewrite this statement.\n3:17\nInstead of writing f of x, I'll write x squared.\n3:19\nSo, the definite integral from 1 to 4 of x squared dx.\n3:24\nWell, we're just gonna have to figure out what the antiderivative is.\n3:27\nSo if f of x is equal to x squared, what is capital F of x equal to?\n3:33\nWhat is the antiderivative?\n3:36\nWell, you might remember from your power rule, that if you\n3:39\ntake the derivative with respect to x of x to the\n3:43\nthird, you are going to get 3x squared, which is pretty\n3:47\ndarn close to x squared except for this factor of 3.\n3:50\nSo, let's divide both sides by 3.\n3:52\nLet's divide both sides by 3, and you get the derivative\n3:56\nof x to the third divided by 3 is indeed x squared.\n4:00\nOr, you can say this is the same thing as the\n4:02\nderivative with respect to x of, x to the third over 3.\n4:07\nTake the derivative of this.\n4:08\nIt'll be 3 times one third.\n4:11\nAnd then you'll decrement the power, it'll just be x squared.\n4:13\nSo, this right over here, once again, is x squared.\n4:15\nIt's just equal to, just equal to x squared.\n4:20\nSo, in this case, our capital F of x, our antiderivative,\n4:24\nis x to the third, x to the third over 3.\n4:28\nAnd so we just have to evaluate that at 4 and at 1, and sometimes the way we would,\n4:34\nthe, the notation we would use is, we'll say that the antiderivative is x\n4:40\nto the third over 3, and we're going to evaluate it, the one I, I always\n4:44\njust like to write the numbers up here,\n4:46\nat 4 and from that subtracted, evaluated at 1.\n4:49\nSometimes you'll see people write a little line here too,\n4:51\nwe'll say we're evaluate it at 4 and then at 1.\n4:54\nBut I'll just do it without the line.\n4:56\nIf we're gonna evaluate this thing at 4 and from\n4:59\nthat subtract it, subtract it evaluated at 1, so this\n5:02\ngoing to be equal to 4 to the third power is 64, so it's going to be 64 over 3.\n5:07\nLet me color code it, this is, this right over here, is this, right\n5:13\nover there and then from that, we're\n5:15\ngoing to subtract this business evaluated at one.\n5:18\nWell, when you evaluate it at 1, you get 1 to the third is one over 3.\n5:23\nYou get one third.\n5:24\nSo just to be clear, this is this right over there.\n5:31\nAnd then we are ready to just subtract these fractions.\n5:33\n64 over 3, minus one third, is equal to 63 over 3.\n5:41\nAnd 3 goes into 63 exactly, exactly 21 times.\n5:46\nSo, whatever the units are, the area of this brown area is 21 square units.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn triangle ABC, AB is equal to 13, BC is equal to 14, and AC is equal to 15.\n0:08\nLet me just draw that. It looks like a pretty involved problem\n0:17\nSo it looks something like that\n0:31\nLet's say this is triangle ABC\n0:34\nThey tell us AB is equal to 13, BC is equal to 14 and AC is equal to 15\n0:42\nand then they tell us point G is the intersection of the medians.\n0:48\nIf you've watched the video on medians and centroids you might recognize\n0:51\nthat the intersection of the medians is just the centroid.\n0:54\nLet me just show that here.\n0:59\nThe line from B to the midpoint of AC is a median.\n1:05\nLet me draw that a little cleaner.\n1:08\nSo that is a median.\n1:10\nNow the line from A to the midpoint of BC is also a median.\n1:22\nAnd finally the line from C to the midpoint of AB is a median.\n1:33\nWe learned -- if you've watched the video on medians and centroids --\n1:38\nthat these three medians always intersect at a point called the centroid.\n1:42\nThey even imply that in the question. So that right there is point G.\n1:50\nPoint A', B', and C' are the iamges of A, B, and C after a 180 degree rotation about G.\n1:59\nWhat is the area of the nion of the two regions enclosed by the triangles ABC and A'B'C'?\n2:06\nLet's draw the second triangle.\n2:11\nWhat we want to do is rotate each of these about G 180 degrees.\n2:16\nSo if A is here and we rotate it 180 degrees about G,\n2:23\nit's going to end up just as far from G on that side.\n2:28\nSo A' is going to be right over there.\n2:36\nB is this far right now, if you rotate it 180 degrees,\n2:44\nB' will then be about that far.\n2:49\nSame for C. If you rotate it 180 degrees,\n2:52\nit's going to go about here. So you have C'.\n3:02\nSo if we wanted to draw A'B'C', it's going to look like this.\n3:07\nHere's my best attempt at it.\n3:20\nThis line should be parallel to that line\n3:24\nsince it's been rotated by 180 degrees.\n3:27\nAnd this line [C'B'] should be parallel to this line [BC],\n3:33\nand this line [C'A'] should be parallel to that line [AC].\n3:38\nIt seems like it's going to be relevant.\n3:42\nSo they're asking, they want the area of the union of the two triangles.\n3:48\nSo it's the area of this star. This slightly skewed or tilted star of David\n3:59\nI'm not doing this in real time; it took me a while before I did this problem\n4:05\nbefore it jumped out at me.\n4:06\nKind of knowing that most of these problems don't require\n4:09\nreally hard mathematics.\n4:10\nA lot of the time you just kind of have to see something\n4:12\nor rearrange things and the answer jumps out.\n4:16\nIt's also the case with this one here.\n4:20\nAnd the thing that jumps out (and the motivation for making this video)\n4:23\nI showed you in the last video that if you have the median of a triangle\n4:33\nand the centroid of the trianlge is over here,\n4:35\nthis distance [GA] is twice the distance from the centroid to the midpoint [of BC]\n4:43\nand the same on all 3 sides.\n4:49\nBut this distance [AG] is also the same as this whole entire distance [A'G]\n5:01\nThis distance has been rotated 180 and degrees\n5:05\nand if this distance [G-midpoint of BC] is half of that one [AG]\n5:10\nthis is exactly halfway between this point [G] and that point [A']\n5:19\nAnother way to think about it:\n5:23\nwe know that this length over here is equal to this length over here,\n5:27\nwhich is equal to this length over here, which is equal to this length over here\n5:31\nAnd so you start seeing, maybe, some triangles will jump out.\n5:37\nLet's see if I can draw these triangles.\n5:42\nI have this triangle up here.\n5:49\nThis is actually going to be a median of this triangle over here\n5:53\nIt's going to be the same as the median or equivalent line of this triangle over here\n6:05\nIt's actually going to be an altitude -- we're kind of drawing a rhombus\n6:10\nand the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.\n6:15\nSo this altitude right here is going to be the same as this altitude over here.\n6:22\nThis side is the exact same thing as this side.\n6:31\nLet me be careful here.\n6:33\nWe already know that this side is going to be the same thing as this side\n6:37\nWe know these two sides are the same because this is acting as a median of this triangle\n6:41\nWe already know that this yellow side I'll draw two marks is the same thing\n6:48\nas that yellow side down there.\n6:51\nIf this is the same as this, and this is the same in both triangles,\n6:56\nwe know that this side must be the same thing as this side,\n7:06\nwhich also must be the same thing as this side and this side over here.\n7:16\nAnother way to think about it, this triangle is going to have the exact same area\n7:20\nas this triangle.\n7:22\nThis triangle is going to have the same exact area as this triangle.\n7:24\nOr, you could view it another way.\n7:26\nThis purple triangle right over here is going to be a congruent triangle to this triangle over here.\n7:35\nAll of its sides are exactly the same. They share one of them.\n7:39\nWe could use the same argument to say that this triangle right over here\n7:43\nis completely congruent to this triangle right over there.\n7:54\nThey have all of the same sides.\n7:55\nIn fact, we even know that they are congruent to these two up here.\n7:59\nSo these are all congruent.\n8:04\nLet's think about this triangle right over here.\n8:19\nWe know that this distance, the distance when started talking about medians,\n8:27\nfrom the centroid to the base, that's the exact same distance\n8:32\nover here , if you were to draw a parallel line.\n8:39\nIt's just that this line up here and this line over here are parallel\n8:44\nIf this is parallel to this, and they're intersecting at the same point\n8:50\nI won't go into the depth of proving they're parallel -- it's not too hard to prove.\n8:54\nYou can show that this distance is the same as this distance.\n9:01\nWe share this magenta side right over here,\n9:08\nso we know that this side is going to\n9:13\nbe the same as that side\n9:17\nOr we know that this triangle is going to be\n9:19\nthe same thing as that triangle.\n9:21\nAnd then we can take the mirror image.\n9:26\nUsing essentially the same argument,\n9:28\nthat's going to be the same thing as this triangle over here.\n9:31\nAnd it's a similar argument to show that that's going\n9:33\nto be the same thing as that triangle over there.\n9:35\nAnd then do it on the other side.\n9:42\nI think you see where this is going!\n9:44\nAll of these triangles are congruent.\n9:58\nThere's actually multiple ways you can make that argument.\n10:04\nThe same argument we made to show that these magenta triangles are congruent,\n10:07\nwe could make to say that this distance is exactly half of this entire distance.\n10:13\nSame argument to tell you that this triangle's congruent\n10:16\nto that that triangle.\n10:17\nAnd that one to that one.\n10:21\nSo that entire shape --\n10:23\nand actually I was a little handwavy about it --\n10:29\nI think you can see it actually wouldn't be hard to do a rigorous proof.\n10:33\nBut this shape, this slanted star of david\n10:37\nis made up of [counts to 12] congruent triangles.\n10:48\n12 congruent triangles.\n10:53\nNow, how many of these congruent triangles originally made up our triangle ABC?\n10:58\n[counts to 9]\n11:12\nSo we have 12 congruent triangles in the star\n11:17\nwe had 9 congruent triangles in ABC,\n11:30\nso the area of the star is just going to be 12/9 the area of ABC.\n11:37\nSo if we can figure out the area of ABC,\n11:41\nwe know that each triangle will have 1/9 that area.\n11:44\nMultiplying by 12 we'll get the area of the actual star.\n11:49\nSo let's figure out the area of triangle ABC.\n11:53\nLet me redraw the triangle.\n12:02\nThere are formulas for figuring out the areas of triangles if you know the sides.\n12:07\nI always forget them, but I do remember the law of cosines.\n12:10\nIt helps me derive those formulas.\n12:15\nArea of a triangle is 1/2 base * height,\n12:22\nso if we could figure out this height,\n12:27\nwe could multiply 1/2 and 14, or multiply it by 7 and\n12:31\nthen we would be able to figure out the area of this entire triangle.\n12:34\nHow can we do that?\n12:36\nLet's just break out a little trigonometry.\n12:44\nLet's take this to be theta over here.\n12:48\nThe law of cosines tells us that\n12:50\nthe opposite side of the angle squared, so 15 squared\n12:55\nis equal to the sum of the other sides squared\n12:59\n(13 squared + 14 squared)\n13:02\nminus 2 times the product of these two sides\n13:07\nso times 13 times 14\n13:10\ntimes the cosine of theta\n13:15\nNow, what is the cosine of theta?\n13:18\nCosine is adjacent over hypotenuse,\n13:22\nso that's this side over our hypotenuse.\n13:26\nSo let's just call this length over here x.\n13:36\nSo cosine of theta is x over 13.\n13:41\nSo if you could solve for x you could then solve for h using the Pythogorean Theorem\n13:45\nThese two characters cancel out, and we are left with\n13:52\n15 squared is 225, 13 squared is 169\n13:56\n14 squared -- we have 140 + 40 + 16 = 196\n14:07\nminus 28 x\n14:16\nSo let's solve for x.\n14:22\nWe'll do a couple of things. We'll subtract 225 from both sides\n14:28\nand I'm going to add 28x to both sides\n14:36\nOn the left hand side we are left with 28 x is equal to\n14:43\nand we have to do a little bit of math\n14:44\n[does arithmetic aloud] 365. Did I do that right?\n15:00\nAnd from that we want to subtract 225\n15:07\nIt is going to be 140\n15:10\nso x is going to be 140 divided by 28\n15:19\nLet's think about it. It goes 5 times. 5 times 20 is 100,\n15:25\n5 times 8 is 40, so 5 times 28 is 140\n15:28\nSo x in this situation is equal to 5.\n15:33\nSo we can use that information to figure out this height.\n15:37\nWe know from the pythagorean theorem that\n15:38\n5 squared plus h squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared.\n15:41\nIt's equal to 169\n15:47\nor h squared = 169 -25 = 144.\n15:53\nh is equal to 12\n15:58\nNow we can figure out the area of the triangle.\n16:00\nThe area sometimes denoted by brackets [ABC] is equal to\n16:06\n1/2 times 14 times 12\n16:13\nwhich is the same as 7 times 12, which is equal to 84\n16:19\nThat's just the area of these 9 congruent triangles.\n16:26\nWe know that the area of the whole thing will be 12/9 of that\n16:34\nSo the area of the star is going to be equal to 12/9 times 84\n16:50\n12/9, dividing numerator and denominator by 3 is the same as 4/3\n17:02\n3 does go into 84. How many times? Is it 28?\n17:06\nLet me make sure. 2*3 = 6, so yup, 28 times.\n17:15\nSo this is equal to 4 times 28\n17:19\nWhich is going to be 80 plus 32\n17:23\nwhich is equal to 112.\n17:28\nLet me make sure I did that right\n17:32\n4 times 20 is 80 plus 32 is 112.\n17:37\nAnd we are done!",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nHere some picture of what most people associate when they think of chemistry.\n0:05\nThey think of scientists working on a bench\n0:08\nwith the different vials of different chemicals.\n0:11\nThey might think of a mad scientist.\n0:14\nSome of them boiling and changing colors.\n0:16\nThey might associate chemistry with chemical equations.\n0:19\nThinking about how different things will react together\n0:22\nto form other things.\n0:24\nThey might think about models of the different molecules\n0:28\nthat can be depicted different ways.\n0:30\nThey might associate it with the periodic table of elements.\n0:33\nAnd all of these things are a big part of chemistry.\n0:38\nBut I want you to do in this video\n0:39\nis appreciate what at its essence chemistry is all about.\n0:45\nAnd chemistry is one of the sciences\n0:47\nthat really just helps us understand\n0:50\nand make models and make predictions about our reality.\n0:55\nAnd even something like the periodic table of elements,\n0:57\nwhich you'll see at the front of any chemistry classroom,\n1:00\nyou take it for granted.\n1:02\nBut this is the product of, frankly,\n1:05\nthousands of years of human beings\n1:08\ntrying to get to an understanding\n1:10\nof all of the different complexity in the world.\n1:13\nIf you look at the world around us,\n1:15\nand it doesn't even have to be our planet,\n1:17\nit could be the universe around us,\n1:19\nyou see all these different substances\n1:21\nthat seem to be different in certain ways.\n1:24\nYou see things like fire and rock and water.\n1:28\nEven in the planets,\n1:29\nyou see meteorological patterns.\n1:32\nIn life, you see all of this complexity\n1:35\nand all of these different things\n1:36\nand it looks like there's just like a infinite spectrum\n1:39\nof differentness out of there.\n1:40\nOf different substances.\n1:42\nEven in things like our human brain.\n1:43\nThe complexity and the electrochemical interactions.\n1:47\nAnd you could imagine as a species,\n1:50\nthis is kind of overwhelming.\n1:51\nHow do you make the sense of all of this?\n1:53\nAnd it was not an easy path,\n1:57\nbut over thousands of years,\n1:59\nwe did start to make sense of it.\n2:01\nAnd why it's very lucky for all of us\n2:03\nto be born when we are now\n2:05\nor to be around when we are now.\n2:07\nTo be able to learn chemistry where we are now\n2:09\nis that we get the answer.\n2:10\nAnd it's a partial answer, which is also exciting,\n2:13\ncause we don't want the full answer.\n2:15\nBut it's a partial answer that takes us a long way.\n2:17\nWe realize that the periodic table of elements,\n2:19\nthat all of this complexity that we're seeing before,\n2:23\nthat at the end of the day,\n2:24\nthings are made of basic building blocks.\n2:27\nKind of you could imagine the legos\n2:29\nthat really make up everything.\n2:31\nAnd there aren't an infinite number of legos.\n2:33\nThere's actually a finite number of them.\n2:34\nWe're discovering more all of the time,\n2:36\nwell not all of the time,\n2:37\nnow new elements are not discovered that frequently,\n2:39\nbut there's a few of these elements\n2:41\nthat are disproportionately showing up\n2:44\nin a lot of what we see here.\n2:45\nThese things that seem so different.\n2:48\nWell a lot of this is different compositions of elements\n2:51\nlike carbon and oxygen and hydrogen.\n2:54\nAnd even the elements themselves are made of things\n2:56\nlike protons and electrons and neutrons\n3:00\nthat are just rearranged in different ways\n3:02\nto give us these elements\n3:04\nthat have all of these different properties.\n3:08\nSo when you think about chemistry,\n3:10\nyes, it might visually look something like this.\n3:15\nThese are obviously much older pictures.\n3:17\nBut at its essence, it's how do we create models\n3:20\nand understand the models that describe\n3:23\na lot of the complexity in the universe around us?\n3:27\nAnd just to put chemistry in,\n3:29\nI guess you could say, in context\n3:31\nwith some of the other sciences,\n3:34\nmany people would say at the purest level,\n3:37\nyou would have mathematics.\n3:40\nThat math, you're studying ideas,\n3:43\nwhich could even be independent,\n3:46\nyou're seeing logical ideas that could be even independent\n3:48\nof anything that you've ever observed or experienced.\n3:51\nAnd a lot of folks that say if we ever communicate\n3:54\nwith another intelligent species\n3:56\nthat could be completely different than us,\n3:58\nmath might be that common language.\n4:00\nBecause even if we perceive the world differently\n4:03\nand think differently in certain ways,\n4:05\nmath might be that common language.\n4:07\nBut on top of math, we start to say,\n4:10\nwell how is our reality actually structured?\n4:13\nAt the most basic level,\n4:15\nwhat are the constituents of matter\n4:17\nand what are the mathematical properties\n4:19\nthat describe how they react together?\n4:22\nAnd then, or interact with each other?\n4:24\nThen you go one level above that,\n4:26\nyou get to the topic of this video, which is chemistry.\n4:30\nWhich is very closely related to physics.\n4:34\nWhen we talk about these chemical equations\n4:36\nand we create these molecular structures,\n4:38\nthe interactions between these atoms,\n4:41\nthese are quantum mechanical interactions\n4:45\nwhich we do not fully understand at the deepest level yet.\n4:49\nBut with chemistry, we can start to make use\n4:52\nof the math and they physics to start to think about\n4:55\nhow all of these different building blocks\n4:56\ncan interact to explain all sorts of different phenomena.\n5:00\nThis chemical equation you see right here,\n5:02\nthis is combustion.\n5:03\nThis is hydrogen combusting with oxygen\n5:05\nto produce a lot of energy.\n5:07\nTo produce energy.\n5:10\nWhen we imagine combustion, we think of fire.\n5:12\nBut what even is fire at its most fundamental level?\n5:16\nHow do we get,\n5:17\nwhy do we perceive this thing here?\n5:19\nAnd chemistry is super important\n5:21\nbecause on top of that, we build biology.\n5:25\nWe build biology.\n5:27\nAnd as you'll see as you study all of these things,\n5:29\nthere's points where these things start to bleed together.\n5:32\nBut the biology in, say, a human being,\n5:34\nor really in any species,\n5:36\nit's based on molecular interactions.\n5:39\nInteractions between molecules, between atoms,\n5:42\nwhich, at the end of the day, is all about chemistry.\n5:45\nAs I speak, the only reason why I'm able to speak\n5:47\nis because of really,\n5:50\nhard to imagine the number of chemical interactions\n5:53\nhappening in me right now\n5:56\nto create this soundness.\n5:58\nTo create this thing that thinks it exists\n6:00\nthat wants to make a video about how awesome\n6:03\nand amazing chemistry is.\n6:05\nAnd then from biology,\n6:06\nyou can build out on all of everything else.\n6:08\nSo sciences like psychology and economics, which of course,\n6:11\nthese things also leverage math and other things.\n6:14\nBut this gives you kind of a sense\n6:17\nof how we build up and how we explain the reality around us.\n6:22\nAnd not one of these is more important than the other.\n6:25\nThese are all studying incredibly fascinating things\n6:27\nthat as humans beings first became thoughtful\n6:31\nabout their environment,\n6:33\nsaid, \"Gee, why are we here?\n6:35\n\"What is this place?\n6:36\n\"Why do we exist?\n6:37\n\"How do we exist?\"\n6:39\nAnd chemistry builds models\n6:42\nfor us to understand interactions at a scale and a speed\n6:45\nthat we can't directly observe,\n6:47\nbut nonetheless, we can to start to make predictions.\n6:50\nSo that's what's really cool about this.\n6:52\nWhen you study chemistry,\n6:53\nyou should not view this as some type of a chore\n6:56\nthat the school system is forcing you through.\n7:00\nThere are people who would've done anything 100 years ago\n7:04\nto get the answers that are in your chemistry book today\n7:07\nor that you can learn from your chemistry teacher\n7:09\nor that you can learn from a Khan Academy video.\n7:11\nThere are people in the world in the past and today\n7:14\nwho'd do anything to be able to understand deeply\n7:16\nwhat this is.\n7:17\nThat they consider it a privilege\n7:19\nto be able to learn at this level.\n7:23\nAnd then to think about where this could go\n7:25\nbecause none of these fields are complete.\n7:27\nWe have very partial knowledge of all of these fields.\n7:30\nArguably, there's an infinite more that we could learn\n7:33\nrelative to what we know.\n7:35\nBut what's exciting is that we have such a strong start.\n7:37\nWe're starting to make sense of it.\n7:39\nTo really describe everything in our reality.",

the equation x\n0:15\nto the third power is equal to 1.\n0:18\nSo we want to find all of the real and/or complex roots\n0:22\nof this equation right over here.\n0:24\nThis is the same thing as x to the third minus 1\n0:27\nis equal to 0.\n0:27\nSo we're looking for all the real and complex roots of this.\n0:31\nAnd there are ways to do this without exponential form\n0:34\nof a complex number.\n0:35\nBut the technique we're going to see in this video\n0:38\ncould be applied if this was x to the fifth minus 1,\n0:40\nor x to the 13th minus 1.\n0:42\nAnd it's also going to show us the patterns that\n0:46\nemerge when you start looking at things on an Argand diagram.\n0:49\nSo to do this, let's think about the exponential representation\n0:54\nof 1.\n0:55\nSo let's just say z is equal to 1.\n0:57\n1 is a complex number.\n0:59\nIt's a real number.\n1:00\nAll real numbers are also complex numbers.\n1:02\nThey're a subset.\n1:04\nThey're in the complex plane.\n1:07\nThey just don't have an imaginary part.\n1:10\nSo let's draw this on an Argand diagram.\n1:13\nSo that's my real axis.\n1:15\nThis is my imaginary axis.\n1:22\nAnd so this is the real.\n1:24\nThis is the imaginary.\n1:26\nAnd if I wanted to represent z equals 1,\n1:29\nit only has a real part.\n1:31\nSo let me just draw 1 all around.\n1:33\nNegative 1.\n1:35\nNegative 1.\n1:36\nz looks like this.\n1:42\nz would look like that, a position\n1:44\nvector that just goes to 1, 0.\n1:47\nOne way to view it-- this is the same thing as equal to 1\n1:51\nplus 0i.\n1:54\nNow, let's put this in exponential form.\n1:57\nWell, its magnitude is pretty straightforward.\n2:00\nThe magnitude of z is just the length of this vector,\n2:03\nor it's the absolute value of 1.\n2:06\nThat's just going to be 1.\n2:09\nNow, what's the argument of z?\n2:14\nWhat's the angle that this vector\n2:15\nmakes with the positive real axis?\n2:19\nWell, it's on the positive real axis.\n2:20\nIt's a real number.\n2:22\nSo it has no angle.\n2:23\nSo the arg of z is 0.\n2:26\nSo that might not be too interesting so far.\n2:30\nWe just figured out that 1 is equal to 1 times e to the 0i.\n2:40\nAnd this is kind of obvious.\n2:41\ne to the 0-- this is just going to be 0.\n2:44\n0 times i is 0.\n2:45\ne to the 0 is going to be 1, times 1 is equal to 1.\n2:47\nNot a big deal there.\n2:49\nBut what is neat is that this argument-- you could view it\n2:52\nas 0 radians, or you could go all the way around\n2:55\nand add 2 pi to it and get to the same point.\n3:02\nSo the argument of our complex number-- or of the number 1,\n3:07\nreally-- could also be an angle of 2 pi, or an angle of 4 pi,\n3:12\nor an angle of 6 pi, or an angle of 8 pi.\n3:15\nSo we can write 1 as 1 times e-- I\n3:20\nwon't write the 1 anymore-- 1 times\n3:22\ne to the 2 pi i, or 1 times e to the 4 pi i.\n3:31\nAnd the reason why this is interesting\n3:32\nis then this equation right here can\n3:35\nbe written in multiple ways.\n3:36\nIt can be written as x to the third is equal to 1.\n3:42\nIt could be written as x to the third\n3:44\nis equal to e to the 2 pi i.\n3:49\nOr it could be written as x to the third\n3:52\nis equal to e to the 4 pi i.\n3:57\nAnd this is interesting, and we're\n3:59\ngoing to see this in a second.\n4:00\nLet's take both sides of all these equations\n4:02\nto the one-third power to solve for x.\n4:04\nSo to the one-third.\n4:06\nWe're going to take that to the one-third.\n4:08\nWe're going to do that same thing over here.\n4:10\nWe're just taking everything to the one-third power\n4:12\nto solve for the x's in each of these equations.\n4:16\nTo the one-third power.\n4:18\nSo this first equation over here becomes x is equal to 1\n4:21\nto the one-third power, which is just equal to 1.\n4:25\nNow, what's the second equation become?\n4:27\nThis second equation-- x is equal to e to the-- well,\n4:31\nthis is going to be the 2 pi over 3, i power.\n4:41\nAnd then this equation over here is\n4:43\ngoing to be-- so x is going to be equal to-- obviously,\n4:46\nthe 3 to the one-third, that just becomes x to the 1.\n4:50\nLet me do that same blue.\n4:52\nx over here is going to be equal to e to the 4 pi over 3, i.\n5:03\nSo let's think about this for a little bit.\n5:06\nWhat is this?\n5:08\nSo immediately, what's the argument here?\n5:11\nSo these are three different roots.\n5:14\nLet me call this x1, x2, and x3.\n5:18\nSo these are three different numbers.\n5:20\nOne of the roots is 1.\n5:22\nThat's pretty clear over here.\n5:23\n1 is one of the cube roots of itself.\n5:26\nBut these are other numbers.\n5:28\nAnd these are going to be complex numbers.\n5:30\nSo let's visualize these numbers a little bit.\n5:33\nSo what is the argument?\n5:39\nThe magnitude of x2 is still clearly 1.\n5:41\nIt's the coefficient out in front of the e.\n5:44\nIt's clearly 1.\n5:46\nLet me do that same color.\n5:48\nThe magnitude of x3 is also clearly going to be 1.\n5:52\nBut what is the argument of x2?\n5:55\nWhat is phi?\n5:57\nWhat is the argument?\n5:59\nWell, it's 2 pi over 3.\n6:02\nSo how would we draw x2?\n6:06\nSo the angle is 2 pi over 3.\n6:09\nIt's easier for me to visualize in degrees.\n6:11\nSo 2 pi is 360 degrees.\n6:14\n360 degrees divided by 3 is 120 degrees.\n6:18\nSo this is going to be-- 120 degrees\n6:20\nis 60 short of-- so it's going to look like this.\n6:29\nSo this angle right here, its argument\n6:31\nis going to be 120 degrees, which\n6:34\nis the same thing as 2 pi over 3.\n6:38\nAnd it's going to have the exact same length.\n6:40\nSo let me do it in the same color.\n6:41\nSo this is x1.\n6:43\nSo that is this green color right over here.\n6:46\nx2 is this magenta one right over here.\n6:50\nAnd they all have the same magnitude.\n6:51\nSo we really just rotate it.\n6:53\nWe rotate it 120 degrees.\n6:54\nAnd what about x3?\n6:55\nWhat's its argument?\n6:57\nWhat's x3's argument?\n7:00\nIts argument is 4 pi over 3.\n7:04\nThat's the same thing as 720 degrees over 3,\n7:09\nif we were to put it into degrees.\n7:11\nAnd so 3 goes into 720-- what is it?\n7:16\n240?\n7:18\n720.\n7:19\n240.\n7:22\nRight.\n7:22\nI should have known that.\n7:24\nSo 240 degrees-- we're going to go 180 degrees,\n7:27\nand then go another 60 degrees.\n7:29\nSo it's going to be right over here.\n7:35\nSo let me draw it like this.\n7:36\nIt's going to be right over here.\n7:41\nThat angle right over there is 4 pi\n7:44\nover 3 radians, which is equal to 240 degrees.\n7:52\nAnd once again, it has the same magnitude.\n7:55\nSo what we just saw is when I take the cube\n7:57\nroots of this real number, I'm essentially\n8:00\ntaking the entire-- I guess we could\n8:02\ncall it the entire circle or the entire 360\n8:05\ndegrees or the entire 2 pi radians--\n8:07\nand I'm dividing it into three, essentially.\n8:12\nThis is one third.\n8:13\nThen we have another 120 degrees.\n8:15\nAnd then we have another 120 degrees.\n8:17\nAnd so you see the pattern of where all of the roots are.\n8:20\nAnd in case you're still not satisfied,\n8:21\nyou're just like, well, you said you would find complex roots.\n8:24\nYeah, I'm not used to this or this\n8:27\nas actually being complex numbers.\n8:30\nI actually want it to be in the form a plus bi-- we can easily\n8:34\nfigure it out from this right over here.\n8:36\nSo x2-- it's going to be equal to the cosine of 2 pi over 3\n8:47\nplus i times the sine of 2 pi over 3.\n8:55\nAnd if you look at this over here,\n8:57\nwe can figure out what those things are going to be.\n8:59\nThis is the angle right over here.\n9:01\nIf this angle right over here is 60 degrees-- which\n9:04\nit is, because this up here is 30\n9:05\ndegrees-- the hypotenuse, or the length, is 1, then\n9:09\nthis over here is square root of 3 over 2.\n9:12\nAnd then this distance right over here is negative 1/2.\n9:16\nSo x2 is going to be equal to-- cosine of 2 pi over 3\n9:23\nis-- negative 1/2.\n9:26\nDid I do that right?\n9:27\nYep, negative 1/2, plus i times sine of 2 pi over 3.\n9:32\nThat's this height over here, which\n9:33\nis square root of 3 over 2, i.\n9:37\nSo that's x2.\n9:38\nAnd we could do the exact same thing with x3.\n9:42\nx3 is going to be equal to its x value.\n9:45\nOr I should say its real value is\n9:47\ngoing to be the exact same thing.\n9:48\nIt's going to be negative 1/2.\n9:51\nAnd then, its imaginary value, so this angle right\n9:56\nover here-- this just from the negative real axis down\n10:00\nto the vector-- is going to be negative 60 degrees.\n10:03\nSo this height right over here is\n10:05\ngoing to be negative square root of 3 over 2.\n10:08\nSo it's negative 1/2 minus the square root of 3 over 2, i.\n10:13\nSo using this technique, we were able to find\n10:17\nthe three complex roots of 1.\n10:20\nThis is one of them.\n10:22\nThis is another one.\n10:24\nAnd of course, 1 is one of them as well.\n10:27\nWhere did we do that?\n10:27\n1 is one of them as well.\n10:29\nAnd you could use this exact same technique\n10:31\nif we were finding the fourth roots.\n10:32\nWe would take the 2 pi radians, or the 360 degrees,\n10:36\nand divide it into 4.\n10:37\nAnd so it would actually be this.\n10:38\nIt would be i.\n10:40\nIt would be negative 1.\n10:41\nAnd it would be negative i.\n10:42\nAnd we know if you take i to the fourth, you get 1.\n10:44\nIf you take negative i to the fourth, you get 1.\n10:48\nAnd if you take negative 1 to the fourth, you get 1.\n10:50\nAnd if you take 1 to the fourth, you get 1.\n10:52\nAnd so you can find the eighth roots of 1\n10:54\nusing this technique.\n10:56\nNow, the other question that might be popping in your brain\n10:59\nis, why did I stop at e to the 4 pi i?\n11:03\nWhy didn't I go on and say, well,\n11:05\nthis is equal to e to the 6 pi i and look for another root?\n11:08\nAnd so if I did that, if I said x to the third-- let's say\n11:11\nI wanted to find a fourth root here, maybe.\n11:13\nx to the third is equal to e to the 6 pi i.\n11:18\nAnd I take both sides of this equation\n11:20\nto the one-third power.\n11:22\nTaking this to the one third, I would get e to the 2 pi i.\n11:28\nWell, what's e to the 2 pi i? e to the 2 pi\n11:30\ni would just get us back to 1.\n11:32\nSo when I added 2 pi again, it just gets us back to this root\n11:35\nagain.\n11:36\nIf I took e to the 6 pi, if I took e to the 8 pi,\n11:39\nI would get this root again.\n11:40\nSo you're going to get only three roots if you're\n11:46\nfinding the third roots of something.\n11:49\nAnything beyond that, it just becomes redundant.",

right over here has length x.\n0:15\nAnd what I'm going to think about is how large\n0:18\nor how small that value x can be.\n0:21\nHow large or small can this side be?\n0:24\nSo the first question is how small can it get?\n0:29\nWell, if we want to make this small,\n0:30\nwe would just literally have to look\n0:32\nat this angle right over here.\n0:34\nSo let me take a look at this angle and make it smaller.\n0:37\nSo let's try to make that angle as small as possible.\n0:40\nSo we have our 10 side.\n0:43\nActually let me do it down here.\n0:46\nSo you have your 10 side, the side of length

dimension.\n1:01\nWe lose our two-dimensionality there.\n1:03\nBut as we approach 0, this side starts\n1:06\nto coincide or get closer and closer to the 10 side.\n1:09\nAnd you could imagine the case where it actually\n1:11\ncoincides with it and you actually get the degenerate.\n1:14\nSo if want this point right over here\n1:16\nto get as close as possible to that point over there,\n1:19\nessentially minimizing your distance x,\n1:21\nthe closest way is if you make the angle the way\n1:23\nequal to 0, all the way.\n1:26\nSo let's actually-- let me draw a progression.\n1:28\nSo now the angle is getting smaller.\n1:32\nThis is length 6.\n1:34\nx is getting smaller.\n1:37\nThen we keep making that angle smaller and smaller and smaller\n1:39\nall the way until we get a degenerate triangle.\n1:42\nSo let me draw that pink side.\n1:45\nSo you have the side of length 10.\n1:48\nNow the angle is essentially 0, this angle that we care about.\n1:51\nSo this side is length 6.\n1:56\nAnd so what is the distance between this point\n1:58\nand this point?\n1:59\nAnd that distance is length x.\n2:01\nSo in the degenerate case, this length right over here is x.\n2:06\nWe know that 6 plus x is going to be equal to 10.\n2:09\nSo in this degenerate case, x is going to be equal to 4.\n2:14\nSo if you want this to be a real triangle, at x equals 4\n2:18\nyou've got these points as close as possible.\n2:20\nIt's degenerated into a line, into a line segment.\n2:22\nIf you want this to be a triangle,\n2:24\nx has to be greater than 4.\n2:28\nNow let's think about it the other way.\n2:30\nHow large can x be?\n2:32\nWell to think about larger and larger x's, we\n2:34\nneed to make this angle bigger.\n2:37\nSo let's try to do that.\n2:39\nSo let's draw my 10 side again.\n2:42\nSo this is my 10 side.\n2:46\nI'm going to make that angle bigger and bigger.\n2:48\nSo now let me take my 6 side and put it like that.\n2:52\nAnd so now our angle is getting bigger and bigger and bigger.\n2:55\nIt's approaching 180 degrees.\n2:58\nAt 180 degrees, our triangle once again\n3:01\nwill be turned into a line segment.\n3:03\nIt'll become a degenerate triangle.\n3:04\nSo let me draw the side of length x,\n3:06\ntry to draw it straight.\n3:08\nSo we're trying to maximize the distance\n3:09\nbetween that point and that point.\n3:11\nSo this is side of length x and let's\n3:13\ngo all the way to the degenerate case.\n3:15\nIn the degenerate case, at 180 degrees, the side of length 6\n3:20\nforms a straight line with the side of length 10.\n3:24\nAnd this is how you can get this point and that point\n3:26\nas far apart as possible.\n3:29\nWell, in this situation, what is the distance\n3:30\nbetween that point and that point, which\n3:32\nis the distance which is going to be our x?\n3:36\nWell in this situation, x is going to be 6 plus 10 is 16.\n3:40\nIf x is 16, we have a degenerate triangle.\n3:42\nIf we don't want a degenerate triangle,\n3:44\nif we want to have two dimensions to the triangle,\n3:46\nthen x is going to have to be less than 16.\n3:51\nNow the whole principle that we're working on right over\n3:54\nhere is called the triangle inequality theorem\n3:58\nand it's a pretty basic idea.\n4:00\nThat any one side of a triangle has to be less,\n4:02\nif you don't want a degenerate triangle,\n4:04\nthan the sum of the other two sides.\n4:07\nSo length of a side has to be less\n4:14\nthan the sum of the lengths of other two sides.\n4:23\nIf you're willing to deal with degenerate triangles--\n4:26\nwhere you essentially form a line segment,\n4:27\nyou lose all your dimensionality,\n4:29\nyou turn to a one-dimensional figure--\n4:30\nthen you could say less than or equal,\n4:33\nbut we're just going to stick to non-degenerate triangles.\n4:36\nSo the length of a side has to be less\n4:38\nthan the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.\n4:40\nAnd just using this principle, we\n4:42\ncould have come up with the same exact conclusion.\n4:45\nYou could say, well look, x is one of the sides.\n4:48\nIt has to be less than the sum of the lengths of the other two\n4:51\nsides.\n4:51\nSo it has to be less than 6 plus 10,\n4:58\nor x has to be less than 16-- the exact same result\n5:04\nwe got by visualizing it like this.\n5:07\nYou want to say how large can x be?\n5:09\nWell you could say, well, 10 has to be less than-- Or\n5:16\nhow small can x be?\n5:18\nYou have to say 10 has to be less than 6\n5:23\nplus x, the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.\n5:26\nIf you subtract 6 from both sides right over here,\n5:29\nyou get 4 is less than x, or x is greater than 4.\n5:37\nSo this is a, in some level, it's a kind of a basic idea,\n5:40\nbut it's something that you'll see definitely in geometry.\n5:43\nAnd then you'll go far into other types of mathematics\n5:46\nand you'll see other versions of what's essentially\n5:48\nthis triangle inequality theorem.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the last video we went over the multiplication tables for 1\n0:04\nthrough 9 and I ran out of time, and actually, it was a\n0:06\ngood thing because 1 through 9 are kind of the core\n0:09\nmultiplication tables.\n0:11\nAnd you'll see that if you know all your multiplication tables\n0:13\nfrom 1 to 9, so you know any number between 1 and 9 times\n0:16\nany other number between 1 and 9, you can actually do\n0:19\nany multiplication problem out there.\n0:21\nBut what I want to do now is I want to complete the\n0:23\nmultiplication tables for 10, 11, and 12.\n0:29\nSo what is 10 times-- let's just start with 0.\n0:33\n10 times 0.\n0:35\nAnything times 0 is 0.\n0:39\nTen 0's are 0.\n0:40\n0 plus 0 plus 0 ten times is still 0.\n0:43\nWhat's 10 times 1?\n0:48\nWell that's just 10 one time.\n0:49\nOr 1 plus itself ten times.\n0:52\nThat's 10.\n0:53\nI think this is second nature to you at this point.\n0:56\nWhat's 10 times 2?\n0:59\nI meant to switch colors, but I didn't.\n1:02\n10 times 2?\n1:04\nThat's 10 plus 10, which is 20.\n1:08\nFair enough.\n1:09\nAnd notice, we went up by 10 the first time.\n1:12\nWe went up by 10 again to get to 20.\n1:15\nWhat's 10 times 3?\n1:17\nWell, that's 10 plus 10 plus 10, or we could view it as 10\n1:21\ntimes 2 plus another 10, which is equal to 30.\n1:26\nWhat's 10 times 4?\n1:27\nI think you start to see a pattern.\n1:28\n10 times 4 is equal to 40.\n1:32\nNotice, 10 times 4 is equal to 40.\n1:37\nIf I were to tell you what is 10 times-- let me\n1:42\ndo another color-- 5?\n1:44\nWell that's equal to 50.\n1:50\n10 times anything is that anything with a 0 behind it.\n1:56\nSo the 10 times tables you almost don't\n1:58\nhave to remember it.\n1:59\nSo let's just keep going.\n2:01\nWhat's 10 times 6?\n2:04\nIt's equal to 60.\n2:06\n6 0.\n2:08\nWhat's 10 times 7?\n2:11\n70.\n2:12\n10 times 8?\n2:13\nThis is almost ridiculous.\n2:14\n10 times 8 is 80.\n2:16\n10 times 9?\n2:19\n90.\n2:20\n10 times 10?\n2:21\nNow this is interesting.\n2:25\nSo it'll be a 10-- let's see me write this.\n2:28\nLet me do it in this orange color.\n2:32\n10 times 10.\n2:33\nSo it'll be ten 10's or a 10 with a 0 behind it.\n2:38\nThere you go.\n2:39\nNotice everything-- whatever times 10 I just add a 0 and\n2:41\nthen I get the next number.\n2:42\nSo it's 100.\n2:43\nAnd I think you understand why that is.\n2:45\nI added 10 to itself ten times.\n2:47\nThat each 10-- you go from 10, 20, 30.\n2:51\n30 is just three 10's or 10 times 3.\n2:54\n90 is just nine 10's or 9 times 10.\n2:58\nLet's keep going.\n3:00\nSo 10 times 11 is equal to 11 with a 0 behind it.\n3:05\n110.\n3:06\nFinally, 10 times 12 is equal to 120.\n3:13\nNow, just for fun, these are kind of your 10 times tables.\n3:17\nBut now that t know the pattern you can do anything.\n3:20\nIf I asked you what 5,732 times 10 is, what's it going to be?\n3:29\nIt's going to be this number with just one more 0.\n3:32\nSo it's going to be-- I won't read it out yet.\n3:34\n5 7 3 2 with a 0 behind it.\n3:39\nAnd just so you know, this little comma that I wrote in\n3:41\nthe number there, that's just to make it easier for\n3:44\nme to read that number.\n3:45\nAnd you put the comma-- you start over here and every third\n3:48\nnumber you put the comma.\n3:49\nSo here I'm going to put the comma right here.\n3:53\nI'm going to put the comma right there.\n3:54\nSo now I can read this.\n3:56\nThe comma doesn't really add or take anything away from\n3:59\nthe number, it just helps me read it.\n4:01\nNow 5,732 times 10 is 57,320.\n4:07\ni just had to add a 0 there, but that was a pretty\n4:10\nstraightforward multiplication.\n4:12\nAnd notice, we had 5,000 times 10 and we got to 50 something\n4:16\nthousand when we multiplied them.\n4:19\nSo that's similar to 5 times 10 is equal to 50.\n4:21\nBut instead of 5 I had a 5,000, and so I got a 50,000 and\n4:26\nsomething and all this other stuff.\n4:28\nWe're going to learn more about how to do problems\n4:29\nlike this in the future.\n4:30\nBut I thought I would introduce you to the idea that just from\n4:33\nthis little pattern of adding a 0 you already know your\n4:35\n10's times tables.\n4:37\nNow let's do our 11's.\n4:42\nWell, they start off easy, and then they get a little more\n4:44\ndifficult as we get into high numbers.\n4:47\n11 times 0.\n4:49\nThis is easy, this is 0.\n4:51\n11 times 1.\n4:52\nThis is also easy.\n4:54\nIt's 11.\n4:56\n11 times 2.\n4:57\nWe're going to start seeing a pattern here.\n4:59\nIt's 11 plus 11 or we could've added 2 to itself eleven times,\n5:03\nbut that is equal to 22.\n5:06\nIf we do 11 times 3 it is equal to 33.\n5:11\n11 times 4 is equal to 44.\n5:15\nI think this is becoming obvious to you.\n5:16\nWhat's 11 times 5?\n5:18\n11 times 5 is 55.\n5:20\nNotice I put the 5 twice.\n5:23\nWhat's 11 times 6?\n5:24\nIt's 66.\n5:27\n11 times 7 is 84-- no.\n5:30\nI'm kidding.\n5:32\nI didn't want to mess with you like that.\n5:33\nBut no.\n5:34\nOf course, it's 77.\n5:37\nYou just repeat the number twice.\n5:41\nLet me switch colors.\n5:42\n11 times 8 is equal to 88.\n5:46\n11 times 9 is equal to 99.\n5:50\nNow what's 11 times 12?\n5:54\nOh sorry, I skipped 10.\n5:56\n11 times 10.\n5:58\nYou might want to say it's 1,010.\n6:00\nNo.\n6:00\nThat's wrong.\n6:01\nIt's not 1,010.\n6:05\nSo that little pattern that we had where you just repeat the\n6:07\nnumber, that only worked for one-digit numbers.\n6:10\nSo it only worked for 1 through 9.\n6:11\n11 times 10?\n6:12\nWell, we could think about it a couple of ways.\n6:14\nWe can add 11 to 99.\n6:16\nSo we can say it's 99 plus 11.\n6:20\nAnd what's that?\n6:21\nThat's equal to 110.\n6:23\nAnd I'm going to show you how to do-- well, hopefully you've\n6:25\nalready watched the video on how to add two-digit numbers\n6:28\nlike this, but that's 110.\n6:30\nOr you could just use the property from the 10's times\n6:32\ntables that we learned where if you just take 11 times 10 you\n6:36\nadd a 0 to the 11, you get 110.\n6:37\nThat's the 11 right there.\n6:39\nFinally, let's do 11 times 12.\n6:44\nNo easy way to remember this, you just kind of\n6:46\nshould remember it.\n6:47\nOr you could say look, it's going to be 11 more\n6:49\nthan 11 times-- sorry.\n6:51\nI keep skipping things.\n6:53\nWe should do 11 times 11 first.\n6:55\nLet me make sure this is clear.\n6:56\nWe're doing 11 times 11 before we go to 11 times 12.\n7:00\nSo 11 times 11 is going to be 11 more than 11 times 10.\n7:05\nSo we add 11 to this.\n7:07\n11 plus 110 is 121.\n7:13\nAnd actually, as you'll see, there actually is an order as\n7:15\nwe get to higher multiples of 11, but I'll leave that\n7:18\nto a future video.\n7:20\nAnd then finally, we're at 11 times 12.\n7:26\nAnd we could add 11 to itself twelve times.\n7:28\nWe could add 12 to itself eleven times.\n7:30\nOr we could just say, hey, is going to be 11 more\n7:35\nthan 11 times 11.\n7:37\nSo that is what?\n7:38\nYou add 11 to this.\n7:40\nWhat do you get?\n7:41\nYou get 132.\n7:46\nI just added 121 plus 11 and then got 132.\n7:51\nNow the other way you could have said it is, well,\n7:52\nwhat's 10 times 12?\n7:54\nWe already knew that.\n7:56\nThat was 120.\n7:58\nSo 11 times 12 because we're multiplying 12 by one more\n8:02\nshould be 12 more than that.\n8:04\nSo that should be 132.\n8:06\nSo two ways to get the exact same answer.\n8:10\nAll right, now let's do our 12 times tables.\n8:15\nAnd once you know this you are ready to tackle any type\n8:18\nof multiplication problem.\n8:19\nBut we'll do that in future videos.\n8:21\nSo 12 times 0.\n8:24\nSuper easy.\n8:24\n0.\n8:25\n12 times 1.\n8:26\nAlso super easy.\n8:27\nIs 12.\n8:28\nNow it gets interesting.\n8:29\nWe're going to increase by 12 every time.\n8:33\n12 times 2 is equal to 24.\n8:37\n12 plus 12 is 24.\n8:39\n12 times-- not 22.\n8:43\nLet me rewrite that.\n8:44\n12 times 3 is going to be 12 plus 12 plus 12.\n8:50\nOr we could write that as 12 times 2.\n8:53\nI see my brain is doing the wrong things.\n8:56\nWe could rewrite that as 12 times 2 plus 12.\n9:00\nOr we could rewrite that as 24 plus 12.\n9:03\nEither way, all of these get us to 36.\n9:07\nAnd notice, that's just that plus 12.\n9:10\n12 times 4.\n9:12\n12 times 4 is equal to 48.\n9:17\nThere's a lot of ways you could think about it.\n9:18\nYou could say 11 times 4 is 44.\n9:25\nAnd you go up by one more 4, so you get to 12 times 4.\n9:30\nOr you could say 12 times 3 is 36 and you can add one\n9:33\n12 to it to get to 48.\n9:36\nEither way works and that's because you can multiply\n9:39\nin either direction.\n9:40\nLet's keep going.\n9:42\n12 times 5 is equal to 60.\n9:47\n10 times 5 is 50, 11 times 5 is 55, so 12 times 5 is 60.\n9:55\n12 times 6 is equal to what?\n9:58\nIt's going to be 12 more than this.\n10:00\nIt's going to equal 72.\n10:02\n12 times 7.\n10:04\n12 more than this again.\n10:06\n12 more than 72 is 84.\n10:09\nAnd I'm serious, I'm probably a lot older than you are and I\n10:15\nstill, in my head to confirm, I go to some 12 times tables that\n10:19\nI remember as definitely right.\n10:20\nLike oh, 12 times 5-- and sometimes in my head I say,\n10:23\noh, let me add another 12.\n10:24\nOh yeah, definitely, my memory was correct.\n10:26\n12 times 6 is 72.\n10:28\nAll right.\n10:29\nThen you go to 12 times 8.\n10:31\nAdd 12 to the 12 times 7.\n10:34\n96.\n10:35\n12 times 9 .\n10:38\nWell you add 12 to this, so it's 108.\n10:44\nAnd then 12 times 10.\n10:46\nThis is an easy one.\n10:48\nWe just add a 0 to the 12 to get 120.\n10:51\nOr we could've added 12 to 108.\n10:54\nEither way.\n10:55\n12 times 11.\n10:58\nWe just did this.\n10:59\nYou add 12 to this you get to 132.\n11:02\nAnd then 12 times 12 is equal to 144.\n11:09\nAnd this actually shows up.\n11:10\nIf I had a dozen of a dozen eggs-- a dozen is 12.\n11:13\nOr if I had, I think a gross is actually 12 dozens.\n11:17\nSo that's 144 eggs.\n11:18\nYou'll actually end up seeing this number a lot.\n11:20\nMore than you would expect in life.\n11:22\nBut anyway, we've now completed all of our\n11:25\nmultiplication tables.\n11:27\nAnd I really encourage you to take the time now to\n11:29\ngo and memorize them.\n11:30\nMake some flash cards.\n11:33\nUse the little software thing that I wrote on my website.\n11:37\nYou could try that out.\n11:38\nAs of September 2009 it's working.\n11:41\nI haven't touched it in a while, but I'm actually\n11:43\nprobably going to rebuild it soon.\n11:45\nSo if you're watching this video in the year 2200.\n11:48\nWell, I would probably not exist anymore.\n11:50\nBut hopefully you'll get a better version of\n11:52\nthe software app.\n11:53\nBut you should practice it.\n11:55\nYou should get your parents to quiz you.\n11:56\nYou should get notes cards.\n11:58\nYou should just be mumbling to yourself as you walk to\n12:00\nschool-- what is 12 times 9?\n12:02\nWhat is 11 times 11?\n12:03\nAnd you should quiz each other because it'll pay huge rewards\n12:07\nto you later on in life.\n12:08\nSee you in the next

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nI think it's very important to have as many ways as possible\n0:04\nto view a certain type of problem, so I want to introduce\n0:06\nyou to a different way.\n0:07\nSome people might have taught this first, but the way I\n0:10\ntaught it in the first integral video is kind of the way that I\n0:15\nalways think about when I do the problems.\n0:17\nBut sometimes, it's more useful to think about it the way I'm\n0:19\nabout to show you, and maybe you won't see the difference,\n0:21\nor maybe you'll say, oh, Sal, those are just the\n0:22\nexact same thing.\n0:24\nSomeone actually emailed me and told me that I should make it\n0:26\nso I can scroll things, and I said, oh, that's not\n0:28\ntoo hard to do.\n0:28\nSo I just did that, and I scrolled my drawing.\n0:32\nBut anyway, let's say we have a surface in 3 dimensions.\n0:34\nIt's a function of x and y.\n0:36\nYou give me a coordinate down here, and I'll tell you\n0:38\nhow high the surface is at that point.\n0:40\nAnd we want to figure out the volume under that surface.\n0:43\nSo.\n0:44\nWe can very easily figure out the volume of a very small\n0:49\ncolumn underneath the surface.\n0:52\nSo this whole volume is what we're trying to figure out,\n0:55\nright, between the dotted lines.\n0:57\nI think you can see it.\n0:59\nYou have some experience visualizing this right now.\n1:01\nSo let's say that I have a little area here.\n1:05\nWe could call that da.\n1:09\nLet me see if I can draw this.\n1:12\nLet's say we have a little area down here, a little\n1:15\nsquare in the x-y plane.\n1:17\nAnd it's, depending on how you view it, this side of it is dx,\n1:23\nits length is dx, and the height, you could say,\n1:27\non that side, is dy.\n1:29\nRight?\n1:30\nBecause it's a little small change in y there, and it's a\n1:33\nlittle small change in x here.\n1:36\nAnd its area, the area of this little square, is\n1:40\ngoing to be dx times dy.\n1:42\nAnd if we wanted to figure out the volume of the solid between\n1:47\nthis little area and the surface, we could just multiply\n1:52\nthis area times the function.\n1:54\nRight?\n1:55\nBecause the height at this point is going to be the\n1:57\nvalue of the function, roughly, at this point.\n1:59\nRight?\n1:59\nThis is going to be an approximation, and then we're\n2:00\ngoing to take an infinite sum.\n2:01\nI think you know where this is going.\n2:03\nBut let me do that.\n2:04\nLet me at least draw the little column that I want to show you.\n2:10\nSo that's one end of it, that's another end of it, that's the\n2:16\nfront end of it, that's the other end of it.\n2:21\nSo we have a little figure that looks something like that.\n2:25\nA little column, right?\n2:28\nIt intersects the top of the surface.\n2:30\nAnd the volume of this column, not too difficult.\n2:33\nIt's going to be this little area down here, which is,\n2:38\nwe could call that da.\n2:41\nSometimes written like that. da.\n2:43\nIt's a little area.\n2:44\nAnd we're going to multiply that area times the height of\n2:47\nthis column, and that's the function at that point.\n2:51\nSo it's f of x and y.\n2:56\nAnd of course, we could have also written it as, this\n2:58\nda is just dx times dy, or dy times dx.\n3:02\nI'm going to write it in every different way.\n3:04\nSo we could also have written this as f of\n3:08\nxy times dx times dy.\n3:12\nAnd of course, since multiplication is associative,\n3:14\nI could have also written it as f of xy times dy dx.\n3:21\nThese are all equivalent, and these all represent the volume\n3:24\nof this column, that's the between this little area\n3:29\nhere and the surface.\n3:31\nSo now, if we wanted to figure out the volume of the entire\n3:35\nsurface, we have a couple of things we could do.\n3:37\nWe could add up all of the volumes in the x-direction,\n3:42\nbetween the lower x-bound and the upper x-bound, and then\n3:45\nwe'd have kind of a thin sheet, although it will already have\n3:49\nsome depth, because we're not adding up just the x's.\n3:51\nThere's also a dy back there.\n3:53\nSo we would have a volume of a figure that would extend from\n3:56\nthe lower x all the way to the upper x, go back dy,\n4:03\nand come back here.\n4:04\nIf we wanted to sum up all the dx's.\n4:07\nAnd if we wanted to do that, which expression would we use?\n4:11\nWell, we would be summing with respect to x first, so we could\n4:15\nuse this expression, right?\n4:19\nAnd actually, we could write it here, but it\n4:21\njust becomes confusing.\n4:21\nIf we're summing with respect to x, but we have the\n4:24\ndy written here first.\n4:26\nIt's really not incorrect, but it just becomes a little\n4:28\nambiguous, are we summing with respect to x or y.\n4:30\nBut here, we could say, OK.\n4:32\nIf we want to sum up all the dx's first, let's do that.\n4:36\nWe're taking the sum with respect to x, and let me, I'm\n4:38\ngoing to write down the actual, normally I just write numbers\n4:41\nhere, but I'm going to say, well, the lower bound here is x\n4:44\nis equal to a, and the upper bound here is x is equal to b.\n4:54\nAnd that'll give us the volume of, you could imagine a\n4:57\nsheet with depth, right?\n4:59\nThe sheet is going to be parallel to the x-axis, right?\n5:03\nAnd then once we have that sheet, in my video, I think\n5:07\nthat's the newspaper people trying to sell me something.\n5:10\nAnyway.\n5:11\nSo once we have the sheet, I'll try to draw it here, too, I\n5:13\ndon't want to get this picture too muddied up, but once we\n5:16\nhave that sheet, then we can integrate those, we can\n5:20\nadd up the dy's, right?\n5:21\nBecause this width right here is still dy.\n5:23\nWe could add up of all the different dy's, and we\n5:25\nwould have the volume of the whole figure.\n5:27\nSo once we take this sum, then we could take this sum.\n5:30\nWhere y is going from it's bottom, which we said with c,\n5:35\nfrom y is equal to c to y's upper bound, to y\n5:39\nis equal to d.\n5:42\nFair enough.\n5:42\nAnd then, once we evaluate this whole thing, we have the\n5:45\nvolume of this solid, or the volume under the surface.\n5:49\nNow we could have gone the other way.\n5:51\nI know this gets a little bit messy, but I think\n5:53\nyou get what I'm saying.\n5:54\nLet's start with that little da we had originally.\n6:00\nInstead of going this way, instead of summing up the dx's\n6:04\nand getting this sheet, let's sum up the dy's first, right?\n6:08\nSo we could take, we're summing in the y-direction first.\n6:12\nWe would get a sheet that's parallel to the y-axis, now.\n6:16\nSo the top of the sheet would look something like that.\n6:21\nSo if we're coming the dy's first, we would take the sum,\n6:25\nwe would take the integral with respect to y, and it would be,\n6:28\nthe lower bound would be y is equal to c, and the upper\n6:33\nbound is y is equal to d.\n6:36\nAnd then we would have that sheet with a little depth, the\n6:39\ndepth is dx, and then we could take the sum of all of those,\n6:44\nsorry, my throat is dry.\n6:46\nI just had a bunch of almonds to get power to be able\n6:50\nto record these videos.\n6:52\nBut once I have one of these sheets, and if I want to sum up\n6:54\nall of the x's, then I could take the infinite sum of\n6:58\ninfinitely small columns, or in this view, sheets, infinitely\n7:02\nsmall depths, and the lower bound is x is equal to a, and\n7:08\nthe upper bound is x is equal to b.\n7:10\nAnd once again, I would have the volume of the figure.\n7:12\nAnd all I showed you here is that there's two ways of doing\n7:15\nthe order of integration.\n7:17\nNow, another way of saying this, if this little original\n7:21\nsquare was da, and this is a shorthand that you'll see all\n7:24\nthe time, especially in physics textbooks, is that we\n7:27\nare integrating along the domain, right?\n7:33\nBecause the x-y plane here is our domain.\n7:35\nSo we're going to do a double integral, a two-dimensional\n7:37\nintegral, we're saying that the domain here is two-dimensional,\n7:40\nand we're going to take that over f of x and y times da.\n7:48\nAnd the reason why I want to show you this, is you see this\n7:51\nin physics books all the time.\n7:53\nI don't think it's a great thing to do.\n7:55\nBecause it is a shorthand, and maybe it looks simpler, but for\n7:58\nme, whenever I see something that I don't know how to\n8:00\ncompute or that's not obvious for me to know how to compute,\n8:04\nit actually is more confusing.\n8:06\nSo I wanted to just show you that what you see in this\n8:09\nphysics book, when someone writes this, it's the exact\n8:12\nsame thing as this or this.\n8:14\nThe da could either be dx times dy, or it could either be dy\n8:18\ntimes dx, and when they do this double integral over domain,\n8:21\nthat's the same thing is just adding up all of these squares.\n8:24\nWhere we do it here, we're very ordered about it, right?\n8:26\nWe go in the x-direction, and then we add all of those up in\n8:30\nthe y-direction, and we get the entire volume.\n8:32\nOr we could go the other way around.\n8:34\nWhen we say that we're just taking the double integral,\n8:36\nfirst of all, that tells us we're doing it in two\n8:37\ndimensions, over a domain, that leaves it a little bit\n8:40\nambiguous in terms of how we're going to sum\n8:43\nup all of the da's.\n8:45\nAnd they do it intentionally in physics books, because you\n8:47\ndon't have to do it using Cartesian coordinates,\n8:50\nusing x's and y's.\n8:51\nYou can do it in polar coordinates, you could do it\n8:53\na ton of different ways.\n8:55\nBut I just wanted to show you, this is another way to\n8:58\nhaving an intuition of the volume under a surface.\n9:00\nAnd these are the exact same things as this type of\n9:04\nnotation that you might see in a physics book.\n9:07\nSometimes they won't write a domain, sometimes they'd\n9:09\nwrite over a surface.\n9:11\nAnd we'll later do those integrals.\n9:12\nHere the surface is easy, it's a flat plane, but sometimes\n9:15\nit'll end up being a curve or something like that.\n9:17\nBut anyway, I'm almost out of time.\n9:19\nI will see you in the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] What I wanna do in this video is see\n0:01\nif we can find the measure of angle D,\n0:05\nif we could find the measure of angle D\n0:07\nand like always, pause this video,\n0:09\nand see if you can figure it out.\n0:11\nAnd I'll give you a little bit of a hint.\n0:12\nIt'll involve thinking about how an inscribed angle relates\n0:17\nto the corresponding to the measure of the arc\n0:20\nthat it intercepts.\n0:22\nSo, think about it like that.\n0:24\nAll right, so, let's work on this a little bit.\n0:27\nSo, what do we know, what do we know?\n0:31\nWell, angle D, angle D intercepts an arc.\n0:35\nIt intercepts this fairly large arc that I'm going\n0:39\nto highlight right now in this purple color.\n0:42\nSo, it intercepts that arc.\n0:44\nWe don't know the measure of that arc\n0:46\nor at least we don't know the measure of that arc yet.\n0:48\nIf we did know the measure of this arc\n0:50\nthat I'm highlighting, then we know that the measure\n0:53\nof angle D would just be half that because the measure\n0:56\nof an inscribed angle is half the measure\n1:00\nof the arc that it intercepts.\n1:02\nWe've seen that multiple times.\n1:03\nSo, if we knew the measure of this arc,\n1:05\nwe would be able to figure out\n1:07\nwhat the measure of angle D is.\n1:09\nBut we do know, we don't know the measure of that arc,\n1:12\nbut we do know the measure of another arc.\n1:15\nWe do know the measure of the arc that completes the circle.\n1:19\nSo, we do know the measure of this arc.\n1:22\nYou might be saying, hey wait, how do we know\n1:24\nthat measure, it's not labeled.\n1:25\nWell, the reason why we know the measure of this arc\n1:28\nthat I've just highlighted in this teal color is\n1:31\nbecause the inscribed angle that intercepts it,\n1:34\nthey gave us the information,\n1:35\nthey said this is a 45 degree angle.\n1:38\nSo, this is a 45 degree angle.\n1:40\nThen this over here is a 90 degree, 90 degree arc.\n1:44\nThe measure of this arc is 90 degrees.\n1:48\nThe measure of arc, I guess you could say\n1:50\nthis is the measure of arc, I'ma write it this way.\n1:53\nThe measure of arc, WL.\n1:58\nWL is equal to 90 degrees,\n2:03\nit's twice that, the inscribed angle that intercepts it.\n2:07\nNow, why is that helpful?\n2:09\nWell, if you go all the way around the circle,\n2:10\nyou're 360 degrees.\n2:12\nSo, this purple arc that we cared about, that we said hey,\n2:16\nif we could figure out the measure of that,\n2:17\nwe're gonna be able to figure out the measure of angle D.\n2:19\nThat plus arc, WL,\n2:23\nthey are going to add up to 360 degrees.\n2:27\nLet me write that down.\n2:28\nSo, the measure of arc, let's see,\n2:32\nand this is going to be a major arc right over here.\n2:36\nThis is so LIW,\n2:39\nthe measure of arc LIW\n2:43\nplus the measure of arc WL\n2:47\nplus the measure\n2:50\nof arc WL plus this right over here.\n2:54\nThat's going to be equal to 360 degrees.\n2:58\nThis is going to be equal to 360 degrees.\n3:02\nNow, we already know that this is 90 degrees.\n3:05\nWe already know WL is 90 degrees.\n3:08\nSo, if you subtract 90 degrees from both sides,\n3:10\nyou get that the measure of this large arc right over here,\n3:15\nmeasure of arc LIW is going\n3:18\nto be equal to 270 degrees.\n3:21\nI just took 300, I went all the way around the circle,\n3:23\nI subtracted out this 90 degrees\n3:25\nand I'm left with 270 degrees.\n3:28\nSo, let me write that down.\n3:29\nThis is the measure of this arc in purple is 270 degrees.\n3:32\nAnd now, we can figure out the measure of angle D.\n3:34\nIt's an inscribed angle that intercepts that arc\n3:37\nso it's going to have half the measure,\n3:40\nthe angle's going to have half the measure.\n3:42\nSo, half of 270\n3:45\nis 135 degrees and we're done,\n3:49\nand you might notice something interesting,\n3:51\nthat if you add 135 degrees plus 45 degrees,\n3:56\nthat they add up to 180 degrees.\n4:00\nSo, it looks like at least for this case that these angles,\n4:03\nthese opposite angles of this inscribed quadrilateral,\n4:07\nit looks like they are supplementary.\n4:12\nSo, an interesting question is\n4:13\nare they always going to be supplementary?\n4:15\nIf you have a quadrilateral, an arbitrary quadrilateral\n4:19\ninscribed in a circle, so each of the vertices\n4:21\nof the quadrilateral sit on the circle.\n4:24\nIf you have that, are opposite angles of that quadrilateral,\n4:28\nare they always supplementary?\n4:30\nDo they always add up to 180 degrees?\n4:32\nSo, I encourage you to think about that and even prove it\n4:35\nif you get a chance, and the proof is very close\n4:38\nto what we just did here.\n4:39\nIn order to prove it, you would just have to do it\n4:41\nwith more general numbers like, you know,\n4:42\ninstead of saying 45 degrees, you could call this X,\n4:45\nand then you would want to prove that this right over here\n4:47\nwould have to be 180 minus X.\n4:50\nSo, I encourage you to do that on your own\n4:51\nbut I'm gonna do it in a video as well\n4:53\nso you can check if our reasoning is similar.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] We've now seen a couple\n0:01\nof examples of balancing chemical equations.\n0:03\nAnd we've seen that, okay, if let's say,\n0:05\nwe're trying to balance this equation right over here\n0:08\nand we started with the carbons.\n0:09\nI have two carbons on the reactant side.\n0:12\nThey're both sitting in this ethylene molecule.\n0:14\nAnd so I would want two carbons on the product side.\n0:17\nAnd right now, I only have one carbon on the product side.\n0:20\nAnd so what we've done is let's just put a two\n0:23\nout front here and so now we have two\n0:26\nfor every molecule of ethylene\n0:28\nand we're not done balancing this chemical equation yet.\n0:30\nWe're now producing two molecules of carbon dioxide.\n0:35\nBut one thing that you might have been thinking,\n0:37\n\"Why put this big two out front\n0:38\n\"of the entire carbon dioxide,\n0:41\n\"I like the way these little subscript little twos look,\n0:43\n\"so why not put a two right over there. \"\n0:48\nAnd the reason why you can't do that\n0:50\nis that's actually changing the molecule.\n0:53\nIt's no longer carbon dioxide,\n0:54\nit's now this bizarre thing that\n0:56\ndoesn't really exist in nature.\n0:59\nWhich is a C2O2 thing.\n1:02\nYou're actually changing the reaction\n1:03\nwhen you're doing that.\n1:04\nWhen you're balancing chemical reactions,\n1:06\nthe reaction itself is,\n1:08\neven before it's balanced is describing\n1:10\nsomething that happens.\n1:12\nWhen it's unbalanced, it just doesn't\n1:14\nhave the numbers right in terms\n1:17\nof number of molecules.\n1:18\nSo the only thing that you can\n1:19\nchange when you're changing these\n1:21\nis the number of molecules.\n1:23\nYou can't change the number of\n1:25\nconstituents within the molecule.\n1:27\nAnd that's why we do not change these subscripts.\n1:31\nAnd if you want to visualize it a little bit differently,\n1:34\nlet's draw each of these molecules\n1:37\nSo ethylene looks like this.\n1:40\nDouble bond carbons.\n1:42\nThen each carbon is bonded to two hydrogens.\n1:46\nNotice you have two carbons and four hydrogens.\n1:50\nMolecular oxygen, O2.\n1:53\nLooks like this.\n1:54\nIt's oxygen doubled bonded to oxygen.\n1:56\nAnd then you have carbon dioxide.\n2:01\nCarbon dioxide is a carbon, double bonded,\n2:06\nto two oxygens each.\n2:09\nAnd then finally, you have water.\n2:11\nFinally, water, actually I'm going to do\n2:14\nthis in a slightly different color.\n2:16\nYour water right over here,\n2:17\nthis is an oxygen bonded to two hydrogens.\n2:21\nSo let me write the plus signs there.\n2:23\nSo plus is right over there.\n2:26\nSo if you were to somehow write a subscript\n2:30\nof two right over there, you would somehow\n2:32\nbe changing the structure, you would be changing\n2:35\nwhat this molecule is.\n2:38\nAs opposed to that, which we don't want to do,\n2:39\nwe want to say, we're definitely producing carbon dioxide.\n2:42\nWe're definitely producing carbon dioxide,\n2:43\nbut how many carbon dioxides do we produce\n2:45\nfor each molecule of ethylene?\n2:49\nAnd so that's where we say,\n2:51\n\"Okay, we have two carbons here,\n2:52\n\"we want two carbons here.\"\n2:53\nWe don't want to change the actual structure here,\n2:55\nso let's write the two out front.\n2:57\nSo we're going to have two of these.\n3:00\nOr if you want to do it,\n3:01\nif you want to have it more visual,\n3:03\nyou could write it,\n3:04\nokay, we're just going to have another molecule here.\n3:06\nWe're just going to have another molecule.\n3:09\nSo now we've balanced the carbons,\n3:11\ntwo carbons on the reactant side.\n3:13\nTwo carbons on the product side.\n3:16\nAnd then you go to the hydrogens.\n3:18\nSay, \"okay, we have four hydrogens here,\n3:19\n\"we only have two here.\"\n3:21\nWell, what if we had two of these water molecules?\n3:23\nSo, let's draw another water molecule here.\n3:27\nSo O H, and actually let me write\n3:30\nthis right over here, so now we have two of these.\n3:31\nAnd now we have two of these.\n3:36\nAnd now we want to balance the oxygens.\n3:38\nSo let's see, on this side we only have two oxygens.\n3:40\nOn this side we have one, two,\n3:41\nthree, four, five, six oxygens.\n3:46\nIn order to balance it, we're going to\n3:46\nhave six oxygens on the reactant side.\n3:49\nWe need three of these molecules.\n3:52\nSo, another one and another one right over there.\n3:57\nAnd now we're all balanced.\n3:58\nWe have two carbon atoms on both sides.\n4:00\nCarbons, carbons.\n4:02\nWe have four hydrogen atoms on both sides.\n4:05\nHere they're in the ethylene, here they're in the waters.\n4:08\nAnd then we have six oxygen atoms on both sides.\n4:12\nAnd here some of the oxygens are in the carbon dioxides,\n4:15\nsome of them are in the waters.\n4:17\nAnd here, they're all in the molecular oxygens.\n4:20\nBut notice, we didn't change the\n4:22\nactual structure of the molecules.\n4:25\nWe just changed the number of molecules we have and\n4:27\nthat's what these coefficients in front of\n4:31\nthese molecular formulas represent.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's see if we can develop some intuition\n0:03\nas to why the equilibrium constant equation\n0:06\nlooks the way it does.\n0:07\nJust as review, this is it: equilibrium constant.\n0:11\nIt would be the concentration of\n0:14\nour molecule Y raised to its coefficient power or,\n0:18\nif we're thinking in moles,\n0:20\nraised to the number of moles.\n0:21\nIf we think of these as kind of the mole ratios,\n0:24\nor the molar ratios\n0:25\n-- or we could just view them as the molecular ratios,\n0:28\neither way --times the concentration of our molecule Z.\n0:32\nNow, we're not doing some calculus here.\n0:34\nd is just the number of moles we need of Z\n0:38\nfor every c moles of Y,\n0:40\nb moles of X,and a moles of V.\n0:42\nSo it's Z to the d power divided by\n0:46\nthe concentration of V to the a power\n0:49\nand X to the b power.\n0:52\nSo it's a nice, little, clean equation,\n0:55\nbut why does it look this way?\n0:56\nAnd I actually made a video earlier today\n0:59\nwhere I started exploring this with natural logs.\n1:01\nAnd I think I got someplace,\n1:03\nbut that one started to break down.\n1:05\nAnd I think I've come up with a much simpler reason\n1:07\nwhy this looks this way.\n1:08\nSo I've deleted that video,\n1:09\nand I think I've come up with a much more intuitive one\n1:11\nthat explains more of why this works\n1:14\nand actually some of the other things\n1:15\nwe're going to learn about\n1:17\nthe equilibrium constants in future videos.\n1:19\nSo what makes a reaction happen?\n1:23\nOr what does equilibrium mean?\n1:25\nIt means the rate at which\n1:27\nthe forward reaction is happening.\n1:28\nSo that means that the rate of this happening,\n1:34\nof V plus X turning into Y plus Z\n1:42\n-- I can't forget the coefficients--\n1:45\nis going to be equal to the reverse reaction,\n1:50\nis equal to the rate of the reverse reaction.\n1:53\nSo our c moles of Y plus d moles of Z\n1:57\nturning and going the other way,\n1:59\ninto the V and the X with certain ratios.\n2:03\nIt doesn't mean necessarily that\n2:06\nthe concentrations are the same,\n2:07\nbecause we could have one\n2:09\nwhere we end up heavily favoring the forward reaction.\n2:13\nWhere we end up with\n2:14\nmuch higher concentrations of Y and Z,\n2:17\nor we might heavily favor the backwards reactions\n2:19\nwhere we have more V and X.\n2:20\nBut when we're in equilibrium,\n2:22\nwe're saying that our concentrations\n2:23\nhave reached a stability point,\n2:25\nwhich implies that the rate of going in this direction\n2:27\nis equal to the rate going into that direction.\n2:29\nSo let's just think a little bit about\n2:31\nwhat drives these rates,\n2:33\nwhat drives these rates of reactions.\n2:36\nIn order for this forward reaction to happen\n2:39\nthat I drew in purple,\n2:40\nwhat needs to happen?\n2:42\nWe have to have a molecules of V roughly.\n2:45\nAnd let's say in any volume of space,\n2:47\nwe have to have some V molecules,\n2:50\nand preferably a V molecules,\n2:54\nbeing in the vicinity of b X molecules.\n2:58\nSo there's got to be b of these X molecules,\n3:03\nand they have to be in the right configuration\n3:05\nand in the right place and kind of close enough\n3:08\nin order for the reaction to happen.\n3:10\nSo the reaction is really going to be driven by,\n3:13\nif you think about it,\n3:14\nthe probability of finding\n3:15\na V molecules and b molecules\n3:19\nall within close enough confines\n3:23\nthat they can actually react.\n3:25\nSo you could say that the rate\n3:27\nis going to be driven by\n3:31\n-- maybe it's going to be proportional.\n3:32\nLet's say it's just equal to-- let's say some constant\n3:34\nthat takes into account things like temperature\n3:37\nand how the molecules are actually configured.\n3:40\nBecause it's not dependent just on them being there.\n3:42\nYou have to have worry about their kinetic energies.\n3:44\nYou have to worry about their shape,\n3:46\nbecause some shapes are going to be\n3:47\nmore conducive to reaction than others.\n3:48\nSo let's just let that be taken into account with a K.\n3:52\nAnd we're talking about the forward reaction, right?\n3:55\nSo in order for the forward reaction to happen,\n3:57\nlet's call that K plus for the forward reaction.\n4:00\nWe have to have\n4:02\na molecules of V there and b molecules of X.\n4:06\nSo what's the probability of having a molecules of X?\n4:10\nOr what's a rough approximation of the probability?\n4:12\nWell, the concentration.\n4:17\nLet's think about this a second.\n4:20\nWhen we write the concentration of the molecule V,\n4:23\nwhich I think when I did this\n4:25\nwas the blue one right here,\n4:26\nwhat is that given in?\n4:28\nThat is given in moles per liter.\n4:31\nMoles is just a number,\n4:34\nso this tells us, look, in any given volume,\n4:36\nroughly how many of the molecules\n4:38\ndo you expect to find?\n4:39\nThat's what concentration is.\n4:41\nSo if I wanted to figure out the probability\n4:43\nof finding a of these molecules,\n4:46\nbecause that's how many I need,\n4:47\nI need to multiply this by itself a times,\n4:50\nbecause I need a of them.\n4:51\nThe probability of having just one molecule\n4:53\nin just some small fraction,\n4:57\nyou would just use the concentration once.\n4:59\nBut you're going to use it a times,\n5:00\nbecause you want a of those molecules there, right?\n5:03\nYou could look at it like\n5:05\nwhat's the probability of having five heads?\n5:07\nWell you would multiply the probability of\n5:08\none head five times.\n5:10\nSo the forward reaction probability is going to be\n5:12\nthe concentration of V to the a power,\n5:15\nand, of course,\n5:17\nthat's not enough to have the reaction happen.\n5:20\nYou also need to have b of the X molecules there.\n5:26\nSo you have the concentration of X to the b power.\n5:31\nAnd I want to make sure you understand this.\n5:33\nMy claim is that this is approximation\n5:40\n-- or actually it's a pretty good way\n5:41\nof calculating-- the probability.\n5:44\nSo let me write it this way.\n5:47\nThe rate is equal to some constant\n5:50\nthat takes into account the temperature\n5:52\nand the molecular configurations\n5:53\ntimes the probability of having\n5:55\na V molecules and b X molecules\n6:07\nin a sufficiently small area all at the same time.\n6:11\nAnd the best way to approximate\n6:13\nthat is with their concentration.\n6:15\nObviously, the higher the concentration,\n6:16\nthe higher the moles per liter,\n6:18\nthe more likely you're going\n6:19\nto find that many of molecules\n6:21\nin kind of that little small space that you care about,\n6:25\nand the temperature and the configuration\n6:26\nare going to matter more.\n6:27\nBut if you use the concentration\n6:30\nas the probability of a\n6:32\n-- let me switch colors.\n6:36\nIf the probability of\n6:37\nhaving a V molecule in some volume\n6:45\n-- if we assume that the solution is homogeneous,\n6:52\nthat the V molecules are roughly evenly distributed,\n6:54\nit's going to be\n6:56\n-- this isn't even an approximation.\n6:57\nIt's going to be the concentration of the V molecules\n7:01\ntimes the volume under which we care about.\n7:06\nIf we want the probability of a,\n7:11\nwhere a is a number,\n7:13\nit could be five V molecules,\n7:14\na V's in some volume,\n7:22\nit's the probability of finding this a times.\n7:27\nSo it's going to be equal to\n7:29\n-- and this is just from the probability concepts\n7:33\nthat we learned in the whole probability playlist.\n7:36\nSo if you want to have five heads in a row,\n7:38\nit's 1/2 to the fifth power.\n7:40\nIf you want to have V molecules there,\n7:42\nfive of them at the same time in some volume,\n7:46\nor a of them,\n7:48\nit's going to be V to the a power\n7:50\ntimes the volume.\n7:51\nIf you also care about the probability\n7:57\nso you want all of that,\n7:58\nso a V's and b X's in some volume,\n8:04\nthen you're going to have to multiply all of them together.\n8:08\nSo it's going to be equal to\n8:10\nthe concentration of V to the a power\n8:13\ntimes the concentration of X to the b power\n8:16\ntimes the volume.\n8:17\nSo the probability of\n8:19\nfinding the right number of V particles\n8:23\nand X particles in the right place in some volume\n8:26\nis going to be proportional to exactly this.\n8:28\nAnd we're saying that the reaction rate,\n8:32\nthe forward reaction rate,\n8:33\nis also proportional to this thing.\n8:35\nSo that's where we get the forward reaction rate.\n8:39\nSo the rate forward is equal to\n8:43\nthe concentration of our V molecules to the a power\n8:46\ntimes the concentration\n8:47\nof our X molecules to the b power.\n8:49\nNow, if we want to find the reverse rate,\n8:52\nso this is the rate forward.\n8:54\nIf we want to find the rate of the reverse reaction,\n9:02\nlet's say that that's equal to some other constant\n9:05\n-- let's call that K-minus--\n9:06\nthe same exact logic holds.\n9:10\nWe're just going in this direction now.\n9:12\nIf we look at our original one,\n9:14\nwe're going in that direction.\n9:15\nSo for this reaction, we do the same thing.\n9:17\nWe literally just do different letters,\n9:18\nso the reverse reaction is just going to be\n9:20\nthe concentration of the Y molecule to the c power,\n9:27\nbecause we need c of them there\n9:29\nroughly at the same time,\n9:30\ntimes the concentration of the Z molecule\n9:33\nto the d power.\n9:35\nNow, just at the beginning of the video,\n9:38\nwe said that\n9:39\nequilibrium is when these rates equal each other.\n9:42\nI wrote it down right here.\n9:43\nSo if the reverse rate\n9:45\nis equal to some constant times this,\n9:47\nand the forward rate\n9:48\nis equal to some constant times that,\n9:50\nthen we reach equilibrium\n9:51\nwhen these two are equal to each other.\n9:53\nLet me clear up somespace here.\n9:54\nLet me clear this up, too.\n9:59\nSo when are they going to be equal to each other?\n10:02\nWhen the forward rate\n10:03\n-- the forward rate is this.\n10:05\nThat's our forward constant,\n10:07\nwhich took into account a whole bunch of\n10:08\ntemperature and molecular structure and all of that--\n10:12\ntimes the concentration\n10:13\nof our V molecule to the a power.\n10:16\nYou can kind of view that as\n10:17\nwhat's the probability of finding in a certain volume\n10:19\n-- and that certain volume\n10:21\ncan be factored into that K factor as well--\n10:23\nbut what's the probability of finding V things,\n10:25\na V molecules in some volume.\n10:30\nAnd it's the concentration of V to the a power\n10:32\ntimes concentration of X to the b power\n10:36\n-- that's the forward reaction--\n10:37\nand that has to equal the reverse reactions.\n10:39\nSo K-minus times the concentration of Y to the c power\n10:45\ntimes the concentration of Z to the d power.\n10:49\nNow, if we divide both sides by\n10:52\n-- let me erase more space.\n10:54\nNope, not with that.\n10:57\nAll right.\n11:00\nSo let's divide both sides by K-minus\n11:03\nand both sides by this,\n11:04\nso you get K-plus over K-minus is equal to that,\n11:14\nis equal to Y to the c\n11:17\ntimes Z to the d.\n11:20\nAll of that over that--\n11:22\nV to the a\n11:26\ntimes the concentration of X to the b.\n11:30\nLet me put this in magenta just so\n11:31\nyou know that this was this K-minus right here.\n11:34\nAnd then, these are just two arbitrary constants,\n11:37\nso we could just replace them\n11:39\nand call them the equilibrium constant.\n11:41\nAnd we're there where we need to be.\n11:43\nWe're at the formula for the equilibrium constant.\n11:48\nNow, I know this was really hand wavy,\n11:49\nbut I want you to at least get the sense that\n11:51\nthis doesn't come from out of the blue,\n11:53\nand there is -- at least I think there is--\n11:55\nthere's an intuition here.\n11:56\nThese are really calculating\n11:57\nthe probabilities of finding\n11:59\n-- this is the forward reaction rate probabilities\n12:04\nproportional to this.\n12:05\nBecause the more V concentration you have,\n12:08\nthe more likely you're able to find it.\n12:10\nAlthough if you need more of those particles around,\n12:14\nyou're going to have to multiply that\n12:15\nconcentration by each other,\n12:17\nbecause the probability's going to get lower.\n12:19\nBecause you need more of them together\n12:20\nin order for the reaction to happen.\n12:22\nSame thing for everything there.\n12:23\nBut all this is derived from is\n12:25\nthat the forward reaction should be equal to\n12:28\nsome constant times the reverse reaction.\n12:31\nOr actually, their rates should be equal,\n12:33\nbut then when you actually calculate the probability,\n12:35\nyou'll have a constant in there.\n12:36\nAnyway, hopefully, I didn't confuse you,\n12:38\nbut I just wanted to give you that\n12:39\nthis isn't just some random equation.\n12:41\nIt really does, I think,\n12:43\ncome from the reality that\n12:45\nthe higher the concentration you have,\n12:47\nthe more the probability you have\n12:48\nof the actual molecules bumping into each other.",

if you input an x into our function f,\n0:23\nwhat's the first thing that you do?\n0:24\nWell, you take the square root of it.\n0:26\nSo if we start off with some x, you input it,\n0:32\nthe first thing that you do, you take the square root of it.\n0:35\nYou are going to take the square root of the input\n0:39\nto produce the square root of x,\n0:43\nand then what do you do?\n0:44\nYou take the square root and then\n0:46\nyou take the natural log of that.\n0:48\nSo then you take the natural log of that,\n0:51\nso you could view that as inputting it\n0:53\ninto another function that takes the natural log\n0:55\nof whatever is inputted in.\n0:57\nI'm making these little squares to\n0:58\nshow what you do with the input.\n1:00\nAnd then what do you produce?\n1:02\nWell you produce the natural log of the square root of x.\n1:06\nNatural log of the square root of x.\n1:10\nWhich is equal to f of x.\n1:12\nSo you could view f of x as this entire set,\n1:18\nor this entire, I guess you could say,\n1:20\nthis combination of functions right over there.\n1:23\nThat is f of x, which is essentially,\n1:27\na composition of two functions.\n1:29\nYou're inputting into one function\n1:31\nthen taking that output and inputting it into another.\n1:34\nSo you could have a function u here,\n1:36\nwhich takes the square root of whatever its input is,\n1:38\nso u of x is equal to the square root of x.\n1:43\nAnd then you take that output,\n1:47\nand input it into another function that we could call v,\n1:49\nand what does v do?\n1:51\nWell it take the natural log of whatever the input is.\n1:53\nIn this case, in the case of f, or in the case of how\n1:57\nI just diagrammed it, v is taking the natural log,\n2:00\nthe input happens to be square root of x,\n2:02\nso it outputs the natural log of the square root of x.\n2:05\nIf we wanted to write v with x as an input,\n2:08\nwe would just say well that's the natural log,\n2:10\nthat is just the natural log of x.\n2:14\nAnd as you can see here, f of x,\n2:16\nand I color-coded ahead of time,\n2:17\nis equal to, f of x is equal to,\n2:22\nthe natural log of the square root of x.\n2:24\nSo that is v of the square root of x, or v of u of x.\n2:31\nSo it is a composition which tells you that,\n2:33\nokay, if I'm trying to find the derivative here,\n2:36\nthe chain rule is going to be very, very, very, very useful.\n2:39\nAnd the chain rule tells us that f prime of x\n2:43\nis going to be equal to the derivative of,\n2:47\nyou can view it as the outside function,\n2:49\nwith respect to this inside function,\n2:51\nso it's going to be v prime of u of x,\n2:55\nv prime of u of x,\n2:58\ntimes the derivative of this inside function\n3:01\nwith respect to x.\n3:02\nSo that's just u prime, u prime of x.\n3:06\nSo how do we evaluate these things?\n3:08\nWell, we know how to take the derivative of u of x\n3:11\nand v of x, u prime of x here, is going to be equal to,\n3:16\nwell remember, square root of x is just the same thing\n3:19\nas x to 1/2 power, so we can use the power rule,\n3:22\nbring the 1/2 out from so it becomes 1/2 x to the,\n3:26\nand then take off one out of that exponent,\n3:29\nso that's 1/2 minus one is negative 1/2 power.\n3:32\nAnd what is v of x, sorry, what is v prime of x?\n3:38\nWell the derivative of the natural log of x\n3:40\nis one over x, we show that in other videos.\n3:45\nAnd so we now know what u prime of x is,\n3:48\nwe know what v prime of x is, but what is v prime of u of x?\n3:52\nWell v prime of u of x, wherever we see the x,\n3:58\nwe replace it, let me write that a little bit neater,\n4:00\nwe replace that with a u of x, so v prime of u of x\n4:05\nis going to be equal to,\n4:07\nis going to be equal to one over u of x,\n4:10\none over u of x, which is equal to,\n4:15\nwhich is equal to one over,\n4:17\nu of x is just the square root of x.\n4:20\nOne over the square root of x.\n4:24\nThis thing right over here, we have figured out,\n4:29\nis one over the square root of x,\n4:31\nand this thing, u prime of x, we figured out,\n4:36\nis 1/2 times x to the negative 1/2,\n4:39\nand x to the negative 1/2, I could rewrite that as 1/2\n4:41\ntimes one over x to the 1/2, which is the same thing\n4:46\nas 1/2 times one over the square root of x,\n4:51\nor I could write that as one over 2 square roots of x.\n4:55\nSo what is this thing going to be?\n4:58\nWell this is going to be equal to, in green,\n5:02\nv prime of u of x is one over the square root of x,\n5:07\ntimes, times, u prime of x is one over two times\n5:13\nthe square root of x, now what is this going to be equal to?\n5:16\nWell, this is going to be equal to,\n5:19\nthis is just algebra at this point,\n5:21\none over, we have our two and square root of x\n5:24\ntimes square root of x is just x.\n5:26\nSo it just simplifies to one over two x.\n5:29\nSo hopefully this made sense,\n5:31\nand I intentionally diagrammed it out\n5:32\nso that you start to get that muscle in your brain going\n5:35\nof recognizing the composite functions,\n5:37\nand then making a little bit more sense of\n5:39\nsome of these expressions of the chain rule\n5:41\nthat you might see in your calculus class,\n5:43\nor in your calculus textbook.\n5:44\nBut as you get more practice, you'll be able to do it,\n5:47\nessentially, without having to write out all of this.\n5:49\nYou'll say okay, look, I have a composition.\n5:51\nThis is the natural log of the square root of x,\n5:55\nthis is v of u of x.\n5:57\nSo what I wanna do is I wanna take the derivative\n6:00\nof this outside function with respect\n6:02\nto this inside function.\n6:03\nSo the derivative of natural log of something,\n6:07\nwith respect to that something, is one over that something.\n6:11\nSo it is one over that something,\n6:14\nthe derivative natural log of something\n6:16\nwith respect to that something is one over that something,\n6:19\nso that's what we just did here.\n6:21\nOne way to think about it, what would natural log of x be?\n6:24\nWell that'd be one over x, but it's not natural log of x.\n6:27\nIt's one over square root of x,\n6:28\nso it's going to be one over the square root of x,\n6:31\nso you take the derivative of the outside function\n6:33\nwith respect to the inside one,\n6:35\nand then you multiply that times just the derivative\n6:37\nof the inside function with respect to x.\n6:41\nAnd we are done.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWhen you get into higher mathematics,\n0:02\nyou might see a professor write something\n0:03\nlike this on a board, where it's just\n0:05\nthis R with this extra backbone right over here.\n0:08\nAnd maybe they write R2.\n0:10\nOr if you're looking at it in a book,\n0:12\nit might just be a bolded capital\n0:14\nR with a 2 superscript like this.\n0:17\nAnd if you see this, they're referring\n0:19\nto the two-dimensional real coordinate\n0:22\nspace, which sounds very fancy.\n0:30\nBut one way to think about it, it's\n0:31\nreally just the two-dimensional space\n0:33\nthat you're used to dealing with in your coordinate plane.\n0:37\nTo go a little bit more abstract,\n0:39\nthis isn't necessarily this visual representation.\n0:42\nThis visual representation is one way\n0:45\nto think about this real coordinate space.\n0:47\nIf we were to think about it a little bit more abstractly,\n0:50\nthe real R2, the two-dimensional real coordinate space--\n0:54\nlet me write this down-- and the two-dimensional real coordinate\n1:00\nspace.\n1:01\nAnd just to break down the notation,\n1:03\nthe 2 tells us how many dimensions we're dealing with,\n1:05\nand then the R tells us this is a real coordinate space.\n1:09\nThe two-dimensional real coordinate space\n1:11\nis all the possible real-valued 2-tuples.\n1:15\nLet me write that down.\n1:17\nThis is all possible real-valued 2-tuples.\n1:30\nSo what is a 2-tuple?\n1:33\nWell, a tuple is an ordered list of numbers.\n1:37\nAnd since we're talking about real values,\n1:38\nit's going to be ordered list of real numbers,\n1:41\nand a 2-tuple just says it's an ordered list of 2 numbers.\n1:44\nSo this is an ordered list of 2 real-valued numbers.\n1:47\nWell, that's exactly what we did here\n1:49\nwhen we thought about a two-dimensional vector.\n1:51\nThis right over here is a 2-tuple,\n1:53\nand this is a real-valued 2-tuple.\n1:55\nNeither of these have any imaginary parts.\n1:58\nSo you have a 3 and a 4.\n2:00\nOrder matters.\n2:01\nWe view this as a different 2-tuple than, say, 4, 3.\n2:08\nAnd even if we were trying to represent them in our axes\n2:12\nright over here, this vector, 4, 3,\n2:15\nwould be 4 along the horizontal axis,\n2:18\nand then 3 along the vertical axis.\n2:22\nAnd so it would look something like this.\n2:24\nAnd remember, we don't have to draw it just over there.\n2:26\nWe just care about its magnitude and direction.\n2:28\nWe could draw it right over here.\n2:32\nThis would also be 4, 3, the column vector, 4 3.\n2:38\nSo when we're talking about R2, we're\n2:40\ntalking about all of the possible real-valued 2-tuples.\n2:43\nSo all the possible vectors that you can have,\n2:47\nwhere each of its components-- and the components\n2:50\nare these numbers right over here--\n2:52\nwhere each of its components are a real number.\n2:56\nSo you might have 3, 4.\n2:57\nYou could have negative 3, negative 4.\n2:59\nSo that would be 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4,\n3:04\nmight look something like-- actually,\n3:06\nI should make the scale a little bit bigger,\n3:08\nso it looks the same-- 1, 2, 3, 4.\n3:12\nSo it might look something like that.\n3:16\nSo that would be the vector, negative 3--\n3:18\nlet me write a little bit better than that-- negative 3,\n3:22\nand negative 4.\n3:24\nSo if you were to take all of the possible 2-tuples,\n3:27\nincluding the vector 0, 0-- so it has no magnitude,\n3:30\nand you could debate what its direction is right over there--\n3:34\nyou take all of those combined, and then\n3:36\nyou have created your two-dimensional real coordinate\n3:39\nspace.\n3:40\nAnd that is referred to as R2.\n3:43\nNow, as you can imagine, the fact\n3:44\nthat we wrote this 2 here-- we had\n3:46\nto specify-- it's like, hey, well, could I put a 3 there?\n3:48\nAnd I would say, absolutely, you could put a 3 there.\n3:51\nSo R3 would be the three-dimensional real\n3:54\ncoordinate space.\n3:56\nSo 3D real coordinate space.\n4:02\nAnd so you would view this as all\n4:04\nthe possible real-valued 3-tuples.\n4:13\nSo, for example, that would be a member of R3.\n4:20\nAnd let me actually label these vectors\n4:22\njust so we get in the habit of it.\n4:23\nSo let's say we call this vector x.\n4:26\nLet's say we have a vector b, that looks like this.\n4:31\nNegative 1, 5, 3.\n4:34\nBoth of these would be members of R3.\n4:38\nAnd if you want to see some fancy notation, a member\n4:41\nof a set-- so this is a member of R3--\n4:47\nit is a real-valued 3-tuple.\n4:51\nNow you say, well, what would not be a member of R3?\n4:53\nWell, this right over here isn't a 3-tuple.\n4:55\nThis right over here is a member of R2.\n4:57\nNow, you might be able to extend it in some way,\n4:59\nadd a zero or something, but formally,\n5:01\nthis is not a 3-tuple.\n5:03\nAnother thing that would not be a member of R3-- let's say\n5:06\nsomeone wanted to make some type of vector that\n5:11\nhad some imaginary parts in it.\n5:12\nSo let's say it had i, 0, 1.\n5:15\nThis is no longer real-valued.\n5:18\nWe have put an imaginary-- this number up here\n5:22\nhas an imaginary part.\n5:23\nSo this is no longer a real-valued 3-tuple.\n5:28\nAnd what's neat about linear algebra is,\n5:30\nwe don't have to stop there.\n5:31\nR3 we can visualize, we can plot these things.\n5:35\nIn your previous mathematical career,\n5:37\nespecially if you have some type of a hologram or something,\n5:39\nit's not hard to visualize things in three dimensions.\n5:42\nBut what's neat is that we can keep extending this.\n5:44\nWe can go into 4, 5, 6, 7, 20, 100 dimensions.\n5:48\nAnd obviously there it becomes much harder, if not impossible,\n5:51\nto visualize it.\n5:52\nBut then we can at least represent it mathematically\n5:55\nwith an n-tuple of vectors.\n5:57\nAnd so if we were to talk about a real coordinate space\n6:00\ngenerally, you'll often see the notation Rn,\n6:04\nwith n as a superscript.\n6:06\nSo this right over here is an n-dimensional real coordinate\n6:12\nspace.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] We know that we can find\n0:01\nthe area of a rectangle by multiplying\n0:03\nthe base times the height.\n0:05\nThe area of a rectangle is equal to base times height.\n0:08\nIn another video, we saw that,\n0:09\nif we're looking at the area of a parallelogram,\n0:12\nand we also know the length of a base,\n0:14\nand we know its height, then the area\n0:16\nis still going to be base times height.\n0:18\nNow, it's not as obvious when you look\n0:19\nat the parallelogram, but in that video,\n0:21\nwe did a little manipulation of the area.\n0:24\nWe said, \"Hey, let's take this\n0:26\n\"little section right over here.\"\n0:28\nSo we took that little section right over there,\n0:31\nand then we move it over to the right-hand side,\n0:35\nand just like that, you see that,\n0:37\nas long as the base and the height is the same,\n0:39\nas this rectangle here, I'm able to construct\n0:41\nthe same rectangle by moving that area over,\n0:44\nand that's why the area of this parallelogram\n0:46\nis base times height.\n0:47\nI didn't add or take away area, I just shifted area\n0:50\nfrom the left-hand side to the right-hand side\n0:53\nto show you that the area of that parallelogram\n0:55\nwas the same as this area of the rectangle.\n0:58\nIt's still going to be base times height.\n1:01\nSo hopefully that convinces you\n1:03\nthat the area of a parallelogram is base times height,\n1:07\nbecause we're now going to use that\n1:09\nto get the intuition for the area of a triangle.\n1:13\nSo let's look at some triangles here.\n1:16\nSo that is a triangle,\n1:17\nand we're given the base and the height,\n1:20\nand we're gonna try to think about\n1:21\nwhat's the area of this triangle going to be,\n1:25\nand you can imagine it's going to be\n1:26\ndependent on base and height.\n1:28\nWell, to think about that,\n1:29\nlet me copy and paste this triangle.\n1:33\nSo let me copy, and then let me paste it,\n1:38\nand what I'm gonna do is,\n1:39\nso now I have two of the triangles,\n1:41\nso this is now going to be twice the area,\n1:43\nand I'm gonna rotate it around,\n1:45\nI'm gonna rotate it around like that,\n1:52\nand then add it to the original area, and you see\n1:55\nsomething very interesting is happening.\n1:57\nI have now constructed a parallelogram.\n2:01\nI have now constructed a parallelogram\n2:03\nthat has twice the area of our original triangle,\n2:06\n'cause I have two of our original triangles\n2:08\nright over here, you saw me do it,\n2:09\nI copied and pasted it, and then I flipped it over\n2:12\nand I constructed the parallelogram.\n2:15\nNow why is this interesting?\n2:17\nWell, the area of the entire parallelogram,\n2:20\nthe area of the entire parallelogram\n2:23\nis going to be the length of this base times this height.\n2:28\nYou also have height written\n2:29\nwith the \"h\" upside down over here.\n2:31\nIt's going to be base times height.\n2:32\nThat's going to be for the parallelogram, for the entire--\n2:35\nlet me draw a parallelogram right over here.\n2:37\nThat's going to be the area of the entire parallelogram.\n2:40\nSo what would be the area of our original triangle?\n2:43\nWhat would be the area of our original triangle?\n2:48\nWell, we already saw that this area of the parallelogram,\n2:51\nit's twice the area of our original triangle.\n2:53\nSo our original triangle is just\n2:54\ngoing to have half the area.\n2:56\nSo this area right over here is going to be\n2:59\none half the area of the parallelogram.\n3:02\nOne half base-- let me do those same colors.\n3:06\nOne half base times height.\n3:10\nOne half base times height.\n3:13\nAnd you might say, \"OK, maybe it worked for this triangle,\n3:15\n\"but I wanna see it work for more triangles.\"\n3:18\nAnd so, to help you there,\n3:19\nI've added another triangle right over here,\n3:21\nyou could do this as an obtuse triangle,\n3:23\nthis angle right over here is greater than 90 degrees,\n3:26\nbut I'm gonna do the same trick.\n3:27\nWe have the base, and then we have the height.\n3:30\nHere, you can think of,\n3:30\nif you start at this point right over here,\n3:33\nand if you drop a ball,\n3:35\nthe length that the ball goes, if you had a string here,\n3:39\nto kind of get to the ground level,\n3:40\nyou could view this as the ground level\n3:41\nright over there, that that's going to be the height,\n3:44\nit's not sitting in the triangle like we saw last time,\n3:46\nbut it's still the height of the triangle.\n3:49\nIf this was a building of some kind,\n3:51\nyou'd say, \"Well, this is the height.\"\n3:52\nHow far off the ground is it?\n3:53\nWell, what's the area of this going to be?\n3:55\nWell, you can imagine,\n3:56\nit's going to be one half base times height.\n3:58\nHow do we feel good about that?\n4:00\nWell, let's do the same magic here.\n4:05\nSo let me copy and paste this,\n4:09\nso I'm gonna copy and then paste it.\n4:12\nWhoops, that didn't work.\n4:14\nLet me copy, and then paste it.\n4:20\nAnd so, I have two of these triangles now,\n4:23\nbut I'm gonna flip this one over,\n4:25\nso that I can construct a parallelogram.\n4:28\nSo I'm gonna flip it over, and move it over here,\n4:31\nI'm gonna have to rotate it a little bit more.\n4:34\nSo, I think you get the general idea.\n4:37\nSo now I have constructed a parallelogram\n4:39\nthat has twice the area of our original triangle.\n4:43\nIt has twice the area of our original triangle.\n4:48\nAnd so, if I talked about\n4:49\nthe area of the entire parallelogram,\n4:51\nit would be base times the height of the parallelogram.\n4:57\nBase times the height of the parallelogram.\n4:59\nBut if we're only talking about the area of --\n5:02\nIf we're only talking about this area\n5:06\nright over here, which is our original triangle,\n5:08\nit's going to be half the area of the parallelogram,\n5:11\nso it's gonna be one half of that.\n5:12\nSo our area of our original triangle\n5:14\nis one half base times height.\n5:17\nSo hopefully that makes you feel pretty good\n5:18\nabout this formula that you will see in geometry,\n5:21\nthat area of a triangle is one half base times height,\n5:23\nwhile the area of a rectangle or a paralleogram\n5:26\nis going to be base times height.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nUse the quadratic formula to solve the equation, 0 is equal\n0:04\nto negative 7q squared plus 2q plus 9.\n0:10\nNow, the quadratic formula, it applies to any quadratic\n0:14\nequation of the form-- we could put the 0 on\n0:16\nthe left hand side.\n0:17\n0 is equal to ax squared plus bx plus c.\n0:24\nAnd we generally deal with x's, in this problem we're\n0:27\ndealing with q's.\n0:28\nBut the quadratic formula says, look, if you have a\n0:29\nquadratic equation of this form, that the solutions of\n0:34\nthis equation are going to be x is going to be equal to\n0:37\nnegative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus\n0:44\n4ac-- all of that over 2a.\n0:49\nAnd this is actually two solutions here, because\n0:51\nthere's one solution where you take the positive square root\n0:53\nand there's another solution where you take\n0:54\nthe negative root.\n0:57\nSo it gives you both roots of this.\n0:58\nSo if we look at the quadratic equation that we need to solve\n1:02\nhere, we can just pattern match.\n1:03\nWe're dealing with q's, not x's, but this is the same\n1:05\ngeneral idea.\n1:06\nIt could be x's if you like.\n1:08\nAnd if we look at it, negative 7 corresponds to a.\n1:13\nThat is our a.\n1:14\nIt's the coefficient on the second degree term.\n1:18\n2 corresponds to b.\n1:21\nIt is the coefficient on the first degree term.\n1:24\nAnd then 9 corresponds to c.\n1:26\nIt's the constant.\n1:29\nSo, let's just apply the quadratic formula.\n1:31\nThe quadratic formula will tell us that the solutions--\n1:34\nthe q's that satisfy this equation-- q will be equal to\n1:38\nnegative b.\n1:40\nb is 2.\n1:42\nPlus or minus the square root of b squared, of 2 squared,\n1:53\nminus 4 times a times negative 7 times c, which is 9.\n2:08\nAnd all of that over 2a.\n2:10\nAll of that over 2 times a, which is once\n2:16\nagain negative 7.\n2:20\nAnd then we just have to evaluate this.\n2:22\nSo this is going to be equal to negative 2 plus or minus\n2:29\nthe square root of-- let's see, 2 squared is 4-- and then\n2:35\nif we just take this part right here, if we just take\n2:37\nthe negative 4 times negative 7 times 9, this negative and\n2:42\nthat negative is going to cancel out.\n2:43\nSo it's just going to become a positive number.\n2:45\nAnd 4 times 7 times 9.\n2:49\n4 times 9 is 36.\n2:52\n36 times 7.\n2:54\nLet's do it up here.\n2:55\n36 times 7.\n2:58\n7 times 6 is 42.\n3:00\n7 times 3, or 3 times 7 is 21.\n3:03\nPlus 4 is 25.\n3:05\n252.\n3:06\nSo this becomes 4 plus 252.\n3:09\nRemember, you have a negative 7 and you\n3:11\nhave a minus out front.\n3:12\nThose cancel out, that's why we have a positive 252 for\n3:16\nthat part right there.\n3:17\nAnd then our denominator, 2 times negative\n3:22\n7 is negative 14.\n3:24\nNow what does this equal?\n3:28\nWell, we have this is equal to negative 2 plus or minus the\n3:33\nsquare root of-- what's 4 plus 252?\n3:36\nIt's just 256.\n3:38\nAll of that over negative 14.\n3:40\nAnd what's 256?\n3:43\nWhat's the square root of 256?\n3:46\nIt's 16.\n3:47\nYou can try it out for yourself.\n3:48\nThis is 16 times 16.\n3:49\nSo the square root of 256 is 16.\n3:53\nSo we can rewrite this whole thing as being equal to\n3:56\nnegative 2 plus 16 over negative 14.\n4:04\nOr negative 2 minus-- right?\n4:07\nThis is plus 16 over negative 14.\n4:10\nOr minus 16 over negative 14.\n4:16\nIf you think of it as plus or minus, that plus is that plus\n4:20\nright there.\n4:21\nAnd if you have that minus, that minus is\n4:26\nthat minus right there.\n4:28\nNow we just have to evaluate these two numbers.\n4:32\nNegative 2 plus 16 is 14 divided by negative 14 is\n4:39\nnegative 1.\n4:40\nSo q could be equal to negative 1.\n4:42\nOr negative 2 minus 16 is negative 18 divided by\n4:47\nnegative 14 is equal to 18 over 14.\n4:51\nThe negatives cancel out, which is equal to 9 over 7.\n4:54\nSo q could be equal to negative 1, or it could be\n4:57\nequal to 9 over 7.\n4:59\nAnd you could try these out, substitute these q's back into\n5:02\nthis original equation, and verify for yourself that they\n5:04\nsatisfy it.\n5:05\nWe could even do it with the first one.\n5:07\nSo if you take q is equal to negative 1.\n5:09\nNegative 7 times negative 1 squared-- negative 1 squared\n5:12\nis just 1-- so this would be negative 7 times 1, right?\n5:17\nThat's negative 1 squared.\n5:18\nNegative 1 times 2 is minus 2 plus 9.\n5:22\nSo it's negative 7 minus 2, which is negative 9, plus 9,\n5:26\ndoes indeed equal 0.\n5:27\nSo this checks out.\n5:29\nAnd I'll leave it up to you to verify that 9 over\n5:31\n7 also works out.",

letter\n0:06\nmost typically used for functions,\n0:08\nthat if I give it an input, a valid input,\n0:11\nif I give it a valid input, and I use the variable \"x\"\n0:14\nfor that valid input, it is going to map that to an output.\n0:19\nIt is going to map that, or produce,\n0:21\ngiven this x, it's going to product an output\n0:24\nthat we would call \"f(x).\"\n0:26\nAnd we've already talked a little bit\n0:28\nabout the notion of a domain.\n0:29\nA domain is the set of all of the inputs\n0:32\nover which the function is defined.\n0:35\nSo if this the domain here, if this is the domain here,\n0:39\nand I take a value here, and I put that in for x,\n0:42\nthen the function is going to output an f(x).\n0:45\nIf I take something that's outside of the domain,\n0:47\nlet me do that in a different color...\n0:49\nIf I take something that is outside of the domain\n0:52\nand try to input it into this function,\n0:55\nthe function will say, \"hey, wait wait,\"\n0:56\n\"I'm not defined for that thing\"\n0:57\n\"that's outside of the domain.\"\n1:00\nNow another interesting thing to think about,\n1:04\nand that's actually what the focus of this video is,\n1:06\nokay, we know the set of all of the valid inputs,\n1:08\nthat's called the domain, but what about all,\n1:10\nthe set of all of the outputs that the function\n1:13\ncould actually produce?\n1:14\nAnd we have a name for that.\n1:16\nThat is called the range of the function.\n1:19\nSo the range.\n1:21\nThe range, and the most typical,\n1:23\nthere's actually a couple of definitions for range,\n1:25\nbut the most typical definition for range\n1:27\nis \"the set of all possible outputs.\"\n1:30\nSo you give me, you input something from the domain,\n1:32\nit's going to output something, and by definition,\n1:34\nbecause we have outputted it from this function,\n1:36\nthat thing is going to be in the range,\n1:39\nand if we take the set of all of the things\n1:40\nthat the function could output,\n1:42\nthat is going to make up the range.\n1:44\nSo this right over here is the set of all possible,\n1:49\nall possible outputs.\n1:53\nAll possible outputs.\n1:55\nSo let's make that a little bit more concrete,\n1:57\nwith an example.\n1:58\nSo let's say that I have the function f(x)\n2:02\ndefined as, so once again, I'm gonna input x's,\n2:06\nand I have my function f, and I'm gonna output f(x).\n2:10\nAnd let's say this def...\n2:12\nThe function definition here, the thing that tries to\n2:13\nfigure out, \"okay, given an x, what f(x) do I produce?\",\n2:16\nthe definition says \"f(x) is going to be equal\"\n2:20\n\"to whatever my input is, squared.\"\n2:23\nWell, just as a little bit of review,\n2:24\nwe know what the domain here is going to be.\n2:26\nThe domain is the set of all valid inputs.\n2:30\nSo what are the valid inputs here?\n2:33\nWell, I could take any real number\n2:34\nand input into this, and I could take any real number\n2:37\nand I can square it, there's nothing wrong with that,\n2:39\nand so the domain is all real numbers.\n2:42\nAll, all real, all real numbers.\n2:48\nBut what's the range?\n2:49\nMaybe I'll do that in a different color\n2:50\njust to highlight it.\n2:52\nWhat is going to be the range here,\n2:54\nwhat is the set of all possible outputs?\n2:58\nWell if you think about, actually,\n2:59\nto help us think about, let me actually draw a graph here.\n3:02\nOf what this looks like.\n3:04\nWhat this looks like.\n3:06\nSo the graph of \"f(x) is equal to x squared\"\n3:08\nis going to look something like this.\n3:10\nSo, it's gonna look, it's going to look something like this.\n3:15\nI'm obviously hand-drawing it, so it's not perfect.\n3:17\nIt's gonna be a parabola with a,\n3:19\nwith a vertex right here at the origin.\n3:22\nSo this is the graph, this is the graph,\n3:24\n\"y is equal to f(x),\" this of course is the x-axis,\n3:28\nthis of course is the y-axis.\n3:31\nSo let's think about it, what is the set\n3:33\nof all possible outputs?\n3:35\nWell in this case, the set of all possible outputs\n3:36\nis the set of all possible y's here.\n3:38\nWell, we see, y can take on any non-negative value.\n3:43\ny could be zero, y could one, y could be pi, y could be e,\n3:47\nbut y cannot be negative.\n3:51\nSo the range here is, the range...\n3:54\nWe could, well we could say it a couple of ways,\n3:56\nwe could say, \"f(x)\", let me write it this way.\n3:59\n\"f(x) is a member of the real numbers\"\n4:03\n\"such that, is such that f(x) is greater than\"\n4:09\n\"or equal to zero.\"\n4:11\nWe could write it that way, if we wanted to\n4:13\nwrite it in a less mathy notation,\n4:15\nwe could say that \"f(x) is going to be\"\n4:19\n\"greater than or equal to zero.\"\n4:21\nf(x) is not going to be negative,\n4:24\nso any non-negative number, the set of all\n4:27\nnon-negative numbers, that is our range.\n4:31\nLet's do another example of this,\n4:33\njust to make it a little bit, just to make it a little bit,\n4:35\na little bit clearer.\n4:37\nLet's say that I had, let's say that I had g(x),\n4:42\nlet's say I have g(x), I'll do this in white,\n4:45\nlet's say it's equal to \"x squared over x.\"\n4:49\nSo we could try to simplify g(x) a little bit,\n4:52\nwe could say, \"look, if I have x squared\"\n4:53\n\"and I divide it by x, that's gonna,\"\n4:55\n\"that's the same thing as g(x) being equal to x.\"\n4:59\n\"x squared over x\" is x, but we have to be careful.\n5:02\nBecause right over here, we have to,\n5:04\nin our domain, x cannot be equal to zero.\n5:08\nIf x is equal to zero, we get zero over zero,\n5:10\nwe get indeterminate form.\n5:11\nSo in order for this function to be the exact same function,\n5:14\nwe have to put that, 'cause it's not obvious now\n5:16\nfrom the definition, we have to say,\n5:21\n\"x cannot be equal to zero.\"\n5:23\nSo g(x) is equal to x for any x\n5:25\nas long as x is not equal to zero.\n5:28\nNow these two function definitions are equivalent.\n5:31\nAnd we could even graph it.\n5:33\nWe could graph it, it's going to look,\n5:35\nI'm gonna do a quick and dirty version of this graph.\n5:38\nIt's gonna look something like, this.\n5:40\nIt's gonna have a slope of one,\n5:43\nbut it's gonna have a hole right at zero,\n5:44\n'cause it's not defined at zero.\n5:47\nSo it's gonna look like this.\n5:48\nSo the domain here, the domain of g\n5:53\nis going to be, \"x is a member of the real numbers\"\n5:57\n\"such that x does not equal zero,\"\n6:00\nand the range is actually going to be the same thing.\n6:03\nThe range here is going to be,\n6:06\nwe could say \"f(x) is a member of the real numbers\"\n6:10\n\"such that f(x) does not equal zero.\"\n6:14\n\"f(x) does not equal zero.\"\n6:17\nSo the domain is all real numbers except for zero,\n6:19\nthe range is all real numbers except for zero.\n6:24\nSo the big takeaway here is the range is all the pos...\n6:28\nThe set of all possible outputs of your function.\n6:32\nThe domain is the set of all valid inputs\n6:35\ninto your function.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWilliam and Luis are in different physics classes\n0:03\nat Santa Rita.\n0:04\nLuis's teacher always gives exams with 30 questions\n0:07\non them, while William's teacher gives more\n0:10\nfrequent exams with only 24 questions.\n0:14\nLuis's teacher also assigns three projects per year.\n0:17\nEven though the two classes have to take a different number\n0:20\nof exams, their teachers have told them\n0:22\nthat both classes-- let me underline-- both classes will\n0:25\nget the same total number of exam questions each year.\n0:29\nWhat is the minimum number of exam questions\n0:32\nWilliam's or Luis's class can expect to get in a given year?\n0:36\nSo let's think about what's happening.\n0:38\nSo if we think about Luis's teacher who\n0:40\ngives 30 questions per test, so after the first test,\n0:44\nhe would have done 30 questions.\n0:46\nSo this is 0 right over here.\n0:48\nThen after the second test, he would have done 60.\n0:52\nThen after the third test, he would have done 90.\n0:56\nAnd after the fourth test, he would have done 120.\n1:00\nAnd after the fifth test, if there is a fifth test,\n1:03\nhe would do-- so this is if they have that many tests-- he\n1:06\nwould get to 150 total questions.\n1:08\nAnd we could keep going on and on looking\n1:10\nat all the multiples of 30.\n1:12\nSo this is probably a hint of what we're thinking about.\n1:14\nWe're looking at multiples of the numbers.\n1:16\nWe want the minimum multiples or the least multiple.\n1:19\nSo that's with Luis.\n1:20\nWell what's going on with William?\n1:22\nWill William's teacher, after the first test,\n1:25\nthey're going to get to 24 questions.\n1:29\nThen they're going to get to 48 after the second test.\n1:32\nThen they're going to get to 72 after the third test.\n1:37\nThen they're going to get to 96.\n1:39\nI'm just taking multiples of 24.\n1:41\nThey're going to get to 96 after the fourth test.\n1:45\nAnd then after the fifth test, they're going to get to 120.\n1:49\nAnd if there's a sixth test, then they would get to 144.\n1:55\nAnd we could keep going on and on in there.\n1:57\nBut let's see what they're asking us.\n1:58\nWhat is the minimum number of exam questions\n2:00\nWilliam's or Luis's class can expect to get in a year?\n2:03\nWell the minimum number is the point\n2:04\nat which they've gotten the same number of exam questions,\n2:07\ndespite the fact that the tests had\n2:09\na different number of items.\n2:10\nAnd you see the point at which they have the same number\n2:12\nis at 120.\n2:14\nThis happens at 120.\n2:16\nThey both could have exactly 120 questions\n2:19\neven though Luis's teacher is giving 30 at a time\n2:21\nand even though William's teacher is giving 24 at a time.\n2:25\nAnd so the answer is 120.\n2:28\nAnd notice, they had a different number of exams.\n2:30\nLuis had one, two, three, four exams\n2:33\nwhile William would have to have one, two, three, four,\n2:36\nfive exams.\n2:37\nBut that gets them both to 120 total questions.\n2:41\nNow thinking of it in terms of some of the math notation\n2:44\nor the least common multiple notation we've seen before,\n2:47\nthis is really asking us what is the least common multiple of 30\n2:55\nand 24.\n2:56\nAnd that least common multiple is equal to 120.\n3:02\nNow there's other ways that you can\n3:04\nfind the least common multiple other than just looking\n3:06\nat the multiples like this.\n3:07\nYou could look at it through prime factorization.\n3:10\n30 is 2 times 15, which is 3 times 5.\n3:15\nSo we could say that 30 is equal to 2 times 3 times 5.\n3:20\nAnd 24-- that's a different color than that blue-- 24\n3:28\nis equal to 2 times 12.\n3:31\n12 is equal to 2 times 6.\n3:33\n6 is equal to 2 times 3.\n3:36\nSo 24 is equal to 2 times 2 times 2 times 3.\n3:44\nSo another way to come up with the least common multiple,\n3:47\nif we didn't even do this exercise up here, says, look,\n3:49\nthe number has to be divisible by both 30 and 24.\n3:52\nIf it's going to be divisible by 30,\n3:54\nit's going to have to have 2 times 3 times 5\n4:00\nin its prime factorization.\n4:01\nThat is essentially 30.\n4:03\nSo this makes it divisible by 30.\n4:05\nAnd say, well in order to be divisible by 24,\n4:10\nits prime factorization is going to need 3 twos and a 3.\n4:13\nWell we already have 1 three.\n4:15\nAnd we already have 1 two, so we just need 2 more twos.\n4:18\nSo 2 times 2.\n4:20\nSo this makes it-- let me scroll up\n4:24\na little bit-- this right over here makes it divisible by 24.\n4:29\nAnd so this is essentially the prime factorization\n4:32\nof the least common multiple of 30 and 24.\n4:34\nYou take any one of these numbers away,\n4:37\nyou are no longer going to be divisible by one of these two\n4:40\nnumbers.\n4:40\nIf you take a two away, you're not going to be divisible by 24\n4:43\nanymore.\n4:43\nIf you take a two or a three away.\n4:45\nIf you take a three or a five away,\n4:50\nyou're not going to be divisible by 30 anymore.\n4:53\nAnd so if you were to multiply all these out,\n4:55\nthis is 2 times 2 times 2 is 8 times 3 is 24 times 5 is 120.\n5:04\nNow let's do one more of these.\n5:06\nUmama just bought one package of 21 binders.\n5:09\nLet me write that number down.\n5:11\n21 binders.\n5:12\nShe also bought a package of 30 pencils.\n5:17\nShe wants to use all of the binders and pencils\n5:20\nto create identical sets of office supplies\n5:23\nfor her classmates.\n5:24\nWhat is the greatest number of identical sets\n5:27\nUmama can make using all the supplies?\n5:29\nSo the fact that we're talking about greatest\n5:31\nis clue that it's probably going to be dealing\n5:33\nwith greatest common divisors.\n5:34\nAnd it's also dealing with dividing these things.\n5:36\nWe want to divide these both into the greatest\n5:39\nnumber of identical sets.\n5:44\nSo there's a couple of ways we could think about it.\n5:46\nLet's think about what the greatest common divisor\n5:49\nof both these numbers are.\n5:51\nOr I could even say the greatest common factor.\n5:53\nThe greatest common divisor of 21 and 30.\n6:00\nSo what's the largest number that divides into both of them?\n6:04\nSo we could go with the prime factor.\n6:05\nWe could list all of their normal factors\n6:07\nand see what is the greatest common one.\n6:09\nOr we could look at the prime factorization.\n6:16\nSo let's just do the prime factorization method.\n6:18\nSo 21 is the same thing as 3 times 7.\n6:21\nThese are both prime numbers.\n6:23\n30 is, let's see, it's 3-- actually,\n6:27\nI could write it this way-- it is 2 times 15.\n6:30\nWe already did it actually just now.\n6:32\nAnd 15 is 3 times 5.\n6:34\nSo what's the largest number of prime numbers that\n6:37\nare common to both factorizations?\n6:39\nWell you only have a three right over here.\n6:42\nThen you don't have a three times anything else.\n6:44\nSo this is just going to be equal to 3.\n6:47\nSo this is essentially telling us,\n6:48\nlook, we can divide both of these numbers into 3\n6:54\nand that will give us the largest\n6:56\nnumber of identical sets.\n6:58\nSo just to be clear of what we're doing.\n7:00\nSo we've answered the question is 3,\n7:02\nbut just to visualize it for this question,\n7:04\nlet's actually draw 21 binders.\n7:07\nSo let's say the 21 binders so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\n7:13\n11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.\n7:19\nAnd then 30 pencils, so I'll just do those in green.\n7:22\nSo 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n7:27\nLet me just copy and paste that.\n7:29\nThis is getting tedious.\n7:31\nSo copy and paste.\n7:35\nSo that's 20 and then paste that is 30.\n7:41\nNow, we figured out that 3 is the largest number that\n7:45\ndivides into both of these evenly.\n7:46\nSo I can divide both of these into groups of 3.\n7:50\nSo for the binders, I could do it into three groups of 7.\n7:55\nAnd then for the pencils, I could do it\n7:58\ninto three groups of 10.\n8:01\nSo if there are three people that\n8:03\nare coming into this classroom, I\n8:05\ncould give them each seven binders and 10 pencils.\n8:11\nBut that's the greatest number of identical sets\n8:14\nUmama can make.\n8:15\nI would have three sets.\n8:16\nEach set would have seven binders and 10 pencils.\n8:22\nAnd we essentially are just thinking\n8:23\nabout what's the number that we can divide both of these sets\n8:27\ninto evenly, the largest number that we\n8:30\ncan divide both of these sets into evenly.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the last video we saw how a matrix and figuring out its\n0:04\ninverse can be used to solve a system of equations.\n0:06\nAnd we did a 2 by 2.\n0:07\nAnd in the future, we'll do 3 by 3's.\n0:09\nWe won't do 4 by 4's because those take too long.\n0:11\nBut you'll see it applies to kind of an n by n matrix.\n0:13\nAnd that is probably the application of matrices that\n0:17\nyou learn if you learn this in your Algebra 2 class, or your\n0:20\nAlgebra 1 class.\n0:22\nAnd you often wonder, well why even do the\n0:23\nwhole matrix thing?\n0:25\nNow I will show you another application of matrices that\n0:28\nactually you're more likely to see in your linear algebra\n0:31\nclass when you take it in college.\n0:34\nBut the really neat thing here is, and I think this will\n0:37\nreally hit the point home, that the matrix representation\n0:40\nis just one way of representing multiple types of\n0:43\nproblems. And what's really cool is that if different\n0:45\nproblems can be represented the same way, it kind of tells\n0:47\nyou that they're the same problem.\n0:48\nAnd that's called an isomorphism in math.\n0:50\nThat if you can reduce one problem into another problem,\n0:53\nthen all the work you did with one of them\n0:54\napplies to the other.\n0:55\nBut anyway, let's figure out a new way that\n0:58\nmatrices can be used.\n1:00\nSo I'm going to draw some vectors.\n1:03\nLet's say I have the vector-- Let's call this vector a.\n1:12\nAnd I'm going to just write this is as a column vector.\n1:14\nAnd all of this is just convention.\n1:16\nThese are just human invented things.\n1:18\nI could have written this diagonally.\n1:19\nI could have written this however.\n1:20\nBut if I say vector a is 3, negative 6.\n1:31\nAnd I view this as the x component of the vector, and\n1:33\nthis is equal to the y component of the vector.\n1:35\nAnd then I have vector b.\n1:41\nVector b is equal to 2, 6.\n1:57\nAnd I want to know are there some combinations of vectors a\n2:04\nand b-- where you can say, 5 times vector a, plus 3 times\n2:08\nvector b, or 10 times victor a minus 6 times vector b-- some\n2:13\ncombination of vector a and b, where I can get vector c.\n2:19\nAnd vector c is the vector 7, 6.\n2:31\nSo let me see if I can visually draw this problem.\n2:33\nSo let me draw the coordinate axes.\n2:35\nLet's see this one.\n2:36\n3, negative 6.\n2:37\nThat'll be in quadrant-- these are both\n2:39\nin the first quadrant.\n2:40\nSo I just want to figure out how much of the\n2:42\naxes I need to draw.\n2:43\nSo let's see-- Let me do a different color.\n2:52\nThat's my y-axis.\n2:53\nI'm not drawing the second or third quadrants, because I\n2:56\ndon't think our vectors show up there.\n2:58\nAnd then this is the x-axis.\n3:03\nLet me draw each of these vectors.\n3:08\nSo first I'll do vector a.\n3:11\nThat's 3, negative 6.\n3:13\n1, 2, 3, and then negative 6.\n3:17\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n3:24\nSo it's there.\n3:26\nSo if I wanted to draw it as a vector, usually\n3:31\nstart at the origin.\n3:34\nAnd it doesn't have to start at the origin like that.\n3:36\nI'm just choosing to.\n3:37\nYou can move around a vector.\n3:39\nIt just has to have the same orientation\n3:42\nand the same magnitude.\n3:45\nSo that is vector a for the green.\n3:52\nNow let me do in magenta, I'll do vector b.\n3:56\nThat is 2, 6.\n3:59\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n4:04\nSo 2, 6 is right over there.\n4:12\nAnd that's vector b.\n4:22\nSo it'll look like this.\n4:25\nThat's vector b.\n4:27\nAnd then let me write down vector a down there.\n4:30\nThat's vector a.\n4:32\nAnd I want to take some combination of\n4:35\nvectors a and b.\n4:36\nAnd add them up and get vector c.\n4:38\nSo what does vector c look like?\n4:39\nIt's 7, 6.\n4:41\nLet me do that in purple.\n4:43\nSo 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n4:50\nComma 6.\n4:52\nSo 7, 6 is right over there.\n4:55\nThat's vector c.\n5:00\nVector c looks like that.\n5:09\nI'm going to draw it like that.\n5:10\nAnd that's vector c.\n5:14\nSo what was the original problem I said?\n5:16\nI said I want to add some multiple of vector a to some\n5:19\nmultiple of vector b, and get vector c.\n5:21\nAnd I want to see what those multiples are.\n5:24\nSo let's say the multiple that I multiply\n5:25\ntimes vector a is x.\n5:27\nAnd the multiple of vector b is y.\n5:29\nSo I essentially want to say that-- let me do it in another\n5:33\nneutral color-- that vector ax-- that's how much of vector\n5:42\na I'm contributing-- plus vector by-- that's how much of\n5:49\nvector b I'm contributing-- is equal to vector c.\n5:54\nAnd you know, maybe I can't.\n5:56\nMaybe there's no combinations of vector a and b when you add\n5:59\nthem together equal vector c.\n6:00\nBut let's see if we can solve this.\n6:03\nSo how do we solve?\n6:03\nSo let's expand out vectors a and b.\n6:05\nVector a is what?\n6:06\n3, negative 6.\n6:07\nSo vector a, we could write as 3, minus 6 times x.\n6:17\nThat just tells us how much vector a we're contributing.\n6:20\nPlus vector b, which is 2, 6.\n6:26\nAnd then y is how much vector b we're contributing.\n6:29\nAnd that is equal to 7, 6.\n6:33\nVector c.\n6:36\nNow this right here, this problem can be rewritten just\n6:41\nbased on how we've defined matrix multiplication, et\n6:43\ncetera, et cetera, as this.\n6:47\nAs 3, minus 6, 2, 6, times x, y, is equal to 7, 6.\n7:07\nNow how does that work out?\n7:09\nWell think about how matrix multiplication works out.\n7:11\nThe way we learned matrix multiplication, we said, 3\n7:16\ntimes x, plus 2 times y is equal to 7.\n7:25\n3 times x plus 2 times y is equal to 7.\n7:28\nThat's how we learned matrix multiplication.\n7:30\nThat's the same thing here.\n7:31\n3 times x, plus 2 times y, is going to be equal to 7.\n7:37\nThese x and y here are just scalar numbers.\n7:39\nSo 3 times x plus 2 times y is equal to 7.\n7:41\nAnd then matrix multiplication here, minus 6 times x plus 6\n7:45\ntimes y is equal to 6.\n7:47\nThat's just traditional matrix multiplication that we learned\n7:49\nseveral videos ago.\n7:50\nThat's the same thing here.\n7:51\nMinus 6x plus 6y is equal to 6.\n7:54\nThese x's and y's are just numbers.\n7:56\nThey're just scalar numbers.\n7:57\nThey're not vectors or anything.\n7:58\nWe would just multiply them times both of these numbers.\n8:01\nSo hopefully you see that this problem is the exact same\n8:03\nthing as this problem.\n8:04\nAnd you've maybe had an a-ha moment now, if you watched the\n8:08\nprevious video.\n8:08\nBecause this matrix also represented the problem, where\n8:16\ndo we find the intersection of two lines?\n8:18\nWhere the two lines-- I'm just going to do it on the side\n8:20\nhere-- the intersection of the two lines, 3x plus\n8:24\n2y is equal to 7.\n8:26\nAnd minus 6x plus 6y is equal to 6.\n8:31\nAnd so, I had drawn two lines.\n8:33\nAnd we said, what's the point of intersection,\n8:34\net cetera, et cetera.\n8:35\nAnd it was represented by this problem.\n8:37\nBut here, we have-- well I won't say a completely\n8:39\ndifferent problem, because we're learning they're\n8:41\nactually very similar-- but here I'm doing a problem of,\n8:43\nI'm trying to find what combination of the matrices a\n8:46\nand b add up to the matrix c.\n8:49\nBut it got reduced to the same matrix representation.\n8:53\nAnd so we can solve this the same exactly way we solved\n8:56\nthis problem.\n8:57\nIf we call this the matrix a, let's figure out a inverse.\n9:02\nSo we get a inverse is equal to what?\n9:06\nIt equals 1 over the determinant of a.\n9:08\nThe determinant of a is 3 times 6.\n9:10\n18 minus minus 12.\n9:13\nSo that's 18 plus 12, which is 1/30.\n9:18\nAnd we did this in the previous video.\n9:19\nYou swap these two numbers.\n9:21\nSo you get 6 and 3.\n9:23\nAnd then you make these two negatives.\n9:25\nSo you get 6 and minus 2.\n9:28\nThat's a inverse.\n9:29\nAnd now to solve for x and y, we can multiply both sides of\n9:32\nthis equation by a inverse.\n9:34\nIf you multiply a inverse times a, this cancels out.\n9:37\nSo you get x, y is equal to a inverse times this.\n9:45\nIt's equal to 1/30 times 6, minus 2, 6, 3.\n9:53\nTimes 7, 6.\n9:55\nAnd remember, with matrices, the order that\n9:58\nyou multiply matters.\n9:59\nSo on this side, we multiplied a inverse on\n10:01\nthis side of the equation.\n10:03\nSo we have to do a inverse on the left side on this side of\n10:06\nthis equation.\n10:07\nSo that's why did it here.\n10:08\nIf we did it the other way, all bets are off.\n10:11\nSo what does this equal?\n10:13\nThis is equal to 1/30 times-- and we did this the previous\n10:17\nproblem-- 6 times 7 is 42, minus 12.\n10:21\n30.\n10:22\n6 times 7, 42.\n10:23\nPlus 18.\n10:24\n60.\n10:26\nSo that equals 1, 2.\n10:30\nSo what does this tell us?\n10:32\nThis tells us that if we have 1 times vector a, plus 2\n10:37\ntimes vector b.\n10:38\n1 times-- this is 1-- and 2 times vector b.\n10:43\nSo 1 times vector a plus 2 times vector b is\n10:46\nequal to vector c.\n10:47\nAnd let's confirm that visually.\n10:49\nSo 1 times vector a.\n10:50\nWell that's vector a right there.\n10:52\nSo if we add 2 vector b's to it, we should get vector c.\n10:55\nSo let's see if we can do that.\n10:57\nSo if we just shift vector b over this way, well vector\n11:01\nlet's see, vector b is over 2 and up 6.\n11:03\nSo over 2 and up 6 would get us there.\n11:08\nSo 1, vector b-- just doing heads to tail visual method of\n11:12\nadding vectors-- would get us there.\n11:16\n1, 2, 3.\n11:17\nGood.\n11:20\nNo, let me see.\n11:23\n1, 2, 3.\n11:26\nAnd then vector b goes over two more.\n11:30\ntwo more.\n11:33\nSo it'll get us up 6.\n11:35\nIt's like that.\n11:36\nSo that's 1, vector b.\n11:40\nAnd then if we add another-- but we want 2 times vector b.\n11:43\nWe essentially need two vector b's.\n11:45\nSo we had one, and then we add another one.\n11:47\nI think visually you see that it does actually-- I didn't\n11:51\nwant to do it like that.\n11:52\nI wanted to use the line tool so it looks neat.\n11:55\nSo you add another vector b.\n11:56\nAnd there you have it.\n11:59\nThat's a vector b.\n12:01\nSo it's 2 times vector b.\n12:02\nSo it's the same direction as vector b, but it's two times\n12:05\nthe length.\n12:06\nSo we visually showed it.\n12:07\nWe solved it algabraically.\n12:10\nBut the real learning, and the big real discovery of this\n12:13\nwhole video, is to show you that the matrix representation\n12:18\ncan represent multiple different problems. This was a\n12:23\nfinding the combinations of a vector problem.\n12:26\nAnd the previous one it was figure out if\n12:28\ntwo lines can intersect.\n12:30\nBut what it tells you is that these two problems are\n12:32\nconnected in some deep way.\n12:33\nThat if we take the veneer of reality, that underlying it,\n12:37\nthey are the same thing.\n12:39\nAnd frankly, that's why math is so interesting.\n12:41\nBecause when you realize that two problems are really the\n12:45\nsame thing, it takes all of the superficial human veneer\n12:48\naway from things.\n12:49\nBecause our brains are kind of wired to perceive the world in\n12:52\na certain way.\n12:52\nBut it tells us that there's some fundamental truth,\n12:56\nindependent of our perception, that is tying all of these\n13:00\ndifferent concepts together.\n13:01\nBut anyway, I don't want to get all mystical on you.\n13:03\nBut if you do see the mysticism in\n13:05\nmath, all the better.\n13:07\nBut hopefully you found that pretty interesting.\n13:10\nAnd actually, I know I'm going over time, but I think this\n13:12\nis-- A lot of people take linear algebra, they learn how\n13:15\nto do all of the things, and they say, well what is the\n13:17\nwhole point of this?\n13:18\nBut this is kind of an interesting\n13:20\nthing to think about.\n13:22\nWe had this had vector a and we had this vector b.\n13:27\nAnd we were able to say, well there's some combinations of\n13:29\nthe vectors a and b, that when we added it up,\n13:31\nwe got vector c.\n13:34\nSo an interesting question is, what are all the vectors that\n13:38\nI could get to by adding combinations of\n13:42\nvectors a and b.\n13:43\nOr adding or subtracting.\n13:44\nOr you could say, I could multiply\n13:46\nthem by negative numbers.\n13:47\nBut either way.\n13:47\nWhat are all of the vectors that I can get by taking\n13:51\nlinear combinations of vectors a and b?\n13:53\nAnd that's actually called the vector space spanned by the\n13:57\nvectors a and b.\n13:58\nAnd we'll do more of that in linear algebra.\n14:01\nAnd here we're dealing with a two\n14:02\ndimensional Euclidean space.\n14:04\nWe could have had three dimensional vectors.\n14:06\nWe could've had n dimensional vectors.\n14:07\nSo it gets really, really, really abstract.\n14:09\nBut this is, I think, a really good toe dipping for linear\n14:14\nalgebra as well.\n14:14\nSo hopefully I haven't confused or overwhelmed you.\n14:17\nAnd I'll see you in the next video.",

This right over here\n1:26\nis equal to M.\n1:27\nNot too difficult.\n1:28\nThis is often called the sum rule, or the sum property,\n1:33\nof limits.\n1:35\nAnd we could come up with a very similar one with differences.\n1:37\nThe limit as x approaches c of f of x minus g of x,\n1:44\nis just going to be L minus M. It's just\n1:47\nthe limit of f of x as x approaches\n1:49\nc, minus the limit of g of x as x approaches c.\n1:52\nSo it's just going to be L minus M.\n1:58\nAnd we also often call it the difference\n2:00\nrule, or the difference property, of limits.\n2:02\nAnd these once again, are very, very, hopefully, reasonably\n2:05\nintuitive.\n2:06\nNow what happens if you take the product of the functions?\n2:08\nThe limit of f of x times g of x as x approaches c.\n2:16\nWell lucky for us, this is going to be\n2:18\nequal to the limit of f of x as x approaches\n2:22\nc, times the limit of g of x, as x approaches c.\n2:28\nLucky for us, this is kind of a fairly intuitive property\n2:31\nof limits.\n2:32\nSo in this case, this is just going\n2:33\nto be equal to, this is L times M. This is just\n2:41\ngoing to be L times M. Same thing,\n2:45\nif instead of having a function here, we had a constant.\n2:47\nSo if we just had the limit-- let\n2:50\nme do it in that same color-- the limit of k times\n2:56\nf of x, as x approaches c, where k is just some constant.\n3:00\nThis is going to be the same thing as k times the limit\n3:03\nof f of x as x approaches c.\n3:06\nAnd that is just equal to L. So this whole thing\n3:13\nsimplifies to k times L.\n3:20\nAnd we can do the same thing with difference.\n3:22\nThis is often called the constant multiple property.\n3:25\nWe can do the same thing with differences.\n3:28\nSo if we have the limit as x approaches\n3:31\nc of f of x divided by g of x.\n3:35\nThis is the exact same thing as the limit\n3:37\nof f of x as x approaches c, divided\n3:41\nby the limit of g of x as x approaches c.\n3:46\nWhich is going to be equal to-- I think you get it now--\n3:49\nthis is going to be equal to L over M.\n3:56\nAnd finally-- this is sometimes called the quotient property--\n3:59\nfinally we'll look at the exponent property.\n4:01\nSo if I have the limit of-- let me\n4:07\nwrite it this way-- of f of x to some power.\n4:09\nAnd actually, let me even write it\n4:10\nas a fractional power, to the r over s\n4:12\npower, where both r and s are integers, then the limit of f\n4:16\nof x to the r over s power as x approaches c,\n4:23\nis going to be the exact same thing as the limit of f\n4:28\nof x as x approaches c raised to the r over s power.\n4:33\nOnce again, when r and s are both integers, and s\n4:36\nis not equal to 0.\n4:37\nOtherwise this exponent would not make much sense.\n4:40\nAnd this is the same thing as L to the r over s power.\n4:46\nSo this is equal to L to the r over s power.\n4:54\nSo using these, we can actually find\n4:56\nthe limit of many, many, many things.\n4:58\nAnd what's neat about it is the property of limits kind of\n5:01\nare the things that you would naturally want to do.\n5:03\nAnd if you graph some of these functions,\n5:05\nit actually turns out to be quite intuitive.",

And its more bizzare because it doesnt have a tangible value\n0:25\nin the sense that we normally, or are used to defining numbers.\n0:29\n\"i\" is defined as the number whose square is equal to negative 1.\n0:35\nThis is the definition of \"i\", and it leads to all sorts of interesting things.\n0:44\nNow some places you will see \"i\" defined this way;\n0:46\n\"i\" as being equal to the principle square root of negative one.\n0:50\nI want to just point out to you that this is not wrong, it might make sense to you,\n0:55\nyou know something squared is negative one, then maybe\n0:57\nits the principle square root of negative one.\n1:00\nAnd so these seem to be almost the same statement,\n1:02\nbut I just want to make you a little bit careful, when you do this\n1:04\nsome people will even go so far as to say this is wrong,\n1:06\nand it actually turns out that they are wrong to say that this is wrong.\n1:09\nBut, when you do this you have to be a little bit careful about what it means\n1:12\nto take a principle square root of a negative number, and it being defined\n1:16\nfor imaginary, and we'll learn in the future, complex numbers.\n1:19\nBut for your understanding right now, you dont have to differentiate them,\n1:22\nyou don't have to split hairs between any of these definitions.\n1:26\nNow with this definition, let us think about what these different powers of \"i\" are.\n1:31\nbecause you can imagine, if something squared is negative one,\n1:33\nif I take it to all sorts of powers, maybe that will give us weird things.\n1:37\nAnd what we'll see is that the powers of \"i\" are kind of neat,\n1:40\nbecause they kind of cycle, where they do cycle, through a whole set of values.\n1:45\nSo I could start with, lets start with \"i\" to the zeroth power.\n1:50\nAnd so you might say, anything to the zeroth power is one,\n1:53\nso \"i\" to the zeroth power is one, and that is true.\n1:57\nAnd you could actually derive that even from this definition,\n1:59\nbut this is pretty straight forward; anything to the zeroth power, including \"i\" is one.\n2:03\nThen you say, ok, what is \"i\" to the first power,\n2:07\nwell anything to the first power is just that number times itself once.\n2:11\nSo that's justgoing to be \"i\".\n2:14\nReally by the definition of what it means to take an exponent,\n2:16\nso that completely makes sense.\n2:18\nAnd then you have \"i\" to the second power.\n2:19\n\"i\" to the second power, well by definition,\n2:22\n\"i\" to the second power is equal to negative one.\n2:29\nLets try \"i\" to the third power ill do this in a color i haven't used.\n2:33\n\"i\" to the third power, well that's going to be \"i\" to the second power times \"i\"\n2:41\nAnd we know that \"i\" to the second power is negative one,\n2:44\nso its negative one times \"i\" let me make that clear.\n2:48\nThis is the same thing as this, which is the same thing as that,\n2:51\n\"i\" squared is negative one.\n2:52\nSo you multiply it out, negative one times \"i\" equals negative \"i\".\n2:58\nNow what happens when you take \"i\" to the fourth power,\n3:01\nI'll do it up here. \"i\" to the fourth power.\n3:06\nWell once again this is going to be \"i\" times \"i\" to the third power.\n3:10\nSo that's \"i\" times \"i\" to the third power. \"i\" times \"i\" to the third power\n3:14\nWell what was \"i\" to the third power? \"i\" to the third power was negative \"i\"\n3:21\nThis over here is negative \"i\". And so \"i\" times \"i\" would get negative one,\n3:28\nbut you have a negative out here, so its \"i\" times \"i\" is negative one,\n3:31\nand you have a negative, that gives you positive one.\n3:35\nLet me write it out. This is the same thing\n3:37\nas, so this is \"i\" times negative \"i\", which is the same thing as\n3:43\nnegative one times, remember multiplication is commutative,\n3:46\nif you're multiplying a bunch of numbers you can just switch the order.\n3:49\nThis is the same thing as negative one times \"i\" times \"i\".\n3:52\n\"i\" times \"i\", by definition, is negative one.\n3:55\nNegative one times negative one is equal to positive one.\n3:59\nSo \"i\" to the fourth is the same thing as \"i\" to the zeroth power.\n4:02\nNow lets try \"i\" to the fifth.\n4:05\n\"i\" to the fifth power. Well that's just going to be \"i\" to to the fourth\n4:09\ntimes \"i\". And we know what \"i\" to the fourth is. It is one.\n4:14\nSo its one times \"i\", or it is one times \"i\",\n4:19\nor it is just \"i\" again. So once again it is exactly the same thing\n4:21\nas \"i\" to the first power.\n4:23\nLets try again just to see the pattern keep going.\n4:25\nLets try \"i\" to the seventh power.\n4:27\nSorry, \"i\" to the sixth power.\n4:28\nWell that's \"i\" times \"i\" to the fifth power, that's \"i\" times \"i\" to the fifth,\n4:35\n\"i\" to the fifth we already established as just \"i\",\n4:38\nso its \"i\" times \"i\", it is equal to, by definition,\"i\" times \"i\" is negative one.\n4:44\nAnd then lets finish off, well we could keep going on this way\n4:47\nWe can keep putting high and higher powers of \"i\" here.\n4:50\nAn we'll see that it keeps cycling back.\n4:52\nIn the next video I'll teach you how taking an arbitrarily high power of \"i\",\n4:56\nhow you can figure out what that's going to be.\n4:58\nBut lets just verify that this cycle keeps going.\n5:00\n\"i\" to the seventh power is equal to \"i\" times \"i\" to the sixth power.\n5:06\n\"i\" to the sixth power is negative one. \"i\" times negative one is negative \"i\".\n5:11\nAnd if you take \"i\" to the eighth, once again it'll be one,\n5:14\n\"i\" to the ninth will be \"i\" again, and so on and so forth.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's say that f(x) is equal to x over the square root of x^2+1\n0:09\nand I want to think about the limit of f(x) as x approaches positive infinity\n0:18\nand the limit of f(x) as x approaches neagative infinity.\n0:25\nSo let's think about what these are going to be.\n0:28\nWell, once again, and I'm not doing this in an ultra-rigorous way but more in an intuitive way\n0:32\nis to think about what this function approximately equals\n0:36\nas we get larger and larger and larger x'es.\n0:38\nThis is the case if we're getting very positive x'es, in very positive infinity direction or very negative.\n0:44\nStill the absolute value of those x'es are very very very large as we approach positive infinity\n0:48\nor negative infinity.\n0:50\nWell, in the numerator we only have only 1 term -- we have this x term --\n0:54\n-- but in the denominator we have 2 terms under the radical here.\n0:57\nAnd as x gets larger and larger and larger either in the positive or the negative direction\n1:01\nthis x squared term is going to really dominate this one\n1:05\nYou can imagine, when x is 1 million, you're going to have a million squared plus one.\n1:09\nThe value of the denominator is going to be dictated by this x squared term.\n1:13\nSo this is going to be approximately equal to x over the square root of x squared.\n1:22\nThis term right over here, the 1 isn't going to matter so much when we get very very very large x'es.\n1:29\nAnd this right over here -- x over the square root of x squared or x over the principle root of x squared --\n1:34\n-- this is going to be equal to x over --\n1:37\n-- if I square something and then take the principle root --\n1:40\n-- remember that the principle root is the positive square root of something --\n1:43\n-- then I'm essentially taking the absolute value of x.\n1:45\nThis is going to be equal to x over the absolute value of x\n1:49\nfor x approaches infinity or for x approaches negative infinity.\n1:57\nSo, another way to say this, another way to restate these limits,\n2:00\nis as we approach infinity, this limit, we can restate it as the limit,\n2:04\nthis is going to be equal to the limit as x approaches infinity of x over the absolute value of x.\n2:11\nNow, for positive x'es the absolute value of x is just going to be x.\n2:15\nThis is going to be x divided by x, so this is just going to be 1.\n2:19\nSimilarly, right over here, we take the limit as we go to negative infinity,\n2:23\nthis is going to be the limit of x over the absolute value of x as x approaches negative infinity.\n2:29\nRemember, the only reason I was able to make this statement is that f(x) and this thing right over here\n2:35\nbecome very very similar, you can kind of say converge to each other,\n2:39\nas x gets very very very large or x gets very very very very negative.\n2:45\nNow, for negative values of x the absolute value of x is going to be positive,\n2:50\nx is obviously going to be negative and we're just going to get negative 1.\n2:55\nAnd so using this, we can actually try to graph our function.\n3:01\nSo let's try to do that.\n3:02\nSo let's say, that is my y axis,\n3:06\nthis is my x axis,\n3:10\nand we see that we have 2 horizontal asymptotes.\n3:13\nWe have 1 horizontal asymptote at y=1,\n3:17\nso let's say this right over here is y=1,\n3:20\nlet me draw that line as dotted line,\n3:23\nwe're going to approach this thing,\n3:25\nand then we have another horizontal asymptote at y=-1.\n3:29\nSo that might be right over there, y=-1.\n3:37\nAnd if we want to plot at least 1 point we can think about what does f(0) equal.\n3:41\nSo, f(0) is going to be equal to 0 over the square root of 0+1, or 0 squared plus 1.\n3:50\nWell that's all just going to be equal to zero.\n3:53\nSo we have this point, right over here,\n3:57\nand we know that as x approaches infinity, we're approaching this blue, horizontal asymptote,\n4:02\nso it might look something like this.\n4:06\nLet me do it a little bit differently. There you go.\n4:12\nI'll clean this up. So it might look something like this.\n4:16\nThat's not the color I wanted to use.\n4:18\nSo it might look something like that.\n4:25\nWe get closer and closer to that asymptote as x gets larger and larger\n4:29\nand then like this -- we get closer and closer to this asymptote as x approaches negative infinity.\n4:38\nI'm not drawing it so well.\n4:39\nSo that right over there is y=f(x).\n4:44\nAnd you can verify this by taking a calculator, trying to plot more points\n4:48\nor using some type of graphing calculator or something.\n4:50\nBut anyway, I just wanted to tackle another situation we're approaching infinity and or negative infinity\n4:54\nand we're trying to determine the horizontal asymptotes.\n4:57\nAnd remember, the key is just to say what terms dominate\n5:01\nas x approaches positive infinity or negative infinity.\n5:05\nTo say, well, what is that function going to approach, and it's going to approach this horizontal asymptote\n5:10\nin the positive direction and this one in the negative.",

    "question_type": "MCQ",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nDetermine the domain and range\n0:02\nof the function f of x is equal to 3x squared plus 6x minus 2.\n0:08\nSo, the domain of the function is: what is a set of all of the valid inputs,\n0:12\nor all of the valid x values for this function?\n0:16\nAnd, I can take any real number, square it, multiply it by 3,\n0:19\nthen add 6 times that real number and then subtract 2 from it.\n0:23\nSo essentially any number if we're talking about reals when we talk about any number.\n0:27\nSo, the domain, the set of valid inputs, the set of\n0:30\ninputs over which this function is defined, is all real numbers.\n0:35\nSo, the domain here is all real numbers.\n0:44\nAnd, for those of you who might say, well, you know, aren't all numbers real?\n0:48\nYou may or may not know that there is a class of numbers,\n0:50\nthat are a little bit bizarre when you first learn them,\n0:53\ncalled imaginary numbers and complex numbers.\n0:56\nBut, I won't go into that right now.\n0:57\nBut, most of the traditional numbers that you know of,\n1:00\nthey are part of the set of real numbers.\n1:02\nIt's pretty much everything but complex numbers.\n1:05\nSo, you take any real number and you put it here,\n1:07\nyou can square it, multiply it by 3, then add 6 times it and subtract 2.\n1:11\nNow, the range, at least the way we've been thinking about it\n1:14\nin this series of videos--\n1:16\nThe range is set of possible, outputs of this function.\n1:21\nOr if we said y equals f of x on a graph, it's a set\n1:26\nof all the possible y values.\n1:29\nAnd, to get a flavor for this, I'm going to try to graph\n1:31\nthis function right over here.\n1:33\nAnd, if you're familiar with quadratics--\n1:35\nand that's what this function is right over here, it is a quadratic--\n1:38\nyou might already know that it has a parabolic shape.\n1:41\nAnd, so its shape might look something like this.\n1:43\nAnd, actually this one will look like this, it's upward opening.\n1:46\nBut other parabolas have shapes like that.\n1:48\nAnd, you see when a parabola has a shape like this,\n1:51\nit won't take on any values below its vertex when it's upward opening,\n1:55\nand it won't take on any values above its vertex when it is downward opening.\n1:59\nSo, let's see if we can graph this and maybe get a sense of its vertex.\n2:04\nThere are ways to calculate the vertex exactly,\n2:07\nbut let's see how we can think about this problem.\n2:10\nSo, I'm gonna try some x and y values.\n2:12\nThere's other ways to directly compute the vertex.\n2:16\nNegative b over 2a is the formula for it.\n2:18\nIt comes straight out of the quadratic\n2:19\nformula, which you get from completing the square.\n2:22\nLets try some x values and lets see what f of x is equal to.\n2:27\nSo, let's try, well this the values we've been trying the last two videos.\n2:30\nWhat happens when x is equal to negative two?\n2:33\nThen f of x is 3 times negative 2 squared, which is 4, plus 6 times\n2:39\nnegative 2, which is 6 times negative 2, so it's minus 12 minus 2.\n2:44\nSo, this is 12 minus 12 minus 2.\n2:48\nSo, it's equal to negative 2.\n2:49\nNow, what happens when x is equal to negative 1?\n2:53\nSo, this is going to be 3 times negative 1 squared, which is just 1, minus, or I\n2:59\nshould say plus 6 times negative 1 which is\n3:02\nminus 6 and then minus 2, and then minus 2.\n3:07\nSo, this is 3 minus 6 is negative 3 minus\n3:10\n2 is equal negative 5, and that actually is the vertex.\n3:14\nAnd, you know the formula for the vertex, once again, is negative b over 2 a.\n3:19\nSo, negative b.\n3:20\nThat's the coefficient on this term right over here.\n3:22\nIt's negative 6 over 2 times this one right over here, 2 times 3.\n3:26\n2 times 3, this is equal to negative 1.\n3:30\nSo, that is the vertex, but let's just keep on going right over here.\n3:34\nSo, what happens when x is equal to 0?\n3:36\nThese first two terms are 0, you're just left with a negative 2.\n3:40\nWhen x is equal to positive 1.\n3:42\nAnd, this is where you can see that this\n3:44\nis the vertex, and you start seeing the symmetry.\n3:46\nIf you go one above the vertex, f of x is equal to negative 2.\n3:50\nIf you go one x value below the vertex, or below the x\n3:53\nvalue of the vertex, f of x is equal to negative 2 again.\n3:56\nBut, let's just keep going.\n3:58\nWe could try, let's do one more point over here.\n4:01\nSo, we have, we could try, x is equal to 1.\n4:04\nWhen x is equal to 1, you have 3 times one squared which is 1.\n4:09\nSo, 3 times 1 plus 6 times 1, which is just 6, minus 2.\n4:14\nSo, this is 9 minus 2 it's equal to 7.\n4:16\nAnd, that I think is enough points to give\n4:19\nus a scaffold of what this graph will look like.\n4:22\nWhat the graph of the function would look like.\n4:25\nSo, it would look something like this.\n4:28\nI do my best to draw it.\n4:30\nSo, this is a x equals negative 2.\n4:34\nWe draw the whole axis.\n4:35\nThis is x is equal to negative 1, this is x is equal to, this is x is\n4:40\nequal to 0 and then this is x is equal to 1 right over there and then\n4:45\nwhen x is equal to, we go from negative 2 all the way to positive.\n4:50\nOr, we should go from negative 5 all the way to positive 7.\n4:54\nSo, let's say this is negative 1,2,3,4,5.\n5:00\nThat's negative five over there on the y axis,\n5:03\ny axis and then it will go to positive 7.\n5:06\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven.\n5:12\nI could keep going, this is in the y, and we're going\n5:15\nto set y equal to whatever our output of the function is.\n5:18\nY is equal to f of x.\n5:20\nAnd this is one right here.\n5:22\nSo, lets plot the points.\n5:23\nYou have the point negative 2, negative 2.\n5:26\nWhen x is negative 2, this is the x axis.\n5:28\nWhen x is negative 2, y is negative 2.\n5:32\nY is negative 2 so that is that right over 3.\n5:36\nSo, that is the point, that is the point negative 2, negative 2.\n5:41\nFair enough?\n5:42\nThen, we have this point that we have this pink or purplish color.\n5:47\nNegative, when x is negative 1, f of x is negative 5.\n5:49\nWhen x is negative 1, f of x is negative 5.\n5:53\nAnd, we already said that this is the vertex.\n5:54\nAnd, you'll see the symmetry around it in a second.\n5:56\nSo, this is the point negative 1, negative 5.\n5:59\nAnd then, with the point 0, negative 2.\n6:03\n0, negative when x is a 0, y is negative 2, for f' of x is negative\n6:09\n2 or f of 0 is negative 2, so this is the point 0, negative 2,\n6:14\nand then finally when x is equal to 1 and f of 1 is 7, f of 1 is 7.\n6:20\nSo, that's right there it's a point 1, 7 and it gives us a\n6:24\nscaffold for what this parabola, what this curve will look like.\n6:30\nSo, I'll try my best to draw it respectably.\n6:34\nSo, it would look something, something like\n6:37\nthat, and keep on going in that direction.\n6:40\nKeep on going in that direction.\n6:42\nBut, I think you see the symmetry around the vertex.\n6:45\nThat if you were to.\n6:46\nIf you were to put a line right over here, the\n6:47\ntwo sides are kind of the mirror images of each other.\n6:50\nThere, you can flip them over, and that's how we know it's the vertex.\n6:53\nAnd, that's how we also know, because this is an upward opening parabola, I\n6:56\nmean, there is formulas for vertex, and there are multiple ways of calculating it.\n7:01\nBut, since it's an upward opening parabola, where\n7:03\nthe vertex is going to be, the minimum point.\n7:05\nThis is the minimum value that the parabola will take on.\n7:08\nSo, going back to the original question, this is all for trying to figure out\n7:12\nthe range, the set of y values, the set of outputs that this function can generate.\n7:16\nYou see that the function, it can get as low as negative 5.\n7:19\nIt got all the way down to negative 5 right at the vertex.\n7:22\nBut, as you go to the right, as x values increase to\n7:25\nthe right or decrease to the left, then the parabola goes upwards.\n7:30\nSo, the parabola can never give you values--\n7:32\nf of x is never going to be less than negative 5.\n7:36\nSo, our domain, but it can take on all the vaues.\n7:37\nIt can keep on increasing forever as x gets\n7:39\nlarger, x gets smaller farther away from the vertex.\n7:42\nSo, our range, so we already said our domain is all real numbers.\n7:46\nOur range, the possible y values is all real\n7:52\nnumbers greater than or equal to negative 5.\n7:58\nIt can take on the value of any\n8:00\nreal number greater than or equal to negative 5.\n8:02\nNothing less than negative 5.",

We could represent vector\n1:00\nv as an ordered list or a 2-tuple of-- so we could say we\n1:08\nmove 2 in the horizontal direction\n1:11\nand 3 in the vertical direction.\n1:14\nSo you could represent it like that.\n1:16\nYou could represent vector v like this,\n1:19\nwhere it is 2 comma 3, like that.\n1:25\nAnd what I now want to introduce you to--\n1:27\nand we could come up with other ways of representing\n1:29\nthis 2-tuple-- is another notation.\n1:32\nAnd this really comes out of the idea\n1:34\nof what it means to add and scale vectors.\n1:37\nAnd to do that, we're going to define\n1:39\nwhat we call unit vectors.\n1:45\nAnd if we're in two dimensions, we\n1:47\ndefine a unit vector for each of the dimensions\n1:49\nwe're operating in.\n1:50\nIf we're in three dimensions, we would define a unit vector\n1:53\nfor each of the three dimensions that we're operating in.\n1:56\nAnd so let's do that.\n1:57\nSo let's define a unit vector i.\n2:00\nAnd the way that we denote that is the unit vector\n2:04\nis, instead of putting an arrow on top,\n2:06\nwe put this hat on top of it.\n2:09\nSo the unit vector i, if we wanted\n2:11\nto write it in this notation right over here,\n2:14\nwe would say it only goes 1 unit in the horizontal direction,\n2:18\nand it doesn't go at all in the vertical direction.\n2:21\nSo it would look something like this.\n2:26\nThat is the unit vector i.\n2:29\nAnd then we can define another unit vector.\n2:31\nAnd let's call that unit vector--\n2:33\nor it's typically called j, which\n2:37\nwould go only in the vertical direction and not\n2:40\nin the horizontal direction.\n2:41\nAnd not in the horizontal direction,\n2:43\nand it goes 1 unit in the vertical direction.\n2:45\nSo this went 1 unit in the horizontal.\n2:48\nAnd now j is going to go 1 unit in the vertical.\n2:54\nSo j-- just like that.\n2:57\nNow any vector, any two dimensional vector,\n3:00\nwe can now represent as a sum of scaled up versions of i and j.\n3:07\nAnd you say, well, how do we do that?\n3:09\nWell, you could imagine vector v right here\n3:13\nis the sum of a vector that moves purely\n3:15\nin the horizontal direction that has a length 2,\n3:18\nand a vector that moves purely in the vertical direction that\n3:21\nhas length 3.\n3:23\nSo we could say that vector v-- let\n3:28\nme do it in that same blue color--\n3:33\nis equal to-- so if we want a vector that has length 2\n3:36\nand it moves purely in the horizontal direction,\n3:39\nwell, we could just scale up the unit vector i.\n3:42\nWe could just multiply 2 times i.\n3:44\nSo let's do that-- is equal to 2 times our unit vector i.\n3:49\nSo 2i is going to be this whole thing\n3:52\nright over here or this whole vector.\n3:55\nLet me do it in this yellow color.\n3:56\nThis vector right over here, you could view as 2i.\n4:00\nAnd then to that, we're going to add 3 times j-- so plus 3 times\n4:08\nj.\n4:11\nLet me write it like this.\n4:12\nLet me get that color.\n4:15\nOnce again, 3 times j is going to be\n4:18\nthis vector right over here.\n4:20\nAnd if you add this yellow vector right over here\n4:25\nto the magenta vector, you're going to get-- notice,\n4:29\nwe're putting the tail of the magenta vector\n4:31\nat the head of the yellow vector.\n4:32\nAnd if you start at the tail of the yellow vector\n4:34\nand you go all the way to the head of the magenta vector,\n4:36\nyou have now constructed vector v. So vector v,\n4:42\nyou could represent it as a column vector like this, 2 3.\n4:46\nYou could represent it as 2 comma 3,\n4:48\nor you could represent it as 2 times i with this little hat\n4:51\nover it, plus 3 times j, with this little hat over it.\n4:55\ni is the unit vector in the horizontal direction,\n4:57\nin the positive horizontal direction.\n4:59\nIf you want to go the other way, you\n5:00\nwould multiply it by a negative.\n5:02\nAnd j is the unit vector in the vertical direction.\n5:05\nAs we'll see in future videos, once you\n5:07\ngo to three dimensions, you'll introduce a k.\n5:11\nBut it's very natural to translate between these two\n5:13\nthings.\n5:13\nNotice, 2, 3-- 2, 3.\n5:16\nAnd so with that, let's actually do some vector operations\n5:19\nusing this notation.\n5:21\nSo let's say that I define another vector.\n5:24\nLet's say it is vector b.\n5:31\nI'll just come up with some numbers here.\n5:33\nVector b is equal to negative 1 times i-- times the unit vector\n5:39\ni-- plus 4 times the unit vector in the horizontal direction.\n5:48\nSo given these two vector definitions,\n5:50\nwhat would the would be the vector v plus b be equal to?\n5:57\nAnd I encourage you to pause the video and think about it.\n6:00\nWell once again, we just literally\n6:02\nhave to add corresponding components.\n6:04\nWe could say, OK, well let's think\n6:05\nabout what we're doing in the horizontal direction.\n6:07\nWe're going 2 in the horizontal direction here,\n6:09\nand now we're going negative 1.\n6:11\nSo our horizontal component is going\n6:13\nto be 2 plus negative 1-- 2 plus negative 1\n6:20\nin the horizontal direction.\n6:22\nAnd we're going to multiply that times the unit vector i.\n6:24\nAnd this, once again, just goes back\n6:26\nto adding the corresponding components of the vector.\n6:30\nAnd then we're going to have plus 4, or plus 3 plus 4-- And\n6:36\nlet me write it that way-- times the unit vector\n6:47\nj in the vertical direction.\n6:50\nAnd so that's going to give us-- I'll\n6:54\ndo this all in this one color-- 2 plus negative 1 is 1i.\n6:59\nAnd we could literally write that just as i.\n7:01\nActually, let's do that.\n7:02\nLet's just write that as i.\n7:03\nBut we got that from 2 plus negative 1 is 1.\n7:05\n1 times the vector is just going to be that vector,\n7:08\nplus 3 plus 4 is 7-- 7j.\n7:15\nAnd you see, this is exactly how we saw vector addition\n7:19\nin the past, is that we could also represent vector\n7:22\nb like this.\n7:23\nWe could represent it like this-- negative 1, 4.\n7:31\nAnd so if you were to add v to b,\n7:33\nyou add the corresponding terms.\n7:35\nSo if we were to add corresponding terms, looking\n7:39\nat them as column vectors, that is\n7:41\ngoing to be equal to 2 plus negative 1, which is 1.\n7:46\n3 plus 4 is 7.\n7:49\nSo this is the exact same representation as this.\n7:52\nThis is using unit vector notation,\n7:54\nand this is representing it as a column vector.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nLet's figure out the shape of the methane molecule\n0:03\nusing VSEPR theory.\n0:06\nSo the first thing that you do is draw a dot structure\n0:08\nto show it the valence electrons.\n0:10\nSo for methane, carbon is in group four.\n0:13\nSo 4 valence electrons.\n0:14\nHydrogen is in group one, and I have four of them, so 1 times 4\n0:18\nis 4, plus 4 is 8 valence electrons\n0:21\nthat we need to show in our dot structure.\n0:23\nCarbon goes in the center and carbon\n0:25\nis bonded to 4 hydrogens, so I can go ahead and put\n0:28\nmy hydrogens in there like that.\n0:30\nAnd this is a very simple dot structure.\n0:31\nWe've already shown all 8 of our valence electrons.\n0:34\nLet me go ahead and highlight those here.\n0:35\n2, 4, six, and 8.\n0:38\nSo carbon has an octet and we are done.\n0:41\nThe next thing we need to do is count the number\n0:44\nof electron clouds that surround our central atom.\n0:48\nSo remember, electron clouds are regions of electron density,\n0:52\nall right?\n0:52\nSo we can think about these bonding electrons\n0:55\nhere as being electron clouds.\n0:57\nSo that's one electron cloud.\n0:58\nHere's another one down here.\n1:01\nAnd then here's one.\n1:02\nAnd then finally, here's another one.\n1:04\nSo we have four electron clouds surrounding our central atom.\n1:08\nThe next step is to predict the geometry of your electron\n1:11\nclouds around your central atom.\n1:13\nAnd so VSEPR theory tells us that those valence electrons\n1:17\nare going to repel each other since they are negatively\n1:19\ncharged.\n1:20\nAnd therefore, they're going to try\n1:21\nto get as far away from each other as they can in space.\n1:24\nAnd when you have four electron clouds,\n1:26\nthe electron clouds are farthest away from each other\n1:28\nif they point towards the course of a tetrahedron, which\n1:31\nis a four sided figure.\n1:33\nSo let me go ahead and draw the molecule here,\n1:35\ndraw the methane molecule.\n1:36\nI'm going to attempt to show it in a tetrahedral geometry.\n1:40\nAnd then I'll actually show you what\n1:41\na tetrahedron looks like here.\n1:43\nSo here's a quick sketch of what the molecule sort of looks\n1:46\nlike.\n1:47\nAnd let me go ahead and draw tetrahedron over\n1:49\nhere so you can get a little bit better idea of the shape,\n1:52\nall right?\n1:53\nSo four sided figure.\n1:55\nAnd so there you go.\n1:56\nSomething like that.\n1:57\nSo you could think about the corners of your tetrahedron\n2:00\nas being approximately where your hydrogens are\n2:04\nand that just gives you a little bit better visual picture\n2:07\nof that tetrahedron, that four sided figure here.\n2:10\nAnd so we've created the geometry of the electron clouds\n2:13\naround our central atom.\n2:15\nAnd in step four, we ignore any lone pairs\n2:18\naround our central atom, which we have none this time.\n2:20\nAnd so therefore, the geometry the molecule\n2:22\nis the same as the geometry of our electron pairs.\n2:25\nSo we can say that methane is a tetrahedral molecule like that.\n2:32\nAll right, in terms of bond angles.\n2:34\nSo our goal now is to figure out what the bond angles are\n2:38\nin a tetrahedral molecule.\n2:39\nTurns out to be 109.5 degrees in space.\n2:43\nSo that's having those bonding electrons\n2:45\nas far away from each other as they possibly\n2:47\ncan using VSEPR theory.\n2:50\nSo 109.5 degrees turns out to be the ideal bond\n2:54\nangle for a tetrahedral molecule.\n2:57\nLet's go ahead and do another one.\n2:58\nLet's look at ammonia.\n3:00\nSo we have NH3.\n3:02\nFirst thing we need to do is draw the dot structure.\n3:04\nSo we start by finding our valence electrons, nitrogen\n3:08\nin group five.\n3:09\nSo 5 valence electrons.\n3:11\nHydrogen in group one, and I have three of them.\n3:13\nSo 1 times 3 plus 5 is 8.\n3:15\nSo once again, we have 8 valence electrons to worry about.\n3:19\nWe put nitrogen in the center and we\n3:22\nknow nitrogen has bonded to 3 hydrogens,\n3:25\nso we go ahead and put our 3 hydrogens in there like that.\n3:27\nLet's see how many valence electrons we've used up so far.\n3:30\n2, 4, and 6.\n3:33\nSo 8 minus 6 is 2 valence electrons left.\n3:36\nWe can't put them on our terminal atoms,\n3:38\nbecause the hydrogens are already\n3:39\nsurrounded by two electrons.\n3:40\nSo we go ahead and put those two valence electrons\n3:43\non our central atom, which is our nitrogen like that.\n3:46\nAnd so now we've gone ahead and represented those two valence\n3:49\nelectrons.\n3:50\nSo we have all eight valence electrons\n3:52\nshown for our dot structure.\n3:54\nAll right, we go back up here to our steps\n3:56\nto remind us what to do after we've drawn our dot structure.\n3:59\nAnd we can see that now we're going\n4:01\nto think about the electron clouds that\n4:03\nsurrounded the central atom.\n4:05\nSo regions of electron density.\n4:07\nAnd let's go ahead and find those.\n4:10\nSo I can see that I have these bonding electrons.\n4:13\nThat's a region of electron density,\n4:15\nso that's an electron cloud.\n4:17\nHere's another one.\n4:18\nSo that's two.\n4:18\nHere's another one.\n4:19\nSo that's three.\n4:21\nAnd this lone pair of electrons, this non-bonding pair\n4:25\nof electrons is also going to be counted as an electron cloud.\n4:28\nIt's a region of electron density too.\n4:30\nAnd so once again we have four regions of electron density.\n4:35\nWhen you're thinking about the geometry of those electron\n4:39\nclouds, those four electron clouds\n4:41\nare going to, once again, try to point\n4:44\ntowards the corners of a tetrahedron.\n4:45\nSo we can kind of sketch out the ammonia molecule.\n4:48\nAnd we can draw the base the same way we did before,\n4:50\nwith our three hydrogens right here.\n4:53\nAnd then we're going to go ahead and put\n4:55\nour lone pair of electrons right up here.\n4:58\nAnd so again, it's an attempt to show the electron clouds\n5:04\nin a tetrahedral geometry.\n5:06\nLet's go back up here and look at our steps again.\n5:10\nSo in step three, we predicted the geometry electron clouds\n5:14\nare going to attempt to be in a tetrahedron shape\n5:16\naround our central atom.\n5:18\nBut when we're actually talking about the geometry or shape\n5:20\nof the molecule, we're going to ignore any lone pairs when\n5:24\nwe predict the geometry of the molecule.\n5:25\nSo when we look at the ammonia molecule,\n5:27\nwe're going to ignore that lone pair of electrons\n5:30\non top of the nitrogen and we're just\n5:31\ngoing to focus in on the bottom part for the shape here.\n5:35\nAnd so when we do that, we get something\n5:37\nthat looks like a little squat pyramid here.\n5:39\nSo if I'm [? ignoring ?] that lone pair of electrons\n5:41\nup there at the top, it's going to look something\n5:44\nlike that for the shape.\n5:47\nAnd we call this trigonal pyramidal.\n5:49\nSo this is a trigonal pyramidal shape.\n5:57\nSo even though the electron clouds\n6:00\nare attempting to be in a tetrahedron fashion,\n6:03\nthe shape is more trigonal pyramidal\n6:04\nbecause we ignore any lone pairs of electrons.\n6:08\nIn terms of a bond angle, this lone pair\n6:12\nof electrons on the nitrogen actually occupies more space.\n6:17\nThese non-bonding electrons occupy a little more space\n6:19\nthan bonding electrons.\n6:21\nAnd because of that, those non-bonding electrons\n6:24\nare going to repel these bonding electrons.\n6:27\nI'm going to go ahead and put them\n6:28\nin blue here just as an example.\n6:31\nRepel these a little bit more than in the previous example\n6:34\nthat we saw.\n6:35\nAnd that's actually going to make the bond\n6:37\nangle a little bit smaller than the ideal bonding angle\n6:39\nwe saw before for 109.5 for a tetrahedral arrangement\n6:43\nof electron clouds.\n6:45\nAnd so it turns out that this bond angle between the atoms,\n6:50\nthe hydrogen nitrogen hydrogen bond angle\n6:52\ngets a little bit smaller than 109.5.\n6:55\nSo it actually gets smaller to approximately 107 degrees\n6:59\nhere for a trigonal pyramidal situation.\n7:02\nAll right, let's do one more.\n7:05\nLet's go ahead and do the water molecule.\n7:07\nAll right, so we have H2O.\n7:09\nAnd to follow our steps, we know that hydrogen's in group one.\n7:12\nI have two of them.\n7:13\nAnd we know that oxygen is in group six.\n7:16\nSo 6 plus 2 is once again 8 valence electrons\n7:19\nto represent for our dot structure.\n7:21\nAnd we put oxygen in the center.\n7:24\nOxygen is bonded to two hydrogens,\n7:26\nso we go ahead and draw those in there.\n7:28\nAnd let's see, how many valence electrons have\n7:30\nwe represented so far?\n7:31\nThat's 2, that's 4.\n7:33\nSo 8 minus 4 is 4 valence electrons left.\n7:37\nWe first think about putting them on our terminal atoms,\n7:39\nbut those are our hydrogens, so they're already\n7:41\nhappy with two electrons.\n7:42\nSo we go ahead and put those four valence electrons\n7:45\non our central atom, which is our oxygen.\n7:47\nAnd four valence electrons means two lone pairs of electrons\n7:51\nnow.\n7:52\nAnd so now we've represented all eight valence electrons\n7:55\nfor water.\n7:56\nOur next step is, of course, to count how many electron clouds\n8:00\nwe have around our central atom.\n8:02\nSo once again, we could think about these bonding electrons\n8:04\nas being an electron cloud.\n8:06\nThese bonding electrons as being electron cloud,\n8:09\nthese non-bonding electrons as lone pairs in an electron\n8:12\ncloud, and same thing for these non-bonding electrons,\n8:15\nelectron cloud over there as well.\n8:17\nAnd so once again we have four electron clouds.\n8:20\nAnd those four electron clouds are\n8:22\ngoing to attempt to be in a tetrahedral arrangement\n8:25\naround that central atom.\n8:26\nUsing VSEPR theory, they're going to repel each other\n8:29\nand get as far away from each other as they possibly can.\n8:35\nLet me go and redraw the molecule here.\n8:37\nSo let's go ahead.\n8:38\nAnd we have our water molecule and we\n8:41\nhave our lone pairs of electrons like that.\n8:45\nAnd in this case we have two lone pairs of electrons.\n8:48\nRemember, lone pairs or non-bonding electrons take up\n8:51\na little bit more space than bonding electrons.\n8:54\nAnd therefore, they're going to repel these electrons right\n8:58\nin here a little bit more.\n9:00\nAnd that's going to make our bond angle even smaller\n9:03\nthan before.\n9:04\nSo it's going to be even smaller than 107 degrees.\n9:07\nAnd so this bond angle right here,\n9:09\nyou'll see it listed as approximately 104.5 degrees,\n9:13\nor some textbooks will say 105 degrees.\n9:16\nSo that's approximately what it is for this.\n9:18\nIn terms of the geometry of the molecule.\n9:22\nSo the geometry of the electron clouds are attempting to be,\n9:24\nonce again, a tetrahedral fashion,\n9:26\nbut the geometry of the molecule is different\n9:28\nbecause you ignore lone pairs of electrons.\n9:30\nAnd so when you look at the shape,\n9:32\nif you look at the shape of this--\n9:34\nI'll go ahead and draw the shape over here.\n9:36\nIf you're ignoring lone pairs of electrons, it looks like that.\n9:38\nAnd we've seen that shape before.\n9:40\nThat's bent or angular.\n9:42\nSo we say that the geometry of the water molecule\n9:45\nis bent or angular with an approximately 104.5 degree\n9:51\nbond angle.\n9:52\nSo those are a couple examples of four electron clouds\n9:56\nand how to figure out the geometry while also\n10:00\nthinking about the bond angles.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWhat I want to do in this video is\n0:01\nto show that if we start with any arbitrary triangle--\n0:04\nand this will be the arbitrary triangle that we're starting\n0:07\nwith-- that we can always make this\n0:10\nthe medial triangle of a larger triangle.\n0:13\nAnd when we say the medial triangle,\n0:15\nwe mean that each of the vertices of this triangle\n0:18\nwill be the midpoint of the sides of a larger triangle.\n0:21\nAnd I wanted to show that you can always construct that.\n0:24\nIf you start with this triangle, you\n0:25\ncan always have this be the medial triangle of a larger\n0:29\ntriangle.\n0:30\nSo to do that, let's draw a line that\n0:33\ngoes through this point right over here,\n0:35\nbut that's parallel to this line down here.\n0:39\nSo this line and this line up here are going to be parallel.\n0:44\nSo just like that.\n0:46\nAnd immediately we can start to say\n0:47\nsome interesting things about the angles.\n0:49\nSo if we have a transversal right over here,\n0:53\nwe could view this side as a transversal of these two\n0:55\nparallel lines, or of this line in the segment.\n0:58\nWe know that alternate interior angles are congruent.\n1:01\nSo that angle is going to be congruent to that angle.\n1:04\nAnd we also know that this angle in blue,\n1:07\nis going to be congruent to that angle right over there.\n1:10\nNow, let's do that for the other two sides.\n1:12\nSo let's create a line that is parallel\n1:16\nto this side of the triangle, but that\n1:19\ngoes through this point right over here.\n1:22\nSo let me draw it as well as possible.\n1:27\nAnd so these two characters are going to be parallel,\n1:29\nand you could always construct a line that's parallel\n1:31\nto another line that goes to a point that's not on that line.\n1:35\nAnd so once again, we can use alternate interior angles.\n1:39\nWe know that if this angle right over here-- let's\n1:42\nsay we have this orange angle-- it's alternate interior angle\n1:45\nis this angle right over there.\n1:48\nWe also have corresponding angles.\n1:50\nThis blue angle corresponds to this angle right over here.\n1:55\nSo it will correspond to that angle right over there.\n1:59\nAnd now let's draw another line that is parallel\n2:01\nto this line right over here, but it\n2:05\ngoes through this vertex.\n2:06\nIt goes through the vertex that's opposite that line.\n2:09\nAnd so let me just draw it.\n2:11\nAnd you can always construct these parallel lines just\n2:15\nlike that.\n2:16\nAnd let's see what happens.\n2:17\nSo once again, these two lines are parallel.\n2:19\nSo you could view this green line as a transversal.\n2:21\nIf this green line is a transversal,\n2:23\nthis corresponding angle is this angle right over here.\n2:29\nIf we view this green line as a transversal of both\n2:32\nof these pink lines, then this angle\n2:35\ncorresponds to this angle right over here.\n2:39\nIf we view this yellow line as a transversal of both\n2:42\nof these pink lines-- actually, let's look at it this way.\n2:47\nView the pink line as a transversal of these two\n2:50\nyellow lines, then we know that this angle corresponds\n2:53\nto this angle right over here.\n2:56\nAnd if you view this yellow line as a transversal of these two\n2:59\npink lines, then this angle corresponds\n3:02\nto this angle right over here.\n3:06\nAnd then the last thing we need to think about\n3:11\nis if we think about the two green parallel lines\n3:18\nand you view this yellow line as a transversal,\n3:22\nthen this corresponding angle in orange is right over here.\n3:27\nThis corresponds to that angle, because this yellow line\n3:30\nis a transversal on both of these green lines.\n3:33\nSo what I've just shown starting with this inner triangle\n3:37\nright over here is that if I construct these parallel lines\n3:40\nin this way, that I now have four triangles\n3:43\nif I include the original one, and they're all\n3:45\ngoing to be similar to each other.\n3:47\nAnd we know that they're all similar\n3:48\nbecause they all have the exact same angles.\n3:50\nYou just need two angles to prove similarity.\n3:52\nBut all four of these triangles have the exact three angles.\n3:55\nNow, the other thing we can show is that they're congruent.\n3:58\nSo all of these four are similar.\n4:00\nAnd we also know they're congruent.\n4:01\nFor example, this side right over here in yellow\n4:06\nis the side in this triangle, between the orange\n4:08\nand the green side, is the side between the orange\n4:11\nand the green side on this triangle right over here.\n4:13\nSo these two-- we have an angle, a side, and an angle.\n4:18\nAngle-side-angle congruency.\n4:20\nSo these two are going to be congruent to each other.\n4:23\nThen over here, on this inner triangle,\n4:26\nour original triangle, the side that's\n4:28\nbetween the orange and the blue side\n4:30\nis going to be congruent to the side between the orange\n4:33\nand the blue side on that triangle.\n4:35\nOnce again, we have angle-side-angle congruency.\n4:37\nSo this is congruent to this, which is congruent to that.\n4:40\nAll of these are going to be congruent.\n4:42\nAnd by the same exact argument, this middle triangle\n4:49\nis going to be congruent to this bottom triangle.\n4:52\nYou have an angle, blue angle, purple side, green angle.\n4:56\nBlue angle, purple side, green angle.\n4:59\nThey're congruent to each other.\n5:00\nSo you have all of these triangles\n5:02\nare congruent to each other.\n5:04\nSo their corresponding sides are equal.\n5:06\nSo if you look at this triangle over here,\n5:10\nwe know that the side between the blue angle\n5:15\nand the green angle is going to be\n5:19\nequal to this angle right over here.\n5:21\nSorry, equal to this length.\n5:24\nSo it's going to be equal to this length.\n5:25\nBetween the blue and the green we\n5:27\nhave this length, between the blue and the green\n5:29\nwe have that length, between the blue and the green we\n5:31\nhave that length right over there.\n5:33\nSo you immediately see that this point-- and let me label it\n5:35\nnow, maybe I should've labeled it before.\n5:37\nIf we call that point A, we see that A\n5:39\nis the midpoint of-- let's call this point B,\n5:44\nand call this point C right over here.\n5:46\nSo A is the midpoint of BC.\n5:49\nSo that's fair enough.\n5:50\nSo I was able to construct it in that way.\n5:52\nNow let's look at the other sides.\n5:54\nSo this green side on all the triangles\n5:56\nis the side between the blue and the orange angle.\n6:00\nSo between the blue and the orange angle,\n6:02\nyou have the green side, between the blue and the orange angle\n6:05\nyou have the green side.\n6:07\nSo once again, this length is equal to this length.\n6:10\nAnd so if we call this point over here D,\n6:13\nand maybe this point over here E,\n6:15\nyou see that D is the midpoint of BE.\n6:18\nAnd then finally, the yellow side\n6:21\nis between the green and the orange.\n6:22\nSo between the green and the orange, we have a yellow side.\n6:24\nBetween the green and the orange you have a yellow side.\n6:27\nAll of these triangles are congruent.\n6:28\nSo once again, let me call this F.\n6:30\nWe see that F is the midpoint of EC.\n6:35\nSo we've done what we wanted to do.\n6:37\nWe've shown that if you start with any arbitrary\n6:39\ntriangle, triangle ADF, we can construct a triangle BCE so\n6:54\nthat ADF is triangle BCE's medial triangle.\n7:05\nAnd all that means is that the vertices of ADF\n7:10\nsit on the midpoints of BCE.\n7:14\nSo you might say Sal, that by itself is interesting,\n7:16\nbut what's the whole point of this?\n7:18\nThe whole point of this is actually,\n7:19\nI wanted to use this fact that if you give me any triangle,\n7:23\nI can make it the medial triangle of the larger one\n7:25\nto prove that the altitudes of this triangle are concurrent.\n7:29\nAnd to see that, let me first draw the altitudes.\n7:32\nSo an altitude from vertex A looks like this.\n7:35\nIt starts at the vertex, goes to the opposite side,\n7:37\nand is perpendicular to the opposite side.\n7:40\nIf I draw an altitude from vertex D,\n7:42\nit would look like this.\n7:44\nAnd if I draw an altitude from vertex F,\n7:47\nit will look like this.\n7:49\nAnd what I did, this whole set up of this video\n7:51\nis to show, to prove that these will always be concurrent.\n7:57\nAnd you might say, wait how do we\n7:59\nknow that they are concurrent?\n8:01\nWell all you have to do is think about how\n8:03\nthey interact with the larger triangle.\n8:06\nWhat are these altitudes to the larger triangle?\n8:09\nWell, this yellow altitude to the larger triangle.\n8:12\nRemember, these two yellow lines, line AD and line CE\n8:16\nare parallel.\n8:17\nSo if this is a 90-degree angle, so its alternate interior angle\n8:22\nis also going to be 90 degrees.\n8:23\nSo this right over here is perpendicular to CE,\n8:27\nand it bisects CE, because we know\n8:29\nthat ADE is the medial triangle.\n8:32\nThis is the midpoint.\n8:33\nSo this right over here is perpendicular bisector.\n8:36\nThis is a perpendicular bisector for the larger triangle,\n8:42\nfor triangle BCE.\n8:45\nSo this altitude for the smaller one\n8:47\nis a perpendicular bisector for the larger one.\n8:49\nWe can do that for all of them.\n8:51\nIf this angle right over here is 90 degrees,\n8:53\nthen this angle right over there is\n8:55\ngoing to be 90 degrees, because this line is parallel to this,\n8:58\nthis is a transversal, alternate interior angles are the same.\n9:02\nSo this line right over here, this altitude of the smaller\n9:05\ntriangle, it bisects right at the midpoint of the larger one,\n9:09\non this side, and it's also a perpendicular bisector.\n9:12\nSo it's a perpendicular bisector of the larger triangle.\n9:15\nAnd then finally, the same thing is\n9:17\ntrue of this altitude right over here.\n9:19\nIt bisects this side of the larger\n9:21\ntriangle at a 90-degree angle.\n9:24\nWe know that because these two magenta lines the way\n9:26\nwe constructed the larger triangle,\n9:28\nthey're going to be parallel.\n9:29\nSo once again, this is a perpendicular bisector.\n9:32\nSo this whole reason, if you just give me any triangle,\n9:36\nI can take its altitudes and I know\n9:38\nthat its altitude are going to intersect in one point.\n9:40\nThey're going to be concurrent.\n9:42\nBecause for any triangle, I can make it the medial triangle\n9:45\nof a larger one, and then it's altitudes\n9:47\nwill be the perpendicular bisector for the larger\n9:50\ntriangle.\n9:50\nAnd we already know that the perpendicular bisectors\n9:53\nfor any triangle are concurrent.\n9:55\nThey do intersect in exactly one point.",

    "question_type": "MCQ",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nI have here three linear equations of four unknowns.\n0:03\nAnd like the first video, where I talked about reduced\n0:07\nrow echelon form, and solving systems of linear equations\n0:10\nusing augmented matrices, at least my gut feeling says,\n0:13\nlook, I have fewer equations than variables, so I probably\n0:16\nwon't be able to constrain this enough.\n0:18\nOr maybe I'll have an infinite number of solutions.\n0:20\nBut let's see if I'm right.\n0:21\nSo let's construct the augmented matrix for this\n0:24\nsystem of equations.\n0:27\nMy coefficients on the x1 terms are 1, 1, and 2.\n0:33\nCoefficients on the x2 are 2, 2, and 4.\n0:38\nCoefficients on x3 are 1, 2, and 0.\n0:43\nThere's of course no x3 term, so we can view it as a 0\n0:46\ncoefficient.\n0:47\nCoefficients on the x4 are 1, minus 1, and 6.\n0:53\nAnd then on the right-hand side of the equals sign, I\n0:56\nhave 8, 12, and 4.\n1:00\nThere's my augmented matrix, now let's put this guy into\n1:04\nreduced row echelon form.\n1:08\nThe first thing I want to do is, I want to zero out these\n1:10\ntwo rows right here.\n1:12\nSo what can we do?\n1:14\nI'm going to keep my first row the same for now, so it's 1,\n1:18\n2, 1, 1, 8.\n1:23\nThat line essentially represents my equals sign.\n1:28\nWhat I can do is, let me subtract-- let me replace the\n1:30\nsecond row with the second row minus the first row.\n1:35\nSo 1 minus 1 is 0, 2 minus 2 is 0, 2 minus 1 is 1, 1--\n1:45\nnegative 1 minus 1 is minus 2, and then 12 minus 8 is 4.\n1:54\nThere you go, that looks good so far, it looks like column,\n1:58\nor x2 which is represented by column two, looks like it\n2:00\nmight be a free variable, but we're not 100% sure yet.\n2:04\nLet's do all of our rows.\n2:07\nSo let's take-- to get rid of this guy right here, let's\n2:11\nreplace our third equation with the third equation minus\n2:14\ntwo times our first equation.\n2:17\nSo we get 2 minus 2 times 1 is 0, 4 minus 2 times 2, well\n2:26\nthat's 0, 0 minus 2 times 1, that's minus 2.\n2:35\n6 minus 2 times 1, well that's 4, right?\n2:40\n6 minus 2.\n2:41\nAnd then 4 minus 2 times 8, is minus 16, 4\n2:47\nminus 16 is minus 12.\n2:52\nNow what can we do?\n2:53\nWell, let's see if we can get rid of this minus\n2:56\n2 term right there.\n2:58\nSo let me rewrite my augmented matrix.\n3:03\nI'm going to keep row two the same this time, so I get a 0,\n3:07\n0, 1, minus 2, and essentially my equals sign, or the\n3:12\naugmented part of the matrix.\n3:15\nAnd now let's see what I can do.\n3:17\nLet me get rid of this 0 up here, because I want to get\n3:19\ninto reduced row echelon form.\n3:21\nSo any of my pivot entries, which are always going to have\n3:24\nthe coefficient 1, or the entry 1, it should be the only\n3:26\nnon-zero term in my row.\n3:28\nHow do I get rid of this one here?\n3:30\nWell I can subtract-- I can replace row one with row 1\n3:35\nminus row 2.\n3:38\nSo 1 minus 0 is 1, 2 minus 0 is 2, 1 minus 1 is 0, 1 minus\n3:48\nminus 2, that's 1 plus 2, which is 3.\n3:52\nAnd then 8 minus 4 is 4.\n3:56\nAnd now how can I get rid of this guy?\n3:59\nWell let me replace row 3 with row 3 plus 2 times row 1.\n4:06\nSorry, with row 3 plus 2 times row 2.\n4:09\nRight?\n4:10\nBecause then you'd have minus 2, plus 2 times this, and\n4:12\nthey'd cancel out.\n4:13\nSo let's see the zeros.\n4:15\n0 plus 2 times 0, that's 0.\n4:18\n0 plus 2 times 0, that's 0, minus 2 plus 2 times 1 is 0.\n4:26\n4 plus 2 times minus 2, that's 4 minus 4, that's 0.\n4:35\nAnd then I have minus 12, plus 2 times 4.\n4:40\nThat's minus 12 plus 8, that's minus 4.\n4:47\nNow, this is interesting right now-- this is interesting.\n4:49\nI have essentially put this in reduced row echelon form.\n4:53\nI have two pivot entries, that's a pivot entry right\n4:56\nthere, and that's a pivot entry right there.\n4:59\nThey're the only non-zero term in their respective columns.\n5:03\nAnd this is just kind of a style issue, but this pivot\n5:05\nentry is in a lower row than that one.\n5:08\nSo it's in a column to the right of this one right there.\n5:12\nAnd I just inspected, this looks like a-- this column two\n5:16\nlooks kind of like a free variable-- there's no pivot\n5:19\nentry there, no pivot entry there.\n5:20\nBut let's see, let's map this back to\n5:22\nour system of equations.\n5:24\nThese are just numbers to me and I just kind of\n5:26\nmechanically, almost like a computer, put this in reduced\n5:29\nrow echelon form.\n5:31\nActually, almost exactly like a computer.\n5:32\nBut let me put it back to my system of linear equations, to\n5:35\nsee what our result is.\n5:37\nSo we get 1 times x1, let me write it in yellow.\n5:41\nSo I get 1 times x1, plus 2 times x2, plus 0 times x3,\n5:50\nplus 3 times x4 is equal to 4.\n5:55\nObviously I could ignore this term right there, I didn't\n5:57\neven have to write it.\n5:58\nActually.\n5:59\nI'm not going to write that.\n5:59\nThen I get 0 times x1, plus 0 times x2, plus 1 times x3, so\n6:05\nI can just write that.\n6:05\nI'll just write the one.\n6:06\n1 times x3, minus 2 times x4, is equal to 4.\n6:12\nAnd then this last term, what do I get?\n6:14\nI get 0 x1, plus 0 x2 plus 0 x3 plus 0 x4, well, all of\n6:19\nthat's equal to 0, and I've got to write something on the\n6:21\nleft-hand side.\n6:22\nSo let me just write a 0, and that's got to be\n6:25\nequal to minus 4.\n6:27\nWell this doesn't make any sense whatsoever.\n6:31\n0 equals minus 4.\n6:33\nThis is this is a nonsensical constraint, this is\n6:36\nimpossible.\n6:37\n0 can never equal minus 4.\n6:40\nThis is impossible.\n6:46\nWhich means that it is essentially impossible to find\n6:49\nan intersection of these three systems of equations, or a\n6:53\nsolution set that satisfies all of them.\n6:56\nWhen we looked at this initially, at the beginning of\n6:58\nthe of the video, we said there are only three\n7:00\nequations, we have four unknowns, maybe there's going\n7:02\nto be an infinite set of solutions.\n7:03\nBut turns out that these three-- I guess you can call\n7:07\nthem these three surfaces-- don't intersect in r4.\n7:11\nRight?\n7:11\nThese are all four dimensional, we're dealing in\n7:14\nr4 right here, because we have-- I guess each vector has\n7:19\nfour components, or we have four variables, is the way you\n7:22\ncould think about it.\n7:23\nAnd it's always hard to visualize things in r4.\n7:26\nBut if we were doing things in r3, we can imagine the\n7:29\nsituation where, let's say we had two planes in r3.\n7:34\nSo that's one plane right there, and then I had another\n7:36\ncompletely parallel plane to that one.\n7:39\nSo I had another completely parallel plane\n7:42\nto that first one.\n7:43\nEven though these would be two planes in r3, so let me give\n7:47\nan example.\n7:47\nSo let's say that this first plane was represented by the\n7:51\nequation 3x plus 6y plus 9z is equal to 5, and the second\n8:02\nplane was represented by the equation 3x plus 6y plus 9z is\n8:08\nequal to 2.\n8:11\nThese two planes in r3-- this is the case of r3, so this is\n8:15\nr3 right here.\n8:17\nThese two planes, clearly they'll never intersect.\n8:19\nBecause obviously this one has the same coefficients adding\n8:23\nup to 5, this one has the same coefficient adding up to 2.\n8:26\nAnd when, if we just looked at this initially, if it wasn't\n8:28\nso obvious, we would have said, we have only two\n8:31\nequations with three unknowns, maybe this has an infinite set\n8:33\nof solutions.\n8:34\nBut it won't be the case, because you can actually just\n8:36\nsubtract this equation, from the bottom equation, from the\n8:39\ntop equation.\n8:40\nAnd what do you get?\n8:41\nYou would get a very familiar-- so if you just\n8:44\nsubtract the bottom equation from the top equation, and you\n8:46\nget 3x minus 3x, 6y minus 6y, 9z minus 9z-- actually, let me\n8:50\ndo it right here.\n8:51\nSo for that minus that, you get zero is equal to 5 minus\n8:55\n2, which is 3.\n8:56\nWhich is a very similar result that we got up there.\n8:59\nSo when you have two parallel planes, in this case in r3, or\n9:03\nreally to any kind of two parallel equations, or a set\n9:07\nof parallel equations, they won't intersect.\n9:08\nAnd you're going to get, when you put it in reduced row\n9:12\nechelon form, or you just do basic elimination, or you\n9:14\nsolve the systems, you're going to get a statement that\n9:17\nzero is equal to something, and that means that there are\n9:19\nno solutions.\n9:23\nSo the general take-away, if you have zero equals\n9:26\nsomething, no solutions.\n9:27\nIf you have the same number of pivot variables, the same\n9:31\nnumber of pivot entries as you do columns, so if you get the\n9:36\nsituations-- let me write this down, this is good to know.\n9:39\nif you have zero is equal to anything, then\n9:41\nthat means no solution.\n9:44\nIf you're dealing with r3, then you probably have\n9:46\nparallel planes, in r2 you're dealing with parallel lines.\n9:50\nIf you have the situation where you have the same number\n9:55\nof pivot entries as columns, so it's just 1, 1, 1, 1, this\n10:02\nis the case of r4 right there.\n10:05\nI think you get the idea.\n10:07\nThat equals a, b, c, d.\n10:10\nThen you have a unique solution.\n10:15\nNow if, you have any free variables-- so free variables\n10:19\nlook like this, so let's say we have 1, 0, 1, 0, and then I\n10:23\nhave the entry 1, 1, let me be careful.\n10:30\n0, let me do it like this.\n10:33\n1, 0, 0, and then I have the entry 1, 2, and then I have a\n10:41\nbunch of zeroes over here.\n10:43\nAnd then this has to equal zero-- remember, if this was a\n10:45\nbunch of zeroes equaling some variable, then I would have no\n10:47\nsolution, or equalling some constant, let's say this is\n10:50\nequal to 5, this is equal to 2.\n10:52\nIf this is our reduced row echelon form that we\n10:55\neventually get to, then we have a few free variables.\n10:58\nThis is a free, or I guess we could call this column a free\n11:02\ncolumn, to some degree this one would be too.\n11:04\nBecause it has no pivot entries.\n11:07\nThese are the pivot entries.\n11:09\nSo this is variable x2 and that's variable x4.\n11:13\nThen these would be free, we can set\n11:14\nthem equal to anything.\n11:16\nSo then here we have unlimited solutions,\n11:19\nor no unique solutions.\n11:21\nAnd that was actually the first example we saw.\n11:23\nAnd these are really the three cases that you're going to see\n11:25\nevery time, and it's good to get familiar with them so\n11:27\nyou're never going to get stumped up when you have\n11:29\nsomething like 0 equals minus 4, or 0 equals 3.\n11:32\nOr if you have just a bunch of zeros and a bunch of rows.\n11:35\nI want to make that very clear.\n11:36\nSometimes, you see a bunch of zeroes here, on the left-hand\n11:40\nside of the augmented divide, and you might say, oh maybe I\n11:44\nhave no unique solutions, I have an\n11:45\ninfinite number of solutions.\n11:46\nBut you have to look at this entry right here.\n11:50\nOnly if this whole thing is zero and you have free\n11:52\nvariables, then you have an infinite number of solutions.\n11:56\nIf you have a statement like, 0 is equal to a, if this is\n11:59\nequal to 7 right here, then all of the sudden you would\n12:01\nhave no solution to this.\n12:03\nThat you're dealing with parallel surfaces.\n12:05\nAnyway, hopefully you found that helpful.",

    "question_type": "MCQ",
    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nIn the last video, we saw the classification of elements\n0:04\ninto groups on the periodic table,\n0:05\nand we stopped with the definition\n0:07\nfor a transition metal.\n0:09\nThere are two ways to think about transition metals.\n0:11\nSo one way to think about it would be when some teachers say\n0:14\ntransition metal, they're talking\n0:16\nabout elements found from Groups 3 through Group 12.\n0:20\nSo all the elements in here, some people\n0:23\nconsider these to be the transition metals.\n0:25\nSo these are the elements found in the d block, right?\n0:28\nSo we're talking about d orbitals here.\n0:30\nSo you have to understand electron configurations\n0:34\nfor this video.\n0:35\nSo that's one way to think about the transition metals,\n0:38\nbut that way is maybe a little bit too general sometimes.\n0:41\nSo there is another definition, which\n0:42\nyou'll find in the IUPAC website.\n0:44\nIUPAC is an acronym for International Union of Pure\n0:48\nand Applied Chemistry, and they say that a transition element\n0:52\nrefers to an element whose atom has an incomplete d subshell.\n0:58\nSo when you're talking about the d orbitals,\n1:01\nwe already know there are five d orbitals,\n1:03\nand each orbital holds a maximum of two electrons.\n1:06\nSo 5 times 2 is 10.\n1:08\nSo 10 will be the maximum number of electrons\n1:10\nthat you could fit in your d orbitals, or your d subshells.\n1:13\nSo let's count that out on our periodic table so 10, so 1, 2,\n1:17\n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 for our d block.\n1:23\nSo let's go ahead and write an electron configuration\n1:27\nfor a transition metal and let's see\n1:28\nhow that applies to our definition from IUPAC.\n1:32\nSo let's write an electron configuration for iron.\n1:36\nSo here's iron right here.\n1:38\nAnd if I wanted to write an electron configuration,\n1:40\nlet's say I wanted to do noble gas notation.\n1:42\nSo once again, I'm assuming that you know how to do this already\n1:45\nso I won't spend too much time talking about it.\n1:48\nBut if I want to write a noble gas configuration,\n1:51\nI would go to argon, which is the noble gas before iron,\n1:55\nand I would put argon in brackets like that.\n1:58\nAnd that takes me to the fourth energy level\n2:00\nor the fourth period on the periodic table.\n2:03\nAnd then just looking at the periodic table,\n2:05\nI can say, oh, that would be 4s1, 4s2,\n2:07\nso I can write 4s2 here.\n2:10\nAnd then I'm in my d orbitals.\n2:13\nSo, again, just looking at the periodic table\n2:15\nto write my electron configuration,\n2:18\nI would say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 electrons.\n2:23\nSo that would be 3d6.\n2:26\nAnd I could have written this 3d6 4s2.\n2:31\nAnd right now, both are considered\n2:33\nto be correct answers.\n2:34\nAnd I won't get into a discussion\n2:38\nabout the order of filling of these orbitals in this videos.\n2:40\nSo I'll save that for another video.\n2:42\nThis video is only talking about definitions\n2:44\nand identifying elements on the periodic table.\n2:47\nAnd so either one of these would be a correct electron\n2:50\nconfiguration.\n2:51\nAnd when I look at the d orbitals for the electron\n2:56\nconfiguration, I can see that there\n2:57\nare six electrons in my d orbitals.\n3:00\nWell, that's an incomplete d subshell,\n3:03\nbecause I can fit a total of 10 into my d orbitals.\n3:06\nAnd so iron would be an example of an element whose atom\n3:10\nhas an incomplete d subshell.\n3:12\nSo iron is a transition metal.\n3:15\nLet's write the electron configuration for zinc.\n3:18\nSo let's find zinc over here, so right there\n3:20\non pour periodic table.\n3:21\nSo if I wanted to write the electron configuration\n3:23\nfor zinc, once again, I would go to the noble gas\n3:28\nbefore it, which is argon.\n3:30\nSo I would put in brackets argon right here.\n3:33\nAnd then, once again, it takes me to the fourth energy level.\n3:36\nSo 4s1, 4s2, so 4s2.\n3:40\nAnd then I count over for my d electrons-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\n3:45\n7, 8, 9, and 10.\n3:48\nSo it would be 3d10.\n3:50\nAnd once again, I could have written\n3:51\nthat argon in brackets 3d10 4s2.\n3:57\nSo it doesn't matter.\n4:00\nSo let's think about the definition\n4:02\nfor a transition metal, an element\n4:04\nwhose atom has an incomplete d subshell.\n4:07\nWell, if I look at the d orbitals for zinc,\n4:11\nthey are completely full.\n4:12\nI have 10 electrons in my d orbital,\n4:15\nand so this is a complete d subshell.\n4:17\nSo this does not meet the definition\n4:19\nfor a transition element.\n4:21\nNow, also in the definition, it talks about cations.\n4:25\nSo let's think about to the cation that zinc would form.\n4:27\nZinc would go to zinc 2 plus.\n4:30\nSo if I wanted to write the electron configuration for zinc\n4:33\n2 plus, I need to think about where does zinc\n4:37\nlose two electrons?\n4:39\nSo if you've going from a neutral atom of zinc\n4:41\nto zinc 2 plus, you would have to lose two electrons.\n4:44\nWell, I already know that those two electrons\n4:46\nare going to be lost from the 4s orbitals.\n4:49\nSo we're going to lose these two electrons right here\n4:52\non your electron configuration, and so you'd be left with 3d10.\n4:55\nAnd once again, you have a cation\n4:58\nthat has a complete d subshell.\n5:00\nYou've completely filled your d orbitals,\n5:02\nand so the cation does not have an incomplete d subshell, which\n5:06\nmeans that it doesn't fit our technical definition\n5:09\nfor a transition element from IUPAC.\n5:11\nAnd so, once again, there are two ways of thinking about it.\n5:14\nOne's a very general way.\n5:16\nSo you might hear someone talk about an element from Groups 3\n5:19\nthrough to 12 as being a transition metal,\n5:22\nor you might find people who are a little bit more\n5:24\nparticular about the definition, who go along with IUPAC.\n5:29\nIt's good to be aware of both ways of thinking about it.",

So let me go down here.\n2:06\nSo I want to look at the frequency of\n2:08\neach of these numbers.\n2:12\nSo I have one, two, three, four 0's.\n2:16\nI have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven 1's.\n2:20\nI have one, two, three, four, five 2's.\n2:24\nI have one, two 3's.\n2:26\nI have one 4, and one 6.\n2:31\nSo we could write it this way.\n2:32\nWe could write the number, and then we\n2:37\ncan have the frequency.\n2:43\nSo I have the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4-- we could even throw 5\n2:49\nin there, although 5 has a frequency of 0.\n2:52\nAnd we have a 6.\n2:53\nSo the 0 showed up four times in this data set.\n2:57\n1 showed up seven times in this data set.\n3:01\n2 showed up five times, 3 showed up to two times, 4\n3:08\nshowed up one time, 5 didn't show up, and 6\n3:12\nshowed up one time.\n3:13\nAll I did is I counted this data set, and I did this\n3:16\nfirst. But you could say how many times do I see a 0?\n3:18\nI see it one, two, three, four times.\n3:21\nHow many times do I see a 1?\n3:22\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven times.\n3:27\nThat's what we mean by frequency.\n3:29\nNow a histogram is really just a plot, kind of a bar graph,\n3:34\nplotting the frequency of each of these numbers.\n3:36\nIt's going to look a lot like this original\n3:38\nthing that I drew.\n3:40\nSo let me draw some axes here.\n3:44\nSo the different buckets here are the numbers.\n3:46\nAnd that worked out because we're dealing with very clean\n3:47\nintegers that tend to repeat.\n3:49\nIf you're dealing with things that the exact number doesn't\n3:54\nrepeat, oftentimes people will put the numbers\n3:56\ninto buckets or ranges.\n3:58\nBut here they fit into nice little buckets.\n4:00\nYou have the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n4:08\nThis is the actual numbers.\n4:09\nAnd then on the vertical axis we're\n4:11\ngoing to plot the frequency.\n4:15\nSo one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.\n4:20\nSo that's 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\n4:25\nSo 0 shows up four times.\n4:28\nSo we'll draw a little bar graph here.\n4:29\n0 shows up four times.\n4:31\nDraw it just like that.\n4:34\n0 shows up four times.\n4:36\nThat is that information right there.\n4:40\n1 shows up seven times.\n4:44\nSo I'll do a little bar graph.\n4:45\n1 shows up seven times.\n4:48\nJust like that.\n4:50\nI want to make it a little bit straighter than that-- 1 shows\n4:53\nup seven times.\n4:58\n2-- I'll do it in a different color-- 2 shows up five times.\n5:06\nDo a bar graph, go all the way up to five.\n5:10\n2 shows up five times.\n5:12\n3 shows up two times.\n5:20\nWe have one 3, two 3's.\n5:24\n4 shows up one time here.\n5:31\n5 doesn't show up at all.\n5:33\nSo it doesn't even get any height there.\n5:37\nAnd then finally, 6 shows up one time.\n5:44\nSo I'll do 6 showing up one time.\n5:47\nWhat I just plotted here, this is a histogram.\n5:51\nThis right here is a histogram.\n5:53\nVery fancy word, but I think you will agree it's a fairly\n5:56\nsimple idea.\n5:58\nFigure out the frequency of each of these numbers and then\n6:01\nplot the frequency of each of these numbers and you get\n6:04\nyourself a histogram.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the last video we saw that a geometric progression,\n0:02\nor a geometric sequence, is just a sequence where\n0:05\neach successive term is the previous term multiplied\n0:08\nby a fixed value.\n0:10\nAnd we call that fixed value the common ratio.\n0:12\nSo, for example, in this sequence right over here,\n0:14\neach term is the previous term multiplied by 2.\n0:18\nSo 2 is our common ratio.\n0:21\nAnd any non-zero value can be our common ratio.\n0:26\nIt can even be a negative value.\n0:27\nSo, for example, you could have a geometric sequence\n0:31\nthat looks like this.\n0:32\nMaybe start at one, and maybe our common ratio,\n0:37\nlet's say it's negative 3.\n0:39\nSo 1 times negative 3 is negative 3.\n0:41\nNegative 3 times negative 3 is positive 9.\n0:45\nPositive 9 times negative 3 is negative 27.\n0:49\nAnd then negative 27 times negative 3 is positive 81.\n0:53\nAnd you could keep going on and on and on.\n0:56\nWhat I now want to focus on in this video\n0:58\nis the sum of a geometric progression\n1:00\nor a geometric sequence, and we would call that\n1:03\na geometric series.\n1:06\nLet's scroll down a little bit.\n1:08\nSo now we're going to talk about geometric series, which\n1:15\nis really just the sum of a geometric sequence.\n1:17\nSo, for example, a geometric series\n1:20\nwould just be a sum of this sequence.\n1:22\nSo if we just said 1 plus negative 3,\n1:31\nplus 9, plus negative 27, plus 81,\n1:36\nand we were to go on, and on, and on,\n1:38\nthis would be a geometric series.\n1:41\nAnd we could do it with this one up here\n1:43\njust to really make it clear of what we're doing.\n1:45\nSo if we said 3 plus 6, plus 12, plus 24, plus 48,\n1:51\nthis once again is a geometric series, just\n1:54\nthe sum of a geometric sequence or a geometric progression.\n1:59\nSo how would we represent this in general terms and maybe\n2:01\nusing sigma notation?\n2:03\nWell, we'll start with whatever our first term is.\n2:06\nAnd over here if we want to speak in general terms\n2:08\nwe could call that a, our first term.\n2:11\nSo we'll start with our first term, a, and then\n2:17\neach successive term that we're going to add\n2:19\nis going to be a times our common ratio.\n2:22\nAnd we'll call that common ratio r.\n2:24\nSo the second term is a times r.\n2:26\nThen the third term, we're just going\n2:28\nto multiply this one times r.\n2:30\nSo it's going to be a times r squared.\n2:35\nAnd then we can keep going, plus a times r to the third power.\n2:43\nAnd let's say we're going to do a finite geometric series.\n2:46\nSo we're not going to just keep on going forever.\n2:48\nLet's say we keep going all the way\n2:50\nuntil we get to some a times r to the n.\n2:58\na times r to the n-th power.\n3:03\nSo how can we represent this with sigma notation?\n3:05\nAnd I encourage you to pause the video and try it on your own.\n3:09\nWell, we could think about it this way.\n3:13\nAnd I'll give you a little hint.\n3:15\nYou could view this term right over here as a times r\n3:17\nto the 0.\n3:18\nAnd let me write it down.\n3:20\nThis is a times r to the 0.\n3:21\nThis is a times r to the first, r squared,\n3:24\nr third, and now the pattern might be emerging for you.\n3:27\nSo we can write this as the sum, so capital sigma\n3:32\nright over here.\n3:33\nWe can start our index at 0.\n3:35\nSo we could say from k equals 0 all the way to k\n3:50\nequals n of a times r to the k-th power.\n4:13\nAnd so this is, using sigma notation,\n4:15\na general way to represent a geometric series where\n4:19\nr is some non-zero common ratio.\n4:23\nIt can even be a negative value.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWhat I want to do in this video is\n0:01\nthink about the antiderivative of 1/x.\n0:05\nOr another way of thinking about it, another way of writing it ,\n0:07\nis the antiderivative of x to the negative 1 power.\n0:10\nAnd we already know, if we somehow\n0:12\ntry to apply that anti-power rule,\n0:14\nthat inverse power rule over here,\n0:15\nwe would get something that's not defined.\n0:17\nWe would get x to the 0 over 0, doesn't make any sense.\n0:20\nAnd you might have been saying, OK, well, I\n0:22\nknow what to do in this case.\n0:24\nWhen we first learned about derivatives,\n0:25\nwe know that the derivative-- let\n0:27\nme do this in yellow-- the derivative with respect\n0:29\nto x of the natural log of x is equal to 1 over x.\n0:36\nSo why can't we just say that the antiderivative\n0:39\nof this right over here is equal to the natural log of x plus c?\n0:45\nAnd this isn't necessarily wrong.\n0:47\nThe problem here is that it's not broad enough.\n0:50\nWhen I say it's not broad enough,\n0:52\nis that the domain over here, for our original function\n0:55\nthat we're taking the antiderivative of,\n0:57\nis all real numbers except for x equals 0.\n1:00\nSo over here, x cannot be equal to 0.\n1:04\nWhile the domain over here is only positive numbers.\n1:08\nSo over here, x, so for this expression,\n1:12\nx has to be greater than 0.\n1:15\nSo it would be nice if we could come up\n1:17\nwith an antiderivative that has the same domain as the function\n1:21\nthat we're taking the antiderivative of.\n1:23\nSo it would be nice if we could find an antiderivative that\n1:26\nis defined everywhere that our original function is.\n1:29\nSo pretty much everywhere except for x equaling 0.\n1:33\nSo how can we rearrange this a little bit\n1:36\nso that it could be defined for negative values as well?\n1:39\nWell, one one possibility is to think\n1:41\nabout the natural log of the absolute value of x.\n1:49\nSo I'll put little question mark here,\n1:51\njust because we don't really know\n1:52\nwhat the derivative of this thing is going to be.\n1:54\nAnd I'm not going to rigorously prove it here,\n1:56\nbut I'll I will give you kind of the conceptual understanding.\n1:59\nSo to understand it, let's plot the natural log of x.\n2:03\nAnd I had done this ahead of time.\n2:04\nSo that right over there is roughly\n2:06\nwhat the graph of the natural log of x looks like.\n2:09\nSo what would the natural log of the absolute value\n2:11\nof x is going to look like?\n2:13\nWell, for positive x's, it's going to look just like this.\n2:17\nFor positive x's you take the absolute value of it,\n2:20\nit's just the same thing as taking that original value.\n2:22\nSo it's going to look just like that for positive x's.\n2:25\nBut now this is also going to be defined for negative x's.\n2:28\nIf you're taking the absolute value of negative 1,\n2:31\nthat evaluates to just 1.\n2:33\nSo it's the natural log of 1, so you're going to be right there.\n2:36\nAs you get closer and closer and closer to 0\n2:40\nfrom the negative side, you're just\n2:42\ngoing to take the absolute value.\n2:43\nSo it's essentially going to be exactly this curve\n2:45\nfor the natural log of x, but the left side\n2:48\nof the natural log of the absolute value of x\n2:50\nis going to be its mirror image, if you were to reflect around\n2:53\nthe y-axis.\n2:53\nIt's going to look something like this.\n2:59\nSo what's nice about this function\n3:01\nis you see it's defined everywhere, except for-- I'm\n3:06\ntrying to draw it as symmetrically as possible--\n3:09\nexcept for x equals 0.\n3:11\nSo if you combine this pink part and this part on the right,\n3:15\nif you combine both of these, you\n3:19\nget y is equal to the natural log of the absolute value of x.\n3:27\nNow let's think about its derivative.\n3:29\nWell, we already know what the derivative of the natural log\n3:32\nof x is, and for positive values of x.\n3:35\nSo let me write this down.\n3:36\nFor x is greater than 0, we get the natural log\n3:41\nof the absolute value of x is equal to the natural log of x.\n3:46\nLet me write this.\n3:47\nIs equal to the natural log of x.\n3:53\nAnd we would also know, since these two are\n3:55\nequal for x is greater than 0, the derivative\n4:00\nof the natural log of the absolute value of x\n4:02\nis going to be equal to the derivative of the natural log\n4:08\nof x.\n4:12\nWhich is equal to 1/x for x greater than 0.\n4:16\nSo let's plot that.\n4:18\nI'll do that in green.\n4:19\nIt's equal to 1/x.\n4:21\nSo 1/x, we've seen it before.\n4:22\nIt looks something like this.\n4:26\nSo let me do my best attempt to draw it.\n4:29\nIt has both vertical and horizontal asymptotes.\n4:33\nSo it looks something like this.\n4:37\nSo this right over here is 1/x x is greater than 0.\n4:42\nSo this is 1/x when x is greater than 0.\n4:46\nSo all it's saying here, and you can see pretty clearly,\n4:49\nis the slope right over here, the slope of the tangent line\n4:52\nis 1.\n4:53\nAnd so you see that when you look\n4:54\nat the derivative, the slope right over here,\n4:56\nthe derivative should be equal to 1 here.\n4:58\nWhen you get close to 0, you have\n5:00\na very, very steep positive slope here.\n5:04\nAnd so you see you have a very high value for its derivative.\n5:07\nAnd then as you move away from 0, it's still steep.\n5:11\nBut it becomes less and less and less steep\n5:13\nall the way until you get to 1.\n5:15\nAnd then it keeps getting less and less and less steep.\n5:19\nBut it never quite gets to absolutely flat slope.\n5:22\nAnd that's what you see its derivative doing.\n5:25\nNow what is the natural log of absolute value\n5:27\nof x doing right over here?\n5:28\nWhen we are out here, our slope is very close to 0.\n5:34\nIt's symmetric.\n5:34\nThe slope here is essentially the negative of the slope here.\n5:38\nI could do it maybe clearer, showing it right here.\n5:40\nWhatever the slope is right over here,\n5:44\nit's the exact negative of whatever\n5:45\nthe slope is at a symmetric point on the other side.\n5:49\nSo if on the other side, the slope is right over here,\n5:52\nover here it's going to be the negative of that.\n5:54\nSo it's going to be right over there.\n5:58\nAnd then the slope it just gets more and more and more\n6:00\nnegative.\n6:01\nRight over here, the slope is a positive 1.\n6:04\nOver here it's going to be a negative 1.\n6:06\nSo right over here our slope is a negative 1.\n6:09\nAnd then as we get closer and closer to 0,\n6:10\nit's just going to get more and more and more negative.\n6:13\nSo the derivative of the natural log\n6:15\nof the absolute value of x, for x is less than 0,\n6:17\nlooks something like this.\n6:22\nAnd you see, and once again, it's\n6:25\nnot a ultra rigorous proof, but what\n6:28\nyou see is that the derivative of the natural log\n6:31\nof the absolute value of x is equal to 1/x for all\n6:36\nx's not equaling 0.\n6:38\nSo what you're seeing, or hopefully you\n6:41\ncan visualize, that the derivative-- let\n6:44\nme write it this way-- of the natural log\n6:51\nof the absolute value of x is indeed equal to 1/x for all\n7:01\nx does not equal 0.\n7:04\nSo this is a much more satisfying antiderivative\n7:07\nfor 1/x.\n7:08\nIt has the exact the same domain.\n7:12\nSo when we think about what the antiderivative is for 1/x--\n7:15\nand I didn't do a kind of a rigorous proof here,\n7:17\nI didn't use the definition of the derivative and all of that.\n7:19\nBut I kind of gave you a visual understanding, hopefully,\n7:21\nof it.\n7:22\nWe would say it's the natural log\n7:23\nof the absolute value of x plus c.\n7:26\nAnd now we have an antiderivative\n7:28\nthat has the same domain as that function\n7:30\nthat we're taking the antiderivative of.",

let me just rewrite each of these\n5:21\nso sine of\n5:23\ni just say sine of two times anything\n5:25\nthat's just the same thing as\n5:27\nand this is called the double angle formula\n5:30\nso this is\n5:31\nI might be wrong I was forgot the actual names of them\n5:34\nbut sine of two time something\n5:36\nis two sine of that something\n5:39\ntimes the cosine of that\n5:41\ntimes the cosine of that something\n5:43\nand you'll see that in any trigonometric book on the\n5:45\ninside cover even a lot of calculus books\n5:47\nlet's do that for this the same thing right over here\n5:49\nso sine of 2A over here is going to be\n5:51\n2 sine of A cosine of A\n5:56\nthat's just a standard trigonometric identity\n5:58\nand we've -

So that indeed is equal to 0.81.\n1:58\nIn fact we could write 0.81 as 0.9 squared.\n2:03\nSo we could write this, we could write that P\n2:07\nis equal to the plus or minus, the square root of,\n2:10\ninstead of writing 0.81,\n2:12\nI could write that as 0.9 squared.\n2:17\nIn fact I could also write that as negative 0.9 squared.\n2:20\nCause if you put a negative here and a negative here,\n2:22\nit's still not going to change the value.\n2:24\nA negative times a negative is going to be a positive.\n2:27\nI could, actually I would have put a negative there,\n2:29\nwhich would have implied\n2:30\na negative here and a negative there.\n2:31\nSo either of those are going to be true.\n2:33\nBut it's going to work out for us\n2:35\nbecause we are taking the positive and negative square root.\n2:37\nSo this is going to be,\n2:39\nP is going to be equal to plus or minus 0.9.\n2:44\nPlus or minus 0.9, or we could write it\n2:48\nthat P is equal to 0.9,\n2:51\nor P could be equal to negative 0.9.\n2:55\nAnd you can verify that,\n2:57\nyou would square either of these things, you get 0.81.",

    "question_type": "MCQ",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nMale: What I want to do in this video is introduce you\n0:02\nto the idea of a consumption function.\n0:05\nIt's a very simple idea.\n0:07\nIt's really just the notion that income,\n0:09\nincome in aggregate in an economy\n0:11\ncan drive consumption in aggregate in an economy.\n0:17\nJust to make things tangible, I will construct\n0:19\na consumption function for a hypothetical economy,\n0:24\nand we can debate whether we can construct a better one.\n0:27\nAll the numbers don't have to be exactly\n0:29\nwhat I'm about to do, but this is just\n0:30\nto make things concrete in your mind.\n0:32\nMaybe we have a hypothetical economy\n0:33\nwhere consumption is going to be equal to ...\n0:36\nwell, maybe there's some base level of consumption\n0:38\neven if there's no aggregate income in our economy.\n0:41\nIt's hard to image, but let's say there isn't.\n0:42\nThere will still be consumption.\n0:44\nMaybe people can do it by digging into their savings.\n0:47\nThey're essentially using resources\n0:49\nthat they've already accumulated in some way.\n0:51\nLet's say that base level of consumption,\n0:53\nlet's call that 500.\n0:55\nIt could be billions of dollars or gold coins\n0:58\nor clamshells or whatever the unit\n1:01\nof measuring economic activity is in our economy.\n1:03\nThat's our base level of consumption.\n1:06\nThen let's say if there is some aggregate income,\n1:10\npeople will spend 60% of it.\n1:12\nI'm just picking these numbers somewhat arbitrarily.\n1:14\nLet's say if there's some above and beyond\n1:17\nthe base level, they're going to spend 0.6\n1:20\nof any aggregate income they have.\n1:22\nActually, to be a little bit more particular,\n1:23\nI'll write not just income, I'll write disposable income.\n1:27\nI'll want to do that in a different color.\n1:30\nThey will ... that's not a different color.\n1:32\nAbove and beyond the base level,\n1:34\nthey'll spend 60% of their disposable income.\n1:40\nI make the distinction, just to clarify our model,\n1:44\nbetween income and disposable income\n1:46\nbecause all of the aggregate income in an economy\n1:49\ndoes not end up in consumers' pockets.\n1:54\nJust for a simplification, you might say,\n1:56\n\"Yeah, some of it ends up in firms' pockets,\"\n1:58\nbut the firms, at the end of the day,\n1:59\nare owned by individuals, so it can end up\n2:01\nin individuals' or consumers' pockets.\n2:03\nBut some of it goes off to the government.\n2:07\nWhen you think about income, and if you spend\n2:09\nany time looking at your pay stub this will\n2:11\nbecome familiar to you, you have your income\n2:13\nbut you don't end up with all of that in your\n2:15\nchecking account or your pocket\n2:17\nor your savings account.\n2:18\nA good fraction of that is taken out for taxes.\n2:21\nWhat you have left over when you subtract\n2:23\ntaxes out of income, that is your disposable income.\n2:31\nThat's why I write this here because that's actually\n2:33\na more reasonable thing to say.\n2:34\nPeople will spend 60% of their disposable income.\n2:37\nThey obviously can't spend a fraction of stuff that\n2:39\nthey don't have, the stuff that's taken out for taxes.\n2:42\nJust to visualize this, we can draw it.\n2:44\nThis will be a line.\n2:45\nThis might ring a bell from your early algebra days.\n2:48\nJust the variables are different.\n2:50\nInstead of a y, we have a c,\n2:52\nbut that's still the dependent variable.\n2:54\nIt's a function of disposable income.\n2:56\nIn algebra you'll often call this the independent variable.\n2:59\nThe most typical variable is x.\n3:01\nIt's really the same idea over here.\n3:03\nLet me draw this a little bit neater.\n3:07\nWe can graph this, what's essentially going to be a line.\n3:11\nIt doesn't have to be a line.\n3:12\nWe just constructed a consumption function\n3:13\nthat happens to be a line.\n3:15\nThis is consumption right over here in the vertical axis.\n3:19\nThat could be in billions of dollars\n3:21\nor clamshells or whatever else.\n3:22\nThen right over here we have disposable income.\n3:31\nIf there is zero disposable income,\n3:34\nmaybe I'll draw a little table over here.\n3:38\nThis is I'll call it disposable income\n3:41\nand this is consumption.\n3:42\nIf there's zero disposable income,\n3:44\nthen this whole term right over here is 0.\n3:46\nThen you have 500 billion dollars,\n3:49\nor whatever our units are, of base consumption.\n3:52\nThis would correspond to this point right over here.\n3:56\nIn the horizontal axis you don't move at all\n3:59\nbecause this is 0.\n4:00\nVertical axis is 500.\n4:02\nSo you have 500.\n4:03\nLet's say disposable income is 1,000\n4:09\nwhatever our units are.\n4:10\nSo this is 500.\n4:11\nLet's say this is 1,000 billion clamshells.\n4:14\nThis could be in billions of clamshells.\n4:16\nI don't want to keep having to say that\n4:18\nover and over again.\n4:19\nWhat is our consumption going to be in our units?\n4:21\nOur consumption is going to be equal to\n4:24\n500 + 0.6 x 1,000 which is equal to\n4:30\n500 + 600 which is equal to 1,100.\n4:35\nThat would correspond, this right over here,\n4:39\nwould correspond to; so 1,000,\n4:42\nso this might be 1,000 on this axis\n4:44\nso this would be 1,100 to this point right over here.\n4:47\nThat would be the coordinate: 1,000; 1,100.\n4:54\nThis is a line.\n4:55\nTwo points make a line.\n4:56\nIn this particular case we have\n5:01\na consumption function that looks\n5:03\nsomething like this.\n5:06\nWe picked two points to draw it.\n5:07\nIf you remember a little bit of your slope,\n5:08\nyou could view this as your y intercept,\n5:11\nor in this case your c intercept,\n5:13\nand that your slope would be the .6,\n5:15\nand we'll talk more about that in future videos\n5:17\nwhen we dig into the marginal propensity\n5:18\nto consume a little bit more.\n5:20\nBut the one thing I just want to highlight\n5:22\nis it's a very simple idea.\n5:23\nThis does not have to be the consumption function.\n5:26\nThe consumption functions that we tend to study\n5:28\nin introductory economics classes will look like this.\n5:31\nIt will be a line that has some intersection,\n5:33\nsome base level of consumption.\n5:34\nBut one could argue it might be very different.\n5:36\nMaybe the consumption function looks like this.\n5:39\nMaybe when income is low,\n5:41\nfor every incremental dollar of income,\n5:44\npeople are probably going to spend a lot.\n5:47\nAs they become richer and richer and richer,\n5:49\nas their income goes higher and higher,\n5:51\nthey're going to spend less and less\n5:52\na fraction of their disposable income.\n5:54\nEssentially what I'm describing here\n5:56\nis a marginal propensity to consume changes.\n5:58\nIn our first model, we had a very basic\n6:00\nmarginal propensity to consume.\n6:02\nIt was constant.\n6:03\nFor every incremental dollar, .6 of that got spent.\n6:07\nSo we had a marginal propensity to consume\n6:09\nthat was constant of 0.6.\n6:13\nMarginal propensity to consume.\n6:15\nBut, you could argue, that maybe a more\n6:16\ncomplex model is justified.\n6:18\nThat when you have a very high marginal\n6:20\npropensity to consume, when people have very little\n6:23\nbecause they have a very low standard of living,\n6:25\nthey really want to just get a little bit more\n6:27\njust so they can live a decent life,\n6:29\nbut as they get more and more income they say,\n6:31\n\"Hey, I'm starting to max out my standard of living,\n6:34\n\"I'll save more and more of it for a rainy day.\"",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWe already know that an angle is formed\n0:02\nwhen two rays share a common endpoint.\n0:04\nSo, for example, let's say that this is one ray right\n0:06\nover here, and then this is one another ray right over here,\n0:11\nand then they would form an angle.\n0:13\nAnd at this point right over here,\n0:14\ntheir common endpoint is called the vertex of that angle.\n0:18\nNow, we also know that not all angles seem the same.\n0:21\nFor example, this is one angle here,\n0:23\nand then we could have another angle\n0:26\nthat looks something like this.\n0:34\nAnd viewed this way, it looks like this one\n0:36\nis much more open.\n0:39\nSo I'll say more open.\n0:43\nAnd this one right over here seems less open.\n0:46\nSo to avoid having to just say, oh, more open and less open\n0:50\nand actually becoming a little bit more exact about it,\n0:52\nwe'd actually want to measure how open an angle is,\n0:55\nor we'd want to have a measure of the angle.\n0:59\nNow, the most typical way that angles are measured,\n1:01\nthere's actually two major ways of that they're measured.\n1:04\nThe most typical unit is in degrees,\n1:07\nbut later on in high school, you'll\n1:09\nalso see the unit of radians being used, especially when you\n1:13\nlearn trigonometry.\n1:15\nBut the degrees convention really comes from a circle.\n1:18\nSo let's draw ourselves a circle right over here,\n1:20\nso that's a circle.\n1:22\nAnd the convention is that-- when I say convention,\n1:26\nit's just kind of what everyone has been doing.\n1:29\nThe convention is that you have 360 degrees in a circle.\n1:33\nSo let me explain that.\n1:34\nSo if that's the center of the circle,\n1:36\nand if we make this ray our starting point or one side\n1:43\nof our angle, if you go all the way around the circle,\n1:48\nthat represents 360 degrees.\n1:54\nAnd the notation is 360, and then this little superscript\n1:57\ncircle represents degrees.\n1:59\nThis could be read as 360 degrees.\n2:03\nNow, you might be saying, where did this 360 number come from?\n2:07\nAnd no one knows for sure, but there's hints in history,\n2:11\nand there's hints in just the way that the universe works,\n2:15\nor at least the Earth's rotation around the sun.\n2:17\nYou might recognize or you might already\n2:19\nrealize that there are 365 days in a non-leap year, 366\n2:25\nin a leap year.\n2:26\nAnd so you can imagine ancient astronomers might have said,\n2:29\nwell, you know, that's pretty close to 360.\n2:38\nAnd in fact, several ancient calendars,\n2:40\nincluding the Persians and the Mayans,\n2:43\nhad 360 days in their year.\n2:46\nAnd 360 is also a much neater number than 365.\n2:49\nIt has many, many more factors.\n2:52\nIt's another way of saying it's divisible by a bunch of things.\n2:55\nBut anyway, this has just been the convention, once again,\n2:58\nwhat history has handed us, that a circle is\n3:00\nviewed to have 360 degrees.\n3:03\nAnd so one way we could measure an angle\n3:06\nis you could put one of the rays of an angle right over here\n3:09\nat this part of the circle, and then the other ray of the angle\n3:14\nwill look something like this.\n3:17\nAnd then the fraction of the circle circumference\n3:24\nthat is intersected by these two rays, the measure of this angle\n3:28\nwould be that fraction of degrees.\n3:31\nSo, for example, let's say that this length right over here\n3:38\nis 1/6 of the circle's circumference.\n3:49\nSo it's 1/6 of the way around the circle.\n3:52\nThen this angle right over here is\n3:54\ngoing to be 1/6 of 360 degrees.\n3:58\nSo in this case, this would be 60 degrees.\n4:01\nI could do another example.\n4:02\nSo let's say I had a circle like this, and I'll draw an angle.\n4:07\nI'll put the vertex at the center of the angle.\n4:10\nI'll put one of the rays right over here.\n4:12\nYou could consider that to be 0 degrees.\n4:15\nOr if the other ray was also here, it would be 0 degrees.\n4:19\nAnd then I'll make the other ray of this angle,\n4:23\nlet's say it went straight up.\n4:25\nLet's say it went straight up like this.\n4:29\nWell, in this situation, the arc that\n4:33\nconnects these two endpoints just like this,\n4:37\nthis represents 1/4 of the circumference of the circle.\n4:40\nThis is, right over here, 1/4 of the circumference.\n4:49\nSo this angle right over here is going to be 1/4 of 360 degrees.\n4:55\n360 degrees divided by 4 is going to be 90 degrees.\n5:00\nAt an angle like this, one where one ray is straight up and down\n5:03\nand the other one goes to the right/left direction,\n5:07\nwe would say these two rays are perpendicular,\n5:11\nor we would call this a right angle.\n5:13\nAnd the way that we oftentimes will denote that\n5:16\nis by a symbol like this.\n5:19\nBut this literally means a 90-degree angle.\n5:22\nLet's do one more example.\n5:24\nLet's do one more example of this, just\n5:25\nto make sure that we understand what's going on.\n5:28\nActually, at least one more example.\n5:30\nMaybe one more if we have time.\n5:32\nSo let's say that we have an angle that looks like this.\n5:35\nOnce more, I'm going to put its vertex\n5:38\nat the center of the circle.\n5:40\nThat's one ray of the angle.\n5:42\nAnd let's say that this is the other ray.\n5:45\nThis right over here is the other ray of the angle.\n5:48\nI encourage you to pause this video\n5:50\nand try to figure out what the measure of this angle\n5:55\nright over here is.\n5:57\nWell, let's think about where the rays intersect the circle.\n6:00\nThey intersect there and there.\n6:02\nThe arc that connects them on the circle\n6:04\nis that arc right over there.\n6:06\nThat is literally half of the circumference of the circle.\n6:09\nThat is half of the circumference, half of the way\n6:13\naround of the circle, circumference of the circle.\n6:18\nSo this angle is going to be half of 360 degrees.\n6:21\nAnd half of 360 is 180 degrees.\n6:26\nAnd when you view it this way, these two rays\n6:27\nshare a common endpoint.\n6:28\nAnd together, they're really forming a line here.\n6:32\nAnd let's just do one more example,\n6:34\nbecause I said I would.\n6:36\nLet me paste another circle.\n6:39\nLet me draw another angle.\n6:42\nLet me draw another angle.\n6:44\nSo let's say that's one ray of the angle,\n6:46\nand this is the other ray.\n6:49\nThis is the other ray of the angle right over here.\n6:52\nAnd we care.\n6:53\nThere's actually two angles that are formed.\n6:55\nThere's actually two angles formed in all of these.\n6:57\nThere's one angle that's formed right over here,\n6:59\nand you might recognize that to be a 90-degree angle.\n7:01\nBut what we really care about in this example\n7:04\nis this angle right over here.\n7:07\nSo once again, where does it intersect the circle?\n7:10\nWe care about this arc right over here,\n7:13\nbecause that's the arc that corresponds\n7:17\nto this angle right over here.\n7:19\nAnd it looks like we've gone 3/4 around the circle.\n7:22\nSo this angle is going to be 3/4 of 360 degrees.\n7:28\n1/4 of 360 degrees is 90, so three of those\n7:32\nis going to be 270 degrees.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWhich of the following real numbers are irrational?\n0:03\nWell, irrational just means it's not rational.\n0:07\nIt means that you cannot express it as the ratio of two\n0:10\nintegers.\n0:11\nSo let's see what we have here.\n0:12\nSo we have the square root of 8 over 2.\n0:15\nIf you take the square root of a number that is not\n0:18\na perfect square, it is going to be irrational.\n0:21\nAnd then if you just take that irrational number\n0:23\nand you multiply it, and you divide it by any other numbers,\n0:26\nyou're still going to get an irrational number.\n0:28\nSo square root of 8 is irrational.\n0:30\nYou divide that by 2, it is still irrational.\n0:33\nSo this is not rational.\n0:34\nOr in other words, I'm saying it is irrational.\n0:38\nNow, you have pi, 3.14159-- it just\n0:40\nkeeps going on and on and on forever without ever repeating.\n0:44\nSo this is irrational, probably the most famous\n0:47\nof all of the irrational numbers.\n0:50\n5.0-- well, I can represent 5.0 as 5/1.\n0:55\nSo 5.0 is rational.\n0:57\nIt is not irrational.\n1:00\n0.325-- well, this is the same thing as 325/1000.\n1:08\nSo I can clearly represent it as a ratio of integers.\n1:11\nSo this is rational.\n1:12\nJust as I could represent 5.0 as 5/1, both of these\n1:16\nare rational.\n1:17\nThey are not irrational.\n1:19\nHere I have 7.777777, and it just\n1:22\nkeeps going on and on and on forever.\n1:23\nAnd the way we denote that, you could just\n1:25\nsay these dots that say that the 7's keep going.\n1:28\nOr you could say 7.7.\n1:29\nAnd this line shows that the 7 part, the second 7,\n1:32\njust keeps repeating on forever.\n1:35\nNow, if you have a repeating decimal-- in other videos,\n1:38\nwe'll actually convert them into fractions--\n1:40\nbut a repeating decimal can be represented\n1:44\nas a ratio of two integers.\n1:47\nJust as 1/3 is equal to 0.333 on and on and on.\n1:52\nOr I could say it like this.\n1:54\nI could say 3 repeating.\n1:56\nWe can also do the same thing for that.\n1:57\nI won't do it here, but this is rational.\n2:01\nSo it's not irrational.\n2:03\n8 and 1/2?\n2:05\nWell, that's the same thing.\n2:06\n8 and 1/2 is the same thing as 17/2.\n2:09\nSo it's clearly rational.\n2:11\nSo the only two irrational numbers\n2:13\nare the first two right over here.",

thick.\n0:09\nA virus, or viruses.\n0:14\nAnd in my opinion, viruses are, on some level, the most\n0:19\nfascinating thing in all of biology.\n0:21\nBecause they really blur the boundary between what is an\n0:25\ninanimate object and what is life?\n0:30\nI mean if we look at ourselves, or life as one of\n0:33\nthose things that you know it when you see it.\n0:35\nIf you see something that, it's born, it grows, it's\n0:39\nconstantly changing.\n0:40\nMaybe it moves around.\n0:41\nMaybe it doesn't.\n0:42\nBut it's metabolizing things around itself.\n0:44\nIt reproduces and then it dies.\n0:46\nYou say, hey, that's probably life.\n0:48\nAnd in this, we throw most things that we see-- or we\n0:50\nthrow in, us.\n0:52\nWe throw in bacteria.\n0:55\nWe throw in plants.\n0:57\nI mean, I could-- I'm kind of butchering the taxonomy system\n1:00\nhere, but we tend to know life when we see it.\n1:03\nBut all viruses are, they're just a bunch of genetic\n1:07\ninformation inside of a protein.\n1:09\nInside of a protein capsule.\n1:11\nSo let me draw.\n1:13\nAnd the genetic information can come in any form.\n1:16\nSo it can be an RNA, it could be DNA, it could be\n1:22\nsingle-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA.\n1:24\nSometimes for single stranded they'll write these two little\n1:27\nS's in front of it.\n1:29\nLet's say they are talking about double stranded DNA,\n1:30\nthey'll put a ds in front of it.\n1:32\nBut the general idea-- and viruses can come in all of\n1:35\nthese forms-- is that they have some genetic information,\n1:38\nsome chain of nucleic acids.\n1:40\nEither as single or double stranded RNA or single or\n1:43\ndouble stranded DNA.\n1:44\nAnd it's just contained inside some type of protein\n1:47\nstructure, which is called the capsid.\n1:49\nAnd kind of the classic drawing is kind of an\n1:53\nicosahedron type looking thing.\n1:56\nLet me see if I can do justice to it.\n1:58\nIt looks something like this.\n2:00\nAnd not all viruses have to look exactly like this.\n2:02\nThere's thousands of types of viruses.\n2:05\nAnd we're really just scratching the surface and\n2:06\nunderstanding even what viruses are out there and all\n2:09\nof the different ways that they can essentially replicate\n2:14\nthemselves.\n2:15\nWe'll talk more about that in the future.\n2:16\nAnd I would suspect that pretty much any possible way\n2:19\nof replication probably does somehow exist\n2:21\nin the virus world.\n2:22\nBut they really are just these proteins, these protein\n2:25\ncapsids, are just made up of a bunch of little\n2:27\nproteins put together.\n2:29\nAnd inside they have some genetic material, which might\n2:31\nbe DNA or it might be RNA.\n2:33\nSo let me draw their genetic material.\n2:35\nThe protein is not necessarily transparent, but if it was,\n2:38\nyou would see some genetic material inside of there.\n2:42\nSo the question is, is this thing life?\n2:48\nIt seems pretty inanimate.\n2:49\nIt doesn't grow.\n2:50\nIt doesn't change.\n2:51\nIt doesn't metabolize things.\n2:53\nThis thing, left to its own devices, is just\n2:55\ngoing to sit there.\n2:55\nIt's just going to sit there the way a book on a table just\n2:59\nsits there.\n3:00\nIt won't change anything.\n3:02\nBut what happens is, the debate arises.\n3:06\nI mean you might say, hey Sal, when you define it that way,\n3:08\njust looks like a bunch of molecules put together.\n3:10\nThat isn't life.\n3:11\nBut it starts to seem like life all of a sudden when it\n3:14\ncomes in contact with the things that we normally\n3:17\nconsider life.\n3:18\nSo what viruses do, the classic example is, a virus\n3:22\nwill attach itself to a cell.\n3:24\nSo let me draw this thing a little bit smaller.\n3:28\nSo let's say that this is my virus.\n3:30\nI'll draw it as a little hexagon.\n3:32\nAnd what it does is, it'll attach itself to a cell.\n3:34\nAnd it could be any type of cell.\n3:35\nIt could be a bacteria cell, it could be a plant cell, it\n3:39\ncould be a human cell.\n3:41\nLet me draw the cell here.\n3:43\nCells are usually far larger than the virus.\n3:48\nIn the case of cells that have soft membranes, the virus\n3:51\nfigures out some way to enter it.\n3:53\nSometimes it can essentially fuse-- I don't want to\n3:58\ncomplicate the issue-- but sometimes viruses have their\n4:01\nown little membranes.\n4:02\nAnd we'll talk about in a second where\n4:03\nit gets their membranes.\n4:04\nSo a virus might have its own membrane like that.\n4:08\nThat's around its capsid.\n4:10\nAnd then these membranes will fuse.\n4:13\nAnd then the virus will be able to enter into the cell.\n4:16\nNow, that's one method.\n4:18\nAnd another method, and they're seldom\n4:19\nall the same way.\n4:20\nBut let's say another method would be, the virus\n4:24\nconvinces-- just based on some protein receptors on it, or\n4:26\nprotein receptors on the cells-- and obviously this has\n4:29\nto be kind of a Trojan horse type of thing.\n4:31\nThe cell doesn't want viruses.\n4:33\nSo the virus has to somehow convince the cell that it's a\n4:36\nnon-foreign particle.\n4:38\nWe could do hundreds of videos on how viruses work and it's a\n4:41\ncontinuing field of research.\n4:43\nBut sometimes you might have a virus that just gets consumed\n4:47\nby the cell.\n4:48\nMaybe the cell just thinks it's something that it needs\n4:49\nto consume.\n4:50\nSo the cell wraps around it like this.\n4:56\nAnd these sides will eventually merge.\n4:58\nAnd then the cell and the virus will go into it.\n5:01\nThis is called endocytosis.\n5:03\nI'll just talk about that.\n5:04\nIt just brings it into its cytoplasm.\n5:06\nIt doesn't happen just to viruses.\n5:11\nBut this is one mechanism that can enter.\n5:12\nAnd then in cases where the cell in question-- for example\n5:17\nin the situation with bacteria-- if the cell has a\n5:20\nvery hard shell-- let me do it in a good color.\n5:25\nSo let's say that this is a bacteria right here.\n5:29\nAnd it has a hard shell.\n5:30\nThe viruses don't even enter the cell.\n5:32\nThey just hang out outside of the cell like this.\n5:36\nNot drawing to scale.\n5:37\nAnd they actually inject their genetic material.\n5:40\nSo there's obviously a huge-- there's a wide variety of ways\n5:43\nof how the viruses get into cells.\n5:45\nBut that's beside the point.\n5:46\nThe interesting thing is that they do get into the cell.\n5:49\nAnd once they do get into the cell, they release their\n5:52\ngenetic material into the cell.\n5:54\nSo their genetic material will float around.\n5:56\nIf their genetic material is already in the form of RNA--\n6:01\nand I could imagine almost every possibility of different\n6:05\nways for viruses to work probably do exist in nature.\n6:08\nWe just haven't found them.\n6:09\nBut the ones that we've already found really do kind\n6:11\nof do it in every possible way.\n6:13\nSo if they have RNA, this RNA can immediately start being\n6:20\nused to essentially-- let's say this is the\n6:23\nnucleus of the cell.\n6:25\nThat's the nucleus of the cell and it normally has the DNA in\n6:28\nit like that.\n6:29\nMaybe I'll do the DNA in a different color.\n6:30\nBut DNA gets transcribed into RNA, normally.\n6:37\nSo normally, the cell, this a normal working cell, the RNA\n6:39\nexits the nucleus, it goes to the ribosomes, and then you\n6:43\nhave the RNA in conjunction with the tRNA and it produces\n6:46\nthese proteins.\n6:49\nThe RNA codes for different proteins.\n6:51\nAnd I talk about that in a different video.\n6:53\nSo these proteins get formed and eventually, they can form\n6:57\nthe different structures in a cell.\n6:58\nBut what a virus does is it hijacks this process here.\n7:03\nHijacks this mechanism.\n7:04\nThis RNA will essentially go and do what the cell's own RNA\n7:08\nwould have done.\n7:09\nAnd it starts coding for its own proteins.\n7:11\nObviously it's not going to code for\n7:12\nthe same things there.\n7:13\nAnd actually some of the first proteins it codes for often\n7:15\nstart killing the DNA and the RNA that might otherwise\n7:19\ncompete with it.\n7:20\nSo it codes its own proteins.\n7:22\nAnd then those proteins start making more viral shells.\n7:26\nSo those proteins just start constructing more and more\n7:31\nviral shells.\n7:33\nAt the same time, this RNA is replicating.\n7:36\nIt's using the cell's own mechanisms. Left to its own\n7:39\ndevices it would just sit there.\n7:40\nBut once it enters into a cell it can use all of the nice\n7:43\nmachinery that a cell has around to replicate itself.\n7:47\nAnd it's kind of amazing, just the biochemistry of it.\n7:51\nThat these RNA molecules then find themselves\n7:54\nback in these capsids.\n7:57\nAnd then once there's enough of these and the cell has\n8:00\nessentially all of its resources have been depleted,\n8:05\nthe viruses, these individual new viruses that have\n8:09\nreplicated themselves using all of the cell's mechanisms,\n8:15\nwill find some way to exit the cell.\n8:17\nThe most-- I don't want to say, typical, because we\n8:20\nhaven't even discovered all the different types of viruses\n8:23\nthere are-- but one that's, I guess, talked about the most,\n8:26\nis when there's enough of these, they'll release\n8:28\nproteins or they'll construct proteins.\n8:30\nBecause they don't make their own.\n8:32\nThat essentially cause the cell to either kill itself or\n8:35\nits membrane to dissolve.\n8:37\nSo the membrane dissolves.\n8:39\nAnd essentially the cell lyses.\n8:41\nLet me write that down.\n8:42\nThe cell lyses.\n8:43\nAnd lyses just means that the cell's membrane just\n8:46\ndisappears.\n8:46\nAnd then all of these guys can emerge for themselves.\n8:50\nNow I talked about before that have some of these guys, that\n8:53\nthey have their own membrane.\n8:54\nSo how did they get there, these\n8:56\nkind of bilipid membranes?\n8:58\nWell some of them, what they do is, once they replicate\n9:00\ninside of a cell, they exit maybe not even killing-- they\n9:07\ndon't have to lyse.\n9:08\nEverything I talk about, these are specific ways that a virus\n9:11\nmight work.\n9:12\nBut viruses really kind of explore-- well different types\n9:15\nof viruses do almost every different combination you\n9:17\ncould imagine of replicating and coding for proteins and\n9:22\nescaping from cells.\n9:23\nSome of them just bud.\n9:24\nAnd when they bud, they essentially, you can kind of\n9:26\nimagine that they push against the cell\n9:28\nwall, or the membrane.\n9:29\nI shouldn't say cell wall.\n9:30\nThe cell's outer membrane.\n9:32\nAnd then when they push against it, they take some of\n9:36\nthe membrane with them.\n9:38\nUntil eventually the cell will-- when this goes up\n9:41\nenough, this'll pop together and it'll take some of the\n9:43\nmembrane with it.\n9:44\nAnd you could imagine why that would be useful thing\n9:47\nto have with you.\n9:49\nBecause now that you have this membrane, you kind of look\n9:51\nlike this cell.\n9:52\nSo when you want to go infect another cell like this, you're\n9:55\nnot going to necessarily look like a foreign particle.\n9:58\nSo it's a very useful way to look like something that\n10:02\nyou're not.\n10:03\nAnd if you don't think that this is creepy-crawly enough,\n10:06\nthat you're hijacking the DNA of an organism, viruses can\n10:10\nactually change the DNA an organism.\n10:14\nAnd actually one of the most common examples is HIV virus.\n10:18\nLet me write that down.\n10:21\nHIV, which is a type of retrovirus, which is\n10:27\nfascinating.\n10:28\nBecause what they do is, so they have RNA in them.\n10:35\nAnd when they enter into a cell, let's say that they got\n10:38\ninto the cell.\n10:39\nSo it's inside of the cell like this.\n10:42\nThey actually bring along with them a protein.\n10:46\nAnd every time you say, where do they get this protein?\n10:49\nAll of this stuff came from a different cell.\n10:51\nThey use some other cell's amino acids and ribosomes and\n10:54\nnucleic acids and everything to build themselves.\n10:56\nSo any proteins that they have in them came\n10:58\nfrom another cell.\n11:00\nBut they bring with them, this protein reverse transcriptase.\n11:04\nAnd the reverse transcriptase takes their RNA and\n11:07\ncodes it into DNA.\n11:11\nSo its RNA to DNA.\n11:14\nWhich when it was first discovered was, kind of,\n11:16\npeople always thought that you always went from DNA to RNA,\n11:19\nbut this kind of broke that paradigm.\n11:22\nBut it codes from RNA to DNA.\n11:23\nAnd if that's not bad enough, it'll incorporate that DNA\n11:29\ninto the DNA of the host cell.\n11:31\nSo that DNA will incorporate itself into the\n11:34\nDNA of the host cell.\n11:35\nLet's say the yellow is the DNA of the host cell.\n11:37\nAnd this is its nucleus.\n11:41\nSo it actually messes with the genetic makeup\n11:44\nof what it's infecting.\n11:46\nAnd when I made the videos on bacteria I said, hey for every\n11:51\none human cell we have twenty bacteria cells.\n11:53\nAnd they live with us and they're useful and they're\n11:56\npart of us and they're 10% of our dry mass and all of that.\n12:00\nBut bacteria are kind of along for the ride.\n12:02\nThey don't change who we are.\n12:03\nBut these retroviruses, they're actually changing our\n12:07\ngenetic makeup.\n12:07\nI mean, my genes, I take very personally.\n12:10\nThey define who I am.\n12:12\nBut these guys will actually go in and\n12:14\nchange my genetic makeup.\n12:16\nAnd then once they're part of the DNA, then just the natural\n12:19\nDNA to RNA to protein process will code\n12:25\ntheir actual proteins.\n12:27\nOr their-- what they need to-- so sometimes they'll lay\n12:30\ndormant and do nothing.\n12:31\nAnd sometimes-- let's say sometimes in some type of\n12:33\nenvironmental trigger, they'll start coding\n12:35\nfor themselves again.\n12:37\nAnd they'll start producing more.\n12:38\nBut they're producing it directly from the organism's\n12:41\ncell's DNA.\n12:43\nThey become part of the organism.\n12:45\nI mean I can't imagine a more intimate way to become part of\n12:49\nan organism than to become part of its DNA.\n12:51\nI can't imagine any other way to\n12:52\nactually define an organism.\n12:55\nAnd if this by itself is not eerie enough, and just so you\n13:00\nknow, this notion right here, when a virus becomes part of\n13:06\nan organism's DNA, this is called a provirus.\n13:13\nBut if this isn't eerie enough, they estimate-- so if\n13:16\nthis infects a cell in my nose or in my arm, as this cell\n13:23\nexperiences mitosis, all of its offspring-- but its\n13:27\noffspring are genetically identical-- are going to have\n13:29\nthis viral DNA.\n13:30\nAnd that might be fine, but at least my\n13:32\nchildren won't get it.\n13:33\nYou know, at least it won't become part of my species.\n13:35\nBut it doesn't have to just infect somatic cells, it could\n13:38\ninfect a germ cell.\n13:41\nSo it could go into a germ cell.\n13:44\nAnd the germ cells, we've learned already, these are the\n13:46\nones that produce gametes.\n13:49\nFor men, that's sperm and for women it's eggs.\n13:52\nBut you could imagine, once you've infected a germ cell,\n13:55\nonce you become part of a germ cell's DNA, then I'm passing\n13:59\non that viral DNA to my son or my daughter.\n14:02\nAnd they are going to pass it on to their children.\n14:05\nAnd just that idea by itself is, at least to my mind.\n14:10\nvaguely creepy.\n14:12\nAnd people estimate that 5-8%-- and this kind of really\n14:16\nblurs, it makes you think about what we as humans really\n14:19\nare-- but the estimate is 5-8% of the human genome-- so when\n14:26\nI talked about bacteria I just talked about things that were\n14:29\nalong for the ride.\n14:30\nBut the current estimate, and I looked up this a lot.\n14:33\nI found 8% someplace, 5% someplace.\n14:35\nIt's all a guess.\n14:35\nI mean people are doing it based on just looking at the\n14:37\nDNA and how similar it is to DNA in other organisms. But\n14:40\nthe estimate is 5-8% of the human genome is from viruses,\n14:47\nis from ancient retroviruses that incorporated themselves\n14:51\ninto the human germ line.\n14:53\nSo into the human DNA.\n14:55\nSo these are called endogenous retroviruses.\n15:04\nWhich is mind blowing to me, because it's not just saying\n15:07\nthese things are along for the ride or that they might help\n15:09\nus or hurt us.\n15:10\nIt's saying that we are-- 5-8% of our DNA\n15:14\nactually comes from viruses.\n15:16\nAnd this is another thing that speaks to\n15:17\njust genetic variation.\n15:19\nBecause viruses do something-- I mean this is called\n15:24\nhorizontal transfer of DNA.\n15:27\nAnd you could imagine, as a virus goes from one species to\n15:30\nthe next, as it goes from Species A to B, if it mutates\n15:37\nto be able to infiltrate these cells, it might take some--\n15:41\nit'll take the DNA that it already has, that\n15:43\nmakes it, it with it.\n15:45\nBut sometimes, when it starts coding for some of these other\n15:48\nguys, so let's say that this is a provirus right here.\n15:52\nWhere the blue part is the original virus.\n15:55\nThe yellow is the organism's historic DNA.\n16:00\nSometimes when it codes, it takes up little sections of\n16:04\nthe other organism's DNA.\n16:07\nSo maybe most of it was the viral DNA, but it might have,\n16:11\nwhen it transcribed and translated itself, it might\n16:14\nhave taken a little bit-- or at least when it translated or\n16:16\nreplicated itself-- it might take a little bit of the\n16:18\norganism's previous DNA.\n16:20\nSo it's actually cutting parts of DNA from one organism and\n16:23\nbringing it to another organism.\n16:24\nTaking it from one member of a species to another member of\n16:27\nthe species.\n16:27\nBut it can definitely go cross-species.\n16:29\nSo you have this idea all of a sudden that DNA can jump\n16:32\nbetween species.\n16:34\nIt really kind of-- I don't know, for me it makes me\n16:36\nappreciate how interconnected-- as a species,\n16:39\nwe kind of imagine that we're by ourselves and can only\n16:41\nreproduce with each other and have genetic variation within\n16:45\na population.\n16:45\nBut viruses introduce this notion of horizontal transfer\n16:50\nvia transduction.\n16:53\nHorizontal transduction is just the idea of, look when I\n16:57\nreplicate this virus, I might take a little bit of the\n17:00\norganism that I'm freeloading off of, I might take a little\n17:04\nbit of their DNA with me.\n17:06\nAnd infect that DNA into the next organism.\n17:09\nSo you actually have this DNA, this jumping,\n17:11\nfrom organism to organism.\n17:13\nSo it kind of unifies all DNA-based life.\n17:17\nWhich is all the life that we know on the planet.\n17:20\nAnd if all of this isn't creepy enough-- and actually\n17:24\nmaybe I'll save the creepiest part for the end.\n17:28\nBut there's a whole-- we could talk all about the different\n17:30\nclasses of viruses.\n17:31\nBut just so you're familiar with some of the terminology,\n17:33\nwhen a virus attacks bacteria, which they often do.\n17:37\nAnd we study these the most because this might be a good\n17:41\nalternative to antibiotics.\n17:42\nBecause viruses that attack bacteria might-- sometimes the\n17:45\nbacteria is far worse for the virus-- but these are called\n17:47\nbacteriaphages.\n17:52\nAnd I've already talked to you about how they have their DNA.\n17:55\nBut since bacteria have hard walls, they will just inject\n17:57\nthe DNA inside of the bacteria.\n18:00\nAnd when you talk about DNA, this idea of a provirus.\n18:06\nSo when a virus lyses it like this, this is\n18:09\ncalled the lytic cycle.\n18:11\nThis is just some terminology that's good to know if you're\n18:13\ngoing to take a biology exam about this stuff.\n18:16\nAnd when the virus incorporates it into the DNA\n18:18\nand lays dormant, incorporates into the DNA of the host\n18:22\norganism and lays dormant for awhile, this is called the\n18:25\nlysogenic cycle.\n18:28\nAnd normally, a provirus is essentially experiencing a\n18:32\nlysogenic cycle in eurkaryotes, in organisms that\n18:35\nhave a nuclear membrane.\n18:38\nNormally when people talk about the lysogenic cycle,\n18:40\nthey're talking about viral DNA laying dormant in the DNA\n18:44\nof bacteria.\n18:45\nOr bacteriophage DNA laying dormant\n18:48\nin the DNA of bacteria.\n18:51\nBut just to kind of give you an idea of what this, quote\n18:53\nunquote, looks like, right here.\n18:59\nI got these two pictures from Wikipedia.\n19:01\nOne is from the CDC.\n19:11\nThese little green dots you see right here all over the\n19:14\nsurface, this big thing you see here, this is a white\n19:17\nblood cell.\n19:20\nPart of the human immune system.\n19:21\nThis is a white blood cell.\n19:27\nAnd what you see emerging from the surface, essentially\n19:31\nbudding from the surface of this white blood cell-- and\n19:34\nthis gives you a sense of scale too--\n19:36\nthese are HIV-1 viruses.\n19:39\nAnd so you're familiar with the terminology, the HIV is a\n19:46\nvirus that infects white blood cells.\n19:51\nAIDS is the syndrome you get once your immune system is\n19:54\nweakened to the point.\n19:55\nAnd then many people suffer infections that people with a\n19:58\nstrong immune system normally won't suffer from.\n20:01\nBut this is creepy.\n20:03\nThese things went inside this huge cell, they used the\n20:06\ncell's own mechanism to reproduce its own DNA or its\n20:11\nown RNA and these protein capsids.\n20:14\nAnd then they bud from the cell and take a little bit of\n20:16\nthe membrane with it.\n20:17\nAnd they can even leave some of their DNA behind in this\n20:20\ncell's own DNA.\n20:22\nSo they really change what the cell is all about.\n20:25\nThis is another creepy picture.\n20:26\nThese are bacteriaphages.\n20:34\nAnd these show you what I said before.\n20:36\nThis is a bacteria right here.\n20:38\nThis is its cell wall.\n20:41\nAnd it's hard.\n20:42\nSo it's hard to just emerge into it.\n20:45\nOr you can't just merge, fuse membranes with it.\n20:47\nSo they hang out on the outside of this bacteria.\n20:52\nAnd they are essentially injecting their genetic\n20:55\nmaterial into the bacteria itself.\n20:58\nAnd you could imagine, just looking at the\n20:59\nsize of these things.\n21:01\nI mean, this is a cell.\n21:02\nAnd it looks like a whole planet or something.\n21:04\nOr this is a bacteria and these\n21:05\nthings are so much smaller.\n21:06\nRoughly 1/100 of a bacteria.\n21:08\nAnd these are much less than 1/100 of this cell we're\n21:10\ntalking about.\n21:11\nAnd they're extremely hard to filter for.\n21:15\nTo kind of keep out.\n21:16\nBecause they are such, such small particles.\n21:20\nIf you think that these are exotic things that exist for\n21:23\nthings like HIV or Ebola , which they do cause, or SARS,\n21:31\nyou're right.\n21:32\nBut they're also common things.\n21:33\nI mean, I said at the beginning of this video that I\n21:35\nhave a cold.\n21:36\nAnd I have a cold because some viruses have infected the\n21:40\ntissue in my nasal passage.\n21:42\nAnd they're causing me to have a runny nose and whatnot.\n21:46\nAnd viruses also cause the chicken pox.\n21:48\nThey cause the herpes simplex virus.\n21:50\nCauses cold sores.\n21:51\nSo they're with us all around.\n21:53\nI can almost guarantee you have some virus\n21:56\nwith you as you speak.\n21:57\nThey're all around you.\n21:58\nBut it's a very\n22:04\nphilosophically puzzling question.\n22:06\nBecause I started with, at the beginning, are these life?\n22:09\nAnd at first when I just showed it to you, look they\n22:11\nare just this protein with some nucleic\n22:13\nacid molecule in it.\n22:15\nAnd it's not doing anything.\n22:16\nAnd that doesn't look like life to me.\n22:17\nIt's not moving around.\n22:18\nIt doesn't have a metabolism.\n22:19\nIt's not eating.\n22:20\nIt's not reproducing.\n22:21\nBut then all of a sudden, when you think about what it's\n22:23\ndoing to cells and how it uses cells to kind of reproduce.\n22:27\nIt kind of like-- in business terms it's asset light.\n22:29\nIt doesn't need all of the machinery because it can use\n22:31\nother people's machinery to replicate itself.\n22:35\nYou almost kind of want to view it as a\n22:38\nsmarter form of life.\n22:39\nBecause it doesn't go through all of the trouble of what\n22:42\nevery other form of life has.\n22:44\nIt makes you question what life is, or even what we are.\n22:47\nAre we these things that contain DNA or are we just\n22:51\ntransport mechanisms for the DNA?\n22:54\nAnd these are kind of the more important things.\n22:56\nAnd these viral infections are just battles between different\n22:59\nforms of DNA and RNA and whatnot.\n23:02\nAnyway I don't want to get too philosophical on you.\n23:04\nBut hopefully this gives you a good idea of what viruses are\n23:08\nand why they really are, in my mind, the most fascinating\n23:12\npseudo organism in all of biology.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLike we did with parabolic mirrors, what I really want to do in this video\n0:04\nis just for put objects at different distances relative to this convex lens\n0:10\nand just think about what its image will look like\n0:12\nAnd the whole point of doing that is going through all the different situations but\n0:16\nmore is getting practice of how to think about it\n0:19\nSo let's first put an object out here\n0:23\nThat's more than two focal lengths away from the lens\n0:28\nI'll put the object right here\n0:30\nWe'll do our classic arrow\n0:32\nActually I'll make a point here. When we dealt with parabolic mirrors\n0:37\nwe talked about the distance of two focal lengths being our center of curvature\n0:42\nOver here we're just gonna call it 2 focal length, because it's really not\n0:45\nthe center of curvature--\n0:47\nor this distance really isn't the radius of curvature of\n0:51\neach of these curves. So we're just gonna call it 2 focal lengths\n0:53\nSo with that said, let's actually try to figure out what the image of this thing would look like\n0:59\nas the light from it gets refracted through this lens\n1:02\nSo like always, it's useful to draw one ray\n1:06\nEvery point of this object is emitting rays in every direction\n1:10\nbecause it's diffusely reflecting light\n1:12\nSo we can just pick rays that are convenient\n1:15\nSo we can go from the tip of the arrow\n1:17\nand go parallel to our principal axis just like that\n1:22\nI'm not gonna show all the internal refraction within this lens right here\n1:26\nBut we know that if we enter the lens, parallel to the principal axis\n1:31\nwhen we get refracted, we will go through the focal point on the other side of the lens\n1:41\nAnd on the left side of the lens\n1:45\nwe'll do another ray that goes through the focal point on the left side\n1:48\nand then comes out parallel\n2:00\nThe incident ray goes through the left focal point\n2:04\nand when it gets refracted, it will now be parallel\n2:10\nAnd so the light that came from that point of the object will reconverge right over here\n2:18\nSo if you did this for every point of this object\n2:21\nif you did a point in the middle right over here, it would reconverge right over here\n2:25\nIf you did this point right over here, it would reconverge right over there\n2:30\nSo the image of this object is going to look like this\n2:38\nSo it's going to be a real image. The rays actually converge here. So it's a real inverted image\n2:46\nIt was pointing up before. Now it's pointing that down\n2:48\nAnd in this situation, it's actually going to be smaller than the original\n2:53\nSo, real, smaller, inverted image\n2:57\nLet's do a couple of other scenarios\n3:00\nLet me copy and paste this before starting this video to save on time\n3:05\nLet's do a situation now where the object is at the 2 focal distances. I guess we can call that\n3:13\nLet's put the object right over here\n3:20\nWe can do the exact same thing\n3:22\nYou might want to do it on paper on your own to get some practice doing it\n3:26\nWe'll do one ray that's parallel\n3:31\nWhen it gets refracted, it will go through the focal point on the other side\n3:36\nAnd then we'll do another ray that goes through the focal point on the left side\n3:40\nand then it will become parallel\n3:45\nAnd they can reconverge or they converge right over there\n3:48\nSo you can see that this is actually a parallelogram\n3:53\nThis distance right there is going to be the same thing as that distance over here\n3:58\nIt is actually--I don't want to say symmetry. You can't flip it over\n4:01\nBut this is a--and this distance right over here is going to be the same\n4:05\nthing as this distance over here. I won't go into all the geometry\n4:08\nAnyway, this would be an inverted image of exactly the same size at the exact same distance\n4:17\nActually I didn't talk about distance in this one over here\n4:19\nOver here, it's a real image; it's smaller and it's also going to be closer in\n4:24\nthan this one was. It's gonna be closer to lens\n4:27\nBut here the image is going to be the same size as the original object\n4:33\nIt's going to be inverted, but it's going to be at the same distance from the lens\n4:37\njust on the other side. Once again this is a real image\n4:41\nLet's do another one\n4:45\nCopy and paste\n4:48\nSo let's stick something between one focal length and two focal lengths\n4:53\nSo what's put my object right over there\n5:03\nSo once again, let's go parallel\n5:06\nthen we will refract through the focus on the other side\n5:16\nAnd then let's go through the focus on the left side\n5:19\nAnd then we will refract and go parallel\n5:25\nSo here, we will have--remember, I could use any point. Here I just used the tip\n5:30\nbecause I know the base will converge over there\n5:34\nIf I took 2 points, it would go converge right back there\n5:38\nAnd then if I did with a point right here\n5:40\nand I did that same exercise, it would go right over there\n5:43\nAnd so the whole image would show up over here\n5:47\nSo here, it's real; it's inverted; and it's larger\n5:50\nand it is now further away from the lens than the object on the other side\n5:57\nThis is really kind of the reverse of the first example\n6:00\nThe first example, the object was larger and more than two focal lengths away\n6:04\nand the image was in this range\n6:06\nNow the object is here and now the image's on the other side. So they're kind of--\n6:10\nthat's really just the other side of that first examples\n6:13\nLet's do a couple more\n6:18\nSo let's put the object at the focal point and see what would happen\n6:27\nAnd sometimes people memorize this type of things for physics exams\n6:31\nYou don't need to. All you have to do is remember just think about 2 rays\n6:35\nusually from the tip of the arrow that gives you a sense what the image will look like\n6:38\nand you do one parallel and one that goes through the focal point\n6:42\nWell, with that said\n6:43\nwe're gonna do something slightly different when something is sitting at the focal point\n6:48\nWhen something is sitting at the focal point\n6:50\none is we can do the parallel\n6:54\nIt will be refracted through the focal point on the other side\n6:58\nAnd then instead of doing a ray that goes through the focal point on this side\n7:04\nbecause actually you can't. You're sitting on the focal point right there\n7:08\nLet's do a ray that does not get refracted. We did a similar thing with the parabolic mirrors\n7:13\nWhat I want do is a ray that'll go right to the center of the lens\n7:19\nwhere it won't get refracted\n7:22\nIt's just go straight through the center of the lens\n7:28\nSo what you have here is, both of these rays that were diverging from this point from this tip\n7:35\nthey don't reconverge anywhere\n7:37\nAnd they don't even look like they're diverging from another point\n7:39\nif someone's eyeball is right over here\n7:43\nThey're just going to see these as 2 parallel rays of light\n7:47\nSo no image will form. Not a real image or virtual image\n7:50\nSo we can say no image is going to form\n7:57\nNow the last case is, let's put the object less than one focal distance away\n8:09\nLet's put the object right over here. And think about what happens\n8:16\nOnce again, the light ray from this tip\n8:19\nwhere to go parallel. It will be refracted through the focal point on the other side\n8:24\nAnd then let's do another light ray, going\n8:26\nin a direction as if it were coming the direction of the focal point on this side\n8:30\nSo it comes from that direction\n8:32\nThe light ray would go like that\n8:34\nAnd then it would come out on the other side parallel\n8:40\nSo clearly, these two light rays are not converging\n8:43\nSo no real image's going to form\n8:45\nBut they do look like they're diverging from some point\n8:51\nContinue these lines. They both look like they're coming from a point right over there\n8:59\nSo what's going to happen? If someone's eyes are processing these light rays\n9:04\nthey're gonna see the tip of this arrow all the way up here\n9:06\nThey're gonna see the base of this arrow down here\n9:11\nAnd essentially, they're going to see a magnified virtual image of the actual arrow\n9:29\nAnyway, hopefully you found that interesting",

through it.\n0:07\nSo let's see.\n0:07\nIt says what are the factors of 9?\n0:10\nYou can re-size this box with 9 dots-- the box\n0:13\nhas 9 dots-- to help you find the factors.\n0:15\nBEN EATER: So what you're looking at,\n0:17\nis you've got these 9 dots on the screen.\n0:19\nAnd right now, there are just 1 row of 9 dots.\n0:22\nAnd if you grab that little thing\n0:24\non the right side of the box and move that around to the left--\n0:27\nSAL KHAN: Oh, that's neat.\n0:28\nBEN EATER: --you still have 9 dots,\n0:29\nbut they're arranged differently.\n0:31\nSAL KHAN: I see.\n0:31\nBEN EATER: And so what you can see is, try to get them\n0:33\nso you have the same number in each row.\n0:35\nSAL KHAN: I see, so this one.\n0:36\nSo if you have-- let's see, not the same number.\n0:39\nBEN EATER: There you go.\n0:40\nSAL KHAN: Oh, 3 there.\n0:41\nAnd so you could get to 9 by literally\n0:43\nmultiplying 3 rows times 3 columns.\n0:47\nBEN EATER: That's right.\n0:48\nSAL KHAN: And you get to 9.\n0:49\nBEN EATER: So 3 is a factor.\n0:51\nSAL KHAN: And then we would write that in this box right\n0:52\nover here.\n0:53\nBEN EATER: Mm-hm.\n0:54\nSAL KHAN: So we'd write 3-- do we have to write 3 twice,\n0:57\nbecause we have-- or is just writing 3 once--\n0:59\nBEN EATER: 3 is the factor--\n1:00\nSAL KHAN: 3 is a factor.\n1:00\nBEN EATER: --so you just put it once.\n1:01\nSAL KHAN: We don't have to write it.\n1:02\nIf we wrote it twice would it be wrong?\n1:04\nBEN EATER: Uh-huh, yes, actually.\n1:05\nSAL KHAN: It would?\n1:05\nOK, so--\n1:05\nBEN EATER: We do mark that wrong.\n1:06\nSAL KHAN: --you actually do mark that wrong.\n1:08\nOK, so there's 3 and 3.\n1:09\nBut there was also, right when you started, you had 9 and 1.\n1:11\nBEN EATER: That's right.\n1:12\nBoth of those are factors.\n1:13\nSAL KHAN: And I don't have to write\n1:14\nthese in any special order?\n1:15\nBEN EATER: No, no.\n1:16\nSAL KHAN: 1 and 9.\n1:17\nBEN EATER: Just got to get them all.\n1:18\nSAL KHAN: And I believe that's all there is.\n1:21\nAnd we could look at the other ones,\n1:22\nand we can see, look 2 and 8 definitely--\n1:25\nBEN EATER: No.\n1:26\nSAL KHAN: No, that's not working out.\n1:28\nIt's interesting for people to think\n1:29\nabout why these aren't working out.\n1:30\nBEN EATER: Right.\n1:31\nYeah, you can't divide 2 into 9.\n1:36\nSAL KHAN: And this just gets us to 1 and 9 again,\n1:38\nand we don't want to repeat it.\n1:39\nBEN EATER: Those are the same factors.\n1:40\nSAL KHAN: Exactly.\n1:40\nSo let's check our answer.\n1:41\nLet's see how we're doing.\n1:42\nBEN EATER: OK.\n1:43\nSAL KHAN: Let's see.\n1:44\nThere we go.\n1:44\nWe got it all right.\n1:45\nLet's do one more.\n1:46\nBEN EATER: OK.\n1:47\nSAL KHAN: Let's do one more.\n1:48\nCorrect.\n1:48\nThe next question.\n1:52\nYou can resize this box with 16 dots\n1:53\nto help you find the factor.\n1:55\nIt's 1 and 16.\n1:56\nBEN EATER: 1 and 16 are factors, sure.\n1:57\nSAL KHAN: So me write those.\n1:58\nBEN EATER: Those are all its factors.\n1:58\nSAL KHAN: So 1 and 16.\n2:00\nSo let's play with this box here.\n2:04\nThat's not working.\n2:05\nThat's not working.\n2:07\nSo I'm trying to figure out-- so this is essentially\n2:10\ngoing 2 times-- 2 might be a factor if I could just--\n2:14\noh look, it is.\n2:15\nBEN EATER: There it is, yeah.\n2:15\n2 is a factor\n2:16\nSAL KHAN: 2 is a factor.\n2:17\nBEN EATER: And so is 8.\n2:18\nSAL KHAN: Exactly, exactly.\n2:19\n2 rows of 8 works.\n2:21\nAnd so we could say 2 and 8 are factors.\n2:24\nBEN EATER: And if you think about it,\n2:26\n2 and 8 both divide into 16.\n2:27\nSAL KHAN: Absolutely.\n2:28\nBEN EATER: 2 divides eight times.\n2:29\nSAL KHAN: Yes.\n2:30\nBEN EATER: Or 8 divides two times.\n2:31\nSAL KHAN: Yes, you can that.\n2:31\nYou can construct.\n2:32\nBEN EATER: Right.\n2:33\nSAL KHAN: 16 dots, you can divide them into 2 groups of 8.\n2:35\nBEN EATER: That's right.\n2:36\nSAL KHAN: And I suspect also 8 groups of 2.\n2:37\nBEN EATER: Well, you can see that.\n2:38\nSAL KHAN: Let's see, so that's 2 groups\n2:40\nof 8, really, or 2 rows of 8.\n2:41\nLet's see, or oh, look at that.\n2:44\n4 times 4.\n2:45\nBEN EATER: 4 times 4.\n2:45\nSAL KHAN: And I'll just write the 4 once.\n2:46\nBEN EATER: So 4 is a factor.\n2:47\nSAL KHAN: 4 is a factor.\n2:49\nAnd then I can-- and I've probably-- well, I've\n2:53\nalready gotten 8 and 2.\n2:54\nBEN EATER: Already got that.\n2:54\nSAL KHAN: Now I have 8 groups of 2 instead of 2 groups of 8,\n2:56\nbut they're still both factors.\n2:58\nThen you go back to 16 and 1.\n2:59\nBEN EATER: That's right.\n3:00\nSAL KHAN: So I think we're done.\n3:01\nBEN EATER: I think so.\n3:01\nSAL KHAN: Let's check our answer.\n3:02\nOh--\n3:02\nBEN EATER: Very good.\n3:03\nSAL KHAN: --very good, very good.\n3:04\nWell, thank you.\n3:04\nThat was fun.\n3:06\nBEN EATER: Thank you.\n3:06\nSAL KHAN:

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nWelcome to the presentation on quadratic inequalities.\n0:05\nBefore we get to quadratic inequalities, let's just start\n0:09\ngraphing some functions and interpret them and then we'll\n0:11\nslowly move to the inequalities.\n0:13\nLet's say I had f of x is equal to x squared plus x minus 6.\n0:26\nWell, if we wanted to figure out where this function\n0:29\nintersects the x-axis or the roots of it, we learned in our\n0:33\nfactoring quadratics that we could just set f of x\n0:35\nis equal to 0, right?\n0:36\nBecause f of x equals 0 when you're intersecting the x-axis.\n0:39\nSo you would say x squared plus x minus 6 is equal to 0.\n0:46\nAnd you just factor this quadratic.\n0:48\nx plus 3 times x minus 2 equals 0.\n0:57\nAnd you would learn that the roots of this quadratic\n1:03\nfunction are x is equal to minus 3, and x is equal to 2.\n1:11\nHow would we visualize this?\n1:13\nWell let's draw this quadratic function.\n1:21\nThose are my very uneven lines.\n1:24\nSo the roots are x is equal to negative 3.\n1:27\nSo this is, right here, x is at minus 3y0 -- by definition one\n1:33\nof the roots is where f of x is equal to 0.\n1:36\nSo the y, or the f of x axis here is 0.\n1:41\nThe coordinate is 0.\n1:42\nAnd this point here is 2 comma 0.\n1:47\nOnce again, this is the x-axis, and this is the f of x-axis.\n1:53\nWe also know that the y intercept is minus 6.\n1:56\nThis isn't the vertex, this is the y intercept.\n1:57\nAnd that the graph is going to look something like this -- not\n2:03\nas bumpy as what I'm drawing, which I think you get the\n2:05\ngeneral idea if you've ever seen a clean parabola.\n2:10\nIt looks like that with x minus 3 here, and x is 2 here.\n2:16\nPretty straightforward.\n2:17\nWe figured out the roots, we figured out what it looks like.\n2:19\nNow what if we, instead of wanting to know where f of x is\n2:22\nequal to 0, which is these two points, what if we wanted\n2:24\nto know where f of x is greater than 0?\n2:29\nWhat x values make f of x greater than 0?\n2:33\nOr another way of saying it, what values make\n2:36\nthe statement true?\n2:37\nx squared plus x minus 6 is greater than 0, Right,\n2:42\nthis is just f of x.\n2:44\nWell if we look at the graph, when is f of x greater than 0?\n2:49\nWell this is the f of x axis, and when are we\n2:52\nin positive territory?\n2:52\nWell f of x is greater than 0 here -- let me draw that\n2:55\nanother color -- is greater than 0 here, right?\n3:00\nBecause it's above the x-axis.\n3:04\nAnd f of x is greater than 0 here.\n3:11\nSo just visually looking at it, what x values make this true?\n3:17\nWell, this is true whenever x is less than minus 3, right, or\n3:23\nwhenever x is greater than 2.\n3:26\nBecause when x is greater than 2, f of x is greater than 0,\n3:31\nand when x is less than negative 3, f of x\n3:35\nis greater than 0.\n3:37\nSo we would say the solution to this quadratic inequality, and\n3:41\nwe pretty much solved this visually, is x is less than\n3:46\nminus 3, or x is greater than 2.\n3:52\nAnd you could test it out.\n3:53\nYou could try out the number minus 4, and you should get f\n3:56\nof x being greater than 0.\n3:58\nYou could try it out here.\n4:00\nOr you could try the number 3 and make sure that this works.\n4:04\nAnd you can just make sure that, you could, for example,\n4:06\ntry out the number 0 and make sure that 0 doesn't work,\n4:10\nright, because 0 is between the two roots.\n4:12\nIt actually turns out that when x is equal to 0, f\n4:15\nof x is minus 6, which is definitely less than 0.\n4:19\nSo I think this will give you a visual intuition of what this\n4:22\nquadratic inequality means.\n4:24\nNow with that visual intuition in the back of your mind, let's\n4:26\ndo some more problems and maybe we won't have to go through the\n4:29\nexercise of drawing it, but maybe I will draw it just to\n4:32\nmake sure that the point hits home.\n4:35\nLet me give you a slightly trickier problem.\n4:37\nLet's say I had minus x squared minus 3x plus 28, let me\n4:49\nsay, is greater than 0.\n4:52\nWell I want to get rid of this negative sign in\n4:53\nfront of the x squared.\n4:54\nI just don't like it there because it makes it look\n4:56\nmore confusing to factor.\n4:58\nI'm going to multiply everything by negative 1.\n5:00\nBoth sides.\n5:00\nI get x squared plus 3x minus 28, and when you multiply or\n5:08\ndivide by a negative, with any inequality you have\n5:10\nto swap the sign.\n5:11\nSo this is now going to be less than 0.\n5:16\nAnd if we were to factor this, we get x plus 7 times x\n5:25\nminus 4 is less than 0.\n5:29\nSo if this was equal to 0, we would know that the two roots\n5:32\nof this function -- let's define the function f of x --\n5:37\nlet's define the function as f of x is equal to -- well we can\n5:40\ndefine it as this or this because they're the same thing.\n5:42\nBut for simplicity let's define it as x plus 7 times x minus 4.\n5:47\nThat's f of x, right?\n5:49\nWell, after factoring it, we know that the roots of this,\n5:53\nthe roots are x is equal to minus 7, and x is equal to 4.\n6:05\nNow what we want to know is what x values make\n6:07\nthis inequality true?\n6:10\nIf this was any equality we'd be done.\n6:12\nBut we want to know what makes this inequality true.\n6:14\nI'll give you a little bit of a trick, it's always going to be\n6:17\nthe numbers in between the two roots or outside\n6:21\nof the two roots.\n6:23\nSo what I do whenever I'm doing this on a test or something, I\n6:25\njust test numbers that are either between the roots or\n6:28\noutside of the two roots.\n6:30\nSo let's pick a number that's between x equals minus\n6:34\n7 and x equals 4.\n6:36\nWell let's try x equals 0.\n6:41\nWell, f of 0 is equal to -- we could do it right here -- f of\n6:46\n0 is 0 plus 7 times 0 minus 4 is just 7 times minus\n6:57\n4, which is minus 28.\n7:00\nSo f of 0 is minus 28.\n7:04\nNow is this -- this is the function we're working with\n7:08\n-- is this less than 0?\n7:11\nWell yeah, it is.\n7:13\nSo it actually turns that a number, an x value between\n7:16\nthe two roots works.\n7:17\nSo actually I immediately know that the answer here\n7:19\nis all of the x's that are between the two roots.\n7:23\nSo we could say that the solution to this is\n7:29\nminus 7 is less than x which is less than 4.\n7:34\nBecause now the other way.\n7:35\nYou could have tried a number that's outside of the roots,\n7:38\neither less than minus 7 or greater than 4 and\n7:41\nhave tried it out.\n7:42\nLet's say if you had tried out 5.\n7:45\nTry x equals 5.\n7:48\nWell then f of 5 would be 12 times 1, right,\n7:55\nwhich is equal to 12.\n7:58\nf of 5 is 12.\n7:59\nIs that less than 0?\n8:02\nNo.\n8:03\nSo that wouldn't have worked.\n8:04\nSo once again, that gives us a confidence that we\n8:06\ngot the right interval.\n8:07\nAnd if we wanted to think about this visually, because we got\n8:11\nthis answer, when you do it visually it actually makes, I\n8:14\nthink, a lot of sense, but maybe I'm biased.\n8:26\nIf you look at it visually it looks like this.\n8:35\nIf you drive visually and this is the parabola, this is f of\n8:40\nx, the roots here are minus 7, 0 and 4, 0, we're saying that\n8:52\nfor all x values between these two numbers, f of\n8:56\nx is less than 0.\n8:57\nAnd that makes sense, because when is f of x less than 0?\n8:59\nWell this is the graph of f of x.\n9:06\nAnd when is f of x less than 0?\n9:07\nRight here.\n9:08\nSo what x values give us that?\n9:10\nWell the x values that give us that are right here.\n9:14\nI hope I'm not confusing you too much with\n9:15\nthese visual graphs.\n9:16\nAnd you're probably saying, well how do I know\n9:19\nI don't include 0?\n9:20\nWell you could try it out, but if you -- oh, well how come\n9:23\nI don't include the roots?\n9:24\nWell at the roots, f of x is equal to 0.\n9:28\nSo if this was this, if this was less than or equal to 0,\n9:31\nthen the answer would be negative 7 is less than\n9:36\nor equal to x is less than or equal to 4.\n9:39\nI hope that gives you a sense.\n9:40\nYou pretty much just have to try number in between the\n9:42\nroots, and try number outside of the roots, and that tells\n9:45\nyou what interval will make the inequality true.\n9:49\nI'll see you in the next presentation.",

I don't like how that looks, I'm going to use the paintbrush.\n0:29\nSo here we go, so that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. So that's one way of representing 7 ninths, we already know that, that's not too interesting.\n0:49\nSo let's see if we can represent it as the sum of other fractions.\n0:53\nSo let's imagine, maybe we can represent it as, let's do it as 2 ninths (let me get another brush here) so let's represent it as 2 ninths.\n1:05\n2 over 9, plus ( I don't know) maybe 3 over 9, but that doesn't quite get us to 7 ninths yet.\n1:20\n2 over 9 plus 3 over 9, that's going to get us to 5 over 9 so we need 2 more, so that's going to be plus another 2 over 9.\n1:28\nPlus another 2/9, so what would this look like? So let's just draw another grid here, so this is going to look like (so I'm going to put it right below it so we can look at what it looks like).\n1:46\nSo we have 2 ninths, this here is 2 ninths well we have nine equal sections.\n1:53\nSo 2 ninths is going to be, 1 and 2.\n2:02\nAnd then we're going to add 3 more ninths, so one, two, three, so we add 3 ninths.\n2:15\nAnd then 2 more ninths, that's 1 and 2.\n2:22\nSo notice, when I added 2 ninths to 3 ninths to 2 ninths, this equals 7 ninths.\n2:30\nAnd we know that when we add a bunch of fractions like this that have the same denominator, we can just add the numerators.\n2:36\nAnd this is why, this is 2/9 and 3/9 and 2/9 and they give me 7/9.\n2:41\nActually, let's do this again, this is a lot of fun. So let me draw my grid again.\n2:48\nAnd then, let's see what we can do. So let me get my pen tool out and make sure my ink isn't too thick.\n3:02\nAnd let's add a couple of ninths. So let's add 1/9 and let's add 2/9 and then we could add (I dunno), maybe we could add 3/9.\n3:22\nAnd then we could add, that won't get us, let's see 1/9. I'm going to try to add 4 fractions here.\n3:30\nSo first I'm going to try to add 1/9 and see where that get's us. 1/9 is going to get us right over here.\n3:37\nSo that's 1/9, so let's say we add 2/9 to that. So that's 1 and 2, so that still doesn't get us there.\n3:56\nSo that's 3/9, 1 plus 2 is 3. So let's add 4 ninths.\n4:05\nSo 4/9. So let's see where this get's us. Actually, why not.\n4:18\nAnd so that's going to get us 1, 2, 3, 4. So that looks like it got us all the way. Because 1+2+4=7 so that's 7/9.\n4:33\nSo what could we put here? We could actually put 0/9. Why not? So we could put in 0/9.\n4:44\nAnd how would we visualize that? Well we're saying none of these. So this is 1/9 plus 2/9 plus 4/9 equals 7/9.\n4:53\nSo these are all different ways to decompose the exact same fraction.",

When x is\n3:04\nequal to 0, y is less than 3.\n3:11\nSo it's all of these points here-- that I'm shading in in\n3:15\ngreen-- satisfy that right there.\n3:19\nIf I were to look at this one over here, when x is negative\n3:22\n1, y is less than negative 1.\n3:26\nSo y has to be all of these points down here.\n3:30\nWhen x is equal to 1, y is less than 7.\n3:36\nSo it's all of these points down here.\n3:39\nAnd in general, you take any point x-- let's say you take\n3:44\nthis point x right there.\n3:47\nIf you evaluate 4x plus 3, you're going to get the point\n3:50\non the line.\n3:52\nThat is that x times 4 plus 3.\n3:55\nNow the y's that satisfy it, it could be equal to that\n3:58\npoint on the line, or it could be less than.\n4:01\nSo it's going to go below the line.\n4:03\nSo if you were to do this for all the possible x's, you\n4:06\nwould not only get all the points on this line which\n4:11\nwe've drawn, you would get all the points below the line.\n4:15\nSo now we have graphed this inequality.\n4:19\nIt's essentially this line, 4x plus 3, with all of the area\n4:23\nbelow it shaded.\n4:25\nNow, if this was just a less than, not less than or equal\n4:29\nsign, we would not include the actual line.\n4:32\nAnd the convention to do that is to actually make the line a\n4:36\ndashed line.\n4:37\nThis is the situation if we were dealing with just less\n4:44\nthan 4x plus 3.\n4:46\nBecause in that situation, this wouldn't apply, and we\n4:49\nwould just have that.\n4:50\nSo the line itself wouldn't have satisfied it, just the\n4:53\narea below it.\n4:55\nLet's do one like that.\n4:57\nSo let's say we have y is greater than negative x\n5:06\nover 2 minus 6.\n5:09\nSo a good way to start-- the way I like to start these\n5:11\nproblems-- is to just graph this equation right here.\n5:14\nSo let me just graph-- just for fun-- let me graph y is\n5:18\nequal to-- this is the same thing as negative 1/2 minus 6.\n5:24\nSo if we were to graph it, that is my vertical axis, that\n5:30\nis my horizontal axis.\n5:34\nAnd our y-intercept is negative 6.\n5:36\nSo 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n5:40\nSo that's my y-intercept.\n5:42\nAnd my slope is negative 1/2.\n5:43\nOh, that should be an x there, negative 1/2 x minus 6.\n5:49\nSo my slope is negative 1/2, which means when I go 2 to the\n5:53\nright, I go down 1.\n5:55\nSo if I go 2 to the right, I'm going to go down 1.\n6:02\nIf I go 2 to the left, if I go negative 2, I'm\n6:05\ngoing to go up 1.\n6:06\nSo negative 2, up 1.\n6:09\nSo my line is going to look like this.\n6:11\nMy line is going to look like that.\n6:15\nThat's my best attempt at drawing the line.\n6:17\nSo that's the line of y is equal to\n6:19\nnegative 1/2 x minus 6.\n6:22\nNow, our inequality is not greater than or equal, it's\n6:24\njust greater than negative x over 2 minus 6, or greater\n6:28\nthan negative 1/2 x minus 6.\n6:30\nSo using the same logic as before, for any x-- so if you\n6:35\ntake any x, let's say that's our particular x we want to\n6:39\npick-- if you evaluate negative x over 2 minus 6,\n6:43\nyou're going to get that point right there.\n6:44\nYou're going to get the point on the line.\n6:47\nBut the y's that satisfy this inequality are the y's\n6:50\ngreater than that.\n6:51\nSo it's going to be not that point-- in fact, you draw an\n6:54\nopen circle there-- because you can't include the point of\n6:58\nnegative 1/2 x minus 6.\n7:00\nBut it's going to be all the y's greater than that.\n7:05\nThat'd be true for any x.\n7:06\nYou take this x.\n7:07\nYou evaluate negative 1/2 or negative x over 2 minus 6,\n7:11\nyou're going to get this point over here.\n7:13\nThe y's that satisfy it are all the y's above that.\n7:19\nSo all of the y's that satisfy this equation, or all of the\n7:22\ncoordinates that satisfy this equation, is this entire area\n7:25\nabove the line.\n7:28\nAnd we're not going to include the line.\n7:30\nSo the convention is to make this line into a dashed line.\n7:33\nAnd let me draw-- I'm trying my best to turn it into a\n7:35\ndashed line.\n7:36\nI'll just erase sections of the line, and hopefully it\n7:41\nwill look dashed to you.\n7:43\nSo I'm turning that solid line into a dashed line to show\n7:45\nthat it's just a boundary, but it's not included in the\n7:48\ncoordinates that satisfy our inequality.\n7:51\nThe coordinates that satisfy our equality are all of this\n7:53\nyellow stuff that I'm shading above the line.\n8:00\nAnyway, hopefully you found that helpful.",

proved it's a second-order reaction,\n0:11\nand we also found the rate constant\n0:14\nat 300 degrees C.\n0:16\nSo in part a, if the initial concentration of\n0:19\nnitrogen dioxide is .008 Molar,\n0:22\nwhat is the concentration of nitrogen dioxide\n0:25\nafter 20 minutes?\n0:27\nWell, we know this is a second-order reaction.\n0:30\nSo we can use our integrated rate law\n0:32\nfor a second-order reaction.\n0:34\nAnd that was one over the concentration of A\n0:38\nminus one over the initial concentration of A\n0:43\nis equal to the rate constant K\n0:45\ntimes the time.\n0:47\nSo this is one form of our integrated rate equation.\n0:51\nNow let's think about what we're gonna plug in here.\n0:53\nWe're trying to solve for the final concentration\n0:57\nof NO2.\n0:58\nSo we're gonna put in here\n0:59\none over the concentration of nitrogen dioxide\n1:03\nat 20 minutes,\n1:05\nright this would be minus\n1:06\none over the initial concentration of nitrogen dioxide,\n1:10\nwhich is .008.\n1:12\nSo we plug that into here.\n1:14\nSo one over .008,\n1:16\nthis is equal to\n1:18\nour rate constant\n1:19\nwhich is .54,\n1:22\nso we have .54,\n1:24\none over Molar times seconds.\n1:28\nAnd then we're gonna multiply that by the time.\n1:32\nNotice we have seconds here,\n1:33\nfor our rate constant we were given minutes.\n1:36\nSo we need to convert minutes to seconds.\n1:39\nSo if you have 20 minutes,\n1:42\nall right we know that there are 60 seconds\n1:45\nfor every one minute.\n1:49\nSo if we multiply, minutes cancels,\n1:51\nand that gives us seconds.\n1:52\nSo 20 times 60 is 1200.\n1:56\nSo we have 1200 seconds.\n2:00\nAll right, so let's go ahead and let's do the math.\n2:03\nSo let's get out the calculator here,\n2:04\nand we'll multiply\n2:06\n.54 by 1200.\n2:10\nAnd so on the right side we have 648.\n2:17\nNotice your units, your seconds would cancel here.\n2:20\nAnd the left, what's one over .008?\n2:24\nSo let's do that.\n2:25\nWhat's one divided by .008?\n2:28\nThat gives us 125.\n2:31\nSo we have 125 here,\n2:34\nand we have our minus,\n2:35\nthis would be one over the concentration of NO2.\n2:40\nAll right so now of course we're just solving\n2:42\nfor the concentration of nitrogen dioxide.\n2:44\nSo one over the concentration of NO2\n2:48\nis equal to 648 plus 125.\n2:52\nAnd that of course, is 773.\n2:56\nSo to solve for the concentration\n2:59\nof nitrogen dioxide,\n3:02\nthat would be one over 773.\n3:06\nSo let's get our calculator out,\n3:07\nand let's do one divided by 773.\n3:12\nAnd so the concentration would be .0013.\n3:17\nSo this is equal to\n3:18\n.0013 Molar.\n3:24\nSo if you start with a concentration of .008 Molar,\n3:30\nthe concentration after 20 minutes\n3:32\ngoes down to .0013 Molar.\n3:37\nAll right, let's move on to part b.\n3:39\nSo in part b, if the initial concentration\n3:42\nof nitrogen dioxide is .008 Molar again,\n3:46\nwhat is the half-life?\n3:47\nSo in the previous video,\n3:48\nwe talked about the equation for the half-life\n3:51\nof a second-order reaction.\n3:53\nAnd we found that the half life for a second-order reaction\n3:56\nis equal to one over the rate constant K,\n3:59\ntimes the initial concentration of A.\n4:03\nAnd so for this case,\n4:05\nthis would be one over the rate constant which is .54,\n4:10\none over Molar times seconds.\n4:13\nAnd then we need to multiply that\n4:15\nby the initial concentration of A,\n4:17\nwhich of course would be the initial concentration\n4:19\nof NO2.\n4:20\nSo that's times\n4:21\n.00800 Molar.\n4:26\nAll right, so let's do that math.\n4:29\nSo we get out our calculator here,\n4:30\nand we take .54 and we multiply that by .008.\n4:36\nSo we get .00432,\n4:41\nand so we take one divided by that,\n4:43\none divided by our answer here\n4:45\nwill get us our half-life.\n4:48\nSo we get 2.3 times ten to the second,\n4:52\nseconds right?\n4:53\nSo this is equal to,\n4:55\nt 1/2 is equal to 2.3\n4:59\ntimes 10 to the second seconds.\n5:03\nOr we could say approximately 230 seconds.\n5:10\nSo if we're going from a concentration of .008,\n5:14\nif we're going from a concentration of .008 Molar,\n5:19\nand we wait approximately 230 seconds,\n5:23\nthe concentration goes down to .004.\n5:26\nSo we have half of our initial concentration\n5:29\nafter one half-life.\n5:31\nAll right, let's compare what we got in b\n5:35\nto what we're gonna get in c.\n5:37\nBecause in c we're changing\n5:38\nthe initial concentration of N02 to .004 Molar.\n5:43\nSo now what's the half-life?\n5:45\nSo the calculation is the same, right?\n5:47\nWe're gonna plug in t 1/2 is equal to one over K,\n5:51\ntimes the initial concentration of A.\n5:54\nThe difference is we're changing the initial concentration.\n5:57\nAll right so K stays the same,\n5:59\nso .54 one over Molar times seconds.\n6:03\nBut now we're gonna plug in .004 instead of .008.\n6:08\nSo we have .004 Molar\n6:12\nand we're solving for the half-life.\n6:15\nSo once again we can get out our calculator here,\n6:17\ntake .54, multiply that by .004,\n6:23\nand then if we take one over our answer\n6:26\nthen we should get our half-life.\n6:28\nSo that's 4.6 times ten to the second.\n6:34\nSo this would be equal to,\n6:37\nso our half life would be equal to\n6:40\n4.6 times ten to the second...\n6:45\nSeconds.\n6:46\nAll right? So this is seconds.\n6:47\nSo I think I forgot to point that out\n6:49\nin the previous example.\n6:50\nIf you're looking at your units,\n6:52\nthe Molar would cancel here,\n6:55\nand so you'd have one over one over seconds.\n6:58\nWhich of course is equal to seconds.\n7:00\nSo the half-life is measured in seconds.\n7:03\nIt'd be the same thing for up here, right?\n7:04\nThe Molars would cancel,\n7:06\nwe'd have one over one over seconds,\n7:09\nso we'd get seconds here.\n7:10\nSo this half-life, 4.6,\n7:12\nlet me just make this look more like a 6,\n7:14\n4.6 times ten to the second,\n7:17\nthat's twice our first half-life.\n7:20\nSo if we're going from a concentration of .004 Molar,\n7:25\nand we wait\n7:28\napproximately 460 seconds,\n7:32\nwe're gonna end up with a concentration of .002 Molar.\n7:37\nSo remember, for a second-order reaction,\n7:40\nthe half-life is not constant.\n7:42\nSo we talked about this in the previous video.\n7:44\nThe half-life for a second order reaction\n7:47\ndepends on the concentration that you're starting with.\n7:50\nAnd so we can see here,\n7:52\nwe're starting with a concentration\n7:55\nthat's half of the first one,\n7:57\nand we can see that our half-life is twice as long.\n8:01\nSo this second half-life here is twice as long\n8:03\nas the first half-life that we talked about for part b.",

if you ask them why is this wrong,\n0:12\nthey'll show up with this kind of line of logic\n0:15\nthat actually seems pretty reasonable.\n0:17\nThey will tell you that, OK, well\n0:19\nlet's just start with negative 1.\n0:21\nWe know from definition that negative 1\n0:23\nis equal to i times i.\n0:26\nEverything seems pretty straightforward right now.\n0:28\nAnd then they'll say, well look, if you\n0:30\ntake this, if you assume this part right here,\n0:33\nthen we can replace each of these i's with the square root\n0:36\nof negative 1.\n0:36\nAnd they'd be right.\n0:37\nSo then this would be the same thing\n0:39\nas the square root of negative 1 times the square root\n0:42\nof negative 1.\n0:43\nAnd then they would tell you that,\n0:45\nhey, look just from straight up properties\n0:48\nof the principal square root function,\n0:50\nthey'll tell you that the square root of a times b\n0:53\nis the same thing as the principal square root\n0:55\nof a times the principal square root of b.\n0:58\nAnd so if you have the principal square root of a times\n1:01\nthe principal square root of b, that's\n1:02\nthe same thing as the square root of a times b.\n1:04\nSo based on this property of the radical of the principal root,\n1:09\nthey'll say that this over here is\n1:11\nthe same thing as the square root\n1:13\nof negative 1 times negative 1.\n1:20\nIf I have the principal root of the product of two things,\n1:23\nthat's the same thing as the product\n1:24\nof each of their principal roots.\n1:26\nI'm doing this in the other order here.\n1:28\nHere I have the principal root of the products,\n1:30\nover here I have this on the right.\n1:32\nAnd then from that we all know that negative 1 times\n1:35\nnegative 1 is 1.\n1:36\nSo this should be equal to the principal square root of 1.\n1:41\nAnd then the principal square root of 1-- Remember,\n1:44\nthis radical means principal square root,\n1:45\npositive square root, that is just going to be positive 1.\n1:51\nAnd they'll say, this is wrong.\n1:52\nClearly, negative 1 and positive 1 are not the same thing.\n1:59\nAnd they'll argue therefore, you can't make this substitution\n2:02\nthat we did in this step.\n2:04\nAnd what you should then point out\n2:06\nis that this was not the incorrect step.\n2:09\nThat it is true negative 1 is not equal to 1,\n2:11\nbut the faulty line of reasoning here\n2:13\nwas in using this property when both a and b are negative.\n2:21\nIf both a and b are negative, this will never be true.\n2:26\nSo a and b both cannot be negative.\n2:36\nIn fact normally when this property is given-- sometimes\n2:38\nit's given a little bit in the footnotes\n2:40\nor you might not even notice it because it's not relevant\n2:42\nwhen you're learning it the first time--\n2:43\nbut they'll usually give a little bit of a constraint\n2:45\nthere.\n2:45\nThey'll usually say for a and b greater than or equal to 0.\n2:52\nSo that's where they list this property.\n2:53\nThis is true for a and b greater than or equal 0.\n2:56\nAnd in particular, it's false if both a and b are both,\n3:00\nif they are both negative.\n3:03\nNow, I've just spent the last three minutes\n3:07\nsaying that people who tell you that this is wrong are wrong.\n3:11\nBut with that said, I will say that you\n3:12\nhave to be a little bit careful about it.\n3:16\nWhen we take traditional principal square roots.\n3:19\nSo when you take the principle square root of 4.\n3:22\nWe know that this is positive 2, that 4 actually\n3:24\nhas two square roots.\n3:26\nThere's negative 2 also is a square root of 4.\n3:34\nIf you have negative 2 times negative 2\n3:36\nit's also equal to 4.\n3:38\nThis radical symbol here means principal square root.\n3:42\nOr when we're just dealing with real numbers, non\n3:44\nimaginary, non complex numbers, you\n3:46\ncould really view it as the positive square root.\n3:48\nThis has two square roots, positive and negative 2.\n3:50\nIf you have this radical symbol right here\n3:52\nprincipal square roots, it means the positive square root of 2.\n3:57\nSo when you start thinking about taking\n3:59\nsquare roots of negative numbers--\n4:01\nor even in the future we'll do imaginary numbers\n4:03\nand complex numbers and all the rest--\n4:05\nyou have to expand the definition\n4:07\nof what this radical means.\n4:08\nSo when you are taking the square root of really\n4:12\nof any negative number, you're really\n4:16\nsaying that this is no longer the traditional principal\n4:19\nsquare root function.\n4:20\nYou're now talking that this is the principal complex square\n4:24\nroot function, or this is now defined\n4:25\nfor complex inputs or the domain,\n4:28\nit can also generate imaginary or complex outputs,\n4:31\nor I guess you could call that the range.\n4:34\nAnd if you assume that, then really straight\n4:36\nfrom this you get that negative, the square root of negative x\n4:42\nis going to be equal to i times the square root of x.\n4:47\nAnd this is only-- and I'm going to make this clear\n4:49\nbecause I just told you that this will be false\n4:51\nif both a and b are negative.\n4:52\nSo this is only true-- So we could\n4:55\napply this when x is greater than or equal to 0.\n5:06\nSo if x is greater than or equal to 0,\n5:08\nthen negative x is clearly a negative number,\n5:10\nor I guess it could also be 0.\n5:12\nIt's a negative number.\n5:13\nAnd then we can apply this right over here.\n5:16\nIf x was less than 0, then we would\n5:18\nbe doing all of this nonsense up here.\n5:20\nAnd we start to get nonsensical answers.\n5:23\nAnd if you look at it this way and you say hey,\n5:25\nlook, i can be the square root of negative one,\n5:27\nif it's the principal branch of the complex square root\n5:30\nfunction.\n5:31\nThen you could rewrite this right over here\n5:33\nas the square root of negative 1 times the square root of x.\n5:41\nAnd so really the real fault in this logic when people\n5:45\nsay, hey, negative 1 can't be equal to 1,\n5:48\nthe real fault is using this property\n5:52\nwhen both a and b, where both of these are negative numbers.\n5:57\nThat will come up with something that is unambiguously false.\n6:00\nIf you expand your definition of the complex\n6:03\nor expand your definition of the principal root\n6:05\nto include negative numbers in the domain\n6:09\nand to include imaginary numbers, then you can do this.\n6:13\nYou can say the square root of negative x\n6:16\nis the square root of negative 1 times--\n6:19\nOr you should say the principal square root of negative x--\n6:22\nI should be particular my words--\n6:23\nis the same thing as the principal square root\n6:26\nof negative 1 times the principal square root of x when\n6:30\nx is greater than or equal to 0.\n6:32\nAnd I don't want to confuse you, if x\n6:34\nis greater than or equal to 0, this negative x, that\n6:39\nis clearly a negative, or I guess\n6:41\nyou should say a non positive number.",

problems.\n0:07\nAnd so if you have 4 goes into 2,292.\n0:17\nAnd I don't know exactly why they call it long division,\n0:20\nand we saw this in the last video a little bit.\n0:23\nI didn't call it long division then, but I think the reason\n0:26\nwhy is it takes you a long time or it takes a long\n0:30\npiece of your paper.\n0:31\nAs you go along, you kind of have this thing, this long tail\n0:36\nthat develops on the problem.\n0:37\nSo all of those are, at least, reasons in my head why\n0:39\nit's called long division.\n0:41\nBut we saw in the last video there's a way to tackle any\n0:43\ndivision problem while just knowing your multiplication\n0:46\ntables up to maybe 10 times 10 or 12 times 12.\n0:49\nBut just as a bit of review, this is the same thing\n0:52\nas 2,292 divided by 4.\n0:58\nAnd it's actually the same thing, and you probably haven't\n0:59\nseen this notation before, as 2,292 divided by 4.\n1:07\nThis, this, and this are all equivalent statements\n1:10\non some level.\n1:12\nAnd you could say, hey Sal, that looks like a fraction\n1:14\nin case you have seen fractions already.\n1:17\nAnd that is exactly what it is.\n1:18\nIt is a fraction.\n1:20\nBut anyway, I'll just focus on this format and in future\n1:22\nvideos we'll think about other ways to represent division.\n1:26\nSo let's do this problem.\n1:28\nSo 4 goes into 2 how many times?\n1:31\nIt goes into 2 no times, so let's move on to-- let\n1:34\nme just switch colors.\n1:35\nSo let's move on to the 22.\n1:37\n4 goes into 22 how many times?\n1:40\nLet's see.\n1:40\n4 times 5 is equal to 20.\n1:45\n4 times 6 is equal to 24.\n1:49\nSo 6 is too much.\n1:51\nSo 4 goes into 22 five times.\n1:55\n5 times 4 is 20.\n1:58\nThere's going to be a little bit of a leftover.\n2:00\nAnd then we subtract 22 minus 20.\n2:03\nWell that's just 2.\n2:05\nAnd then you bring down this 9.\n2:08\nAnd you saw in the last video exactly what this means.\n2:11\nWhen you wrote this 5 up here-- notice we wrote\n2:13\nin the 100's place.\n2:13\nSo this is really a 500.\n2:15\nBut in this video I'm just going to focus more on the\n2:17\nprocess, and you can think more about what it actually means\n2:19\nin terms of where I'm writing the numbers.\n2:21\nBut I think the process is going to be crystal\n2:23\nclear hopefully, by the end of this video.\n2:25\nSo we brought down the 9.\n2:27\n4 goes into 29 how many times?\n2:29\nIt goes into at least six times.\n2:31\nWhat's 4 times 7?\n2:32\n4 times 7 is 28.\n2:34\nSo it goes into it at least seven times.\n2:36\nWhat's 4 times 8?\n2:38\n4 times 8 is 32, so it can't go into it eight times so it's\n2:41\ngoing to go into it seven.\n2:43\n4 goes into 29 nine seven times.\n2:46\n7 times 4 is 28.\n2:49\n29 minus 28 to get our remainder for this step\n2:53\nin the problem is 1.\n2:56\nAnd now we're going to bring down this 2.\n2:59\nWe're going to bring it down and you get a 12.\n3:03\n4 goes into 12?\n3:04\nThat's easy.\n3:05\n4 times 3 is 12.\n3:06\n4 goes into 12 three times.\n3:09\n3 times 4 is 12.\n3:11\n12 minus 12 is 0.\n3:13\nWe have no remainder.\n3:14\nSo 4 goes into 2,292 exactly 573 times.\n3:20\nSo this 2,292 divided by 4 we can say is equal to 573.\n3:26\nOr we could say that this thing right here is equal to 573.\n3:32\nLet's do a couple of more.\n3:34\nLet's do a few more problems.\n3:39\nSo I'll do that red color.\n3:40\nLet's say we had 7 going into 6,475.\n3:50\nMaybe it's called long division because you write it nice and\n3:53\nlong up here and you have this line.\n3:54\nI don't know.\n3:55\nThere's multiple reasons why it could be called long division.\n3:58\nSo you say 7 goes into 6 zero times.\n4:00\nSo we need to keep moving forward.\n4:03\nSo then we go to 64.\n4:06\n7 goes into 64 how many times?\n4:09\nLet's see.\n4:11\n7 times 7 is?\n4:15\nWell, that's way too small.\n4:16\nLet me think about it a little bit.\n4:18\nWell 7 times 9 is 63.\n4:20\nThat's pretty close.\n4:21\nAnd then 6 times 10 is going to be too big.\n4:23\n7 times 10 is 70.\n4:25\nSo that's too big.\n4:26\nSo 7 goes into 64 nine times.\n4:29\n9 times 7 is 63.\n4:32\n64 minus 63 to get our remainder of this stage 1.\n4:38\nBring down the 7.\n4:41\n7 goes into 17 how many times?\n4:43\nWell, 7 times 2 is 14.\n4:45\nAnd then 7 times 3 is 21.\n4:47\nSo 3 is too big.\n4:48\nSo 7 goes into 17 two times.\n4:51\n2 times 7 is 14.\n4:54\n17 minus 14 is 3.\n4:57\nAnd now we bring down the 5.\n5:03\nAnd 7 goes into 35?\n5:05\nThat's in our 7 multiplication tables, five times.\n5:07\n5 times 7 is 35.\n5:14\nAnd there you go.\n5:15\nSo the remainder is zero.\n5:17\nSo all the examples I did so far had no remainders.\n5:20\nLet's do one that maybe might have a remainder.\n5:22\nAnd to ensure it has a remainder I'll just\n5:23\nmake up the problem.\n5:24\nIt's much easier to make problems that have remainders\n5:27\nthan the ones that don't have remainders.\n5:29\nSo let's say I want to divide 3 into-- I'm going to divide it\n5:38\ninto, let's say 1,735,092.\n5:47\nThis will be a nice, beastly problem.\n5:49\nSo if we can do this we can handle everything.\n5:50\nSo it's 1,735,092.\n5:54\nThat's what we're dividing 3 into.\n5:58\nAnd actually, I'm not sure if this will have a remainder.\n6:00\nIn the future video I'll show you how to figure out whether\n6:04\nsomething is divisible by 3.\n6:06\nActually, we can do it right now.\n6:07\nWe can just add up all these digits.\n6:08\n1 plus 7 is 8.\n6:10\n8 plus 3 is 11.\n6:13\n11 5 five is 16.\n6:15\n16 plus 9 is 25.\n6:20\n25 plus 2 is 27.\n6:22\nSo actually, this number is divisible by 3.\n6:24\nSo if you add up all of the digits, you get 27.\n6:27\nAnd then you can add up those digits-- 2 plus 7 is 9.\n6:30\nSo that is divisible by 9.\n6:32\nThat's a trick that only works for 3.\n6:34\nSo this number actually is divisible by 3.\n6:35\nSo let me change it a little bit, so it's\n6:37\nnot divisible by 3.\n6:41\nLet me make this into a 1.\n6:44\nNow this number will not be divisible by 3.\n6:47\nI definitely want a number where I'll end\n6:49\nup with a remainder.\n6:50\nJust so you see what it looks like.\n6:53\nSo let's do this one.\n6:54\n3 goes into 1 zero times.\n6:57\nSo we can just move forward.\n6:57\nYou could write a 0 here and multiply that out, but that\n7:01\njust makes it a little bit messy in my head.\n7:03\nSo we just move one to the right.\n7:04\n3 goes into 17 how many times?\n7:06\nWell, 3 times 5 is equal to 15.\n7:11\nAnd 3 times 6 is equal to 18 and that's too big.\n7:13\nSo 3 goes into 17 right here five times.\n7:18\n5 times 3 is 15.\n7:20\nAnd we subtract.\n7:22\n17 minus 15 is 2.\n7:27\nAnd now we bring down this 3.\n7:31\n3 goes into 23 how many times?\n7:33\nWell, 3 times 7 is equal to 21.\n7:36\nAnd 3 times 8 is too big.\n7:38\nThat's equal to 24.\n7:40\nSo 3 goes into 23 seven times.\n7:44\n7 times 3 is 21.\n7:46\nThen we subtract.\n7:47\n23 minus 21 is 2.\n7:51\nNow we bring down the next number.\n7:53\nWe bring down the 5.\n7:54\nI think you can appreciate why it's called long division now.\n7:57\nWe bring down this 5.\n8:00\n3 goes into 25 how many times?\n8:02\nWell, 3 times 8 gets you pretty close and 3 times 9 is too big.\n8:06\nSo it goes into it eight times.\n8:08\n8 times 3 is 24.\n8:10\nI'm going to run out of space.\n8:12\nYou subtract, you get 1.\n8:14\n25 minus 24 is 1.\n8:16\nNow we can bring down this 0.\n8:23\nAnd you get 3 goes into 10 how many times?\n8:25\nThat's easy.\n8:25\nIt goes into it three times.\n8:26\n3 times 3 is 9.\n8:28\nThat's about as close to 10 as we can get.\n8:30\n3 times 3 is 9.\n8:32\n10 minus 9, I'm going to have to scroll up and\n8:34\ndown here a little bit.\n8:36\n10 minus 9 is 1, and then we can bring down the next number.\n8:39\nI'm running out of colors.\n8:41\nI can bring down that 9.\n8:44\n3 goes into 19 how many times?\n8:46\nWell, 6 is about as close as we can get.\n8:48\nThat gets us to 18.\n8:51\n3 goes into 19 six times.\n8:53\n6 times 3-- let me scroll down.\n8:56\n6 times 3 is 18.\n8:59\n19 minus 18-- we subtract it up here too.\n9:01\n19 minus 18 is 1 and then we're almost done.\n9:04\nI can revert back to the pink.\n9:06\nWe bring down this 1 right there.\n9:09\n3 goes into 11 how many times?\n9:11\nWell, that's three times because 3 times 4 is too big.\n9:15\n3 times 4 is 12, so that's too big.\n9:17\nSo it goes into it three times.\n9:18\nSo 3 goes into 11 three times.\n9:22\n3 times 3 is 9.\n9:26\nAnd then we subtract and we get a 2.\n9:30\nAnd there's nothing left to bring down.\n9:32\nWhen we look up here there's nothing left to bring\n9:34\ndown, so we're done.\n9:35\nSo we're left with the remainder of 2 after doing\n9:38\nthis entire problem.\n9:40\nSo the answer, 3 goes into 1,735,091-- it goes into\n9:46\nit 578,363 remainder 2.\n9:52\nAnd that remainder 2 was what we got all the way down there.\n9:57\nSo hopefully you now appreciate and you can tackle pretty\n9:59\nmuch any division problem.\n10:01\nAnd you also, through this exercise, can appreciate

experiments\n0:09\nas if it were a particle.\n0:10\nSo, for instance, there was an experiment done\n0:13\ncalled the photoelectric effect,\n0:15\nwhere, if you shine light at a metal,\n0:17\nit'll knock electrons out of the metal\n0:19\nif that light has sufficient energy,\n0:22\nbut if you tried to explain this using wave mechanics,\n0:25\nyou get the wrong result.\n0:26\nAnd it was only by resorting to a description of light\n0:29\nas if it could only deliver energy in discrete packets\n0:33\nthat Einstein was able to describe\n0:35\nhow this photoelectric effect worked,\n0:37\nand predict the results\n0:39\nthat they actually measure in the lab.\n0:41\nIn other words, light was only giving energy\n0:44\nin certain bunches,\n0:46\nequal to something called planks constant,\n0:48\nmultiplied by the frequency of the light.\n0:51\nIt either gave all of this energy to the electron,\n0:53\nor it gave none of the energy to the electron.\n0:55\nIt was never half and half.\n0:57\nIt never gave half of this energy,\n0:59\nit was sort of all or nothing.\n1:00\nBut this was confusing to people.\n1:02\n'Cause we thought we had established\n1:04\nthat light was a wave,\n1:05\nand we thought that because if you shine light\n1:07\nthrough a double slit,\n1:08\nif it were a particle,\n1:10\nif light were just a bunch of particles,\n1:12\nyou would expect particles\n1:13\nto just either go through the top hole\n1:15\nand give you a bright spot right here,\n1:17\nor go through the bottom hole,\n1:18\ngive you a bright spot right here,\n1:20\nbut what we actually measure\n1:21\nwhen you do this experiment with light,\n1:23\nis that the light seemingly diffracts from both holes,\n1:27\noverlaps, and it gives you\n1:28\na diffraction pattern on the screen.\n1:31\nSo instead of just two bright spots,\n1:33\nit gives you this constructive and destructive pattern\n1:36\nthat would only emerge if the light beam\n1:39\nwere passing through both slits,\n1:41\nand then overlapping, the way waves would,\n1:43\nout of two holes on this other side of the double slit.\n1:47\nSo this experiment showed that light behaved like a wave,\n1:50\nbut the photoelectric effect showed\n1:52\nthat light behaved more like a particle,\n1:54\nand this kept happening.\n1:55\nYou kept discovering different experiments\n1:57\nthat showed particle-like behavior,\n1:59\nor different experiments\n2:00\nthat showed wave-like behavior for light.\n2:02\nFinally, physicists resigned to the fact\n2:04\nthat light can seemingly have particle-like properties,\n2:08\nand wave-length properties,\n2:10\ndepending on the experiment being conducted.\n2:12\nSo that's where things sat when in 1924,\n2:16\na young French physicist, a brilliant young physicist,\n2:19\nnamed Louis de Broglie,\n2:21\nnow, it looks like you pronounce this \"Louis de Broe-glee\",\n2:25\nand that's what I always said.\n2:26\nI always read this and I said \"de Broe-glee\" in my mind,\n2:29\nand I knew that wasn't right.\n2:30\nIf you look it up, it's more like \"Louis de Broy\",\n2:33\nso get rid of all that, replace it with a \"y\" in your mind,\n2:36\nLouis de Broglie, in 1924, wrote a paper,\n2:39\nand he did something no one else was doing.\n2:41\nEveryone else was worried about light,\n2:43\nand light behaving like a particle or a wave,\n2:46\ndepending on the experiment;\n2:47\nLouis de Broglie said this, \"What about the electron?\n2:50\n\"You got this electron flying off here,\"\n2:52\nhe said, \"if light, which we thought was a wave,\n2:55\n\"can act like a particle,\n2:57\n\"maybe electrons, which we thought were particles,\n3:00\n\"can act like a wave.\"\n3:02\nIn other words, maybe they have a wavelength\n3:03\nassociated with them.\n3:05\nHe was trying to synthesize these ideas\n3:07\ninto one over arching framework\n3:10\nin which you could describe both quanta of light,\n3:13\ni.e. particles of light, and particles,\n3:16\nwhich we thought were just particles,\n3:18\nbut maybe they can behave like waves as well.\n3:20\nSo maybe, he was saying, everything in the universe\n3:23\ncan behave like a particle or a wave,\n3:25\ndepending on the experiment that's being conducted.\n3:28\nAnd he set out to figure out what would this wavelength be,\n3:31\nhe figured it out, it's called the \"de Broe-lee\" wavelength,\n3:34\noh, I reverted, sorry,\n3:36\n\"de Broy\" wavelength, not the \"de Broe-glee\" wavelength.\n3:40\nThe de Broglie wavelength, he figured it out,\n3:43\nand he realized it was this.\n3:44\nSo, he actually postulated it.\n3:46\nHe didn't really prove this.\n3:48\nHe motivated the idea,\n3:49\nand then it was up to experimentalists to try this out.\n3:52\nSo he said that the wavelength associated\n3:54\nwith things that we thought were matter,\n3:56\nso sometimes these were called matter waves,\n3:59\nbut the wavelength of, say, an electron,\n4:01\nis gonna be equal to Planck's constant,\n4:04\ndivided by the momentum of that electron.\n4:07\nAnd so, why did he say this?\n4:09\nWhy did he pick Planck's constant,\n4:11\nwhich, by the way,\n4:12\nif you're not familiar with Planck's constant,\n4:14\nit is like the name suggests, just a constant,\n4:17\nand it's always the same value,\n4:18\nit's 6.626 times 10,\n4:22\nto the negative 34th joule seconds.\n4:26\nIt's really small.\n4:28\nThis was a constant discovered in other experiments,\n4:31\nlike this photoelectric effect,\n4:33\nand the original blackbody experiments\n4:35\nthat Planck was dealing with.\n4:37\nIt's called Planck's constant,\n4:38\nit shows up all around modern physics and quantum mechanics.\n4:42\nSo how did Louis de Broglie even come up with this?\n4:44\nWhy Planck's constant over the momentum?\n4:47\nWell, people already knew for light,\n4:50\nthat the wavelength of a light ray\n4:52\nis gonna also equal Planck's constant,\n4:54\ndivided by the momentum of the photons in that light ray.\n4:59\nSo the name for these particles of light are called photons.\n5:03\nI'm drawing them localized in space here,\n5:05\nbut don't necessarily think about it that way.\n5:08\nThink about it just in terms of,\n5:10\nthey only deposit their energy in bunches.\n5:12\nThey don't necessarily have to be\n5:14\nat a particular point at a particular time.\n5:17\nThis is a little misleading, this picture here,\n5:19\nI'm just not sure how else to represent this idea\n5:22\nin a picture that they only deposit\n5:24\ntheir energies in bunches.\n5:26\nSo this is a very loose drawing,\n5:28\ndon't take this too seriously here.\n5:30\nBut people had already discovered\n5:31\nthis relationship for photons.\n5:34\nAnd that might bother you, you might be like,\n5:35\n\"Wait a minute, how in the world can photons have momentum?\n5:40\n\"They don't have any mass.\n5:41\n\"I know momentum is just m times v,\n5:44\n\"if the mass of light is zero,\n5:46\n\"doesn't that mean the momentum always has to be zero?\n5:49\n\"Wouldn't that make this wavelength infinite?\"\n5:51\nAnd if we were dealing with classical mechanics,\n5:53\nthat would be right,\n5:54\nbut it turns out, this is not true\n5:57\nwhen you travel near the speed of light.\n5:59\nBecause parallel to all these\n6:01\ndiscoveries in quantum physics,\n6:03\nEinstein realized that this was actually not true\n6:06\nwhen things traveled near the speed of light.\n6:08\nThe actual relationship, I'll just show you,\n6:10\nit looks like this.\n6:11\nThe actual relationship is that the energy squared,\n6:14\nis gonna equal the rest mass squared,\n6:17\ntimes the speed of light to the fourth,\n6:19\nplus the momentum of the particles squared,\n6:22\ntimes the speed of light squared.\n6:23\nThis is the better relationship that shows you\n6:26\nhow to relate momentum and energy.\n6:28\nThis is true in special relativity,\n6:30\nand using this, you can get this formula\n6:33\nfor the wavelength of light in terms of its momentum.\n6:36\nIt's not even that hard.\n6:37\nIn fact, I'll show you here, it only takes a second.\n6:39\nLight has no rest mass, we know that,\n6:41\nlight has no rest mass, so this term is zero.\n6:44\nWe've got a formula for the energy of light,\n6:46\nit's just h times f.\n6:48\nSo e squared is just gonna be h squared times f squared,\n6:51\nthe frequency of the light squared,\n6:53\nso that equals the momentum of the light squared,\n6:56\ntimes the speed of light squared,\n6:57\nI could take the square root of both sides now\n6:59\nand get rid of all these squares,\n7:01\nand I get hf equals momentum times c,\n7:04\nif I rearrange this, and get h over p on the left hand side,\n7:09\nif I divide both sides by momentum,\n7:11\nand then divide both sides by frequency,\n7:13\nI get h over the momentum\n7:15\nis equal to the speed of light over the frequency,\n7:18\nbut the speed of light over the frequency\n7:20\nis just the wavelength.\n7:21\nAnd we know that, because the speed of a wave\n7:23\nis wavelength times frequency,\n7:25\nso if you solve for the wavelength,\n7:27\nyou get the speed of the wave over the frequency,\n7:29\nand for light, the speed of the wave is the speed of light.\n7:32\nSo c over frequency is just wavelength.\n7:34\nThat is just this relationship right here.\n7:36\nSo people knew about this.\n7:39\nAnd de Broglie suggested, hypothesized,\n7:41\nthat maybe the same relationship works\n7:44\nfor these matter particles like electrons, or protons,\n7:48\nor neutrons, or things that we thought were particles,\n7:51\nmaybe they also can have a wavelength.\n7:53\nAnd you still might not be satisfied,\n7:55\nyou might be like, \"What, what does that even mean,\n7:57\n\"that a particle can have a wavelength?\"\n8:00\nThat's hard to even comprehend.\n8:01\nHow would you even test that?\n8:03\nWell, you'd test it the same way you test\n8:05\nwhether photons and light can have a wavelength.\n8:08\nYou subject them to an experiment\n8:10\nthat would expose the wave-like properties,\n8:12\ni.e., just take these electrons,\n8:15\nshoot them through the double slit.\n8:17\nSo, if light can exhibit wave-like behavior\n8:20\nwhen we shoot it through a double slit,\n8:22\nthen the electrons, if they also have a wavelength\n8:24\nand wave-like behavior,\n8:26\nthey should also demonstrate wave-like behavior\n8:29\nwhen we shoot them through the double slit.\n8:30\nAnd that's what people did.\n8:31\nThere was an experiment by Davisson and Germer,\n8:34\nthey took electrons, they shot them through a double slit.\n8:37\nIf the electrons just created two bright electron splotches\n8:41\nright behind the holes, you would've known that,\n8:43\n\"Okay, that's not wave-like.\n8:46\n\"These are just flat out particles, de Broglie was wrong.\"\n8:49\nBut that's not what they discovered.\n8:51\nDavisson and Germer did this experiment,\n8:53\nand it's a little harder,\n8:55\nthe wavelength of these electrons are really small.\n8:58\nSo you've gotta use atomic structure\n9:00\nto create this double slit.\n9:02\nIt's difficult, you should look it up, it's interesting.\n9:04\nPeople still use this, it's called electron diffraction.\n9:06\nBut long story short, they did the experiment.\n9:09\nThey shot electrons through here,\n9:11\nguess what they got?\n9:12\nThey got wave-like behavior.\n9:13\nThey got this diffraction pattern on the other side.\n9:16\nAnd when they discovered that,\n9:17\nde Broglie won his Nobel Prize,\n9:19\n'cause it showed that he was right.\n9:22\nMatter particles can have wavelength,\n9:24\nand they can exhibit wave-like behavior,\n9:27\njust like light can,\n9:29\nwhich was a beautiful synthesis between\n9:31\ntwo separate realms of physics, matter and light.\n9:34\nTurns out they weren't so different after all.\n9:37\nNow, sometimes, de Broglie is given sort of a bum rap.\n9:40\nPeople say, \"Wait a minute, all he did\n9:43\n\"was take this equation that people already knew about,\n9:46\n\"and just restate it for matter particles?\"\n9:49\nAnd no, that's not all he did.\n9:50\nIf you go back and look at his paper, I suggest you do,\n9:53\nhe did a lot more than that.\n9:55\nThe paper's impressive, it's an impressive paper,\n9:57\nand it's written beautifully.\n9:59\nHe did much more than this,\n10:00\nbut this is sort of the thing\n10:02\npeople most readily recognize him for.\n10:04\nAnd to emphasize the importance of this,\n10:06\nbefore this point, people had lots of ideas\n10:09\nand formulas in quantum mechanics\n10:11\nthat they didn't completely understand.\n10:13\nAfter this point, after this pivot,\n10:15\nwhere we started to view matter particles as being waves,\n10:19\nprevious formulas that worked,\n10:22\nfor reasons we didn't understand, could now be proven.\n10:25\nIn other words, you could take this formula\n10:27\nand idea from de Broglie,\n10:29\nand show why Bohr's atomic model actually works.\n10:33\nAnd shortly after de Broglie's paper,\n10:35\nSchrodinger came around and basically\n10:37\nset the stage for the entire rest of quantum physics.\n10:41\nAnd his work was heavily influenced\n10:43\nby the ideas of Louis de Broglie.\n10:46\nSo recapping, light can have\n10:47\nparticle-like or wave-like properties,\n10:49\ndepending on the experiment,\n10:51\nand so can electrons.\n10:53\nThe wavelength associated with these electrons,\n10:55\nor any matter particle,\n10:57\ncan be found by taking Planck's constant,\n10:59\ndivided by the momentum of that matter particle.\n11:02\nAnd this wavelength can be tested in experiments,\n11:05\nwhere electrons exhibit wave-like behavior,\n11:07\nand this formula accurately represents the wavelength\n11:10\nthat would be associated with the diffraction pattern\n11:13\nthat emerges from that wave-like behavior.",

I can now afford a better car!\n3:49\nWhy should I you know,\n3:51\nthis is not safe\n3:52\nmaybe or not as safe as the other cars,\n3:53\nand I want to impress my friends\n3:56\nfrom high school and all that,\n3:57\nso something very strange might happen for this car,\n4:00\nthe demand for this car.\n4:02\nIt actually will decrease\n4:04\nso the whole curve could shift to the left.\n4:11\nSo income is a very strange thing for this good\n4:14\nbecause income increasing maybe people say,\n4:16\nhey you know what,\n4:17\nI could trade out of this good\n4:18\nI could get a good that\n4:19\nI'd rather have than just getting more of this thing right over here\n4:23\nDemand went down.\n4:24\nAnd goods like this, we call them inferior goods.\n4:30\nAnd the general way to think about\n4:32\ninferior goods are the goods\n4:33\nthat people will want to not own if they had more money\n4:36\nthey would want to buy, I guess, less inferior goods.\n4:39\nOr another way to think about it is,\n4:41\nif income were to go down,\n4:45\nand more people are budget strapped\n4:46\nand they can't afford\n4:47\nthe Mercedes-Benz or the BMW\n4:49\nor even the mid-sized sedan anymore,\n4:51\nso if income were to go down\n4:52\nand things were getting tighter,\n4:54\nmore people would want this car\n4:56\nmore people would have to trade down to this\n4:57\nbecause they're strapped,\n4:59\nthey're tightening their belts\n5:00\nand so you'll have this strange situation\n5:04\nwhere if income goes down,\n5:06\ndemand would go up for this thing\n5:09\nSo income goes down,\n5:12\ndemand goes up.\n5:13\nRemember, we're talking about demand,\n5:15\nwe're talking about the entire shifting of the curve.\n5:17\nAt any given price point,\n5:18\nthe quantity demanded will go up.\n5:21\nBecause, this is, or we're assuming,\n5:23\nis the cheapest car on the market.\n5:27\nSo, and likewise,\n5:28\nif income were to go down for a normal good,\n5:30\nit'll do what you'll expect,\n5:31\ndemand would go down.\n5:32\nSo this, an inferior good,\n5:33\ndoes the opposite of a normal good\n5:35\nwhen we're talking about the income effect,\n5:40\nthe inferior good will do the opposite of a normal good\n5:44\nand that's because people want to trade out of it\n5:46\nwhen their income goes up\n5:47\nor they don't want to buy it\n5:48\nor they want to buy something nicer.\n5:49\nAnd when their income goes down,\n5:50\nthey'll say\n5:51\nI have to buy this thing,\n5:52\nso you know, let me just do it.",

The hypotenuse\n2:05\nis always going to be the longest side a triangle\n2:07\nD squared plus whatever length this squared, is\n2:10\ngoing to be equal to this length squared. So hopefully\n2:14\nthat at least gives you a decent sense why dropping\n2:16\nthe perpendicular will always give you the shortest\n2:20\ndistance between a point and a line, and that unique\n2:22\nshortest distance is what we call the distance\n2:25\nbetween a point and a line. Now with that out of the way,\n2:28\nlet's think a little bit about angle bisectors.\n2:31\nSo let me draw an angle here, so let me, draw an angle.\n2:38\nSo lets call this point, let me do it in a different color,\n2:42\nlet's call that point A, lets call this point B,\n2:44\nand let's call this point C right over here.\n2:47\nAnd an angle bisector is essentially line, or a segment,\n2:50\nor a ray that splits an angle into two equal angles\n2:53\nand we've talked about this before,\n2:56\nso for example if we want to bisect angle ABC,\n2:59\nso this angle right over here, we want to split it\n3:01\nin two, we are going to -I can draw a better version\n3:05\nof that, we want to split it in two, we want to split it in two\n3:09\nlike, let me draw a little bit better, my drawing\n3:13\nstill doesn't look like, that looks decent, alright,\n3:17\nso lets call this point right over here D,\n3:23\nand again we could even say that, that's a ray,\n3:25\nor we could call that a segment, or whatever,\n3:27\nbut the way to think about this, is if now\n3:29\nangle DBC is equal to angle DBA, so this angle,\n3:35\nDBC is equal to angle DBA, we can say that DB bisects\n3:43\nangle ABC, so we can say that DB and now Im talking\n3:49\nabout segment DB we could have made it a ray if we\n3:52\nhad -keep going to the right, or a line. DB\n3:54\nbisects BISECTS angle ABC, ABC\n4:02\nFare enough, now, the whole reason why I started\n4:05\nthis video talking about distances between points and lines,\n4:08\nis that I want to show you, that any point that is on\n4:10\nan angle bisector, is actually going to be\n4:12\nequidistant from the sides of the angle, and then were\n4:16\ngoing to go the other way saying, any point\n4:18\nthat is equidistant from the sides of an angle is\n4:20\ngoing on the angle bisector. So lets take an\n4:24\narbitrary point that sits on this angle bisector\n4:26\nso let's take this point right over here,\n4:30\nIll call that arbitrary point F, or actually I havnt used\n4:33\nE yet, so this is going to be and arbitrary point on our\n4:36\nangle bisector, and now let's look at the distance between\n4:40\nE and BC and the distance between E and BA we already\n4:44\nsay that, -we already said that the distance between\n4:46\npoint and a line is if you drop a perpendicular\n4:49\nfrom a point to that line, which you can always do\n4:51\nso lets draw a perpendicular right over here,\n4:54\nthis is one distance, and then this is the other distance\n4:57\nthis is, -this orange line right here is the distance between E and BC and this orange line is the distance\n5:04\nbetween E and BA and what I want to prove is that these distances are equal\n5:11\nwell the first thing to realize, is that we have two right triangles over here, they both share\n5:17\nth- they both have the same angle, they're not sharing it but angle ABE is congruent\n5:24\nto angle CBE and we know that because DB bisects it so this angle is equal to that angle\n5:29\nthey're both right triangles so the actually have 2 angles in common, which actually means\n5:34\nthey actually have 3 angles in common and constrains what this other angle would be and they also have\n5:38\nthis side in common, -they have 3 angles are congruent to each other, they are not\n5:44\nnecessarily in common, but it does have this side in common, BE is the hypotenuse\n5:48\nof both of these right triangles, and so, you can invoke\n5:52\nusing this angle, that angle and this side, this angle,that angle and this side\n5:56\nyou could say that these 2 triangles are going to be congruent to each other\n6:00\nso we could say that triangle, and let me put some points over here, so let's see\n6:04\nlet's call this F and let's call this G, we can say that triangle EBF is congruent to triangle\n6:14\nEBG and we can use AAS, by Angle Angle Side congruency or you could say hey if\n6:23\ntwo angles, -if corresponding angles are the same then the third angle is also going to be the same\n6:28\nso this angle right over here could also be the same and\n6:31\nyou could use ASA, but either way these two things are going to be congruent\n6:35\nbut if these two things are congruent, then the corresponding sides are going to be congruent\n6:39\nso then, then length of EF, segment EF, is going to be congruent to segment\n6:47\nEF is going to be congruent to segment EG which is the same\n6:51\nthing as the length of EF is equal to the length of EG, these are really, these are really\n6:57\nequivalent statements right over there, so the length of EF, the length of EF\n7:02\nis equal to the length of EG and the length of those two segments are the distances\n7:06\nbetween the point and those 2 respective sides.\n7:09\nWe've just proven the first case, if a point lies on an angle bisector, it is\n7:15\nequidistant from the 2 sides of the angle, now let's go the other way around,\n7:21\nlet's say that I have, so let me draw another angle here, so let me draw another angle over here and let's call\n7:29\nthis A, B, and C and let's pick some arbitrary point E, let's point some arbitrary point E\n7:40\nright over here and let's say we start off with the assumption that E is equidistant\n7:43\nto BC and BA and what we want to do is prove that E must be on the angle bisector,\n7:51\nso here, if you're on the angle bisector you're equidistant, over here we're going to show if you're\n7:55\nequidistant you're on the angle bisector, so if it's equidistant to BC and BA, then this perpendicular\n8:02\nright over here, this perpendicular right over here, is going to be congruent to this\n8:06\nperpendicular right over there, and let me give these points' labels, so let call this point D, and let's\n8:13\ncall this point right over F, and let's just draw segment BE here, let's just draw segment\n8:20\nBE right over here, so once again, we have 2 right triangles, we already know that\n8:29\n2 of the legs are congruent to each other, they both share the hypotenuse this\n8:32\nhypotenuse is equal to its self, we know from the pythagorean theorm\n8:36\nif you know 2 sides of a triangle, it determines the third side, so and we know 2 sides of both\n8:43\nof these, so the third sides must be the same, so this side must be equal to that side\n8:48\nso you could invoke SSS, Side Side Side, to show these 2 triangles are congruent\n8:53\nor you actually didn't need to -have to good there you could have used a special\n8:56\ncase, the RSH case, where if you have a right triangle, so if you have the right triangle\n9:02\nyou have one set of sides that are congruent, and you have the hypotenuse that is congruent\n9:06\nthen you're also okay, you could use RSH to prove congruency as well,\n9:11\nand so either way we know that triangle EBD, triangle EBD, is congruent to triangle EBF\n9:21\ncongruent to triangle EBF, we used Side Side Side here but you could have used RSH, let me write that\n9:29\nRSH, which is -we know that Angle Side Side can be used for any general triangle\n9:34\nbut it can be, -RSH is essentially Angle Side Side for right triangles, if you have\n9:38\n2 sides of a right triangle and- in common, --if 2 sides of a right triangle are congruent then\n9:49\nthe 2 triangles are definitely congruent but once you know that two triangles are congruent, then\n9:57\nthey're corresponding angles have to be congruent, and angle EBD, angle EBD\n10:01\ncorresponds to angle EBF so we know that angle EBD must be congruent to angle EBF\n10:11\nso EBD must be congruent to EBF, well if EBD is congruent to EBF then that means\n10:21\nthat segment EB must bisect, must bisect angle CBF, or actually CBA even, it could be called CEF\n10:38\nangle CBA. So we're done! If over here, we show that if something sits on a bisector is\n10:43\nequidistant from the sides of the angle, and here we showed if it's equidistant from the sides\n10:48\nof the angle it sits on the angle bisector, or, or -it could even be the end point of an angle bisector\n10:54\nbut clearly, it sits on it.",

simple straight lines of dots\n1:15\nconnecting the dots from one line to the other\n1:18\nin order somehow gives you\n1:19\nthis awesome woven curve shape.\n1:22\nAnother student is asking the teacher when he's ever\n1:24\ngoing to need to know how to graph a parabola –\n1:26\neven as he hides his multi-million dollar enterprise\n1:28\nof a parabola graphing game under his desk.\n1:31\nIf your teacher thought about it,\n1:32\nhe would probably think shooting birds at things\n1:35\nis a great reason to learn about parabolas\n1:37\nbecause he's come to understand that\n1:38\neducation is about money and prestige and\n1:40\nnot about becoming a better human able to do great things.\n1:42\nYou yourself haven't done anything really great yet\n1:44\nbut you figure the path to your future greatness\n1:47\nlies more in inventing awesome new connect-the-dot arrangements\n1:49\nthan in graphing parabolas or shooting birds at things.\n1:52\nAnd that's when you begin to worry.\n1:54\nWhat if this cool liney curvey thing you drew\n1:56\napproximates a parabola?\n1:59\nAs if your teacher doesn't realize\n2:00\neveryone has their phones under their desks,\n2:02\nbut he's underpaid and overworked and\n2:03\nhis whole word runs on plausible deniability,\n2:05\nso he shouts state-mandated, pass the test,\n2:08\nteach-to-the-middle nonsense at students\n2:09\nwho are not at all fooled\n2:11\nby his false enthusiasm or false mathematics and\n2:13\nhe pretends he's teaching algebra and\n2:14\nthe students pretend to be taught algebra and\n2:16\neveryone else involved in the system\n2:17\nis too invested to do anything\n2:19\nbut pretend to believe them both.\n2:20\nYou think maybe it's a hyperbola,\n2:22\nwhich is similar to the parabola\n2:24\nin that they are both conic sections.\n2:25\nA hyperbola is a nice vertical slice of cone,\n2:28\nthe cone itself being just like a line swirled around in a circle,\n2:31\nwhich is why the cone is like two cones radiating both ways;\n2:34\nthe lovely hyperbola insecting both parts.\n2:37\nTwo perfect curves, looking disconnected when seen alone\n2:40\nbut sharing their common conic heritage.\n2:42\nWhile the boring old parabola is a slice taken at an angle\n2:45\ncompletely meant to miss the top part of the cone and\n2:47\nto miss wrapping around the bottom like an ellipse would.\n2:50\nAnd it's such a special, specific case of conic section\n2:53\nthat all parabolas are exactly the same,\n2:54\njust bigger or smaller or moved around.\n2:57\nYour teacher could just as well hand you parabolas already drawn\n3:00\nand have you draw coordinate grids on parabolas\n3:02\nrather than parabolas on coordinate grids.\n3:04\nAnd it's stupid, and you hate it,\n3:06\nand you don't wanna learn to graph them,\n3:07\neven if it means not making a billion dollars\n3:09\nfrom a game about shooting birds at things.\n3:11\nMeanwhile anyone who actually learns how to think mathematically\n3:14\ncan then learn to graph a parabola or anything else\n3:17\nthey need in like five minutes.\n3:18\nBut teaching how to think is an individualized process\n3:21\nthat gives power and responsibility to individuals\n3:23\nwhile teaching what to think can be done\n3:25\nwith one-size-fits-all bullet points and check-boxes\n3:27\nand our culture of excuses demands that we do the latter,\n3:30\nkeeping ourselves placated in the comforting structure\n3:32\nof tautology and clear expectations.\n3:34\nAlgebra has become a check-box subject and\n3:37\nmathematics weeps alone in the top of the ivory tower prison\n3:40\nto which she has been condemned.\n3:42\nBut you're not interested in check-boxes;\n3:44\nyou're interested in dots, and lines that connect them.\n3:46\nOr maybe you could connect them with semicircles,\n3:48\nto give visual structure to lines that would otherwise overlap.\n3:51\nOr you could say one dot is the center of a circle and\n3:53\nanother defines a radius and draw the entire circle\n3:56\nand do things that way.\n3:57\nYou could make rules about how every dot\n3:59\nis the center of a circle with its neighbor being the radius,\n4:01\nor say one dot stays the center of all circles,\n4:04\nand all of the others define radii.\n4:06\nBut then you just get concentric circles,\n4:08\nwhich I suppose should have been obvious.\n4:09\nBut what if you did it the other way around and\n4:11\nsaid one dot always stays on the circle and\n4:14\nall the other dots are centers, like this.\n4:16\nLooks more promising.\n4:17\nSo you try putting all the dots in a circle and\n4:19\nusing them as circle centers and\n4:20\nchoose just one dot for the circles to go through and\n4:23\nyou get this awesome shape that looks kind of like a heart.\n4:26\nSo let's call it, oh I don't know, a cardioid.\n4:28\nWhich happens to be the same curve that you get\n4:30\nwhen parallel lines like rays of light reflect off a circle\n4:33\nthe same heart of sunshine in a cup.\n4:35\nOr maybe instead of circle centers\n4:37\nyou could have points all on the curve of a circle,\n4:39\nwhich means you need three points to define a circle,\n4:42\nmaybe just a point and its two closest neighbors to start with.\n4:45\nAnd of course, any collection of circles is two-colorable,\n4:48\nwhich means you can contrast light and dark colors\n4:50\nfor a classy color scheme.\n4:51\nOr maybe you could throw down some random points\n4:53\nto make all possible circles.\n4:54\nOnly that would be a lot of circles,\n4:56\nso you choose just ones you like.\n4:57\nAnd then, against your will, you begin to wonder\n4:59\nhow many points it takes to define the boring old parabola.\n5:02\nBecause parabolas are actually a lot like circles in that\n5:04\nboth are like extreme ellipses,\n5:06\nbecause a circle is like taking one focus of an ellipse\n5:09\nand putting the other focus zero distance away.\n5:11\nAnd a parabola is like an ellipse where\n5:14\none focus is infinity distance away.\n5:16\nWhich is why everyone lies to you and says\n5:18\nthrowing balls or shooting birds is all about parabolas\n5:20\nwhen really it's about ellipses\n5:22\nbecause the earth is a sphere and\n5:24\ngravity doesn't actually go straight down.\n5:25\nAnd the other focus of the elliptical orbit of\n5:27\nyour thrown object of choice may be very far away,\n5:30\nbut very far away is a great bit closer than infinity.\n5:33\nSo let's not fool ourselves.\n5:34\nYou can't look at everything that seems kind of parabolic\n5:37\nand call it a parabola.\n5:39\nSure, if you connect two dots with a hanging string or chain,\n5:41\nit looks parabolic, and so do structurally strong arches,\n5:44\nbut they're actually catenary arches and\n5:45\nmaybe you can't tell by sight,\n5:47\nbut if you're an architect you'd better know the difference.\n5:49\nThough caternarys are quite related to parabolas,\n5:51\nyou get them by rolling around a parabola\n5:52\nand tracing the focus\n5:53\nwhich makes them a cousin of the ellipse and\n5:55\neven a hyperbola is like an ellipse that got turned inside out\n5:57\nor whose focus went through infinity and\n5:59\ncame out the other side or something.\n6:00\nAnd of course parabolas and hyperbolas and ellipses\n6:02\nare all conic sections which mean\n6:04\nthey all come from a line that got spun around.\n6:05\nAnd a line is just what happens\n6:07\nwhen a couple dots get connected.\n6:08\nOr maybe what happens when your circle is so big that,\n6:10\nlike the extreme ellipse that becomes a parabola,\n6:13\nthe extreme circle is broken at infinity and\n6:16\nbecomes a line before getting larger than infinitely big\n6:19\nwhich brings it back to the other side.\n6:20\nThis linear circle, the infinite in-between.\n6:23\nOr maybe a line is what happens\n6:25\nwhen you roll around a circle and trace the focus.\n6:27\nOr rather the 2 foci, which are zero distance apart, in ellipse terms.\n6:30\nWhich makes you wonder what you get\n6:32\nwhen you roll around an ellipse and trace the foci.\n6:34\nIn fact, there's lots of great shapes\n6:36\nyou can get by rolling around shapes on other shapes,\n6:38\nlike if you roll a circle around a circle and trace the focus,\n6:41\nyou get just another circle.\n6:42\nBut, if you trace a point on the edge,\n6:44\nyou get our awesome friend the cardioid again.\n6:46\nSo now it's related to circles in three ways ,\n6:49\nwhich means it's a close cousin of the ellipse\n6:51\nand a second cousin to the infinite ellipse or, parabola.\n6:53\nExcept, not just that, if you take a parabola and\n6:56\ninvert it around the unit circle, reversing inside and outside,\n6:57\none half becomes two, one hundred becomes a hundredth,\n7:01\none stays one, infinity becomes zero,\n7:03\nyou get once again, the cardioid.\n7:06\nThe cardioid is the anti-parabola which is good\n7:09\nbecause parabolas make you sad but you heart cardioids.\n7:12\nAnd of course, any time you want to\n7:14\nconnect two dots on a piece of paper,\n7:16\ninstead of drawing the line you could fold the line.\n7:18\nHere's the thing about connecting dots.\n7:20\nYou can have all the steps laid out for you,\n7:22\ntaking whatever next step is easiest and closest\n7:25\nand be sure of what you're getting the whole time.\n7:27\nThis way is safe and comfortable.\n7:29\nOr, you can try new ways of connecting dots\n7:32\nand not know what you're going to get.\n7:33\nMaybe it will be something great, maybe it will fail.\n7:36\nAnd when it fails it will be your fault.\n7:38\nYou can't blame anyone else, not mathematics\n7:40\nor the system or the check-boxes.\n7:41\nBut if I am to have faults I would rather they be my own.",

What's the next largest\n3:12\nnumber that starts with a T?\n3:14\nWell, it's going to be equal to 3.\n3:18\nNow what would h of-- I don't know, let's think about this,\n3:25\nh of 8 be equal to?\n3:27\nWell, 8 starts with an E. The next largest number\n3:31\nthat starts with an E-- it's not 9, 10-- it would be 11.\n3:37\nAnd so now you see it's a very, very, very general tool.\n3:42\nThis h function that we just defined, we'll look at it.\n3:44\nWe'll look at the letter that the number\n3:46\nstarts with in English.\n3:47\nSo it's doing this really, really, really, really\n3:49\nwacky thing.\n3:50\nNow not all functions have to be this wacky.\n3:53\nIn fact, you have already been dealing with functions.\n3:55\nYou have seen things like y is equal to x plus 1.\n4:02\nThis can be viewed as a function.\n4:04\nWe could write this as y is a function\n4:07\nof x, which is equal to x plus 1.\n4:11\nIf you give as an input-- let me write\n4:16\nit this way-- for example, when x is 0 we could say f of 0\n4:23\nis equal to, well, you take 0.\n4:25\nYou add 1.\n4:26\nIt's equal to 1.\n4:28\nf of 2 is equal to 2.\n4:30\nYou've already done this before.\n4:31\nYou've done things where you said, look,\n4:33\nlet me make a table of x and put our y's there.\n4:37\nWhen x is 0, y is 1.\n4:40\nI'm sorry.\n4:42\nI made a little mistake.\n4:44\nWhere f of 2 is equal to 3.\n4:46\nAnd you've done this before with tables where you say,\n4:48\nlook, x and y.\n4:51\nWhen x is 0, y is 1.\n4:53\nWhen x is 2, y is 3.\n4:57\nYou might say, well, what was the whole point of using\n4:59\nthe function notation here to say\n5:01\nf of x is equal to x plus 1?\n5:03\nThe whole point is to think in these more general terms.\n5:07\nFor something like this, you didn't really\n5:09\nhave to introduce function notations.\n5:11\nBut it doesn't hurt to introduce function notations because it\n5:14\nmakes it very clear that the function takes an input,\n5:17\ntakes my x-- in this definition it munches on it.\n5:21\nIt says, OK, x plus 1.\n5:23\nAnd then it produces 1 more than it.\n5:26\nSo here, whatever the input is, the output is 1 more\n5:29\nthan that original function.\n5:31\nNow I know what you're asking.\n5:32\nAll right.\n5:32\nWell, what is not a function then?\n5:35\nWell, remember, we said a function\n5:36\nis something that takes an input and produces only one\n5:39\npossible output for that given input.\n5:43\nFor example-- and let me look at a visual way\n5:46\nof thinking about a function this time, or a relationship,\n5:49\nI should say-- let's say that's our y-axis,\n5:53\nand this right over here is our x-axis.\n5:58\nLet me draw a circle here that has radius 2.\n6:05\nSo it's a circle of radius 2.\n6:07\nThis is negative 2.\n6:09\nThis is positive 2.\n6:11\nThis is negative 2.\n6:12\nSo my circle, it's centered at the origin.\n6:15\nIt has radius 2.\n6:17\nThat's my best attempt at drawing the circle.\n6:20\nLet me fill it in.\n6:21\nSo this is a circle.\n6:23\nThe equation of this circle is going\n6:25\nto be x squared plus y squared is equal to the radius squared,\n6:28\nis equal to 2 squared, or it's equal to 4.\n6:31\nThe question is, is this relationship between x and y--\n6:34\nhere I've expressed it as an equation.\n6:35\nHere I've visually drawn all of the x's and y's that satisfy\n6:40\nthis equation-- is this relationship between x\n6:43\nand y a function?\n6:45\nAnd we can see visually that it's not\n6:47\ngoing to be a function.\n6:48\nYou pick a given x.\n6:49\nLet's say x is equal to 1.\n6:53\nThere's two possible y's that are associated with it,\n6:57\nthis y up here and this y down here.\n7:00\nWe could even solve for that by looking at the equation.\n7:02\nWhen x is equal to 1, we get 1 squared plus y squared\n7:06\nis equal to 4.\n7:07\n1 plus y squared is equal to 4.\n7:11\nOr subtracting 1 from both sides, y squared is equal to 3.\n7:15\nOr y is equal to the positive or the negative square root of 3.\n7:20\nThis right over here is the positive square root of 3,\n7:23\nand this right over here is the negative square root of 3.\n7:26\nSo this situation, this relationship\n7:28\nwhere I inputted a 1 into my little box here,\n7:34\nand associated with the 1, I associate\n7:36\nboth a positive square root of 3 and a negative square root\n7:40\nof 3, this is not a function.\n7:47\nI cannot associate with my input two different outputs.\n7:51\nI can only have one output for a given input.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a\n0:02\nprinciple of quantum mechanics.\n0:04\nAnd so if we take a particle, let's say we have\n0:06\na particle here of Mass M, moving with Velocity V,\n0:11\nthe momentum of that particle, the linear momentum\n0:14\nis equal to the Mass times the Velocity.\n0:16\nAnd according to the uncertainty principle,\n0:19\nyou can't know the position and momentum\n0:22\nof that particle accurately, at the same time.\n0:25\nSo if you know the position, if you know where that particle\n0:28\nis in space really well, you don't know the momentum,\n0:32\nor you don't know the velocity of that particle,\n0:34\nand vice versa.\n0:35\nIf you know the momentum really well,\n0:36\nyou don't know the position.\n0:38\nSo let's look at a mathematical description\n0:40\nof the uncertainty principle.\n0:42\nSo the uncertainty in the position,\n0:44\nso Delta X is the uncertainty in the position,\n0:47\ntimes the uncertainty in the momentum,\n0:49\nso Delta P is uncertainty in momentum,\n0:53\nthe product of these two must be greater than\n0:56\nor equal to some constant.\n0:58\nAnd that constant is Planck's Constant:\n1:00\nh divided by four pi.\n1:03\nSo we have a constant divided by another constant.\n1:08\nSo this just gives us a number on the right side,\n1:11\nand you might see something a little bit different\n1:12\nin another textbook.\n1:13\nIt doesn't really matter that much,\n1:15\nit just depends on how you define things.\n1:17\nSo the point is, the product of the two uncertainties\n1:21\nmust be greater than or equal to some number.\n1:24\nSo the uncertainties are inversely proportional\n1:27\nto each other: if you increase one, you decrease the other.\n1:31\nLet's go ahead and use some really simple numbers here,\n1:33\njust so you can understand that point.\n1:35\nSo let's say, and this is just extremely simplified,\n1:39\nso let's just see if we can understand that idea\n1:40\nof inversely proportional.\n1:42\nSo if you have an uncertainty of two for the position,\n1:46\nand let's say you had an uncertainty\n1:47\nof two for the momentum.\n1:49\nAlright, so two times two is equal to four,\n1:52\nso I won't even worry about greater than,\n1:55\nI'll just put equal to here.\n1:56\nSo if two times two is equal to four.\n1:59\nIf I decrease the uncertainty of the position,\n2:02\nso I decrease it to one,\n2:03\nso the uncertainty in the momentum must increase to four,\n2:08\nbecause one times four is equal to four.\n2:10\nIf I decrease the uncertainty in the position even more,\n2:13\nso if I lower that to point five, I increase the uncertainty\n2:17\nin the momentum, that must go up to eight.\n2:19\nSo point five times eight gives us four.\n2:22\nAnd so, what I'm trying to show you here,\n2:24\nis as you decrease the uncertainty in the position,\n2:28\nyou increase the uncertainty in the momentum.\n2:31\nSo another way of saying that is,\n2:33\nthe more accurately you know the position of a particle,\n2:37\nthe less accurately you know the momentum of that particle.\n2:40\nAnd that's the idea of the uncertainty principle.\n2:44\nAnd so let's apply this uncertainty principle\n2:46\nto the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom.\n2:49\nSo let's look at a picture of the Bohr model\n2:51\nof the hydrogen atom.\n2:52\nAlright, we know our negatively charged electron\n2:55\norbits the nucleus, like a planet around the sun.\n2:58\nAnd, let's say the electron is going this direction,\n3:01\nso there is a velocity associated with that electron,\n3:05\nso there is velocity going in that direction.\n3:08\nAlright, the reason why the Bohr model is useful,\n3:10\nis because it allows us to understand things like\n3:12\nquantized energy levels.\n3:14\nAnd we talked about the radius for the electron,\n3:18\nso if there's a circle here, there's a radius\n3:21\nfor an electron in the ground state,\n3:23\nthis would be the radius of the first energy level,\n3:26\nis equal to 5.3 times 10 to the negative 11 meters.\n3:30\nSo if we wanted to know the diameter of that circle,\n3:33\nwe could just multiply the radius by two.\n3:35\nSo two times that number would be equal\n3:38\nto 1.06 times 10 to the negative 10 meters.\n3:44\nAnd this is just a rough estimate of the size\n3:47\nof the hydrogen atom using the Bohr model,\n3:50\nwith an electron in the ground state.\n3:52\nAlright, we also did some calculations\n3:55\nto figure out the velocity.\n3:57\nSo the velocity of an electron in the ground state\n4:01\nof a hydrogen atom using the Bohr model,\n4:03\nwe calculated that to be\n4:04\n2.2 times 10 to the six meters per second.\n4:08\nAnd since we know the mass of an electron,\n4:10\nwe can actually calculate the linear momentum.\n4:12\nSo the linear momentum P is equal\n4:14\nto the mass times the velocity.\n4:16\nLet's say we knew the velocity with a 10% uncertainty\n4:21\nassociated with that number.\n4:23\nSo a 10% uncertainty.\n4:26\nIf we convert that to a decimal, we just divide 10 by 100,\n4:30\nso we get 10% is equal to point one.\n4:34\nSo we have point one here.\n4:35\nIf I want to know the uncertainty of the momentum\n4:38\nof that electron, so the uncertainty\n4:40\nin the momentum of that particle,\n4:43\nmomentum is equal to mass times velocity.\n4:45\nIf there's a 10% uncertainty associated with the velocity,\n4:50\nwe need to multiply this by point one.\n4:52\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n4:54\nSo we would have the mass of the electron\n4:58\nis 9.11 times 10 to the negative 31st.\n5:02\nThe velocity of the electron is\n5:04\n2.2 times 10 to the sixth, and we know that\n5:08\nwith 10% uncertainty, so we need to multiply\n5:10\nall of that by point one.\n5:12\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n5:14\nWe're gonna multiply all those things together.\n5:17\nSo we take the mass of an electron,\n5:18\n9.11 times 10 to the negative 31st\n5:23\nand we multiply that by the velocity,\n5:26\n2.2 times 10 to the sixth,\n5:29\nand we know there's a 10% uncertainty\n5:32\nassociated with the velocity,\n5:34\nso we get an uncertainty in the momentum\n5:36\n2.0 times 10 to the negative 25.\n5:40\nSo the uncertainty in the momentum is\n5:43\n2.0 times 10 to the negative 25.\n5:47\nAnd the units would be,\n5:48\nthis is the mass in kilograms, and the velocity\n5:51\nwas in meters over seconds,\n5:53\nso kilograms times meters per second.\n5:55\nAlright, so this is the uncertainty associated\n5:59\nwith the momentum of our electrons.\n6:02\nLet's plug it in to our uncertainty principle here:\n6:06\nwe had the uncertainty in the position of the electron,\n6:10\ntimes the uncertainty in the momentum of the electron\n6:13\nmust be greater than or equal to\n6:15\nPlanck's Constant divided by four pi.\n6:19\nSo we can take that uncertainty in the momentum\n6:22\nand we can plug it in here.\n6:24\nSo now we have the uncertainty in the position\n6:27\nof the electron in the ground state of the hydrogen atom\n6:30\ntimes 2.0 times 10 to the negative 25.\n6:34\nThis product must be greater than or equal to,\n6:37\nPlanck's Constant is 6.626 times 10 to the negative 34.\n6:43\nAlright, divide that by four pi.\n6:48\nSo we could solve for the uncertainty in the position.\n6:52\nSo, Delta X must be greater than or equal to,\n6:56\nlet's go ahead and do that math.\n6:58\nSo we have Planck's Constant,\n7:00\n6.626 times 10 to the negative 34,\n7:06\nwe divide that by 4, we need to divide that also by pi,\n7:13\nand then we need to divide by the\n7:15\nuncertainty in the momentum.\n7:17\nSo we also need to divide by the uncertainty in momentum,\n7:20\nthat's 2.0 times 10 to the negative 25,\n7:25\nand that gives us 2.6 times 10 to the negative 10.\n7:30\nSo the uncertainty in the position must be greater than\n7:33\nor equal to 2.6 times 10 to the negative 10\n7:39\nand if you worked our your units,\n7:41\nyou would get meters for this.\n7:43\nSo the uncertainty in the position must be\n7:46\ngreater than or equal to\n7:46\n2.6 times 10 to the negative 10 meters.\n7:49\nLet's go back up here to the picture of the hydrogen atom.\n7:53\n2.6 times 10 to the negative 10 meters,\n7:55\nthat's greater than the diameter of our hydrogen atom,\n8:00\nso the uncertainty would be greater than this diameter.\n8:04\nSo the uncertainty in the position would be greater than\n8:07\nthe diameter of the hydrogen atom, using the Bohr model.\n8:10\nSo the Bohr model is wrong.\n8:12\nIt's telling us we know the electron is orbiting the nucleus\n8:15\nat a certain radius, and it's moving at a certain velocity.\n8:18\nThe uncertainty principle says this isn't true.\n8:21\nIf we know the velocity fairly accurately,\n8:24\nwe don't know the position of the electron,\n8:27\nthe position of the electron is greater than\n8:28\nthe diameter, according to the Bohr model.\n8:30\nSo this just one reason why the Bohr model is wrong.\n8:34\nBut again, we keep the Bohr model around\n8:36\nbecause it is useful as a simple model\n8:38\nwhen you're just starting to get into chemistry.\n8:40\nBut this concept of the uncertainty principle goes\n8:44\nagainst our natural intuitions.\n8:46\nSo our every day life doesn't really give us\n8:48\nany experience with the uncertainty principle.\n8:51\nFor example, if we had a particle,\n8:53\nlet's make it a much bigger particle here,\n8:55\nso a much bigger particle than an electron,\n8:58\nso something that we can actually see in our real life,\n9:00\nand so this has a much bigger mass,\n9:03\nand moving with some velocity,\n9:04\nlogic tells us we can figure out pretty accurately\n9:07\nwhere the position of that object is,\n9:09\nand we can probably, pretty accurately,\n9:11\nfigure out the velocity, and so we know the momentum.\n9:14\nAnd, that's true.\n9:16\nWe do know these things fairly accurately.\n9:19\nBut if you did a calculation using\n9:21\nthe uncertainty principle, so if you plugged in some\n9:24\ndifferent numbers, like if you increased the mass,\n9:26\nso instead of 9.11 times 10 to the negative 31st,\n9:29\nlet's say you're using nine kilograms,\n9:31\nand you plugged in some velocity here,\n9:34\nand you solved for the uncertainty in the position,\n9:37\nyou're gonna get an uncertainty in the position\n9:38\nthat's extremely small.\n9:40\nSo you don't really notice those things\n9:42\non a macroscopic scale.\n9:44\nYou only notice them when you think about the atomic scale.\n9:47\nAnd so that's why this isn't really an intuitive concept.\n9:50\nSame idea with quantum mechanics:\n9:52\nquantum mechanics is something\n9:53\nthat makes absolutely no sense when you first encounter it.\n9:56\nYou have no experience with quantum mechanics\n9:58\nin your daily life, it just doesn't make any sense.\n10:00\nYou don't see these sorts of things.\n10:02\nSo this is just showing you an application\n10:05\nat an atomic scale.\n10:07\nAgain, this is the uncertainty principle.\n10:09\nWe'll get more into quantum mechanics,\n10:11\nand how quantum mechanics affects\n10:13\nelectrons and atoms in the next few videos.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWe are being asked, what is the smallest-- this\n0:04\nis a little typo here-- what is the smallest\n0:07\npossible sum of squares of two numbers\n0:10\nif their product is negative 16?\n0:14\nSo let's say that these two numbers are x and y.\n0:19\nSo how could we define the sum of the squares of the two\n0:22\nnumbers?\n0:23\nSo I'll just call that the sum of the squares,\n0:25\ns for sum of the squares, and it would just\n0:28\nbe equal to x squared plus y squared.\n0:32\nAnd this is what we want to minimize.\n0:35\nWe want to minimize s.\n0:40\nNow, right now s is expressed as a function of x and y.\n0:43\nWe don't know how to minimize with respect to two variables,\n0:46\nso we have to get this in terms of only one variable.\n0:48\nAnd lucky for us, they give us another piece of information.\n0:51\nTheir product is negative 16.\n0:54\nSo x times y is equal to negative 16.\n1:00\nSo let's say we wanted this expression\n1:03\nright over here only in terms of x.\n1:05\nWell, then we can figure out what\n1:07\ny is in terms of x and then substitute.\n1:10\nSo let's do that right over here.\n1:11\nIf we divide both sides by x, we get y is equal to negative 16\n1:16\nover x.\n1:17\nAnd so let's replace our y in this expression\n1:20\nwith negative 16 over x.\n1:23\nSo then we would get our sum of squares\n1:27\nas a function of x is going to be\n1:29\nequal to x squared plus y squared.\n1:32\ny is negative 16 over x.\n1:38\nAnd then that's what we will now square.\n1:41\nSo this is equal to x squared plus, what is this?\n1:46\n256 over x squared.\n1:48\nOr we could write that as 256x to the negative 2 power.\n1:54\nThat is the sum of our squares that we now want to minimize.\n1:59\nWell, to minimize this, we would want\n2:02\nto look at the critical points of this, which\n2:04\nis where the derivative is either 0 or undefined,\n2:07\nand see whether those critical points are possibly\n2:09\na minimum or a maximum point.\n2:11\nThey don't have to be, but those are\n2:12\nthe ones if we have a minimum or a maximum point,\n2:15\nthey're going to be one of the critical points.\n2:16\nSo let's take the derivative.\n2:18\nSo the derivative s prime-- let me\n2:21\ndo this in a different color-- s prime of x.\n2:24\nI'll do it right over here, actually.\n2:26\nThe derivative s prime of x with respect\n2:28\nto x is going to be equal to 2x times\n2:32\nnegative 2 times 2x plus 256 times negative 2.\n2:38\nSo that's minus 512x to the negative 3 power.\n2:45\nNow, this is going to be undefined when x is equal to 0.\n2:52\nBut if x is equal to 0, then y is undefined.\n2:55\nSo this whole thing breaks down.\n2:57\nSo that isn't a useful critical point, x equals 0.\n3:01\nSo let's think about any other ones.\n3:02\nWell, it's defined everywhere else.\n3:04\nSo let's think about where the derivative is equal to 0.\n3:07\nSo when does this thing equal 0?\n3:09\nSo when does 2x minus 512x to the negative 3 equal 0?\n3:16\nWell, we can add 512x to the negative 3 to both sides.\n3:19\nSo you get 2x is equal to 512x to the negative third power.\n3:26\nWe can multiply both sides times x to the third power\n3:32\nso all the x's go away on the right-hand side.\n3:34\nSo you get 2x to the fourth is equal to 512.\n3:40\nWe can divide both sides by 2, and you\n3:42\nget x to the fourth power is equal to 256.\n3:49\nAnd so what is the fourth root of 256?\n3:52\nWell, we could take the square root of both sides just\n3:54\nto help us here.\n3:56\nSo let's see.\n3:57\nSo it's going to be x squared is going to be equal to 256\n4:01\nis 16 squared.\n4:03\nSo this is 16.\n4:05\nThis is going to be x squared is equal to 16 or x is equal to 4.\n4:12\nNow that's our only critical point we have,\n4:15\nso that's probably the x value that\n4:17\nminimizes our sum of squares right over here.\n4:19\nBut let's make sure it's a minimum value.\n4:21\nAnd to do that, we can just do our second derivative test.\n4:24\nSo let's figure out.\n4:25\nLet's take the second derivative s\n4:27\nprime prime of x and figure out if we are concave upwards\n4:31\nor downwards when x is equal to 4.\n4:34\nSo s prime prime of x is going to be equal to 2.\n4:37\nAnd then we're going to have negative 3 times negative 512.\n4:41\nSo I'll just write that as plus 3 times 512.\n4:45\nThat's going to be 1,536.\n4:48\nIs that right?\n4:48\nYeah, 3 times 500 is 1,500, 3 times 12\n4:51\nis 36, x to the negative 4 power.\n4:57\nAnd this thing right over here is actually\n4:59\ngoing to be positive for any x.\n5:04\nx to the negative 4, even if the negative x value,\n5:08\nthat's going to be positive.\n5:09\nEverything else is positive.\n5:10\nThis thing is always positive.\n5:12\nSo we are always in a concave upwards situation.\n5:18\nConcave upwards means that our graph might look something\n5:22\nlike that.\n5:23\nActually, I don't want to draw the little squiggle.\n5:25\nIt might look something like that.\n5:26\nAnd you see there's a reason why the second derivative implies\n5:29\nconcave upwards, a second derivative positive\n5:31\nmeans that our derivative is constantly increasing.\n5:35\nSo the derivative is constantly increasing.\n5:36\nIt's negative, less negative, even less negative.\n5:39\nLet me do it in a different color.\n5:41\nYou see it's negative, less negative, even less negative,\n5:45\n0, positive, more positive.\n5:47\nSo it's increasing over the entire place.\n5:50\nSo if you have a critical point where\n5:53\nthe derivative is equal to 0, so the slope is equal to 0,\n5:57\nand it's concave upwards, you see pretty clearly\n6:00\nthat we have minimized the function.\n6:04\nSo what is y going to be equal to?\n6:06\nWe actually don't even have to figure out\n6:08\nwhat y has to be equal to in order\n6:10\nto minimize the sum of squares.\n6:11\nWe could just put it back into this.\n6:13\nBut just for fun, we see that y would be negative 16 over x.\n6:17\nSo y would be equal to negative 4.\n6:20\nAnd we could just figure out now what our sum of squares is.\n6:23\nOur minimum sum of squares is going\n6:26\nto be equal to 4 squared, which is 16 plus negative 4\n6:31\nsquared plus another 16, which is equal to 32.\n6:35\nNow I know some of you might be thinking, hey,\n6:37\nI could have done this without calculus.\n6:39\nI could have just tried out numbers whose product is\n6:41\nnegative 16 and I probably would have tried out 4 and negative 4\n6:45\nin not too much time and then I would\n6:47\nhave been able to maybe figure out it's lower than if I did\n6:49\n2 and negative 8 or negative 2 and 8 or 1 and 16.\n6:53\nAnd that's true, you probably would\n6:55\nhave been able to do that.\n6:56\nBut you still wouldn't have been able to feel good\n6:58\nthat that was a minimum value, because you wouldn't\n7:00\nhave tried out 4.01 or 4.0011.\n7:03\nIn fact, you couldn't have tried out all of the possible values.\n7:06\nRemember, we didn't say that this is only integers.\n7:08\nIt just happened to be that our values just worked out\n7:12\nto be integers in this situation.\n7:14\nYou can imagine what would happen if the problem wasn't\n7:17\nif their product is negative 16, but what\n7:19\nif their product is negative 17?\n7:23\nOr what if the product is negative 16.5?\n7:25\nOr what if their product was pi squared?\n7:28\nThen you wouldn't be able to try everything else out\n7:30\nand you would have to resort to doing\n7:32\nwhat we did in this video.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nI think by now we have a reasonable sense of what\n0:03\nlinear dependence means.\n0:07\nSo let's just do a slightly more formal definition of\n0:11\nlinear dependence.\n0:13\nSo we're going to say that a set of vectors-- Let me just\n0:16\ndefine my set of vectors.\n0:18\nLet me call my set s of vectors, v1, v2,\n0:24\nall the way to vn.\n0:27\nI'm going to say that they are linearly dependent.\n0:36\nIf and only if.\n0:38\nSo sometimes it's written if, if with a lot of f's in there.\n0:42\nSo sometimes it's written if and only if.\n0:45\nSometimes it's shown like an arrow in two directions.\n0:49\nIf and only if I can satisfy this equation, I can find a\n0:54\nset of constants c1 times v1.\n0:59\nI can take a linear combination of my vectors all\n1:03\nthe way to cn vn, that satisfy the equation that I can create\n1:10\nthis into the 0 vector.\n1:13\nSometimes it's just written as a bold 0, and sometimes you\n1:16\ncould just write it -- I mean we don't know the\n1:18\ndimensionality of this vector.\n1:20\nIt would be a bunch of 0's.\n1:22\nWe don't know how many actual elements are in each of these\n1:29\nvectors, but you get the idea.\n1:32\nMy set of vectors is linearly dependent-- remember I'm\n1:35\nsaying dependent, not independent --is linearly\n1:39\ndependant, if and only if I can satisfy this equation for\n1:43\nsome ci's where not all of them are equal to 0.\n1:54\nThis is key, not all are 0.\n1:58\nOr you could say it the other way.\n2:00\nYou could say at least one is non-zero.\n2:09\nSo how does this gel with what we were talking about in the\n2:12\nprevious video where I said look, a set is linearly\n2:15\ndependent if one of the of vectors can be represented by\n2:19\nthe combination of the other vectors?\n2:24\nLet me write that down.\n2:25\nIn the last few I said, look, one vector can be -- Let me\n2:35\nwrite it this way.\n2:37\nOne vector being represented by the some of the other\n2:39\nvectors, I can just write it like this.\n2:41\nI can write it a little bit more math-y.\n2:43\nIn the last video, I said that linear dependence means that--\n2:46\nlet me just pick an arbitrary vector, v1.\n2:50\nLet's say that v1, you know this is arbitrary, v1 one\n2:53\ncould be represented by some combination\n2:55\nof the other vectors.\n2:57\nLet me call them a1 times v -- let me be careful -- a2 times\n3:04\nv2 plus a3 times v3 plus all the way up to an times vn.\n3:11\nThis is what we said in the previous video.\n3:13\nIf this is linear dependence, any one of these guys can be\n3:16\nrepresented as some combination of the other ones.\n3:19\nSo how does this imply that?\n3:21\nIn order show this if and only if, I have to show that this\n3:24\nimplies that and I have to show that that implies this.\n3:29\nSo this is almost a trivially easy proof.\n3:31\nBecause if I subtract v1 from both sides of this equation I\n3:36\nget 0 is equal to minus 1 v1 plus a2 v2 plus a3 v3 all the\n3:49\nway to an vn.\n3:52\nAnd clearly I've just said, well,\n3:55\nthis is linearly dependent.\n3:57\nThat means that I can represent this vector as a sum\n4:00\nof the other vectors, which means that minus 1 times v1\n4:04\nplus some combination of the other vectors is equal to 0,\n4:07\nwhich means that I've been able to satisfy this equation,\n4:12\nand at least one of my constants is non-zero.\n4:19\nSo I've shown you that, if I can represent one of the\n4:23\nvectors by a sum of the other ones, then this condition is\n4:26\ndefinitely going to be true.\n4:28\nNow let me go the other way.\n4:29\nLet me show you if I have this situation that I can\n4:32\ndefinitely represent one of the vectors as\n4:35\nthe sum of the others.\n4:36\nSo let's say that this is true.\n4:42\nAnd one of these constants, remember it's not just this,\n4:46\nit's at least one, is non-zero.\n4:48\nSo let me just assume, just for the sake of simplicity-- I\n4:50\nmean these are all arbitrary.\n4:53\nI'll do it in a new color.\n4:55\nLet me do it in the magenta.\n4:57\nLet me assume that c1 is not equal to 0.\n5:03\nIf c1 is not equal to 0, then I can divide both sides of\n5:06\nthis equation by c1.\n5:08\nAnd what do I get?\n5:09\nI get v1 plus c2 over c1 v2 plus all the way up to cn over\n5:19\nc1 is equal to 0.\n5:23\nAnd then I can multiply both sides of this, or I could add\n5:28\nnegative v1 to both sides of this equation or subtract v1\n5:31\nfrom both sides.\n5:32\nAnd I get c2 over c1 v2 plus all the way up to cn over c1\n5:41\nvn-- there's a vn here --is equal to minus v1.\n5:46\nNow if I just multiply both sides of this by negative 1, I\n5:49\nget a minus, and all these become minuses and this\n5:52\nbecomes a plus.\n5:53\nAnd I just showed you that if at least one of these\n5:56\nconstants is non-zero, that I can represent my vector v1 as\n6:02\nsome combination of the other vectors.\n6:04\nSo we're able to go this way too.\n6:07\nIf this condition is true, then I can represent one of\n6:10\nthe vectors as a combination of the others.\n6:12\nIf I can represent one of those vectors as a combination\n6:14\nof the others, then this condition is true.\n6:17\nHopefully that kind of proves that these two definitions are\n6:20\nequivalent.\n6:21\nMaybe it's a little bit of overkill.\n6:22\nLet's apply that definition now, to actually test. You\n6:26\nmight say, hey Sal, why'd you go through all of this effort?\n6:28\nI went through all of this effort because this is\n6:30\nactually a really useful way to test whether things are\n6:36\nlinearly independent or dependent.\n6:39\nLet's try it out.\n6:40\nLet's use our newly found tool.\n6:43\nLet's say I have the set of vectors--\n6:47\nLet me do it up here.\n6:48\nI want to be efficient with my space usage.\n6:51\nSo let's say I have the set of vectors 2,1 and 3,2.\n6:59\nAnd my question to you is, are these linearly independent or\n7:03\nare they linearly dependent?\n7:06\nIn order for them to be linearly dependent, that means\n7:11\nthat if some constant times 2,1 plus some other constant\n7:18\ntimes this second vector, 3,2 where this\n7:23\nshould be equal to 0.\n7:24\nWhere these both aren't necessarily 0.\n7:27\nBefore I go up for this problem, let's remember what\n7:30\nwe're going to find out.\n7:32\nIf either of these are non-zero, if c1 or c2 are\n7:38\nnon-zero, then this implies that we are dealing with a\n7:44\ndependent, linearly dependent set.\n7:51\nIf c1 and c2 are both 0, if the only way to satisfy this\n7:58\nequation -- I mean you can always satisfy it by sitting\n8:02\neverything equal to 0.\n8:02\nBut if the only way to satisfy it is by making both of these\n8:06\nguys 0, then we're dealing with a\n8:08\nlinearly independent set.\n8:13\nLet's try to do some math.\n8:15\nAnd this'll just take us back to our Algebra 1 days.\n8:19\nIn order for this to be true, that means 2 times c1 plus 3\n8:25\ntimes c2 is equal to -- when I say this is equal to 0, it's\n8:29\nreally the 0 vector.\n8:30\nI can rewrite this as 0,0.\n8:34\nSo 2 times c1 plus 3 times c2 would be\n8:37\nequal to that 0 there.\n8:39\nAnd then we'd have 1 times c1 plus 2 times c2 is\n8:46\nequal to that 0.\n8:50\nAnd now this is just a system, two equations, two unknowns.\n8:53\nA couple of things we could do.\n8:55\nLet's just multiply this top equation by 1/2.\n9:02\nIf you multiply it by 1/2 you get c1 plus 3/2 plus 3/2 c2 is\n9:12\nequal to 0.\n9:15\nAnd then if we subtract the green equation from the red\n9:18\nequation this becomes 0.\n9:20\n2 minus 1 and 1/2-- 3/2 is 1 and 1/2 --of this is just 1/2\n9:25\nc2 is equal to 0.\n9:27\nAnd this is easy to solve.\n9:29\nc2 is equal to 0.\n9:32\nSo what's c1?\n9:33\nWell, just substitute this back in. c2 is equal to 0.\n9:36\nSo this is equal to 0.\n9:38\nSo c1 plus 0 is equal to 0.\n9:40\nSo c1 is also equal to 0.\n9:42\nWe could have substituted it back into that\n9:44\ntop equation as well.\n9:45\nSo the only solution to this equation involves both c1 and\n9:52\nc2 being equal to 0.\n9:54\nSo they both have to be 0.\n9:56\nSo this is a linearly independent set of vectors.\n10:04\nWhich means that neither of them are redundant\n10:06\nof the other one.\n10:07\nYou can't represent one as a combination of the other.\n10:10\nAnd since we have two vectors here, and they're linearly\n10:13\nindependent, we can actually know that this will span r2.\n10:22\nThe span of my r vectors is equal to r2.\n10:26\nIf one of these vectors was just some multiple of the\n10:29\nother, than the span would have been some line within r2,\n10:32\nnot all of.\n10:33\nBut now I can represent any vector in r2 as some\n10:35\ncombination of those.\n10:37\nLet's do another example.\n10:41\nLet me scroll to the right, because sometimes this thing,\n10:46\nwhen I go too far down, I haven't figured out why, when\n10:49\nI go too far down it starts messing up.\n10:51\nSo my next example is the set of vectors.\n10:56\nSo I have the vector 2,1.\n11:00\nI have the vector 3,2.\n11:04\nAnd I have the vector 1,2.\n11:08\nAnd I want to know are these linearly dependent or linearly\n11:11\nindependent.\n11:12\nSo I go to through the same drill.\n11:13\nI use that little theorem that I proved at the beginning of\n11:17\nthis video.\n11:19\nIn order for them to be linearly dependent there must\n11:24\nbe some set of weights that I can multiply these guys.\n11:28\nSo c1 times this vector plus c2 times this vector plus c3\n11:37\ntimes that vector, that will equal the 0 vector.\n11:43\nAnd if one of these is non-zero then we're dealing\n11:45\nwith a linearly dependent set of vectors.\n11:49\nAnd if all of them are 0, then it's independent.\n11:52\nLet's just do our linear algebra.\n12:00\nSo this means that 2 times c1 plus 3 times c2 plus c3 is\n12:10\nequal to that 0 up there.\n12:13\nAnd then if we do the bottom rows-- Remember when you\n12:15\nmultiply a scalar times a vector you multiply it by each\n12:17\nof these terms. So c1 times 1.\n12:19\n1c1 plus 2c2 plus 2c3 is equal to 0.\n12:29\nThere's a couple of giveaways on this problem.\n12:31\nIf you have three two-dimensional vectors, one\n12:34\nof them is going to be redundant.\n12:37\nBecause, in the very best case, even if you assume that\n12:41\nthat vector and that vector are linearly independent, then\n12:44\nthese would span r2.\n12:45\nWhich means that any point, any vector, in your\n12:49\ntwo-dimensional space can be represented by some\n12:51\ncombination of those two.\n12:53\nIn which case, this is going to be one of them because this\n12:56\nis just a vector in two-dimensional space.\n12:57\nSo it would be linearly dependent.\n12:59\nAnd then, if you say, well, these aren't linearly\n13:01\nindependent then, they're just multiples of each other.\n13:07\nIn which case, this would definitely be a linearly\n13:09\ndependent set.\n13:11\nWhen you see three vectors that are each only vectors in\n13:15\nr2, that are each two-dimensional vectors, it's\n13:17\na complete giveaway that this is linearly dependent.\n13:20\nBut I'm going to show it to you using our dependent, using\n13:25\nour little theorem here.\n13:27\nSo I'm going to show you that I can get non-zero c3's, c2's,\n13:30\nand c1's such that I can get a 0 here.\n13:34\nIf all of these had to be 0-- I mean you can always set them\n13:37\nequal to 0.\n13:37\nBut if they had to be equal to 0, then it would be linearly\n13:39\nindependent.\n13:41\nLet me just show you.\n13:43\nI can just pick some random c3.\n13:45\nLet me pick c3 to be equal to negative 1.\n13:49\nSo what would these two equations reduce to?\n13:51\nI mean you have just three unknowns and two equations, it\n13:53\nmeans you don't have enough constraints on your system.\n13:57\nSo if I just set c3-- I just pick that out of a hat.\n13:59\nI could have picked c3 to be anything.\n14:01\nBut if I set c3 to be equal to negative 1, what do these\n14:05\nequations become?\n14:06\nYou get 2c1 plus 3c2 minus 1 is equal to 0.\n14:12\nAnd you get c1 plus 2c2 minus 2 is equal to 0.\n14:19\nRight?\n14:19\n2 times minus 1.\n14:22\nWhat can I do here?\n14:24\nIf I multiply this second equation by 2, what do I get?\n14:28\nI get 2 plus 4c2 minus 4 is equal to 0.\n14:37\nAnd now let's subtract this equation from that equation.\n14:41\nSo the c1's cancel out.\n14:43\n3c2 minus 4c2 is minus c2.\n14:47\nAnd then minus 1 minus minus 4, so that's minus 1 plus 4.\n14:53\nThat's plus 3 is equal to 0.\n14:58\nAnd so we get our -- Let me make sure I got that right.\n15:06\nWe have a minus 1 minus a minus 4.\n15:10\nSo plus 4.\n15:11\nSo we have a plus 3.\n15:13\nSo that is a minus 2.\n15:20\nSo minus c2 is equal to minus 3 or c2 is equal to 3.\n15:28\nAnd if c2 is equal to 3 and c3 is equal to minus 1-- Let's\n15:32\njust substitute here, so we get c1 plus 2 times c2, so\n15:38\nplus 6, plus 2 times c3.\n15:41\nSo minus 2 is equal to 0.\n15:45\nc1 plus 4 is equal to 0.\n15:48\nc1 is equal to minus 4.\n15:54\nI'm giving you a combination of c's that\n15:56\nwill give us a 0 vector.\n15:58\nIf I multiply minus 4 times our first vector, 2,1, that's\n16:03\nc1, plus 3 times our second vector, 3,2 minus 1 times our\n16:13\nthird vector, 1,2 this should be equal to 0.\n16:16\nLet's verify it just for fun.\n16:18\nMinus 4 times 2 is minus 8 plus 9 minus 1.\n16:24\nYeah, that's minus 9 plus 9.\n16:26\nThat's 0.\n16:27\nMinus 4 times plus 6 minus 2 that's also 0.\n16:36\nSo we've just shown a linear combination of these vectors,\n16:39\nwhere actually none of the constants are 0.\n16:41\nBut all we had to show was that at least one of the\n16:43\nconstants had to be non-zero, and we actually showed all\n16:46\nthree of them were.\n16:47\nBut at least one of these had to be non-zero.\n16:49\nAnd I was able to satisfy this equation, I was able to make\n16:53\nthem into the zero vector.\n16:54\nSo this shows, this proves, that this is a linearly\n17:02\ndependent set of vectors.\n17:07\nWhich means one of the vectors is redundant.\n17:09\nAnd you can never just say, oh, this is the redundant\n17:11\nvector, because I can represent this as combination\n17:13\nof those two.\n17:14\nYou could just as easily pick this guy as the redundant\n17:16\nvector, and say, hey, I can represent this guy as the sum\n17:19\nof those two.\n17:20\nThere's not one bad apple in the bunch.\n17:23\nAny of them can be represented by the combination of some\n17:26\nother, by all of the rest of them.\n17:29\nSo hopefully you have a better intuition of linear dependence\n17:33\nand independence.\n17:33\nMaybe I'll continue.\n17:34\nI'll do a few more examples in the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn this video we're going to get introduced to the\n0:03\nPythagorean theorem, which is fun on its own.\n0:14\nBut you'll see as you learn more and more mathematics it's\n0:16\none of those cornerstone theorems of really all of math.\n0:21\nIt's useful in geometry, it's kind of the backbone\n0:24\nof trigonometry.\n0:26\nYou're also going to use it to calculate distances\n0:29\nbetween points.\n0:30\nSo it's a good thing to really make sure we know well.\n0:33\nSo enough talk on my end.\n0:35\nLet me tell you what the Pythagorean theorem is.\n0:38\nSo if we have a triangle, and the triangle has to be a right\n0:43\ntriangle, which means that one of the three angles in the\n0:49\ntriangle have to be 90 degrees.\n0:51\nAnd you specify that it's 90 degrees by drawing that\n0:54\nlittle box right there.\n0:55\nSo that right there is-- let me do this in a different\n0:58\ncolor-- a 90 degree angle.\n1:05\nOr, we could call it a right angle.\n1:09\nAnd a triangle that has a right angle in it is\n1:13\ncalled a right triangle.\n1:15\nSo this is called a right triangle.\n1:21\nNow, with the Pythagorean theorem, if we know two sides\n1:25\nof a right triangle we can always figure out\n1:28\nthe third side.\n1:30\nAnd before I show you how to do that, let me give you one\n1:34\nmore piece of terminology.\n1:36\nThe longest side of a right triangle is the side opposite\n1:43\nthe 90 degree angle-- or opposite the right angle.\n1:46\nSo in this case it is this side right here.\n1:49\nThis is the longest side.\n1:51\nAnd the way to figure out where that right triangle is, and\n1:55\nkind of it opens into that longest side.\n1:58\nThat longest side is called the hypotenuse.\n2:03\nAnd it's good to know, because we'll keep referring to it.\n2:05\nAnd just so we always are good at identifying the hypotenuse,\n2:09\nlet me draw a couple of more right triangles.\n2:12\nSo let's say I have a triangle that looks like that.\n2:17\nLet me draw it a little bit nicer.\n2:19\nSo let's say I have a triangle that looks like that.\n2:22\nAnd I were to tell you that this angle right\n2:24\nhere is 90 degrees.\n2:25\nIn this situation this is the hypotenuse, because it is\n2:29\nopposite the 90 degree angle.\n2:33\nIt is the longest side.\n2:34\nLet me do one more, just so that we're good at\n2:36\nrecognizing the hypotenuse.\n2:39\nSo let's say that that is my triangle, and this is the 90\n2:44\ndegree angle right there.\n2:45\nAnd I think you know how to do this already.\n2:47\nYou go right what it opens into.\n2:49\nThat is the hypotenuse.\n2:51\nThat is the longest side.\n2:57\nSo once you have identified the hypotenuse-- and let's say\n3:00\nthat that has length C.\n3:02\nAnd now we're going to learn what the Pythagorean\n3:03\ntheorem tells us.\n3:05\nSo let's say that C is equal to the length of the hypotenuse.\n3:08\nSo let's call this C-- that side is C.\n3:11\nLet's call this side right over here A.\n3:17\nAnd let's call this side over here B.\n3:21\nSo the Pythagorean theorem tells us that A squared-- so\n3:28\nthe length of one of the shorter sides squared-- plus\n3:32\nthe length of the other shorter side squared is going to\n3:36\nbe equal to the length of the hypotenuse squared.\n3:41\nNow let's do that with an actual problem, and you'll see\n3:43\nthat it's actually not so bad.\n3:45\nSo let's say that I have a triangle that looks like this.\n3:49\nLet me draw it.\n3:51\nLet's say this is my triangle.\n3:54\nIt looks something like this.\n3:57\nAnd let's say that they tell us that this is the right angle.\n4:00\nThat this length right here-- let me do this in different\n4:02\ncolors-- this length right here is 3, and that this\n4:06\nlength right here is 4.\n4:09\nAnd they want us to figure out that length right there.\n4:14\nNow the first thing you want to do, before you even apply the\n4:17\nPythagorean theorem, is to make sure you have your\n4:19\nhypotenuse straight.\n4:20\nYou make sure you know what you're solving for.\n4:23\nAnd in this circumstance we're solving for the hypotenuse.\n4:26\nAnd we know that because this side over here, it is the side\n4:30\nopposite the right angle.\n4:33\nIf we look at the Pythagorean theorem, this is C.\n4:36\nThis is the longest side.\n4:38\nSo now we're ready to apply the Pythagorean theorem.\n4:41\nIt tells us that 4 squared-- one of the shorter sides-- plus\n4:48\n3 squared-- the square of another of the shorter sides--\n4:53\nis going to be equal to this longer side squared-- the\n4:56\nhypotenuse squared-- is going to be equal to C squared.\n5:00\nAnd then you just solve for C.\n5:02\nSo 4 squared is the same thing as 4 times 4.\n5:06\nThat is 16.\n5:08\nAnd 3 squared is the same thing as 3 times 3.\n5:11\nSo that is 9.\n5:13\nAnd that is going to be equal to C squared.\n5:18\nNow what is 16 plus 9?\n5:20\nIt's 25.\n5:22\nSo 25 is equal to C squared.\n5:25\nAnd we could take the positive square root of both sides.\n5:29\nI guess, just if you look at it mathematically, it could\n5:30\nbe negative 5 as well.\n5:33\nBut we're dealing with distances, so we only care\n5:34\nabout the positive roots.\n5:37\nSo you take the principal root of both sides and\n5:41\nyou get 5 is equal to C.\n5:44\nOr, the length of the longest side is equal to 5.\n5:50\nNow, you can use the Pythagorean theorem, if we give\n5:52\nyou two of the sides, to figure out the third side no matter\n5:54\nwhat the third side is.\n5:55\nSo let's do another one right over here.\n5:59\nLet's say that our triangle looks like this.\n6:10\nAnd that is our right angle.\n6:12\nLet's say this side over here has length 12, and let's say\n6:17\nthat this side over here has length 6.\n6:21\nAnd we want to figure out this length right over there.\n6:27\nNow, like I said, the first thing you want to do is\n6:29\nidentify the hypotenuse.\n6:31\nAnd that's going to be the side opposite the right angle.\n6:34\nWe have the right angle here.\n6:35\nYou go opposite the right angle.\n6:37\nThe longest side, the hypotenuse, is right there.\n6:41\nSo if we think about the Pythagorean theorem-- that A\n6:46\nsquared plus B squared is equal to C squared-- 12\n6:50\nyou could view as C.\n6:52\nThis is the hypotenuse.\n6:54\nThe C squared is the hypotenuse squared.\n6:56\nSo you could say 12 is equal to C.\n6:59\nAnd then we could say that these sides, it doesn't matter\n7:00\nwhether you call one of them A or one of them B.\n7:02\nSo let's just call this side right here.\n7:04\nLet's say A is equal to 6.\n7:06\nAnd then we say B-- this colored B-- is equal\n7:11\nto question mark.\n7:12\nAnd now we can apply the Pythagorean theorem.\n7:15\nA squared, which is 6 squared, plus the unknown B squared is\n7:25\nequal to the hypotenuse squared-- is equal\n7:28\nto C squared.\n7:29\nIs equal to 12 squared.\n7:33\nAnd now we can solve for B.\n7:35\nAnd notice the difference here.\n7:36\nNow we're not solving for the hypotenuse.\n7:38\nWe're solving for one of the shorter sides.\n7:40\nIn the last example we solved for the hypotenuse.\n7:42\nWe solved for C.\n7:43\nSo that's why it's always important to recognize that A\n7:46\nsquared plus B squared plus C squared, C is the length\n7:49\nof the hypotenuse.\n7:49\nSo let's just solve for B here.\n7:51\nSo we get 6 squared is 36, plus B squared, is equal\n7:59\nto 12 squared-- this 12 times 12-- is 144.\n8:04\nNow we can subtract 36 from both sides of this equation.\n8:11\nThose cancel out.\n8:13\nOn the left-hand side we're left with just a B squared\n8:17\nis equal to-- now 144 minus 36 is what?\n8:23\n144 minus 30 is 114.\n8:27\nAnd then you subtract 6, is 108.\n8:30\nSo this is going to be 108.\n8:33\nSo that's what B squared is, and now we want to take the\n8:36\nprincipal root, or the positive root, of both sides.\n8:40\nAnd you get B is equal to the square root, the\n8:44\nprincipal root, of 108.\n8:48\nNow let's see if we can simplify this a little bit.\n8:50\nThe square root of 108.\n8:53\nAnd what we could do is we could take the prime\n8:54\nfactorization of 108 and see how we can\n8:56\nsimplify this radical.\n8:58\nSo 108 is the same thing as 2 times 54, which is the same\n9:07\nthing as 2 times 27, which is the same thing as 3 times 9.\n9:15\nSo we have the square root of 108 is the same thing as the\n9:19\nsquare root of 2 times 2 times-- well actually,\n9:24\nI'm not done.\n9:25\n9 can be factorized into 3 times 3.\n9:28\nSo it's 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 times 3.\n9:34\nAnd so, we have a couple of perfect squares in here.\n9:36\nLet me rewrite it a little bit neater.\n9:38\nAnd this is all an exercise in simplifying radicals that you\n9:41\nwill bump into a lot while doing the Pythagorean theorem,\n9:44\nso it doesn't hurt to do it right here.\n9:46\nSo this is the same thing as the square root of 2 times 2\n9:55\ntimes 3 times 3 times the square root of that last\n10:00\n3 right over there.\n10:02\nAnd this is the same thing.\n10:04\nAnd, you know, you wouldn't have to do all of\n10:05\nthis on paper.\n10:07\nYou could do it in your head.\n10:08\nWhat is this?\n10:09\n2 times 2 is 4.\n10:11\n4 times 9, this is 36.\n10:14\nSo this is the square root of 36 times the square root of 3.\n10:18\nThe principal root of 36 is 6.\n10:20\nSo this simplifies to 6 square roots of 3.\n10:25\nSo the length of B, you could write it as the square root of\n10:28\n108, or you could say it's equal to 6 times the\n10:34\nsquare root of 3.\n10:35\nThis is 12, this is 6.\n10:37\nAnd the square root of 3, well this is going to be a 1\n10:40\npoint something something.\n10:41\nSo it's going to be a little bit larger than 6.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- Let's delve into the world of mitochondria\n0:03\nwhich are probably my favorite organelle.\n0:07\nSo let's just have a little review of what mitochondria are\n0:10\nand then we can delve a little bit deeper\n0:11\ninto their structure.\n0:13\nSo let's just think about a cell\n0:15\nand not just any cell, but a eukaryotic cell.\n0:18\nSo that's the cellular membrane\n0:20\nand when people say a eukaryote or a eukaryotic cell\n0:23\nthey most typically say, \"Oh! That must have its nuclear DNA\n0:27\n\"in a membrane-bound nucleus.\" and that would be true,\n0:31\nso let's draw our membrane-bound nucleus.\n0:33\nThat's our nuclear membrane.\n0:35\nYou have your DNA in here,\n0:38\nso let's draw some DNA.\n0:39\nBut when we talk about eukaryotic cells,\n0:42\nwe're not just talking about a membrane-bound nucleus,\n0:44\nwe're also talking about other membrane-bound organelles\n0:47\nand in a close second place for a membrane-bound structure\n0:51\nthat is very important to the cell\n0:52\nwould be the mitochondria.\n0:55\nSo let's draw some mitochondria right over here.\n0:58\nSo I'll talk a little bit more about\n1:00\nwhat these little squiggly lines that I'm drawing\n1:02\ninside of the mitochondria are\n1:04\nand this is actually a little bit more\n1:05\nof a textbook visualization, as we'll learn\n1:06\nin a few minutes or seconds that we now have more\n1:09\nsophisticated visualizations of what's actually going on\n1:12\ninside of a mitochondria, but we haven't actually\n1:13\nanswered all of our questions,\n1:15\nbut you might have already learned that,\n1:17\nso let me make it clear, these are mitochondria.\n1:20\nThat's the plural.\n1:21\nIf we're just talking about one of them,\n1:22\nwe're talking about a mitochondrion.\n1:24\nThat's the singular of mitochondria.\n1:26\nBut you might have already learned,\n1:27\nsome time in your past or in another Khan Academy video,\n1:31\nthat these are viewed as the ATP factories for cells.\n1:35\nSo let me right it this way.\n1:38\nSo ATP factories.\n1:40\nA-T-P factories and if you watched the videos on ATP\n1:45\nor cellular respiration or other videos,\n1:48\nI'd repeatedly talk about how ATP is really the currency\n1:51\nfor energy in the cell that when it's in its ATP form\n1:55\nyou have adenosine triphosphate.\n1:57\nIf you pop one of the phosphate groups off,\n2:00\nyou pop one of the P's off, it release energy\n2:02\nand that's what your body uses to do all sort of things\n2:05\nfrom movement to thinking to all sorts of things\n2:08\nthat actually go on in your bodies,\n2:10\nso you can imagine mitochondria are really important\n2:12\nfor energy, for when the cell has to do things.\n2:16\nAnd that's why you'll find more mitochondria\n2:18\nin things like muscle cells, things that have to use\n2:21\na lot of energy.\n2:22\nNow before I get into the structure of mitochondria,\n2:25\nI wanna talk a little bit about its fascinating past\n2:28\nbecause we think of cells as the most basic unit of life\n2:31\nand that is true, that comes straight out of cell theory,\n2:33\nbut it turns out the most prevalent theory\n2:36\nof how mitochondria got into our cells\n2:39\nis that at one time the predecessors,\n2:43\nthe ancestors to our mitochondria,\n2:45\nwere free, independent organisms, microorganisms.\n2:49\nSo they're descendent from bacterial-like microorganisms\n2:54\nthat might have been living on their own\n2:57\nand they were maybe really good at processing energy\n2:59\nor maybe they were even good at other things,\n3:01\nbut at some point in the evolutionary past,\n3:04\nthey got ingested by what the ancestors of our cells\n3:08\nand instead of just being engulfed and being torn to shreds\n3:10\nand kind of being digested and eaten,\n3:12\nit was like, \"Hey, wait, if these things stick around,\n3:15\n\"those cells are more likely to survive\n3:17\n\"because they're able to help process glucose\n3:19\n\"or help generate more energy out of things.\"\n3:24\nAnd so the cells that were able to kind of live\n3:27\nin symbiosis have them kind of give a place\n3:30\nfor the mitochondria to live or the pre-mitochondria,\n3:33\nthe ancestor mitochondria, those survived\n3:35\nand then through kind of the processes of natural selection,\n3:38\nthis is what we now associate,\n3:41\nwe now associate eukaryotic cells\n3:43\nas having mitochondria,\n3:44\nso I find this whole idea of one organism being inside\n3:47\nof another organism in symbiosis even at the cellular level,\n3:52\nthat's kind of mind-boggling, but anyway,\n3:55\nI'll stop talking about that and now let's just talk\n3:57\nabout the present, let's talk about\n3:59\nwhat the actual structure of mitochondria are.\n4:03\nAnd I'll first draw kind of a simplified drawing\n4:06\nof a mitochondion and I'll draw a cross section.\n4:10\nSo, I'm gonna draw a cross section.\n4:13\nSo if we were to kind of cut it in half.\n4:15\nSo what I've drawn right over here\n4:16\nthis would be its outer membrane.\n4:18\nThis is the outer membrane right over here\n4:24\nand we label that.\n4:25\nOuter membrane.\n4:28\nAnd all of these membranes that I'm gonna draw,\n4:30\nthey're all going to be phospholipid bilayers.\n4:34\nSo if I were to zoom in right over here,\n4:38\nso let me, if I were to zoom in,\n4:41\nwe would see a bilayer of phospholipids.\n4:44\nSo you have your\n4:47\nhydrophilic heads facing outwards,\n4:50\nhydrophilic heads facing outwards\n4:53\nand your hydrophobic tails facing inwards.\n4:57\nSo.\n5:00\nYou see something just like that,\n5:02\nso they're all phospholipid bilayers.\n5:05\nBut they aren't just phospholipids.\n5:07\nAll of these membranes have all sorts of proteins imbedded,\n5:10\nI mean cells are incredibly complex structures,\n5:13\nbut even organelles like mitochondria have a fascinating,\n5:16\nI guess you would say sub-structure to them.\n5:18\nThey themselves have all sorts of interesting proteins,\n5:21\nenzymes imbedded in their membranes\n5:23\nand are able to help regulate what's going on\n5:25\ninside and outside of these organelles.\n5:28\nAnd one of the proteins that you have in the outer membrane\n5:34\nof mitochondria, they're called porins\n5:38\nand porins aren't found only in mitochondria,\n5:40\nbut they're kind of tunnel proteins,\n5:41\nthey're structured so they kind of form a hole\n5:44\nin the outer membrane.\n5:46\nSo I'm drawing them the best that I can.\n5:49\nThese are porins\n5:51\nand what's interesting about porins is they don't allow\n5:54\nlarge molecules to pass through passively,\n5:57\nbut small molecules like sugars or ions can pass passively\n6:02\nthrough the porins.\n6:04\nAnd so, because of that, your ion concentration\n6:06\nand well, I should actually say,\n6:07\nyour small molecule concentrations tend\n6:09\nto be similar on either side of this membrane,\n6:12\non either side of this outer membrane.\n6:15\nBut that's not the only membrane involved\n6:17\nin a mitochondrion.\n6:18\nWe also have a inner membrane.\n6:20\nI'll do that in yellow.\n6:22\nWe also have a inner membrane\n6:24\nand I'm gonna draw it with a textbook model first\n6:27\nand then we'll talk a little bit about,\n6:28\nsince we think this model is not quite right,\n6:32\nbut in this, so we have this inner membrane,\n6:36\ninner membrane,\n6:41\nand this inner membrane has these folds in it\n6:45\nto increase their surface area\n6:46\nand the surface area is really important\n6:48\nfor the inner membrane because that's\n6:50\nwhere the processes of the electron transport chain\n6:53\noccur across, essentially, these membranes.\n6:55\nSo you want this extra surface area\n6:57\nso you can essentially have more of that going on.\n7:00\nAnd these folds have a name.\n7:02\nSo if you're talking about one of them,\n7:04\nif you're talking about one of these folds,\n7:05\nyou're talking about a crista,\n7:10\nbut if you're talking about more than one of them,\n7:14\nyou would call that a cristae, cristae.\n7:18\nSometimes I've seen the pronunciation of this\n7:20\nas cristae, cristae or cristae, that's plural for crista.\n7:24\nThese are just folds in the inner membrane\n7:27\nand once again the inner membrane is also\n7:30\na phospholipid bilayer.\n7:33\nNow inside of the inner membranes,\n7:36\nso between the outer membrane and the inner membrane\n7:40\nyou could imagine what this is gonna be called.\n7:42\nThat space is called the intermembrane space,\n7:46\nnot too creative of a name, intermembrane space\n7:51\nand because of the porins,\n7:53\nthe small molecule concentration\n7:56\nof the intermembrane space and then outside\n7:58\nof the mitochondria,\n8:02\nout in the cytosol,\n8:03\nthose concentrations are gonna be similar,\n8:05\nbut then the inner membrane does not have the porins\n8:08\nin it and so you can actually have a different concentration\n8:11\non either side and that is essential\n8:12\nfor the electron transport chain.\n8:14\nThe electron transport chain really culminates\n8:16\nwith hydrogen, a hydrogen ion gradient\n8:19\nbeing built between the two sides\n8:20\nand then they flow down that gradient through a protein\n8:24\ncalled ATP synthase which helps us synthesize ATP,\n8:28\nbut we'll talk more about that maybe in this video\n8:29\nor in a future video,\n8:31\nbut let's finish talking about the different parts\n8:33\nof a mitochondrion.\n8:36\nSo inside the inner membrane you have\n8:40\nthis area right over here is called the matrix.\n8:42\nIt's called, let me use this in a different color,\n8:45\nthis is\n8:48\nthe matrix\n8:49\nand it's called the matrix 'cause it actually has\n8:50\na much higher protein concentration,\n8:53\nit's actually more viscous than the cytosol\n8:58\nthat would be outside of the\n9:03\nmitochondria.\n9:05\nSo this right over here is the matrix.\n9:07\nWhen we we talk about cellular respiration,\n9:09\ncellular respiration has many phases in it.\n9:11\nWe talk about glycolysis.\n9:13\nGlycolysis is actually occurring in the cytosol.\n9:15\nSo glycolysis can occur in the cytosol.\n9:20\nGlycolysis.\n9:22\nBut the other major phases of cellular respiration.\n9:26\nRemember we talk about the citric acid cycle\n9:28\nalso known as the Krebs cycle,\n9:29\nthat is occuring in the matrix.\n9:32\nSo Krebs cycle\n9:35\nis occuring in the matrix\n9:37\nand then I said the electron transport chain\n9:40\nwhich is really what's responsible for producing\n9:42\nthe bulk of the ATP, that is happening through proteins\n9:46\nthat are straddling the inner membrane\n9:49\nor straddling the cristae right over here.\n9:55\nNow we're just done.\n9:56\nProbably one of the most fascinating parts of mitochondria,\n9:59\nwe said that we think that they are descendent\n10:01\nfrom these ancient independent lifeforms\n10:04\nand in order to be an ancient independent life form,\n10:06\nthey'd would have to have some information,\n10:09\nsome way to actually transmit their genetic information\n10:13\nand, it turns out, mitochondria actually have\n10:16\ntheir own genetic information.\n10:18\nThey have mitochondrial DNA\n10:19\nand they often don't just even have one copy of it,\n10:21\nthey have multiple copies of it\n10:23\nand they're in loops very similar to bacterial DNA.\n10:28\nIn fact, they have a lot in common\n10:29\nwith bacterial DNA and that's why we think\n10:30\nthat the ancestor to mitochondria that live independently\n10:34\nwas probably a form of bacteria or related to bacteria\n10:38\nin some way.\n10:39\nSo this is, this right over there,\n10:41\nthat is the loop of mitochondrial DNA.\n10:43\nSo all the DNA that's inside of you, the bulk of it,\n10:46\nyes, it is in your nuclear DNA, but you still have\n10:50\na little bit of DNA in your mitochondria\n10:52\nand what's interesting is your mitochondrial DNA,\n10:55\nyour mitochondria, are inherited, essentially,\n10:59\nfrom your mother's side, because when a egg is fertilized,\n11:05\na human egg has tons of mitochondria in it\n11:09\nand I'm obviously not drawing all of the things\n11:11\nin the human egg.\n11:12\nIt obviously has a nucleus and all of that.\n11:14\nThe sperm has some mitochondria in it,\n11:17\nyou could imagine it needs to be able\n11:20\nto win that very competitive fight\n11:22\nto get to fertilize the egg,\n11:24\nbut the current theory is all or most of that\n11:26\ngets digested or dissolved once it actually gets\n11:30\ninto the egg.\n11:31\nAnd anyway, the egg itself has way more mitochondria,\n11:34\nso the DNA in your mitochondria is\n11:38\nfrom your mother or is essentially from your mother's side\n11:42\nand that's actually used, mitochondrial DNA,\n11:43\nwhen people talk about kind of an ancient Eve\n11:45\nor tracing back to having kind\n11:47\nof one common mother,\n11:48\npeople are looking at the mitochondrial DNA,\n11:52\nso it is actually quite, quite fascinating.\n11:56\nNow I said a little bit earlier,\n11:58\nand you know, obviously, it has its own DNA\n12:00\nand then because it has its own DNA\n12:02\nit's able to synthesize some of its own RNA,\n12:04\nits own ribosomes, so it also has ribosomes here.\n12:07\nBut it doesn't synthesize all of the proteins\n12:10\nthat are sitting in mitochondria.\n12:11\nA lot of those are still synthesized by\n12:14\nor encoded for by your nuclear DNA\n12:17\nand are actually synthesized outside of the mitochondria\n12:19\nand then make their way into the mitochondria,\n12:22\nbut mitochondria are these fascinating, fascinating things.\n12:25\nThey're these little creatures living in symbiosis\n12:29\nin our cells and they're able to replicate themselves\n12:32\nand I don't know, I find all of this mind boggling.\n12:34\nBut anyway.\n12:35\nI said that this was the textbook model\n12:37\nbecause it turns out, when you look\n12:39\nat a micrograph, a picture of mitochondria,\n12:43\nit seems to back up this textbook model\n12:45\nof these folds, these cristae just kind of folding in,\n12:49\nbut when we've been able to have more sophisticated\n12:51\nvisualizations it actually turns out\n12:53\nthat it's not just these simple folds\n12:55\nthat the inner membrane essentially hooks\n12:59\ninto the matrix and it turns out it has\n13:02\nthese little tunnels that connect the space\n13:05\ninside of the cristae to the intermembrane space.\n13:10\nSo I like to think about this because it makes you realize,\n13:12\nyou know, we look in textbooks and we take these things\n13:14\nlike mitochondria for granted, like, \"Oh yeah, of course.\n13:17\n\"That's where ATP factories are,\"\n13:18\nbut it's still an area for visualization research\n13:21\nto fully understand exactly how they work\n13:24\nand even how they are structured\n13:25\nthat this Baffle Model where you see these cristae\n13:28\nkind of just coming in and out of the different sides.\n13:31\nThis is actually no longer the accepted model\n13:33\nfor the actual visualization, the structure of mitochondria.\n13:36\nSomething more like this, something more where\n13:39\nyou have this cristae junction model\n13:42\nwhere you have, if I were to draw a cross section\n13:46\nwhere this is the,\n13:50\nI drew the outer membrane and the inner membrane,\n13:52\nI'll just draw has these little tunnels\n13:54\nto the actual space inside of the cristae.\n13:59\nThis is actually now the more accepted visualization,\n14:03\nso I want you to appreciate\n14:04\nthat when in Biology, you read something in a textbook\n14:06\nyou kind of say, \"Oh, people have figured all\n14:08\n\"of this stuff out,\" but people are still think about,\n14:10\n\"Well, how does this structure work?\n14:11\n\"What is the actual structure?\" and then,\n14:12\n\"How does it actually let this organelle,\n14:14\n\"this fascinating organelle do all of the things\n14:16\n\"that it needs to do?\"",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Instructor] Let's try a hard one.\n0:01\nThis one's a classic.\n0:02\nLet's say you have two charges,\n0:03\npositive eight nanoCoulombs and negative eight nanoCoulombs,\n0:06\nand instead of asking what's the electric field\n0:08\nsomewhere in between, which is essentially\n0:10\na one-dimensional problem, we're gonna ask,\n0:12\nwhat's the electric field up here, at this point, P?\n0:15\nNow, this is a two-dimensional problem\n0:17\nbecause if we wanna find the net electric field\n0:19\nup here, the magnitude n direction\n0:22\nof the net electric field at this point,\n0:24\nwe approach it the same way initially.\n0:26\nWe say alright, each charge is gonna create a field\n0:29\nup here that goes in a certain direction.\n0:30\nThis positive charge creates a field\n0:32\nup here that goes radially away from it,\n0:34\nand radially away from this positive\n0:36\nat point P is something like this.\n0:39\nI'll call this electric field blue E\n0:41\nbecause it's created by this blue positive charge,\n0:43\nand this negative charge creates its own electric field\n0:46\nat that point that goes radially into the negative,\n0:49\nand radially into the negative\n0:50\nis gonna look something like this.\n0:52\nI'll call this electric field yellow E\n0:55\nbecause it's created by the yellow electric field.\n0:57\nSo far so good.\n0:58\nSame approach, but now things get a little weird.\n1:00\nLook, these fields aren't even pointing\n1:02\nin the same direction.\n1:03\nThey're lying in this two-dimensional plane,\n1:06\nand we wanna find the net electric field.\n1:08\nSo what we have to do in these 2D electric field problems\n1:10\nis break up the electric fields into their components.\n1:13\nIn other words, the field created by this positive charge\n1:16\nis gonna have a horizontal component,\n1:17\nand that's gonna point to the right.\n1:19\nAnd I'll call that blue E x because it was the horizontal\n1:22\ncomponent created by the blue, positive charge.\n1:25\nAnd this electric field is gonna have a vertical\n1:27\ncomponent, that's gonna point upward.\n1:28\nI'll call that blue E y.\n1:30\nAnd similarly, for the electric field this negative charge\n1:32\ncreates, it has a horizontal component\n1:35\nthat points to the right.\n1:36\nWe'll call that yellow E x, and a vertical component,\n1:39\nbut this vertical component points downward.\n1:41\nI'll call that yellow E y.\n1:43\nWhat do we do with all these components\n1:45\nto find the net electric field?\n1:47\nTypically what you do in these 2D electric problems\n1:50\nis focus on finding the components\n1:52\nof the net electric field in each direction separately.\n1:55\nWe divide and conquer.\n1:56\nWe're gonna ask, what's the horizontal component\n1:59\nof the net electric field, and what's\n2:00\nthe vertical component of the net electric field?\n2:03\nAnd then once we know these, we can combine them\n2:04\nusing the Pythagorean theorem if we want to,\n2:07\nto get the magnitude of that net electric field.\n2:09\nBut we're kind of in luck in this problem.\n2:11\nThere's a certain amount of symmetry\n2:13\nin this problem, and when there's a certain amount\n2:15\nof symmetry, you can save a lot of time.\n2:17\nWhat I mean by that is that both\n2:18\nof these charges have the same magnitude of charge.\n2:21\nAnd because this point, P, lies directly\n2:22\nin the middle of them, the distance\n2:24\nfrom the charge to point P is gonna be the same\n2:27\nas the distance from the negative charge to point P,\n2:29\nso both of these charges create an electric field\n2:31\nat this point of equal magnitude.\n2:33\nThe fields just point in different directions,\n2:36\nand what that means is that this positive charge\n2:38\nwill create an electric field that has\n2:39\nsome vertical component upward of some positive amount.\n2:43\nWe don't know exactly how much that is,\n2:44\nbut it'll be a positive number because it points up,\n2:46\nand this negative charge is gonna create\n2:48\nan electric field that has a vertical component downward,\n2:51\nwhich is gonna be negative, but it's gonna have\n2:52\nthe same magnitude as the vertical component\n2:54\nof the blue electric field.\n2:56\nIn other words, the field created by the positive charge\n2:59\nis just as upward as the field created\n3:01\nby the negative charge is downward.\n3:04\nSo when you add those up, when you add\n3:05\nup these two vertical components to find the vertical\n3:08\ncomponent of the net electric field,\n3:10\nyou're just gonna get zero.\n3:12\nThey're gonna cancel completely,\n3:14\nwhich is nice because that means we only have\n3:15\nto worry about the horizontal components.\n3:18\nThese will not cancel.\n3:19\nHow come these don't cancel?\n3:20\nBecause they're both pointing to the right.\n3:22\nIf one was pointing right and the other was left,\n3:25\nthen the horizontal components would cancel,\n3:26\nbut that's not what happens here.\n3:28\nThese components combine to form a total component\n3:30\nin the x direction that's larger than either one of them.\n3:34\nIn fact, it's gonna be twice as big\n3:35\nbecause each charge creates the same amount\n3:38\nof electric field in this x direction\n3:40\nbecause of the symmetry of this problem.\n3:42\nSo we've reduced this problem to just finding\n3:44\nthe horizontal component of the net electric field.\n3:47\nTo do that, we need the horizontal components\n3:48\nof each of these individual electric fields.\n3:51\nIf I can find the horizontal component\n3:53\nof the field created by the positive charge,\n3:55\nthat's gonna be a positive contribution\n3:57\nto the total electric field, since this points\n3:59\nto the right, and I'd add that\n4:01\nto the horizontal component of the yellow electric field\n4:04\nbecause it also points to the right,\n4:06\neven though the charge creating that field is negative,\n4:08\nthe horizontal component of that field is positive\n4:11\nbecause it points to the right.\n4:13\nSo if I can get both of these,\n4:14\nI will just add these up, and I'd get my total\n4:16\nelectric field in the x direction.\n4:18\nHow do I get these?\n4:19\nHow do I determine these horizontal components?\n4:21\nWell, to get the horizontal component\n4:22\nof this blue electric field, I first need\n4:24\nto find what's the magnitude of this blue electric field.\n4:28\nWe know the formula for that.\n4:29\nI'll write it over here.\n4:30\nThe magnitude of the electric field\n4:31\nis always k Q over r squared.\n4:34\nSo for this blue field, we'll say that E\n4:36\nis equal to nine times 10 to the ninth,\n4:39\nand the charge is eight nanoCoulombs.\n4:42\nNano means 10 to the negative ninth.\n4:44\nAnd then we divide by the r, but what's the r in this case?\n4:47\nIt's not four or three.\n4:49\nRemember, the r in that electric field formula\n4:51\nis always from the charge to the point you're trying\n4:54\nto determine the electric field at.\n4:55\nSo r is this.\n4:57\nThis distance is r.\n4:58\nHow do we figure out what this is?\n5:00\nWell, we're kind of in luck.\n5:01\nIf you know about three, four, five triangles,\n5:03\nlook at, this forms a three, this side is three,\n5:06\nmeters, and this side is four meters.\n5:08\nThat means that this side automatically\n5:09\nwe know is five meters.\n5:11\nIf you're not comfortable with that,\n5:12\nyou can always do the Pythagorean theorem.\n5:14\nPythagorean theorem says that a squared\n5:17\nplus b squared equals c squared for a right triangle,\n5:19\nwhich is what we have here.\n5:21\nA is this side, three.\n5:22\nB is the four meter side.\n5:24\nAnd then c would be r, I'll call that r squared.\n5:28\nAnd if you solve this for r, nine plus 16,\n5:30\nsquare root gives you r is five meters, just like we said.\n5:34\nBut if you know three, four, five triangles,\n5:35\nit's kinda nice because you could just quote that.\n5:37\nAnd that's the r we're gonna use up here.\n5:39\nWe'll use five meters squared,\n5:41\nwhich, if you calculate, you get\n5:42\nthat the electric field is 2.88 Newtons per Coulomb.\n5:47\nThis is the magnitude of the electric field\n5:49\ncreated at this point, P, by the positive charge.\n5:52\nHow do we get the horizontal component of that field?\n5:54\nThere's a few ways to do it.\n5:56\nOne way to do it is first just find this angle here.\n5:59\nIf we could find what that angle is,\n6:01\nwe can do trigonometry to get this horizontal component.\n6:04\nHow do I find this angle?\n6:05\nWell, you note that that angle's gonna be\n6:07\nthe same as this angle down here.\n6:09\nThese are gonna be similar angles\n6:11\nbecause I've got horizontal lines\n6:13\nand then this diagonal line just continues right through.\n6:15\nSo this angle is the same as this angle,\n6:17\nso if I could find this angle here,\n6:19\nI've found that angle up top.\n6:20\nHow do I get this angle?\n6:22\nI know each side of this triangle,\n6:23\nso I can use either sine, cosine, or tangent.\n6:26\nI'm just gonna use tangent.\n6:28\nWe'll say that tangent of that angle\n6:30\nis defined always to be the opposite over adjacent.\n6:33\nWe know the opposite side to this angle\n6:36\nis four meters, and the adjacent side was three meters,\n6:39\nso tangent theta's gonna equal 4/3.\n6:42\nHow do we get theta?\n6:43\nWe say that theta's going to equal\n6:45\nthe inverse tangent of 4/3.\n6:48\nWe basically take inverse tangent of both sides.\n6:51\nWe get theta on the left, and if you plug this\n6:53\ninto your calculator, you get 53.1 degrees.\n6:57\nSo that's what this angle is right here.\n6:58\nThis is 53.1 degrees, but that means this angle up here\n7:02\nis also 53.1 degrees because these are the same angle.\n7:06\nThis horizontal component is not the same\n7:08\nas this three meters?\n7:09\nAnd this diagonal electric field is not the same\n7:12\nas five meters, but the angle between those components\n7:15\nare the same as the angle between these length components.\n7:18\nSo what do I do to get this horizontal component?\n7:20\nThis is the adjacent side to this angle,\n7:22\nso this E x is adjacent to that angle.\n7:25\nWe're gonna use cosine.\n7:26\nWe're gonna say that cosine of 53.1 degrees\n7:30\nis gonna be equal to the adjacent side, which is E x.\n7:33\nWe'll write this as E x divided\n7:35\nby the hypotenuse, and we found the hypotenuse.\n7:38\nThis is the magnitude of the total\n7:40\nelectric field right here, which is the hypotenuse\n7:42\nof this triangle, so that's 2.88.\n7:45\nAnd we get that E x is going to be 2.88 Newtons\n7:49\nper Coulomb times cosine of 53.1,\n7:52\nwhich, if you plug that into the calculator\n7:54\nis gonna give you 1.73 Newtons per Coulomb.\n7:59\nThis is how much electric field\n8:00\nthe positive charge creates in the x direction.\n8:03\nThat's what this component up here is.\n8:05\nThis is 1.73 Newtons per Coulomb.\n8:08\nSo that's what this is.\n8:09\nThat's what I'm gonna plug in here.\n8:10\nTo get this horizontal component\n8:11\nof the yellow field created by the negative charge,\n8:14\nyou could go through the whole thing again\n8:16\nor you could notice that because\n8:18\nof symmetry, this horizontal component\n8:20\nhas to be the exact same as the horizontal component\n8:23\ncreated by the positive charge.\n8:24\nThey're both 1.73, and they're both positive\n8:27\nbecause both of these components point to the right.\n8:30\nSo to get the total electric field\n8:32\nin the x direction, we'll take 1.73\n8:35\nfrom the positive charge and we'll add that\n8:37\nto the horizontal component from the negative charge,\n8:39\nwhich is also positive 1.73, to get\n8:42\na horizontal component in the x direction\n8:44\nof the net electric field equal to\n8:47\n3.46 Newtons per Coulomb.\n8:51\nThis is the horizontal component\n8:53\nof the net electric field at that point.\n8:56\nWe basically took both of these values and added them up,\n8:59\nwhich, essentially is just one of them times two.\n9:01\nAnd now you might be worried though, this is just\n9:03\nthe horizontal component of the net electric field.\n9:05\nHow do we get the magnitude of the total net electric field?\n9:09\nWell, this is gonna be the same value\n9:10\nbecause since there was no vertical component\n9:13\nof the electric field, the horizontal component\n9:15\nis gonna be equal to the magnitude\n9:17\nof the total electric field at that point.\n9:20\nIf there was a vertical component\n9:21\nof the electric field, we'd have\n9:22\nto do the Pythagorean theorem to get the total magnitude\n9:25\nof the net electric field, but since there was only\n9:27\na horizontal component, and these\n9:29\nvertical components canceled, the total electric field's\n9:32\njust gonna point to the right, and it will be equal\n9:35\nto two times one of these horizontal components,\n9:38\nwhich, when you add them up,\n9:39\ngives you 3.46 Newtons per Coulomb.\n9:43\nThat's the magnitude of the net electric field,\n9:45\nand the direction would be straight to the right.\n9:47\nSo recapping, when you have a 2D electric field problem,\n9:50\ndraw the field created by each charge,\n9:52\nbreak those fields up into their individual components.\n9:56\nIf there's any symmetry involved,\n9:57\nfigure out which component cancels,\n9:59\nand then to find the net electric field,\n10:01\nuse the component that doesn't cancel,\n10:03\nand determine the contribution\n10:05\nfrom each charge in that direction.\n10:07\nAdd or subtract them accordingly,\n10:09\nbased on whether those components point\n10:10\nto the right or to the left, and that will give you\n10:13\nyour net electric field at that point,\n10:15\ncreated by both charges.",

    "question_type": "MCQ",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's do a few more examples with the ideal gas equation.\n0:04\nSo we have pressure times volume is equal to the number\n0:08\nof molecules we have in moles times the ideal gas constant\n0:13\ntimes temperature in Kelvin.\n0:15\nAnd I just got a comment on one of the videos saying\n0:17\nit made sense except for the fact that\n0:20\nR seems kind of like this mysterious thing in here.\n0:24\nAnd the way you think about R\n0:25\n-- let me rearrange this a little bit.\n0:27\nLet me write it as pressure times volume\n0:28\nis equal to R times nT.\n0:33\nSo we've established, or hopefully we've established,\n0:35\nthe intuition that the pressure times the volume\n0:37\nshould be proportional to essentially\n0:40\nthe total energy we have in the system.\n0:42\nTemperature is average energy, or energy per molecule,\n0:47\nand this is the total number molecules we had.\n0:49\nWhat R is, the ideal gas constant is,\n0:52\nwhen you multiply moles times Kelvin, you get mole Kelvin.\n0:58\nAnd with pressure times volume,\n1:00\nit's force per area times the volume.\n1:03\nYou get force times distance,\n1:04\nor force times one dimension of distance,\n1:07\nwhich is joules, so this is in joules.\n1:11\nSo what the ideal gas constant essentially does is it converts\n1:14\n-- we know that this is proportional to this,\n1:17\nbut it sets the exact constant of proportionality\n1:21\nand it also makes sure we get the units right,\n1:23\nso that's all it is.\n1:24\nIt just helps us translate from a world dealing\n1:27\nwith moles and Kelvins to a world of dealing with,\n1:30\nwell, in this case, atmospheres and liters,\n1:33\nor bars and meters cubed,\n1:37\nor kilopascals and meters cubed.\n1:39\nBut no matter what the units\n1:40\nof the pressure and the volume are,\n1:41\nthe whole unit of pressure\n1:43\ntimes volume is going to be joules.\n1:44\nSo it's just a translation between the two\n1:46\nand we know that they're proportional.\n1:48\nNow, with that said, let's do some more problems.\n1:50\nSo let's say we want to know how many grams of oxygen.\n1:56\nSo we want to know grams of O2. O2 in grams.\n2:02\nSo how many grams of O2 are in a 300-milliliter container\n2:09\nthat has a pressure of 12 atmospheres\n2:14\nand the temperature is 10 degrees Celsius.\n2:20\nWell, we've already broken out our ideal gas equation.\n2:25\nLet's see, pressure is 12 atmospheres.\n2:28\nSo we can say 12.\n2:30\nI'll keep the units there.\n2:32\n12 atmospheres times the volume.\n2:35\nThe volume should be in liters, so this is 300 milliliters,\n2:39\nor 300 thousandths or 3 tenths.\n2:43\nSo that's 0.3 liters.\n2:48\n300 one thousandths of a liter is 0.3 liters.\n2:52\nAnd that is equal to the number of moles we have of this,\n2:57\nand that's what we need to figure out.\n2:58\nIf we know the number of moles, we know the number of grams.\n3:00\nSo this is equal to n times R.\n3:04\nNow which R should we use?\n3:06\nWe're dealing with liters and atmospheres.\n3:08\nWe'll deal with this one.\n3:13\nTimes 0.082.\n3:16\nAnd what's our temperature?\n3:17\nIt's 10 degrees Celsius.\n3:19\nWe always have to do everything in Kelvin.\n3:20\nSo it's 283 degrees Kelvin.\n3:25\nSo all we have to solve for is n.\n3:28\nWe just have to divide both sides\n3:29\nof this equation by this right here,\n3:31\nand so we have n is equal to 12 atmospheres\n3:37\n-- I'm just swapping the sides\n3:38\n-- times 0.3 liters divided by 0.082 times 283 degrees.\n3:47\nOur answer will be in moles.\n3:50\nAnd if you want to verify that,\n3:52\nyou can plug in all the units\n3:54\nand use units for the ideal gas constant.\n3:57\nThe number of moles we're dealing with,\n4:01\nso it's 12 times 0.3 divided by 0.082 divided by 283\n4:11\nis equal to 0.155 moles. It's equal to 0.155 moles.\n4:22\nNow how many grams are in one mole of an oxygen molecule?\n4:31\nSo one mole of O2, well, we know oxygen's atomic mass.\n4:39\nIt's 16.\n4:40\nOne molecule of oxygen, of gaseous oxygen,\n4:44\nhas two atoms in it, so it has an atomic mass of 32.\n4:51\nSo it's molar mass, it's mass per mole,\n4:56\nis going to be 32 grams.\n4:58\nNow we don't have one mole.\n4:59\nWe have 0.155 moles.\n5:02\nSo to figure out how many grams we have,\n5:04\nwe multiply 32 grams per mole times 0.155 moles,\n5:21\nand we'll get our answer.\n5:23\nSo let's do that.\n5:24\nSo we have 32 times 0.155 is equal to 4.96 grams,\n5:35\nor roughly 5 grams.\n5:37\nSo we have approximately 5 grams of molecular oxygen.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's say I'm over here.\n0:01\nI'm going to do two scenarios.\n0:03\nSo I'm an observer over here.\n0:04\nThis is me.\n0:06\nAnd then maybe even better, I should just draw my eyeball\n0:10\nbecause we're going to be observing light.\n0:12\nSo I'm just going to draw my eyeball.\n0:15\nSo this is me in the first scenario or this\n0:18\nis one of my eyeballs.\n0:20\nAnd then this is one of my eyeballs\n0:21\nin the second scenario.\n0:24\nNow in the first scenario-- so let me draw it--\n0:26\nso in both scenarios, we're going to have an object.\n0:28\nWe're going to have some type of source of light.\n0:31\nBut in the first scenario, relative to me,\n0:35\nthe source of light will not be moving.\n0:37\nWhile in the second scenario, the source\n0:38\nof light-- just for the sake of discussion, just for fun--\n0:43\nwill be moving at half the speed of light.\n0:45\nUnimaginably fast speed, but let's just assuming that it is.\n0:49\nSo it's moving at-- it has a velocity of 1/2\n0:52\nthe speed of light, 1/2 light speed away from me\n1:02\nwho is the observer.\n1:05\nNow let's just imagine what would happen.\n1:07\nThey're both emitting light.\n1:08\nSo and they're both going to start\n1:09\nemitting light at the exact same time.\n1:12\nAnd when they start emitting light,\n1:14\nthey're both at the exact same distance from my eye.\n1:18\nThe only difference is is that this\n1:19\nis stationary, relative to me, while this is moving away\n1:23\nfrom me at half the speed of light.\n1:26\nSo let's say that after some period of time,\n1:29\nthat the light wave from this source reaches my eye.\n1:35\nAnd then it looks something like this.\n1:36\nI'll try my best to draw it.\n1:40\nSo let's say I have-- I want to draw a couple of wavelengths\n1:42\nhere.\n1:43\nSo let's say that's half a wavelength.\n1:45\nThat's a full wavelength.\n1:47\nThat's another half, a full wavelength, another half,\n1:51\nfull wavelength, and then a half, and then\n1:53\na full wavelength.\n1:54\nSo let me see if I can draw that.\n1:55\nSo it would look like full wavelength,\n2:00\nfull wavelength, full wave length.\n2:04\nThis is not easy to do.\n2:05\nAnd then you got another full wavelength.\n2:07\nSo it would look something like that, the actual waveform.\n2:11\nAnd so the front of the wave form is just getting to my eye.\n2:16\nAnd then as the wave forms keep going past my eye,\n2:20\nmy eye will perceive some type of a wave length or frequency\n2:23\nand perceive it to be some type of color,\n2:25\nassuming that we're in the visible part\n2:27\nof the electromagnetic spectrum.\n2:28\nNow let's think about what's going\n2:30\nto happen with this source.\n2:31\nSo the first thing is is that the front of the wave form\n2:34\nis going to reach me at the exact same time.\n2:36\nOne of those neat and amazing things about light travelling\n2:41\nin general, or especially in a vacuum,\n2:43\nit doesn't matter that this is moving away from me at half\n2:47\nthe speed of light.\n2:48\nThe light will still move towards me\n2:50\nat the speed of light.\n2:52\nIt's absolute.\n2:53\nIt doesn't matter if this is going away at 0.9\n2:55\nthe speed of light.\n2:56\nThe light will still travel to me at the speed of light.\n3:00\nAnd it's very unintuitive.\n3:01\nBecause in our everyday sense, if I'm moving away from you\n3:05\nat half the speed of a bullet and I shoot a bullet,\n3:07\nthe bullet will only move towards you\n3:09\nat-- it'll kind of-- that half of its velocity\n3:12\nwill be subtracted.\n3:13\nAnd it'll only move towards me at half of its normal velocity,\n3:17\nrelative to whether it was stationary,\n3:18\nbut not the case with the light.\n3:20\nSo with that out of the way, let's think\n3:22\nabout what the wave form would look like.\n3:24\nSo by the time the light reached here,\n3:27\nwe need to think of-- let me actually redraw this over here.\n3:29\nLet me redraw this eyeball right over here.\n3:37\nSo this is me again.\n3:38\nSo by the time the light reaches my eye-- so they both started\n3:42\nemitting the light at the exact same time--\n3:44\nthis guy has traveled half this distance.\n3:47\nIf it took light a certain amount of time to get this far,\n3:52\nthis guy will get half as far in that same amount of time.\n3:54\nSo by the time the light reaches my eye,\n3:57\nthis guy will have traveled about half that distance.\n4:00\nSo he would have traveled about that far.\n4:03\nThey started emitting the light at the same time.\n4:06\nSo that very first photon, if you view light as a particle,\n4:10\nwill reach my eye at the very same time\n4:13\nas the very first photon from this guy.\n4:16\nSo the wave form is going to essentially be stretched.\n4:19\nSo instead of having-- so we're still\n4:22\ngoing to have one, two, three, four full wavelengths,\n4:28\nbut they'll now be stretched.\n4:29\nLet me see if I can draw four full wavelengths.\n4:31\nSo let me cut this in half over here.\n4:34\nAnd let me cut each of those in half.\n4:37\nSo each of these are going to be a full wavelength.\n4:40\nAnd then they're going to have a half wavelength in between.\n4:47\nAnd so the wave form is going to look like this.\n4:52\nLet me try my best to draw it.\n4:55\nThis is the hardest part, drawing the stretched out wave\n4:58\nform.\n5:00\nAnd there you go.\n5:01\nIt's going to look like this.\n5:02\nAnd so when it gets to my eye, my eye\n5:04\nis going to perceive it as having a longer wavelength,\n5:07\neven though from the perspective of each\n5:09\nof these objects, if you're traveling with each of them,\n5:12\nthe frequency and the wavelength of the light emitted\n5:15\nis the same.\n5:16\nThe only difference is this guy's moving away from me--\n5:18\nor I'm moving away from it, depending\n5:20\non how you want to view it-- while I am stationary,\n5:23\nwhile in this first case, the observer and the source\n5:26\nare both stationary.\n5:27\nNow, in this situation, what's my eye going to say?\n5:29\nWell, my eye will get each of these successive pulses,\n5:33\nor each of these successive wave trains.\n5:35\nAnd it's going to say, hey, there's a longer wavelength\n5:37\nhere, a perceived longer wavelength--\n5:46\nlet me write that-- perceived longer wavelength here,\n5:51\nand also, a perceived lower frequency.\n6:00\nSo what would that do to the perception of the light?\n6:03\nLet's say that this is green light.\n6:06\nSo if you are stationary with the observer,\n6:08\nit would be green light.\n6:09\nSo let's look at the electromagnetic spectrum.\n6:11\nI got this off of Wikipedia.\n6:13\nSo if I were stationary towards-- with the observer,\n6:16\nwe'd be in the green light part of the spectrum,\n6:20\nso a 500 nanometer wavelength.\n6:23\nBut if all of a sudden, because the object\n6:26\nis moving away from me at this huge velocity,\n6:29\nthe perceived wavelength becomes wider.\n6:32\nSo from my perception, it is going\n6:34\nto have a wider wavelength.\n6:36\nAnd you can see what's happening.\n6:37\nIt will look redder.\n6:39\nIt will move towards the red part of the spectrum.\n6:42\nAnd this phenomenon is called redshift.\n6:53\nAnd I've done a bunch of videos of the physics playlist\n6:55\non the Doppler effect.\n6:56\nAnd over there, I talk about sound waves and the perceived\n6:59\nfrequency of sound-- if something travels towards you\n7:02\nverses away from you-- as the exact same idea.\n7:05\nThis is the Doppler effect applied to light.\n7:07\nAnd the reason why the Doppler effect\n7:09\nworks for light traveling through space\n7:12\nand for sound traveling through air\n7:15\nis because the sound wave in air, regardless\n7:17\nof whether the source is moving away\n7:19\nor towards you, the sound wave is\n7:21\ngoing to move at the speed of sound in air\n7:23\nat a certain pressure and all of that.\n7:25\nAnd light is the same thing.\n7:27\nBut in a vacuum, It will always, regardless of the source,\n7:32\nregardless of what the source is doing,\n7:34\nthe actual light wave itself will always\n7:36\ntravel at the same velocity.\n7:39\nThe only difference is is that its perceived frequency\n7:42\nand wavelength will change.\n7:43\nAnd now the whole reason why I'm talking about this\n7:45\nis you can use this property of light,\n7:49\nthat it gets redshift, to see whether things are traveling\n7:52\naway or towards you.\n7:55\nAnd people talk about redshift because, frankly, most things\n7:57\nare traveling away from us.\n7:59\nAnd that's one of the reasons why\n8:00\nwe tend to believe in the Big Bang.\n8:02\nThe opposite, if something is traveling towards me\n8:05\nat super high velocities, then we\n8:07\nwould have something called-- you\n8:09\ndon't hear the word-- it would be violetshift.\n8:11\nThe frequency would increase.\n8:15\nSo it would look bluer or more purple.\n8:17\nNow the other thing I want to highlight\n8:19\nis this redshift phenomenon, this idea,\n8:21\nit doesn't apply only to visible light.\n8:24\nSo it could even apply the things that we can't even see.\n8:27\nSo it would only-- it would become redder.\n8:29\nBut it's not like you can even see.\n8:31\nIt could even be applied to things\n8:32\nthat are even more red than red.\n8:34\nSo maybe it's a microwave that is being emitted.\n8:37\nBut because the source is moving away from us so fast,\n8:40\nit could be perceived as an actual radio wave.\n8:44\nAnd actually, I should have talked about this in the video\n8:46\non the microwave background radiation\n8:49\nis that we're perceiving it as microwaves.\n8:52\nBut these sources were moving away from us.\n8:55\nThey were being redshift.\n8:57\nSo they were not actually emitting microwave radiation.\n9:00\nIt's just what we observe-- and this is actually\n9:03\nwhat would be predicted based on the Big Bang-- is actually\n9:07\nmicrowave radiation.\n9:08\nSo anyway, hopefully, that gives you\n9:10\na sense of what redshift is.\n9:11\nAnd now we can use this tool to explain\n9:16\nwhy we think many, many things are moving away from us.\n9:19\nAnd now let me just actually make sure you get that idea.\n9:22\nIf I have two objects, let's say that these are suns.\n9:25\nLet's say that these are both suns, or both galaxies,\n9:29\neither way.\n9:30\nAnd because of other properties--\n9:32\nand I won't talk about them right now--\n9:33\nwe know that they are probably emitting\n9:37\nlight of the same color.\n9:39\nThey're probably emitting light of the same color\n9:41\nbecause we know other properties of that star or of that galaxy.\n9:45\nNow, if what we actually perceive\n9:48\nis that this one looks redder to us than this one,\n9:51\nthen we know that it is traveling away from us.\n9:55\nAnd the redder it looks, the more its wavelength\n9:57\nis spread out relative to this other star, the faster we know\n10:00\nthat this is moving away from us.",

remember, you've had the Siege of Leningrad\n0:11\ngoing on for several years now.\n0:13\nIncredibly bloody siege,\n0:15\nincredibly hard on the civilians of Leningrad.\n0:17\nBut the Soviet army is finally able to end that,\n0:20\nand so you see from these troop movements on this map\n0:23\nstarting in January of 1944 with the end of the siege,\n0:27\nthey are able to really take the offensive\n0:29\nand start marching through the Baltics,\n0:32\nthrough the Baltic states.\n0:33\nAt the same time, you have the Soviet armies marching\n0:37\nand they're able to force the Axis to surrender\n0:42\nin the Crimea.\n0:44\nYou fast forward further into the year, further into 1944.\n0:48\nYou might remember in 1943, the Allies were able\n0:51\nto land on Italy and force the surrender of Italy\n0:56\nto the Allied powers.\n0:58\nBut that doesn't mean that Italy, as we know it today,\n1:00\nor even as we knew it then, was free of the German troops,\n1:04\nor from the Axis troops.\n1:06\nAnd so, the Allies were continuing to slog through,\n1:09\nslog through Italy, and in particular Rome.\n1:13\nRome did not get liberated in 1943.\n1:16\nThe Allies had to continue bombing Rome.\n1:18\nAnd it doesn't get liberated until June of 1944.\n1:23\nSo Rome is liberated.\n1:25\nSo liberated in the summer of 1944.\n1:30\nThat happens June, 5th.\n1:32\nThe next day, and this is probably one of the most\n1:34\nfamous events in World War II,\n1:36\nespecially from an American point of view,\n1:38\nsomething that's documented in many films,\n1:40\nis June, 6th, D-Day, 1944.\n1:44\nYou have the invasion of Normandy,\n1:45\nthe amphibious invasion of Normandy,\n1:47\nprobably most famously depicted in the opening scenes\n1:50\nof Saving Private Ryan.\n1:52\nWe have British, primarily British and American troops.\n1:54\nThey are able to storm the beaches of Normandy successfully\n1:57\nwhich allows them to start making progress\n2:01\nin northern France towards Germany.\n2:05\nNow, also in the summer of 1944,\n2:08\nrockets start to get involved in a serious way\n2:11\nin World War II.\n2:12\nThe Germans are starting to send their V1 rockets\n2:15\nover to Great Britain.\n2:18\nAnd the V1 rockets, this is just significant\n2:20\nfrom the history of technology.\n2:21\nObviously today rockets play a big deal\n2:24\nin a whole bunch of context,\n2:26\nand this was the first time that they were deployed\n2:28\nin a major way during a war.\n2:30\nThe first V1 rockets, they weren't all that impressive,\n2:32\nthey traveled three or four hundred miles per hour,\n2:35\nslower than modern jet-liners.\n2:37\nThey didn't travel at that high of an altitude.\n2:39\nBut as we'll see, or as we'll see even in this video,\n2:42\nwithin a few months, by September,\n2:45\nthey were sending in V2 rockets,\n2:47\nwhich were far more advanced,\n2:49\ngoing several thousand miles per hour,\n2:50\ngetting to altitudes of tens of miles high,\n2:53\nand carrying even larger payloads.\n2:55\nSo the Germans were really starting to push the envelope\n2:57\nin terms of rocket science.\n3:00\nWhat's good about the Allie is, is that the Germans\n3:02\nwere kind, they developed this technology a little bit late.\n3:05\nThey are starting to be on the heels, obviously,\n3:07\non both the Western front and the Eastern front,\n3:10\nand even in the South the Allies\n3:12\nwere really on the offensive now,\n3:14\nbut rockets are starting to get involved.\n3:15\nV1's in the summer, and then the V2's in the fall.\n3:22\nNow, also as we go into the late summer and fall,\n3:25\nyou see that Russians, after defeating the Germans at Kursk,\n3:28\nare marching towards,\n3:32\nare marching towards Poland,\n3:36\nand marching in particular towards Warsaw,\n3:38\nas we go through 1944.\n3:43\nAnd at the end of 1944, not the end really,\n3:45\nat the end of the summer of 1944,\n3:48\nin August of 1944,\n3:50\nyou have the Polish uprising, you have kind of the rebels.\n3:55\nThe underground is taking on the German occupiers.\n3:59\nSo this is August, 1944.\n4:02\nAugust, 1944.\n4:04\nWith the Russian troops, or the Soviet troops\n4:07\nnot that far away, they're getting closer and closer\n4:09\nand closer to Warsaw.\n4:11\nNow, also in August of 1944, you have Paris, is liberated.\n4:17\nSo this is August, 25th, 1944.\n4:22\nParis is liberated.\n4:25\nAnd then, as we go later into that year,\n4:27\nBritish troops are able to liberate Athens.\n4:32\nSo British troops are able to liberate Athens.\n4:35\nSo Athens is liberated.\n4:36\nAnd actually this, once this liberated,\n4:38\nthen you start having the beginnings of the Civil War,\n4:41\nof the Greek Civil War that occurs\n4:43\nbetween kind of the government troops and the Communists,\n4:46\nor as you say the more left-leaning people\n4:49\nwho were involved in fighting against the Axis powers.\n4:55\nSo, even though they were liberated,\n4:56\nit's kind of the start of another unfortunate chapter\n5:00\nwith the Greek Civil War.\n5:02\nAnd then, finishing out 1944, the Axis powers,\n5:06\nand particularly the Germans, they weren't done yet.\n5:08\nEven though the war is not looking good,\n5:10\nthey finally mount a, I guess you could say\n5:12\none of their last counteroffensive,\n5:14\njust not their last major counteroffensive.\n5:16\nAnd that's over here against the Allied troops,\n5:21\nparticularly the American troops,\n5:23\nat the Battle of the Bulge.\n5:25\nAnd this starts in December of 1944.\n5:30\nIt's called the Battle of the Bulge\n5:32\nbecause the shape in which, so if the Allied,\n5:35\nyou know, the front, the Allied front looks like that\n5:37\nas it is advancing.\n5:39\nThe

of what\n0:09\nit means, or a good understanding of what it means.\n0:11\nAnd to understand communism-- let\n0:12\nme just draw a spectrum here.\n0:13\nSo I'm going to start with capitalism.\n0:15\nAnd this is really just going to be an overview.\n0:17\nPeople can do a whole PhD thesis on this type of thing.\n0:21\nCapitalism, and then I'll get a little bit more--\n0:24\nand then we could progress to socialism.\n0:28\nAnd then we can go to communism.\n0:30\nAnd the modern versions of communism\n0:33\nare really kind of the brainchild\n0:35\nof Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin.\n0:37\nKarl Marx was a German philosopher\n0:39\nin the 1800s, who, in his Communist Manifesto and other\n0:43\nwritings, kind of created the philosophical underpinnings\n0:46\nfor communism.\n0:47\nAnd Vladimir Lenin, who led the Bolshevik Revolution\n0:51\nin the-- and created, essentially, the Soviet Union--\n0:54\nhe's the first person to make some of Karl Marx's ideas\n0:58\nmore concrete.\n0:59\nAnd really every nation or every country\n1:03\nwhich we view as communist has really\n1:04\nfollowed the pattern of Vladimir Lenin.\n1:07\nAnd we'll talk about that in a second.\n1:08\nBut first, let's talk about the philosophical differences\n1:11\nbetween these things, and how you would move.\n1:13\nAnd Karl Marx himself viewed communism\n1:16\nas kind of a progression from capitalism\n1:20\nthrough socialism to communism.\n1:22\nSo what he saw in capitalism-- and at least this part\n1:25\nof what he saw was right-- is that you\n1:28\nhave private property, private ownership of land.\n1:32\nThat's the main aspect of capitalism.\n1:34\nAnd this is the world that most of us live in today.\n1:38\nThe problem that he saw with capitalism\n1:40\nis he thought, well, look, when you\n1:42\nhave private property, the people who start accumulating\n1:46\nsome capital-- and when we talk about capital,\n1:48\nwe could be talking about land, we\n1:51\ncould be talking about factories,\n1:53\nwe could be talking about any type of natural resources--\n1:55\nso the people who start getting a little bit of them--\n1:58\nso let me draw a little diagram here.\n2:00\nSo let's say someone has a little bit of capital.\n2:03\nAnd that capital could be a factory, or it could be land.\n2:07\nSo let me write it.\n2:08\nCapital.\n2:10\nAnd let's just say it's land.\n2:11\nSo let's say someone starts to own a little bit of land.\n2:14\nAnd he owns more than everyone else.\n2:16\nSo then you just have a bunch of other people\n2:18\nwho don't own land.\n2:20\nBut they need, essentially-- and since this guy\n2:22\nowns all the land, they've got to work on this guy's land.\n2:25\nThey have to work on this guy's land.\n2:28\nAnd from Karl Marx's point of view, he said, look,\n2:31\nyou have all of these laborers who don't have as much capital.\n2:35\nThis guy has this capital.\n2:37\nAnd so he can make these laborers work\n2:39\nfor a very small wage.\n2:42\nAnd so any excess profits that come out\n2:45\nfrom this arrangement, the owner of the capital\n2:48\nwill be able to get it.\n2:49\nBecause these laborers won't be able to get\n2:52\ntheir wages to go up.\n2:53\nBecause there's so much competition for them\n2:56\nto work on this guy's farm or to work on this guy's land.\n2:59\nHe really didn't think too much about, well,\n3:01\nmaybe the competition could go the other way.\n3:04\nMaybe you could have a reality eventually where\n3:06\nyou have a bunch of people with reasonable amounts of capital,\n3:10\nand you have a bunch of laborers.\n3:12\nAnd the bunch of people would compete for the laborers,\n3:15\nand maybe the laborers could make their wages go up,\n3:19\nand they could eventually accumulate their own capital.\n3:22\nThey could eventually start their own small businesses.\n3:24\nSo he really didn't think about this reality\n3:26\ntoo much over here.\n3:27\nHe just saw this reality.\n3:28\nAnd to his defense-- and I don't want\n3:31\nto get in the habit of defending Karl Marx too\n3:33\nmuch-- to his defense, this is what\n3:36\nwas happening in the late 1800s, especially--\n3:39\nwe have the Industrial Revolution.\n3:41\nEven in the United States, you did\n3:42\nhave kind of-- Mark Twain called it the Gilded Age.\n3:45\nYou have these industrialists who\n3:47\ndid accumulate huge amounts of capital.\n3:50\nThey really did have a lot of the leverage\n3:51\nrelative to the laborers.\n3:53\nAnd so what Karl Marx says, well, look,\n3:55\nif the guy with all the capital has all the leverage,\n3:58\nand this whole arrangement makes some profits,\n4:00\nhe's going to be able to keep the profits.\n4:02\nBecause he can keep all of these dudes' wages low.\n4:05\nAnd so what's going to happen is that the guy with the capital\n4:07\nis just going to end up with more capital.\n4:11\nAnd he's going to have even more leverage.\n4:13\nAnd he'll be able to keep these people on kind of a basic wage,\n4:17\nso that they can never acquire capital for themselves.\n4:20\nSo in Karl Marx's point of view, the natural progression\n4:23\nwould be for these people to start organizing.\n4:26\nSo these people maybe start organizing into unions.\n4:30\nSo they could collectively tell the person who\n4:33\nowns the land or the factory, no, we're not going to work,\n4:36\nor we're going to go on strike unless you increase our wages,\n4:39\nor unless you give us better working conditions.\n4:42\nSo when you start talking about this unionization stuff,\n4:45\nyou're starting to move in the direction of socialism.\n4:48\nThe other element of moving in the direction of socialism\n4:52\nis that Karl Marx didn't like this kind\n4:54\nof high concentration-- or this is socialists in general,\n4:57\nI should say-- didn't like this high concentration of wealth.\n5:00\nThat you have this reality of not only\n5:03\ndo you have these people who could accumulate all\n5:06\nof this wealth-- and maybe, to some degree,\n5:08\nthey were able to accumulate it because they were innovative,\n5:10\nor they were good managers of land,\n5:12\nor whatever, although the Marxists don't\n5:14\ngive a lot of credit to the owners of capital.\n5:16\nThey don't really give a lot of credit\n5:18\nto saying maybe they did have some skill in managing\n5:20\nsome type of an operation.\n5:22\nBut the other problem is is that it gets handed over.\n5:24\nIt gets handed over to their offspring.\n5:27\nSo private property, you have this situation where it just\n5:30\ngoes from maybe father to son, or from parent to a child.\n5:34\nAnd so it's not even based on any type of meritocracy.\n5:37\nIt's really just based on this inherited wealth.\n5:39\nAnd this is a problem that definitely happened in Europe.\n5:43\nWhen you go back to the French Revolution,\n5:45\nyou have generation after generation of nobility,\n5:48\nregardless of how incompetent each generation would\n5:52\nbe, they just had so much wealth that they were essentially\n5:55\nin control of everything.\n5:56\nAnd you had a bunch of people with no wealth\n5:59\nhaving to work for them.\n6:00\nAnd when you have that type of wealth disparity,\n6:02\nit does lead to revolutions.\n6:05\nSo another principle of moving in the socialist direction\n6:07\nis kind of a redistribution of wealth.\n6:10\nSo let me write it over here.\n6:11\nSo redistribution.\n6:16\nSo in socialism, you can still have private property.\n6:20\nBut the government takes a bigger role.\n6:23\nSo you have-- let me write this.\n6:24\nLarger government.\n6:27\nAnd one of the roles of the government\n6:29\nis to redistribute wealth.\n6:30\nAnd the government also starts having\n6:33\ncontrol of the major factors of production.\n6:37\nSo maybe the utilities, maybe some\n6:39\nof the large factories that do major things, all of a sudden\n6:42\nstarts to become in the hands of the government,\n6:45\nor in the words of communists, in the hands of the people.\n6:49\nAnd the redistribution is going on,\n6:51\nso in theory, you don't have huge amounts of wealth\n6:54\nin the hands of a few people.\n6:57\nAnd then you keep-- if you take these ideas\n7:00\nto their natural conclusion, you get\n7:03\nto the theoretical communist state.\n7:05\nAnd the theoretical communist state\n7:07\nis a classless, and maybe even a little bit--\n7:12\na classless society, and in Karl Marx's point of view-- and this\n7:16\nis a little harder to imagine-- a stateless society.\n7:21\nSo in capitalism, you definitely had classes.\n7:23\nYou had the class that owns the capital,\n7:28\nand then you had the labor class,\n7:29\nand you have all of these divisions,\n7:30\nand they're different from each other.\n7:32\nHe didn't really imagine a world that maybe a laborer could\n7:35\nget out of this, they could get their own capital,\n7:38\nthen maybe they could start their own business.\n7:40\nSo he just saw this tension would eventually to socialism,\n7:43\nand eventually a classless society where\n7:45\nyou have a central-- Well, he didn't even\n7:48\ngo too much into the details but you have kind of equal,\n7:52\neveryone in society has ownership over everything,\n7:55\nand society somehow figures out where\n7:57\nthings should be allocated, and all of the rest.\n8:00\nAnd it's all stateless.\n8:01\nAnd that's even harder to think about in a concrete fashion.\n8:05\nSo that's Karl Marx's view of things.\n8:07\nBut it never really became concrete\n8:09\nuntil Vladimir Lenin shows up.\n8:12\nAnd so the current version of communism\n8:14\nthat we-- The current thing that most of us view as communism\n8:18\nis sometimes viewed as a Marxist-Leninist state.\n8:25\nThese are sometimes used interchangeably.\n8:28\nMarxism is kind of the pure, utopian, we're eventually\n8:31\ngoing to get to a world where everyone is equal,\n8:35\neveryone is doing exactly what they want,\n8:38\nthere's an abundance of everything.\n8:40\nI guess to some degree, it's kind\n8:42\nof describing what happens in Star Trek, where everyone can\n8:44\ngo to a replicator and get what they want.\n8:46\nAnd if you want to paint part of the day,\n8:48\nyou can paint part of the day, and you're not just a painter,\n8:50\nyou can also do whatever you want.\n8:52\nSo it's this very utopian thing.\n8:53\nLet me write that down.\n8:54\nSo pure Marxism is kind of a utopian society.\n9:00\nAnd just in case you don't know what utopian means,\n9:02\nit's kind of a perfect society, where you don't have classes,\n9:05\neveryone is equal, everyone is leading these kind\n9:08\nof rich, diverse, fulfilling lives.\n9:10\nAnd it's also, utopian is also kind of viewed as unrealistic.\n9:13\nIt's kind of, if you view it in the more negative light, is\n9:16\nlike, hey, I don't know how we'll ever\n9:17\nbe able to get there.\n9:18\nWho knows?\n9:19\nI don't want to be negative about it.\n9:20\nMaybe we will one day get to a utopian society.\n9:23\nBut Leninist is kind of the more practical element of communism.\n9:27\nBecause obviously, after the Bolshevik Revolution, 1917,\n9:30\nin the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union gets created,\n9:33\nthey have to actually run a government.\n9:35\nThey have to actually run a state based\n9:36\non these ideas of communism.\n9:39\nAnd in a Leninist philosophy-- and this\n9:43\nis where it starts to become in tension with the ideas\n9:46\nof democracy-- in a Leninist philosophy,\n9:50\nyou need this kind of a party system.\n9:52\nSo you need this-- and he calls this the Vanguard Party.\n9:55\nSo the vanguard is kind of the thing that's leading,\n9:58\nthe one that's leading the march.\n10:00\nSo this Vanguard Party that kind of\n10:02\ncreates this constant state of revolution,\n10:05\nand its whole job is to guide society, is to kind of almost\n10:10\nbe the parent of society, and take it from capitalism\n10:14\nthrough socialism to this ideal state of communism.\n10:18\nAnd it's one of those things where\n10:19\nthe ideal state of communism was never--\n10:22\nit's kind of hard to know when you get there.\n10:24\nAnd so what happens in a Leninist state is\n10:26\nit's this Vanguard Party, which is usually called the Communist\n10:29\nParty, is in a constant state of revolution, kind of saying,\n10:32\nhey, we're shepherding the people to some future state\n10:35\nwithout a real clear definition of what that future state is.\n10:39\nAnd so when you talk about Marxist-Leninist,\n10:42\nbesides talking about what's happening\n10:44\nin the economic sphere, it's also\n10:46\nkind of talking about this party system, this party system where\n10:50\nyou really just have one dominant party that it will\n10:53\nhopefully act in the interest of the people.\n10:56\nSo one dominant communist party that\n11:02\nacts in the interest of the people.\n11:04\nAnd obviously, the negative here is that how do\n11:09\nyou know that they actually are acting\n11:11\nin the interest of people?\n11:12\nHow do you know that they actually are competent?\n11:14\nWhat means are there to do anything\n11:16\nif they are misallocating things, if it is corrupt,\n11:18\nif you only have a one-party system?\n11:21\nAnd just to make it clear, the largest existing communist\n11:25\nstate is the People's Republic of China.\n11:28\nAnd although it is controlled by the Communist Party,\n11:31\nin economic terms it's really not that communist anymore.\n11:35\nAnd so it can be confusing.\n11:36\nAnd so what I want to do is draw a little bit of a spectrum.\n11:39\nOn the vertical axis, over here, I want to put democratic.\n11:46\nAnd up here, I'll put authoritarian or totalitarian.\n11:51\nLet me put-- well, I'll put authoritarian.\n11:53\nI'll do another video on the difference.\n11:56\nAnd they're similar.\n11:58\nAnd totalitarian is more an extreme form of authoritarian,\n12:02\nwhere the government controls everything.\n12:05\nAnd you have a few people controlling everything\n12:07\nand it's very non-democratic.\n12:08\nBut authoritarian is kind of along those directions.\n12:12\nAnd then on this spectrum, we have the capitalism, socialism,\n12:15\nand communism.\n12:17\nSo the United States, I would put-- I\n12:19\nwould put the United States someplace over here.\n12:23\nI would put the United States over here.\n12:25\nIt has some small elements of socialism.\n12:28\nYou do have labor unions.\n12:29\nThey don't control everything.\n12:31\nYou also have people working outside of labor unions.\n12:34\nIt does have some elements of redistribution.\n12:38\nThere are inheritance taxes.\n12:41\nThere are-- I mean it's not an extreme form of redistribution.\n12:44\nYou can still inherit private property.\n12:46\nYou still have safety nets for people,\n12:49\nyou have Medicare, Medicaid, you have welfare.\n12:51\nSo there's some elements of socialism.\n12:53\nBut it also has a very strong capitalist history,\n12:57\nprivate property, deep market, so I'd\n12:59\nstick the United States over there.\n13:01\nI would put the USSR-- not current Russia,\n13:05\nbut the Soviet Union when it existed-- I\n13:08\nwould put the Soviet Union right about there.\n13:14\nSo this was the-- I would put the USSR right over there.\n13:21\nI would put the current state of Russia,\n13:23\nactually someplace over here.\n13:28\nBecause they actually have fewer safety nets,\n13:30\nand they kind of have a more-- their economy\n13:32\ncan kind of go crazier, and they actually\n13:34\nhave a bigger disparity in wealth\n13:37\nthan a place like the United States.\n13:38\nSo this is current Russia.\n13:42\nAnd probably the most interesting one here\n13:44\nis the People's Republic of China, the current People's\n13:47\nRepublic of China, which is at least\n13:49\non the surface, a communist state.\n13:52\nBut in some ways, it's more capitalist than the United\n13:54\nStates, in that they don't have strong wealth redistribution.\n13:58\nThey don't have kind of strong safety nets for people.\n14:02\nSo you could put some elements of China--\n14:05\nand over here, closer to the left.\n14:07\nAnd they are more-- less democratic than either the US\n14:10\nor even current Russia, although some people would\n14:13\ncall current Russia-- well, I won't go too much into it.\n14:15\nBut current China, you could throw it here a little bit.\n14:17\nSo it could be even a little bit more capitalist\n14:19\nthan the United States.\n14:20\nDefinitely they don't even have good labor laws, all the rest.\n14:24\nBut in other ways, you do have state ownership of a lot,\n14:28\nand you do have state control of a lot.\n14:30\nSo in some ways, they're kind of spanning this whole range.\n14:35\nSo this right over here is China.\n14:37\nAnd even though it is called a communist state, in some ways,\n14:40\nit's more capitalist than countries\n14:42\nthat are very proud of their capitalism.\n14:44\nBut in a lot of other ways, especially with the government\n14:47\nownership and the government control of things,\n14:49\nand this one dominant party, so it's\n14:50\nkind of Leninist with less of the Marxist going on.\n14:54\nSo in that way, it is more in the communist direction.\n14:57\nSo hopefully that clarifies what can sometimes\n15:00\nbe a confusing topic.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWhat I want to do in this video is give ourselves\n0:02\na basic introduction to the phenomenon of light.\n0:07\nAnd light is, at least to me, mysterious.\n0:11\nBecause on one level it really defines our reality.\n0:14\nIt's maybe the most defining characteristic of our reality.\n0:17\nEverything we see, how we perceive reality,\n0:20\nis based on light bouncing off of objects\n0:23\nor bending around objects or diffracting around objects,\n0:26\nand then being sensed by our eyes,\n0:29\nand then sending signals into our brain that\n0:32\ncreate models of the world we see around us.\n0:35\nSo it really is, almost, the defining characteristic\n0:37\nof our reality.\n0:38\nBut at the same time, when you really go down to experiment\n0:42\nand observe with light, it starts\n0:44\nto have a bunch of mysterious properties.\n0:47\nAnd to a large degree it is not fully understood yet.\n0:51\nAnd probably the most amazing thing about light--\n0:54\nwell, actually there's tons of amazing things about light--\n0:56\nbut one of the mysterious things is when you really get down\n0:59\nto it-- and this is actually not just true of light,\n1:01\nthis is actually true of almost anything\n1:03\nonce you get onto a small enough quantum mechanical level--\n1:07\nlight behaves as both a wave and a particle.\n1:12\nAnd this is probably not that intuitive to you,\n1:15\nbecause it's not that intuitive to me.\n1:17\nIn my life, I'm used to certain things behaving as waves,\n1:19\nlike sound waves or the waves of an ocean.\n1:22\nAnd I'm used to certain things behaving like particles,\n1:25\nlike basketballs or-- I don't know-- my coffee cup.\n1:29\nI'm not used to things behaving as both.\n1:32\nAnd it really depends on what experiment you run\n1:34\nand how you observe the light.\n1:36\nSo when you observe it as a particle,\n1:38\nand this comes out of Einstein's work\n1:40\nwith the photoelectric effect-- and I won't go into the details\n1:43\nhere, maybe in a future video when\n1:44\nwe start thinking about quantum mechanics--\n1:47\nyou can view light as a train of particles moving\n1:54\nat the speed of light, which I'll talk about in a second.\n1:56\nWe call these particles photons.\n2:00\nIf you view light in other ways-- and you see it\n2:02\neven when you see light being refracted by a prism here--\n2:07\nit looks like it is a wave.\n2:10\nAnd it has the properties of a wave.\n2:12\nIt has a frequency, and it has a wavelength.\n2:16\nAnd like other waves, the velocity of that wave\n2:19\nis the frequency times its wavelength.\n2:23\nNow even if you ignore this particle aspect of light,\n2:28\nif you just look at the wave aspect of the light,\n2:30\nit's still fascinating.\n2:32\nBecause most waves require a medium to travel through.\n2:36\nSo for example, if I think about how sound travels through air--\n2:40\nso let me draw a bunch of air particles.\n2:44\nI'll draw a sound wave traveling through the air particles.\n2:47\nWhat happens in a sound wave is you compress some of the air\n2:52\nparticles and those compress the ones next to them.\n2:54\nAnd so you have points in the air that have higher,\n2:57\nI guess you could say, higher pressure\n2:59\nand points that have lower pressure,\n3:00\nand you could plot that.\n3:02\nSo we have high pressure over here.\n3:03\nHigh pressure, low pressure, high pressure, low pressure.\n3:07\nAnd as these things bump into each other,\n3:08\nand this wave essentially travels to the right--\n3:11\nand if you were to plot that you would see this wave\n3:13\nform traveling to the right.\n3:15\nBut this is all predicated, or this is all\n3:17\nbased on, this energy traveling through a medium.\n3:22\nAnd I'm used to visualizing waves in that way.\n3:26\nBut light needs no medium.\n3:34\nLight will actually travel fastest through nothing,\n3:37\nthrough a vacuum.\n3:39\nAnd it will travel at an unimaginably fast speed--\n3:42\n3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second.\n3:47\nAnd just to give you a sense of this,\n3:49\nthis is 300 million meters per second.\n3:51\nOr another way of thinking about it is it\n3:54\nwould take light less than a seventh of a second\n3:59\nto travel around the earth.\n4:00\nOr it would travel around the earth more than seven times\n4:03\nin one second.\n4:04\nSo unimaginably fast.\n4:06\nAnd not only is this just a super fast speed,\n4:10\nbut once again it tells us that light\n4:12\nis something fundamental to our universe.\n4:14\nBecause it's not just an unimaginable fast speed.\n4:17\nIt is the fastest speed not just known to physics, but possible\n4:21\nin physics.\n4:22\nSo once again something very unintuitive to us\n4:25\nin our everyday realm.\n4:26\nWe always imagine that, OK, if something\n4:29\nis going at some speed, maybe if there was an ant riding on top\n4:31\nof that something and it was moving in the same direction,\n4:34\nit would be going even faster.\n4:35\nBut nothing can go faster than the speed of light.\n4:39\nIt's absolutely impossible based on our current understanding\n4:43\nof physics.\n4:44\nSo it's not just a fast speed, it\n4:46\nis the fastest speed possible.\n4:55\nAnd this right here is an approximation.\n4:57\nIt's actually 2.99 something something times 10\n5:01\nto the eighth meters per second.\n5:02\nBut 3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second\n5:04\nis a pretty good approximation.\n5:07\nNow within the visible light spectrum-- and I'll\n5:10\ntalk about what's beyond the visible light spectrum\n5:13\nin a second-- you're probably familiar with the colors.\n5:15\nMaybe you imagine them as the colors of the rainbow.\n5:18\nAnd rainbows really happen because the light\n5:20\nfrom the sun, the white light, is being refracted\n5:24\nby these little water particles.\n5:27\nAnd you can see that in a clearer way when\n5:29\nyou see light being refracted by a prism right over here.\n5:33\nAnd the different wavelengths of light-- so white light\n5:36\ncontains all of the visible wavelengths--\n5:39\nbut the different wavelengths get refracted differently\n5:42\nby a prism.\n5:44\nSo in this case the higher-frequency wavelengths,\n5:47\nthe violet and the blue, get refracted more.\n5:50\nIts direction gets bent more than the low-frequency\n5:53\nwavelengths, than the reds and the oranges right over here.\n5:59\nAnd if you want to look at the wavelength of visible light,\n6:02\nit's between 400 nanometers and 700 nanometers.\n6:05\nAnd the higher the frequency, the higher the energy of that\n6:09\nlight.\n6:09\nAnd that actually goes into when you\n6:11\nstart talking about the quantum mechanics of it--\n6:13\nthat the higher frequency means that each of these photons\n6:16\nhave higher energy.\n6:17\nThey have a better ability to give kinetic energy\n6:20\nto knock off electrons or whatever else they need to do.\n6:23\nSo higher frequency-- let me write\n6:25\nthat down-- higher frequency means higher energy.\n6:35\nNow I keep referring to this idea of the visible light.\n6:39\nAnd you might say, what is beyond visible light?\n6:41\nAnd what you'll find is that light is just\n6:43\npart of a much broader phenomenon,\n6:46\nand it's just the part that we happen to observe.\n6:49\nAnd if we want to broaden the discussion a little bit,\n6:54\nvisible light is just really part\n6:56\nof the electromagnetic spectrum.\n6:59\nSo light is really just electromagnetic radiation.\n7:09\nAnd everything that I told you about light just now--\n7:11\nit has a wave property and it has particle properties--\n7:15\nthis is not just specific to visible light.\n7:17\nThis is true of all of electromagnetic radiation.\n7:22\nSo at very low frequencies or very long wavelengths--\n7:25\nwe're talking about things like radio waves,\n7:27\nthe things that allow a radio to reach your car;\n7:31\nthe things that allow your cellphone\n7:34\nto communicate with cell towers; microwaves, the things that\n7:38\nstart vibrating water molecules in your food\n7:40\nso that they heat up; infrared, which\n7:43\nis what our body releases, and that's\n7:45\nwhy you can detect people through walls\n7:46\nwith infrared cameras; visible light; ultraviolet light,\n7:50\nthe UV light coming from the sun that'll give you sunburn;\n7:53\nX-rays, the radiation that allows\n7:55\nus to see through the soft material and just visualize\n7:58\nthe bones; gamma rays,\n7:59\nthe super high energy that comes from quasars\n8:03\nand other certain types of physical phenomena-- these\n8:05\nare all examples of the exact same thing.\n8:08\nWe just happen to perceive certain frequencies\n8:11\nof this as visible light.\n8:14\nAnd you might say, hey, Sal, how come we only\n8:15\nperceive certain frequencies of this?\n8:18\nHow can we only see these frequencies?\n8:23\nLiterally we can see those frequencies\n8:25\nwith our unaided eye.\n8:26\nAnd the reason, or at least my best guess\n8:28\nof the reason of that, is that's the frequency where\n8:30\nthe sun dumps out a lot of electromagnetic radiation.\n8:34\nSo it's inundating the Earth.\n8:36\nAnd if, as a species, you wanted to observe things\n8:38\nbased on reflected electromagnetic energy,\n8:42\nit is most useful to be able to perceive the things where there\n8:46\nis the most electromagnetic radiation.\n8:48\nSo it is possible that in other realities or other planets\n8:51\nthere are species that perceive more\n8:53\nin the ultraviolet range or the infrared range.\n8:55\nAnd even on Earth, there are some\n8:57\nthat perform better at either end of the range.\n8:59\nBut we see really well in the part of the spectrum\n9:02\nwhere the sun just happens to dump a lot of radiation on us.\n9:08\nNow I'll leave you there.\n9:09\nI think that's a pretty good overview of light.\n9:11\nAnd if any of this stuff seems kind\n9:14\nof unintuitive or daunting, or really\n9:17\non some level confusing-- this wave-particle duality,\n9:20\nthis idea of a transfer of energy through nothing--\n9:25\nand it seems unintuitive, don't worry.\n9:27\nIt seems unintuitive even for the best of physicists.\n9:30\nSo you're already at the leading edge of physics thinking.",

1s has gone by\n6:05\nwhat is now our velocity? well our initial velocity right here is 19.6m/s\n6:12\nthat was a given, and our acceleration is negative 9.8m/s*s\n6:20\nso it's negative right over there and you multiply that by delat t\n6:24\nin every situation, so in this situation we are gonna multiply it by 1\n6:28\ndelta t is 1, so you have 19.6 minus 9.8 that gives exactly 9.8m/s\n6:36\nand the unit we got cause we multiply here is second\n6:40\nso its give us meters per second\n6:41\n19.6m/s minus 9.8m/s one of these seconds go away multiply by second\n6:48\ngive you 9.8m/s so after 1s our velocity is now half of what it was before\n6:55\nso we are now going 9.8m/s, let me draw a line here\n7:01\n9.8m/s, now what is our displacement? so you look up here\n7:09\nLet me rewrite this displacement formular here with all the infomation\n7:13\nSo we know that displacement is going to be equal to initial veloctiy\n7:17\nwhich is 19.6m/s\n7:21\nnow I won't write the units here just for the sake of space\n7:22\ntimes change in time, times our, use the same color to see what is what\n7:28\ntimes our change in time, plus one half let me be clear one half\n7:33\ntimes negative 9.8m/s*s so one half times a is going to be\n7:40\nI rewrite this right over here cause this is gonna be negative 9.8m/s*s\n7:45\ntimes one half, so this is going to be negative 4.9\n7:50\nAll I did is one half times negative 9.8 over here\n7:57\nIt is important that is why the vector quantity is start to matter\n8:00\nbecause if you put a positive here you wouldn't have the obeject slowing\n8:04\ndown as you went up, because you will have gravity somehow accelerating\n8:07\nas it went up, but it's actually slowing it down\n8:09\nit's pulling it, it's accelerating it in downward direction\n8:12\nso that's why you have a negative right over there,\n8:15\nthat was out convention at the beginning\n8:16\nof last video, up is positive, down is negative, so let's focus\n8:22\nSo this part right over here, negative 4.9 m/s*s times delat t square\n8:27\ntimes delta t, times delta t square, this will make it a little bit easier\n8:32\nAlthough it still, let me get the calculator out\n8:34\nSo when one second has past, I let my trusty TI-85 out now\n8:42\nwhen 1s past it's 19.6 times 1,\n8:46\nwell that's just 19.6 minus 4.9 times 1 square\n8:50\nSo that's just minus 4.9, mius 4.9, gives us 14.7 meters\n8:58\nSo 14.7 meters So after 1s, the ball has travel 14.7 meters in the air\n9:06\nSo that's roughly over there, now what happen after 2s?\n9:12\nI'll do the same agenda, so after 2s,\n9:15\nour velocity is 19.6 minus 9.8 times 2, times 2 this is 2s has gone by\n9:23\nwell 9.8 times 2, 9.8 times 2 square seconds gives us 19.6 m/s\n9:32\nso these just cancel out, so we get out velocity now is zero\n9:36\nSo after two seconds our velocity now is zero\n9:40\nlet me make it so this thing should more look like a line\n9:47\nI don't get a sense, so this is let me just draw the line like this\n9:51\nso our velocity now is zero after 2 seconds\n9:55\nwhat is our displacement?\n9:57\nSo literally we at the point with the ball has no velocity\n10:01\nexactly two seconds, it kind of gone up,\n10:04\nand right for that exact moment of time it's stationary\n10:09\nand then what do we have going on in our displacement?\n10:13\nWe have 19.6 let me get the calculator out for this\n10:16\nWe can do it by hand but for the sake of quickness\n10:21\n19.6 times 2 minus 4.9 times 2s squared, this is 2s squared\n10:36\nso that's times four, so that gives us 19.6 meters\n10:41\nSo we have 19, we are at 19.6 meters after 2 seconds\n10:49\nwe are 19.6 meters in the air\n10:53\nnow let's go to 3s, so after 3s, our velocity now\n11:01\nit's 19.6 m/s minus 9.8 times 3, we could do that in our head but just\n11:09\nverified it for us, let me get the calculator out\n11:11\nit's 19.6-9.8*3, that gives us 9.8 m/s, negative 9.8m/s\n11:24\nSo after 3s, our velocity is now negative 9.8 m/s, what is that mean?\n11:29\nit's now going in downward direction, 9.8 m/s,\n11:33\nso this is our velocity graph, and what is our displacement?\n11:39\nSo once again, let's get the calculator out\n11:41\nyou are getting the hang of this\n11:43\nat anytime I encourage you to pause it and try it for yourself\n11:46\nSo now what is this is, Okay I'm looking at the displacement\n11:53\nOur displacment was delta t with 3s 19.6*3 - 4.9 times\n12:03\nso this is delat t so this is 3s\n12:06\nwe are talking about delat t, our change in time is 3s so that's square\n12:10\nSo times 9 and that gives us 14.7 meters, so 14.7 meters\n12:18\nSo after 3s we are 14.7m again, the same position with 1s\n12:24\nbut the difference is now we are moving downard\n12:27\nover here we were moving upwards\n12:28\nand finally what happen after 4s? Or what's our velocity?\n12:32\nLet me just get the calculator out\n12:34\nor you might be figure this out in your head\n12:36\nOur velocity is going to be 19.6 - 9.8 times 4s\n12:48\njust minus 19.6 m/s\n12:55\nSo we are going a magnitude of velocity which is the same initially\n12:59\nthrew the ball except now it's going at opposite direction\n13:02\nit's now going downward, so it's now going downward\n13:07\nand what is our displacement? get the calculator out\n13:11\nSo we have out displacement is 19.6 times 4, 4s has gone by\n13:18\nminus 4.9 times 4 square which is 16 times, which is equal to zero!\n13:27\nthe displacement here is zero!\n13:29\nWe are back on the ground\n13:32\nSo if you plot the displacement, you will actually got a parabola\n13:38\na downward opening parabola that looks something like this\n13:41\nI best draw it relatively neatly\n13:44\nSo my check to do it better than that\n13:46\nDotted line, dotted line is always easier to adjust than its streamed\n13:50\nso if you plot displacement verses time it look something like this\n13:56\nit's velocity just downward sloping line, and the acceleration is constant\n14:01\nand the whole reason why I wanted to this is I wanted to show you\n14:05\nthat velocity the whole time is decreasing at constant rate\n14:08\nand that make sense because that's the rate which the velocity increases\n14:13\nand decreases as the acceleration,\n14:15\nand the acceleration base on our convention is downward\n14:19\nso that why it's decreasing, we have a negative slope here\n14:22\nwe have a negative slope of negative 9.8 m/s*s\n14:28\nand just to think about what's happening for this ball\n14:32\nI know this video is getting long as it goes\n14:34\nI'm gonna draw the vectors for velocity\n14:38\nSo I'm gonna do that in orange, or maybe I will do that in blue\n14:42\nSo velocity in blue, so right when we start,\n14:45\nit has a positive velocity of 19.6m/s,\n14:49\nso I will draw a big vector like this\n14:52\n19.6m/s that's velocity, but after 1s is 9.8m/s so half of that\n14:58\nso then its maybe would look something like this\n15:01\n9.8m/s, then at the speed right over here has the velocity of zero\n15:06\nthen as you go to 3s, the magnitude of the velocity is 9.8m/s\n15:12\nbut it is now downwards, so it looks like this\n15:16\nand then finally right when it hits the ground,\n15:20\nright before it hits the ground it has a negative velocity of 19.6m/s\n15:26\nSo it would look like this, roughly like this\n15:32\nIf I use the same scale over here,\n15:35\nbut what was the acceleration the entire time?\n15:38\nwell the entire time the acceleration is negative\n15:40\nIt's 9.8m/s*s I will do that in orange\n15:44\nSo the acceleration over here\n15:46\nNegative, now I wanna do that in orange\n15:48\nThe acceleration is negative 9.8m/s*s\n15:58\nThe acceleration is constant the entire time\n16:02\nSo last one is negative 9.8m/s*s\n16:05\nit does not change depending on where you are\n16:07\nin the curve when you are near the surface of the earth\n16:10\nSo hopefully that clarify the things a little bit and gives you\n16:12\nwhat happen when you throw up a projectile into the air",

    "source_material": "•\n0:02\nAll right.\n0:03\nLet's talk about hypertension.\n0:05\nAnd the first thing we have to do\n0:08\nis understand the two main categories, or types,\n0:12\nof hypertension that are out there.\n0:14\nSo there are two types, primary--\n0:20\nand this is actually also called essential hypertension.\n0:23\nYou might hear that word, essential.\n0:25\nAnd secondary.\n0:27\nAnd I'll write that as a two.\n0:29\nAnd so the way that this is divided up\n0:32\nis that primary hypertension is caused by something indirect.\n0:40\nOK, so what does that mean exactly?\n0:43\nSo I'll give you some examples of what\n0:44\nthe indirect cause could be.\n0:46\nIt could be something like smoking,\n0:48\nor it could be that someone has obesity or is obese.\n0:53\nOr it could be that they have hyperlipidemia,\n0:57\nmeaning that they have lots of fats floating around\n1:00\nin the blood.\n1:02\nOr let's say they have diabetes.\n1:04\nThat would be another cause, or indirect cause,\n1:08\nof hypertension.\n1:09\nAnd these are all risk factors, right?\n1:11\nThat's another way of thinking about these things.\n1:13\nThese are general risk factors for having hypertension.\n1:16\nAnd the other category would be something direct.\n1:20\nAnd once I write this down, you'll\n1:22\nstart seeing the difference.\n1:23\nThis would be something like kidney disease.\n1:26\nSo let's say that I have a problem with my kidneys.\n1:30\nAnd they, for some reason-- these\n1:32\nare my kidneys-- they are holding on\n1:34\nto far too much fluid than they should.\n1:36\nAnd that's because they're diseased.\n1:38\nAnd so they're holding onto too much fluid.\n1:40\nAnd they're causing my volume of blood to go up.\n1:43\nThere causing the volume to go up,\n1:45\nand the stroke volume is going up as well.\n1:48\nAnd if the stroke volume goes up,\n1:49\nyou know that stroke volume is going to cause a higher blood\n1:55\npressure, because they're directly related\n1:56\nto each other-- very direct.\n1:58\nThat would be one example.\n2:00\nAnother example could be-- let's say\n2:01\nI have what's called an \"aortic coarctation.\"\n2:07\nSo this is a very specific problem.\n2:11\nThis would be-- if I have my-- let's say the heart is here.\n2:15\nAnd I have the aorta coming off here.\n2:18\nNormally, it should be nice and open, the way I've drawn it.\n2:21\nBut if you have a coarctation, then you\n2:24\nmight have a pinching in of the vessel.\n2:27\nSo it would start looking like this.\n2:29\nIt would look like that, like a pinch.\n2:33\nAnd if you have a pinching in right there, then\n2:36\nyou have increased resistance.\n2:41\nAnd if you have increased resistance,\n2:42\nyou know, again, resistance is going\n2:44\nto relate back to pressure.\n2:46\nSo if you have more resistance, you have higher pressure.\n2:49\nSo these are direct causes of hypertension,\n2:54\nwhich is slightly different than the indirect causes\n2:56\nI wrote above-- the smoking, obesity--\n2:58\nbecause there's no clear direct mechanism in any\n3:01\nof those things.\n3:01\nThey're just more general risk factors.\n3:03\nSo this is how we kind of divvy up the two groups.\n3:05\nAnd we say, OK, if you have one or the other,\n3:08\nthen you're in the primary or secondary group.\n3:11\nSo let's figure out, of the two, which is more prevalent.\n3:19\nAnd this basically means, which is\n3:22\ngoing to affect more people at any point in time.\n3:26\nSo if I was to poll all people with hypertension--\n3:29\nask them, hey, what group are you in, primary or secondary--\n3:33\nmost people would say primary, because most of these people\n3:38\nare going to be smokers or obese or diabetics or people that\n3:43\nhave hyperlipidemia, some of these risk factors\n3:46\nthat we just laid out.\n3:47\nIn fact over, 90% of the people have primary hypertension.\n3:55\nAnd only a few people, I would say less than 10%,\n3:59\nare going to say, nope, I'm actually\n4:00\nin the secondary group.\n4:01\nI have a very specific reason for having hypertension.\n4:05\nSo this is actually a very easy way\n4:06\nof figuring out if people are having hypertension\n4:10\nfrom an indirect cause or a direct cause.\n4:13\nAll right.\n4:13\nSo now, let's assume that you follow\n4:16\none person over time, one individual.\n4:19\nAnd that person used to have normal blood pressure.\n4:24\nLet's say this is blood pressure over here.\n4:26\nAnd I'm going to write it out as Mean Arterial Pressure, MAP.\n4:30\nMean Arterial Pressure.\n4:32\nAnd we want to maintain a Mean Arterial Pressure, a MAP,\n4:37\nof a certain number.\n4:38\nSo this would be like a normal blood pressure range, right?\n4:40\nSomething below this dashed line.\n4:43\nSo this is normal.\n4:46\nBut of course, many people have something higher than normal.\n4:49\nThey, over time, might develop higher blood pressure.\n4:54\nSo maybe they start out here and here in the normal range.\n4:58\nAnd then they start having high blood pressure.\n5:01\nAnd it kind of goes up and down, and up and then down\n5:04\nand stops there.\n5:06\nSo in this person-- I'm going to connect\n5:10\nthe dots-- they, if you asked them,\n5:13\nwould not have any symptoms for most of the time.\n5:16\nThey would actually say, you know, I feel fine.\n5:19\nI don't have any symptoms at all.\n5:20\nIn fact, up until this point in time,\n5:25\nthey would say they have no symptoms.\n5:29\nAnd the vast majority of people are actually in this group.\n5:32\nSo most people with hypertension,\n5:34\nif you ask them if they have symptoms from it,\n5:36\nthey would say no, they don't have any symptoms.\n5:38\nBut at some point, they can develop symptoms.\n5:41\nNot everybody, but you can develop symptoms.\n5:44\nAnd when you do, it's usually quite significant.\n5:47\nSo you might have problems with your heart.\n5:50\nMaybe your heart is having to work harder than it ever\n5:53\nhad to, and you're having some heart failure.\n5:55\nOr you might have problems with your large vessels\n5:59\nor medium vessels.\n6:01\nAnd primarily, these are the arteries,\n6:03\nbecause the arteries are the vessels that\n6:05\nare seeing those high pressures.\n6:06\nAnd those arteries might be getting very stiff.\n6:10\nOr you might have problems with tiny vessels.\n6:12\nThese are the little arteries, the smallest ones,\n6:15\nor the arterioles.\n6:17\nAnd remember, the smallest arteries and arterioles,\n6:19\nthey're not sitting there naked in your body.\n6:23\nThey're usually within an organ, right?\n6:26\nSo they're usually within the kidney,\n6:28\nor they could be within the eye.\n6:30\nSo I'll just draw these two.\n6:32\nSo they're usually within some other organ.\n6:35\nAnd if you have problems with the smallest arterioles-- let's\n6:38\nsay they're breaking-- then really, what you're saying\n6:42\nis you're going to have kidney problems or eye problems.\n6:45\nSo these are the kind of problems you can get.\n6:48\nAnd because most people are having\n6:50\nno symptoms-- most people are over here--\n6:52\nyou really want to catch them before they cross over\n6:56\nfrom no symptoms to having symptoms.\n6:58\nAnd you want to take care of the blood pressure problem\n7:01\nso that they never develop any symptoms.\n7:02\nThat's the goal.\n7:04\nNow, unfortunately, some people develop\n7:07\nwhat's called \"malignant hypertension.\"\n7:10\nAnd I'm going to write out for you\n7:11\nwhat malignant hypertension means.\n7:16\nIt's a few things.\n7:18\nAnd we can actually even draw it on our figure.\n7:20\nMaybe I'll do that.\n7:21\nSo you have people with malignant hypertension\n7:24\nthat have a rapid rise in their blood pressure.\n7:30\nAnd it causes damage to the heart and vessels.\n7:41\nAnd finally, the range that we're talking about,\n7:45\nit's a rapid rise to a really high blood pressure.\n7:48\nSometimes we think of these pressures\n7:50\nbeing around 240 over 120-- really high blood pressures.\n7:54\nSo on our graph, this could be the person\n7:56\nthat-- unlike the person in white,\n7:58\nthis person maybe had a very quick rise in pressure.\n8:04\nAnd then it got very high, maybe got up to 240 over 120.\n8:10\nAnd so this would be the third point.\n8:13\nThe rapid rise is the first point.\n8:16\nAnd the fact that they're having symptoms is point number two.\n8:19\nSo you can see now how someone with malignant hypertension\n8:23\ncould look on this sort of a graph.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn this video, I'm going to do several examples of quadratic\n0:03\nequations that are really of a special form, and it's really\n0:06\na bit of warm-up for the next video that we're going to do\n0:10\non completing the square.\n0:11\nSo let me show you what I'm talking about.\n0:13\nSo let's say I have 4x plus 1 squared, minus\n0:20\n8 is equal to 0.\n0:24\nNow, based on everything we've done so far, you might be\n0:26\ntempted to multiply this out, then subtract 8 from the\n0:29\nconstant you get out here, and then try to factor it.\n0:33\nAnd then you're going to have x minus something, times x\n0:37\nminus something else is equal to 0.\n0:43\nAnd you're going to say, oh, one of these must be equal to\n0:45\n0, so x could be that or that.\n0:47\nWe're not going to do that this time, because you might\n0:50\nsee something interesting here.\n0:52\nWe can solve this without factoring it.\n0:56\nAnd how do we do that?\n0:57\nWell, what happens if we add 8 to both\n0:59\nsides of this equation?\n1:02\nThen the left-hand side of the equation becomes 4x plus 1\n1:06\nsquared, and these 8's cancel out.\n1:09\nThe right-hand becomes just a positive 8.\n1:13\nNow, what can we do to both sides of this equation?\n1:15\nAnd this is just kind of straight, vanilla\n1:18\nequation-solving.\n1:19\nThis isn't any kind of fancy factoring.\n1:21\nWe can take the square root of both sides of this equation.\n1:28\nWe could take the square root.\n1:29\nSo 4x plus 1-- I'm just taking the square root of both sides.\n1:34\nYou take the square root of both sides, and, of course,\n1:36\nyou want to take the positive and the negative square root,\n1:39\nbecause 4x plus 1 could be the positive square root of 8, or\n1:43\nit could be the negative square root of 8.\n1:45\nSo 4x plus 1 is equal to the positive or negative\n1:50\nsquare root of 8.\n1:51\nInstead of 8, let me write 8 as 4 times 2.\n1:55\nWe all know that's what 8 is, and obviously the square root\n1:58\nof 4x plus 1 squared is 4x plus 1.\n2:02\nSo we get 4x plus 1 is equal to-- we can factor out the 4,\n2:09\nor the square root of 4, which is 2-- is equal to the plus or\n2:12\nminus times 2 times the square root of 2, right?\n2:17\nSquare root of 4 times square root of 2 is the same thing as\n2:19\nsquare root of 4 times the square root of 2, plus or\n2:23\nminus the square root of 4 is that 2 right there.\n2:26\nNow, it might look like a really bizarro equation, with\n2:29\nthis plus or minus 2 times the square of 2,\n2:32\nbut it really isn't.\n2:34\nThese are actually two numbers here, and we're actually\n2:36\nsimultaneously solving two equations.\n2:38\nWe could write this as 4x plus 1 is equal to the positive 2,\n2:43\nsquare root of 2, or 4x plus 1 is equal to negative 2 times\n2:52\nthe square root of 2.\n2:53\nThis one statement is equivalent to this right here,\n2:56\nbecause we have this plus or minus here, this or statement.\n2:59\nLet me solve all of these simultaneously.\n3:01\nSo if I subtract 1 from both sides of this\n3:05\nequation, what do I have?\n3:07\nOn the left-hand side, I'm just left with 4x.\n3:10\nOn the right-hand side, I have-- you can't really\n3:13\nmathematically, I mean, you could do them if you had a\n3:15\ncalculator, but I'll just leave it as negative 1 plus or\n3:19\nminus the square root, or 2 times the square root of 2.\n3:23\nThat's what 4x is equal to.\n3:25\nIf we did it here, as two separate equations, same idea.\n3:28\nSubtract 1 from both sides of this equation, you get 4x is\n3:32\nequal to negative 1 plus 2, times the square root of 2.\n3:36\nThis equation, subtract 1 from both sides.\n3:39\n4x is equal to negative 1 minus 2, times the\n3:44\nsquare root of 2.\n3:45\nThis statement right here is completely equivalent to these\n3:52\ntwo statements.\n3:53\nNow, last step, we just have to divide both sides by 4, so\n3:57\nyou divide both sides by 4, and you get x is equal to\n4:02\nnegative 1 plus or minus 2, times the square\n4:06\nroot of 2, over 4.\n4:09\nNow, this statement is completely equivalent to\n4:11\ndividing each of these by 4, and you get x is equal to\n4:16\nnegative 1 plus 2, times the square root 2, over 4.\n4:21\nThis is one solution.\n4:22\nAnd then the other solution is x is equal to negative 1 minus\n4:27\n2 roots of 2, all of that over 4.\n4:31\nThat statement and these two statements are equivalent.\n4:35\nAnd if you want, I encourage you to-- let's substitute one\n4:38\nof these back in, just so you feel confident that something\n4:41\nas bizarro as one of these expressions can be a solution\n4:45\nto a nice, vanilla-looking equation like this.\n4:48\nSo let's substitute it back in.\n4:50\n4 times x, or 4 times negative 1, plus 2 root 2, over 4, plus\n4:58\n1 squared, minus 8 is equal to 0.\n5:03\nNow, these 4's cancel out, so you're left with negative 1\n5:07\nplus 2 roots 2, plus 1, squared, minus\n5:12\n8 is equal to 0.\n5:14\nThis negative 1 and this positive 1 cancel out, so\n5:17\nyou're left with 2 roots of 2 squared, minus\n5:21\n8 is equal to 0.\n5:24\nAnd then what are you going to have here?\n5:28\nSo when you square this, you get 4 times 2, minus 8 is\n5:33\nequal to 0, which is true.\n5:38\n8 minus 8 is equal to 0.\n5:40\nAnd if you try this one out, you're going to get the exact\n5:42\nsame answer.\n5:44\nLet's do another one like this.\n5:45\nAnd remember, these are special forms where we have\n5:46\nsquares of binomials in our expression.\n5:51\nAnd we're going to see that the entire quadratic formula\n5:53\nis actually derived from a notion like this, because you\n5:55\ncan actually turn any, you can turn any, quadratic equation\n6:00\ninto a perfect square equalling something else.\n6:05\nWe'll see that two videos from now.\n6:06\nBut let's get a little warmed up just seeing\n6:08\nthis type of thing.\n6:09\nSo let's say you have x squared minus 10x, plus 25 is\n6:16\nequal to 9.\n6:18\nNow, once again your temptation-- and it's not a\n6:20\nbad temptation-- would be to subtract 9 from both sides, so\n6:23\nyou get a 0 on the right-hand side, but before you do that,\n6:27\njust inspect this really fast. And say, hey, is this just\n6:31\nmaybe a perfect square of a binomial?\n6:34\nAnd you see-- well, what two numbers when I multiply them I\n6:38\nget positive 25, and when I add them I get negative 10?\n6:41\nAnd hopefully negative 5 jumps out at you.\n6:44\nSo this expression right here is x minus 5, times x minus 5.\n6:52\nSo this left-hand side can be written as x minus 5 squared,\n6:56\nand the right-hand side is still 9.\n6:59\nAnd I want to really emphasize.\n7:01\nI don't want this to ruin all of the training you've gotten\n7:03\non factoring so far.\n7:05\nWe can only do this when this is a perfect square.\n7:08\nIf you got, like, x minus 3, times x plus 4, and that would\n7:12\nbe equal to 9, that would be a dead end.\n7:15\nYou wouldn't be able to really do anything\n7:16\nconstructive with that.\n7:17\nOnly because this is a perfect square, can we now say x minus\n7:21\n5 squared is equal to 9, and now we can take the square\n7:23\nroot of both sides.\n7:25\nSo we could say that x minus 5 is equal to plus or minus 3.\n7:31\nAdd 5 to both sides of this equation, you get x is equal\n7:36\nto 5 plus or minus 3, or x is equal to-- what's 5 plus 3?\n7:43\nWell, x could be 8 or x could be equal to 5 minus 3, or x is\n7:49\nequal to 2.\n7:51\nNow, we could have done this equation, this quadratic\n7:54\nequation, the traditional way, the way you were\n7:58\ntempted to do it.\n7:59\nWhat happens if you subtract 9 from both\n8:01\nsides of this equation?\n8:03\nYou'll get x squared minus 10x.\n8:07\nAnd what's 25 minus 9?\n8:09\n25 minus 9 is 16, and that would be equal to 0.\n8:16\nAnd here, this would be just a traditional factoring problem,\n8:18\nthe type that we've seen in the last few videos.\n8:21\nWhat two numbers, when you take their product, you get\n8:23\npositive 16, and when you sum them you get negative 10?\n8:29\nAnd maybe negative 8 and negative 2\n8:31\njump into your brain.\n8:33\nSo we get x minus 8, times x minus 2 is equal to 0.\n8:38\nAnd so x could be equal to 8 or x could be equal to 2.\n8:43\nThat's the fun thing about algebra: you can do things in\n8:46\ntwo completely different ways, but as long as you do them in\n8:49\nalgebraically-valid ways, you're not going to get\n8:52\ndifferent answers.\n8:55\nAnd on some level, if you recognize this, this is easier\n8:57\nbecause you didn't have to do that little game in your head,\n8:58\nin terms of, oh, what two numbers, when you multiply\n9:01\nthem you get 16, and when you add them you get negative 10?\n9:02\nHere, you just said, OK, this is x minus 5-- oh, I guess you\n9:05\ndid have to do it.\n9:06\nYou had to say, oh, 5 times 5 is 25, and negative 10 is\n9:10\nnegative 5 plus negative 5.\n9:11\nSo I take that back, you still have to do that little\n9:14\ngame in your head.\n9:15\nSo let's do another one.\n9:18\nLet's do one more of these, just to really get ourselves\n9:22\nnice and warmed up here.\n9:25\nSo, let's say we have x squared plus 18x, plus 81 is\n9:38\nequal to 1.\n9:41\nSo once again, we can do it in two ways.\n9:42\nWe could subtract 1 from both sides, or we could recognize\n9:46\nthat this is x plus 9, times x plus 9.\n9:53\nThis right here, 9 times 9 is 81, 9 plus 9 is 18.\n9:58\nSo we can write our equation as x plus 9\n10:01\nsquared is equal to 1.\n10:03\nTake the square root of both sides, you get x plus 9 is\n10:06\nequal to plus or minus the square root of 1,\n10:09\nwhich is just 1.\n10:10\nSo x is equal to-- subtract 9 from both sides-- negative 9\n10:15\nplus or minus 1.\n10:16\nAnd that means that x could be equal to-- negative 9 plus 1\n10:21\nis negative 8, or x could be equal to-- negative 9 minus 1,\n10:26\nwhich is negative 10.\n10:28\nAnd once again, you could have done this the traditional way.\n10:31\nYou could have subtracted 1 from both sides and you would\n10:33\nhave gotten x squared plus 18x, plus 80 is equal to 0.\n10:41\nAnd you'd say, hey, gee, 8 times 10 is 80, 8 plus 10 is\n10:44\n18, so you get x plus 8, times x plus 10 is equal to 0.\n10:50\nAnd then you'd get x could be equal to negative 8, or x\n10:54\ncould be equal to negative 10.\n10:57\nThat was good warm up.\n10:58\nNow, I think we're ready to tackle completing the square.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] Check out this fine looking sneaker\n0:02\nright here, we're gonna use this shoe to illustrate\n0:04\nsome more challenging normal force problems\n0:07\nand we're gonna take this as an opportunity to discuss\n0:09\na lot of the misconceptions that people have about\n0:11\nthe normal force.\n0:13\nSo one misconception is that people forget\n0:15\nnormal force is a contact force.\n0:17\nYou only have a normal force when two surfaces\n0:20\nare in contact, so when the shoe's in contact with\n0:22\nthe floor, there will be a normal force on the shoe\n0:24\nand a normal force on the floor.\n0:26\nOr if the shoe were in contact with the wall,\n0:28\nthere would be a normal force on the wall\n0:30\nand a normal force on the shoe.\n0:32\nBut if the shoe were just falling through the air,\n0:34\nhere's what happens for a lot of people.\n0:36\nLet's say the shoe's just falling,\n0:37\nand you got a question and the question said,\n0:39\ndraw the forces that are exerted on the shoe\n0:41\nwhile it's falling through the air.\n0:42\nPeople get so used to having normal forces\n0:44\nthat they make a mistake, they do this, they say alright,\n0:48\nlet me draw it over here.\n0:50\nThey say there's a gravitational force and that's just fine.\n0:52\nThere will be a gravitational force, there's always gravity,\n0:54\nthe Earth's always pulling down,\n0:56\nand it pulls down with an amount mg.\n0:58\nBut they're so used to having normal forces,\n1:00\nI mean normal forces pop up in so many different questions\n1:03\nit's almost just like a reflex,\n1:05\npeople just automatically put, whoop, there's a normal force\n1:08\nthere's gotta be a normal force, right?\n1:10\nThere's always a normal force?\n1:11\nBut there isn't always a normal force, if the shoe\n1:13\nis not in contact with the surface, you don't have a normal\n1:16\nforce, it's not until this shoe makes it to the ground\n1:20\nor touches another surface that you'll have that\n1:22\nnormal force, so if we stick this shoe right here\n1:25\nand we let it rest on the ground,\n1:27\nnow you'll have a normal force and that normal force\n1:29\nwill point up, and this is what people wanna say\n1:32\nand it's true when the surfaces are in contact\n1:35\nbut if they're not in contact,\n1:36\nyou don't have a normal force.\n1:38\nAnd then here's another misconception,\n1:40\npeople think the normal force is always equal to mg,\n1:43\nbecause again, it's equal to mg\n1:45\nin so many different scenarios that people just\n1:48\nwanna say well it's always equal to mg, and again,\n1:50\nit's just like a reaction.\n1:51\nPeople see normal force, they just automatically replace it\n1:54\nwith mg, and that'll be true in the simple case,\n1:57\nbut I'll show you coming up how that's not gonna be true\n1:59\nand what you do if it's not true.\n2:01\nSo for instance if we wanted to find what's the normal force\n2:03\nif this shoe has a mass m,\n2:06\nso let's assume that the shoe has a mass m,\n2:08\nwhat would the normal force be?\n2:10\nWe can use Newton's second law,\n2:11\nwe can always use Newton's second law,\n2:13\nso we'll say that acceleration equals the net force\n2:17\ndivided by the mass, and in this case,\n2:21\nsince these are vertical forces,\n2:23\nI'm gonna consider the acceleration\n2:24\nin the vertical direction and the net force\n2:26\nin the vertical direction.\n2:28\nAnd so what is the acceleration for the shoe vertically\n2:30\nif it's just sitting here in a room, sitting on the ground,\n2:33\nat rest and not changing it's motion,\n2:35\nnot changing it's velocity, the acceleration's just gonna\n2:37\nbe zero, so the vertical acceleration,\n2:40\nacceleration, excuse me, should be zero.\n2:42\nFor the net force, I've got an upward normal force,\n2:46\nso I'm gonna make that positive,\n2:48\nif fn represents the magnitude of the normal force,\n2:50\nthis would be positive Fn, I'm just gonna put positive here\n2:54\neven though I don't really need it but to show you\n2:56\nthat it's upward, we're gonna consider upward to be positive\n2:58\nand then I've got this downward gravitational force,\n3:00\nand if mg represents the size of the gravitational force,\n3:04\nI'm gonna put a negative here to represent that that\n3:06\ngravitational force is down, and then I divide by\n3:09\nthe mass of the shoe and if I do this I get that\n3:13\nthese two forces, this net force divided by the mass\n3:16\nhas to be zero, according to Newton's second law.\n3:19\nBut I can multiply both sides by the mass and if I do that,\n3:22\nthe left hand side is still zero,\n3:24\nand I'll get that this is equal to the normal force\n3:27\nminus mg, so I'll have normal force minus mg,\n3:32\nand if I finally solve for the normal force,\n3:35\nI'll get that the normal force is gonna equal mg,\n3:38\nand a lot of people are like yeah I already knew that, duh.\n3:42\nNormal force is always equal to mg, but it's only equal\n3:45\nto mg in this case because those were the only two forces,\n3:47\nlook at the assumptions we made.\n3:49\nOnly two forces were the normal force and the\n3:51\ngravitational force and we assumed that the acceleration\n3:54\nwas zero, if you relax any of those requirements,\n3:57\nnormal force is no longer going to be equal to mg.\n4:00\nAnd it was on a horizontal surface,\n4:02\nif you relax that requirement, again, there's no reason\n4:05\nto think this has to be in the Y direction,\n4:07\nyou could have normal forces in the X direction.\n4:09\nSo let's slowly, one point at a time,\n4:12\ntry to relax some of these requirements and see what\n4:14\nthat does to the normal force.\n4:16\nIn other words, what if we just added another force?\n4:19\nWhat if we let the shoe sit here on the ground\n4:22\nand I push down on it?\n4:23\nSo I'm pushing down on this shoe, I'm gonna say I'm pushing\n4:26\ndown with a force, I'll just call it F1, so a force\n4:31\nof magnitude, F1, and it's pointing downward,\n4:34\nhow would that change this now?\n4:36\nSo this is, we're stepping it up, this is gonna be a little\n4:38\nharder, what do we do?\n4:40\nWell the acceleration is still zero, let's say it's still\n4:42\njust sitting there, so we don't have to do anything\n4:45\nwith the left hand side that's still zero,\n4:47\nmultiplying by m still makes that zero,\n4:49\nbut now up here in this force up here,\n4:50\nI'm gonna have another force, I'm gonna have F1,\n4:53\nthat points down so in my force diagram\n4:55\nI'd have another force that points down, F1,\n4:58\nthat means I'd have to subtract it when I find\n5:01\nthe net vertical force, I'd have F1,\n5:03\nthis would be a negative F1 right here,\n5:06\nand when I solve for Fn I'd add mg to both sides\n5:09\nto cancel it and then I'd add F1 to both sides\n5:12\nto cancel this F1, this negative F1,\n5:14\nand I'd get mg plus F1.\n5:17\nSo I get the normal force is gonna be bigger,\n5:19\nbigger by an amount F2 and that makes sense,\n5:22\nif you push down on a, oh no F2, wow,\n5:25\nF1, sorry about that, it's gonna be bigger by an amount F1,\n5:28\nso if I push down with an extra 10 Newtons of force,\n5:32\nthere's more pressure, right?\n5:34\nThat makes sense, the pressure between the ground\n5:36\nand the shoe is gonna be greater, you're squashing\n5:37\nthese two surfaces together with greater force,\n5:40\nso the ground's gotta push up to keep the shoe\n5:42\nout of the surface, that's what this normal force does,\n5:45\nit exerts a force to keep the object out of the surface,\n5:48\nto keep the object from penetrating that surface,\n5:51\nso if I push down on an object, into a surface,\n5:54\nthat normal force increases and it increases by the amount\n5:57\nyou're pushing down, so that makes sense.\n6:00\nIf you had an upward force, let's say you had an\n6:01\nupward force, someone's pulling up on the shoe\n6:04\nwhile you push down, you're fighting over the shoe,\n6:06\nyou're wrestling over it with somebody because they just,\n6:09\nthey love the shoe, they recognize the beauty of the shoe,\n6:12\nwell crafted shoe, so if there's an F2 pointing up,\n6:15\nwe now have another force in our diagram,\n6:17\nthat force would point up, we would call this F2,\n6:20\nover here how would this change?\n6:22\nAgain, still acceleration to zero,\n6:24\nbut I'd have an upward force now so I'd have to add\n6:26\nF2 vertically because that's another force,\n6:29\nI'd have a plus F2 right here,\n6:31\nand then over here when I solve for this,\n6:34\nI add mg to both sides, I add F1 to both sides,\n6:37\nand I have to subtract F2 from both sides\n6:40\nso now I'd have Fn is mg plus F1 minus F2,\n6:44\nthis also makes sense, if you pull up on a shoe,\n6:47\nyou're relieving some of the pressure between the shoe\n6:50\nand the other surface, the shoe and the floor.\n6:53\nSo if I pull up with 20 Newtons I'm gonna reduce\n6:56\nthe normal force by 20 Newtons because I'm relieving\n6:58\nsome of that pressure between the shoe and the floor.\n7:01\nLet's make it even harder.\n7:03\nLet's make this thing scary, sometimes you get really\n7:06\ncrazy problems and you don't know what to do, let's say,\n7:08\nwe have another force, let's say this force is gonna be\n7:12\na diagonal force, so we're gonna pull this way.\n7:17\nThat was not a well drawn force, let me draw it like this.\n7:21\nSo we got a force this way at an angle.\n7:24\nNow we're talking, this is F3.\n7:28\nF3, at an angle of, we'll call it Fi, so the angle from\n7:32\nthis horizontal line here is Fi.\n7:37\nNow what do we do?\n7:38\nSo I've got this crooked angle in here, now this F3 is\n7:41\ngonna be pointing this way, so I'll add another force\n7:44\nto my force diagram, and I can figure out how to include\n7:48\nthis into my vertical force version of Newton's second law,\n7:53\nI can't include the entire F3 force, here's a mistake\n7:56\npeople make, they wanna just add F3 or subtract F3,\n7:58\nbut I can't do that, this is the vertical form of\n8:02\nNewton's second law, this is only applying to the vertical\n8:04\ndirection, the Y direction, but F3 is pointing both\n8:07\nvertically and horizontally.\n8:09\nSo I have to only include the vertical part of F3\n8:12\nin this formula so what I have to do is say that alright\n8:15\nF3 is gonna have a vertical component,\n8:17\nthat vertical component, I'll call it F3 Y,\n8:20\nfor F3 in the vertical direction.\n8:22\nAnd it's also gonna have a horizontal component.\n8:24\nI'll just call that F3 X for F3 in the horizontal direction.\n8:29\nSo if I wanna solve for F3 Y, I'll just use the definition\n8:32\nof sine and I know to use sine because this side is\n8:35\nthe opposite to this angle, I know sine\n8:38\nrelates opposite side, so I'm gonna write this as\n8:40\nsine of phi is gonna equal the opposite side is F3 Y\n8:45\nso F3 in the Y direction divided by F3 total,\n8:50\nthe total magnitude of F3, and if I solve this for F3 Y,\n8:53\nI get F3 in the Y direction is gonna equal F3 times sine\n8:59\nof Fi, now I can include this in my force, my net force,\n9:03\nbecause this points upward, so since it points up,\n9:07\nthis vertical component's gonna add a plus,\n9:10\nF3 sin theta over here, or sorry not theta,\n9:14\nit's gonna be F3 sin Fi, and I'll have a plus F3 sin fi\n9:20\nright here, and when we subtract this F3 sin phi from the\n9:24\nother side to get it over to here,\n9:27\nwe're gonna get minus F3 sine phi and that makes sense\n9:31\nbecause if we pull up, we know we're reducing some\n9:34\nof the pressure, we'll reduce the normal force,\n9:37\nso this component, look at this component points up,\n9:39\nit's reducing some of the pressure\n9:41\non the bottom of the shoe, the normal force goes down,\n9:44\nand so we subtract the F3 sin fi.\n9:47\nAnd one more way to step this problem up to the next level\n9:50\nwould be to say that this room isn't really just a room,\n9:53\nmaybe it's an elevator,\n9:54\nand this elevator is accelerating upward\n9:56\nwith some acceleration A zero, in that case,\n10:00\nnothing would change on this right hand side.\n10:02\nSometimes people think if there's acceleration,\n10:04\nthere's gonna be some new force, but if these are the forces\n10:07\nthose are the forces, the only thing that changes over here\n10:10\nif this was in an elevator that's accelerating up,\n10:13\nis that instead of zero, you'd replace this with a zero\n10:16\nor whatever the acceleration is, that's it,\n10:19\nthat's the only change, you could still solve for fn\n10:21\nthe same way, when you multiply by m it wouldn't be\n10:23\nzero on the left anymore, you'd have a m a zero,\n10:26\nand then a plus m a zero when you solve\n10:30\nfor the normal force.\n10:32\nAlright, I think we've pretty much exhausted\n10:34\nthis example of a shoe on the floor,\n10:36\nit's probably harder than any example you'll see\n10:39\nbut now you know how to handle any type of force\n10:41\nyou might meet or acceleration.",

fraction.\n99:59:59\nThe fraction of those planets that\n99:59:59\nare capable of sustaining life, that actually, this\n99:59:59\nis capable of sustaining life, now we're\n99:59:59\nsaying that the fraction that actually do develop life.\n99:59:59\nAnd then of the life, we care about the fraction\n99:59:59\nthat actually does become intelligent.\n99:59:59\nAnd of the fraction that actually\n99:59:59\ndoes become intelligent, we care about the fraction\n99:59:59\nthat eventually becomes detectable.\n99:59:59\nThat can actually communicate.\n99:59:59\nAnd then in the traditional Drake equation,\n99:59:59\nwe multiply that times this L over here.\n99:59:59\nTimes the detectable life of the civilization.\n99:59:59\nSo how long is that civilization detectable?\n99:59:59\nAre they releasing radio waves, or something like it\n99:59:59\nthat a civilization like ours can detect?\n99:59:59\nMaybe there are other ways to communicate,\n99:59:59\nand we're just not advanced enough.\n99:59:59\nMaybe in a few years, we'll discover\n99:59:59\nin a few decades, or a few hundreds of years,\n99:59:59\nwe'll discover that all the other advanced civilizations\n99:59:59\nare using a much more sophisticated way\n99:59:59\nof communicating that doesn't involve electromagnetic waves.\n99:59:59\nWho knows?\n99:59:59\nBut this is what we're thinking right now.\n99:59:59\nBut anyway, the whole point here is\n99:59:59\nto reconcile this thing which is less intuitive-- for me\n99:59:59\nat least-- than with this thing.\n99:59:59\nBecause I started up here with the total number\n99:59:59\nof stars in the galaxy.\n99:59:59\nThe traditional Drake equation starts\n99:59:59\nwith the average rate of star formation.\n99:59:59\nSo it's like, well, how does the average rate of star formation\n99:59:59\ngel with the total number of stars,\n99:59:59\nor civilizations that are now detectable?\n99:59:59\nWhat I want to do is diagram that out a little bit,\n99:59:59\nand I'm going to make a few assumptions.\n99:59:59\nI'm going to assume that this is kind of constant, that we're\n99:59:59\nin a steady state.\n99:59:59\nSo this is constant, and we are in a steady state.\n99:59:59\nThe reality is that what would matter\n99:59:59\nis the rate of star formation maybe 4, 5,\n99:59:59\n6 billion years ago, I don't know\n99:59:59\nhow long it has to be ago, so that now it\n99:59:59\nstarts to become realistic for real intelligence\n99:59:59\nand real detectable intelligence to exist.\n99:59:59\nBut let's just assume that this number\n99:59:59\nis constant for most of the life of the galaxy.\n99:59:59\nObviously we're making all sorts of crazy assumptions here,\n99:59:59\nso why not make another one?\n99:59:59\nBut what I want you to show is that this\n99:59:59\nis equivalent to the number of stars in the galaxy divided\n99:59:59\nby the average life of a star, or the average life\n99:59:59\nof a solar system.\n99:59:59\nAnd if n divided by this t sub s,\n99:59:59\nif that's the same thing as our star, then\n99:59:59\nessentially we have the same formulas.\n99:59:59\nAnd to see that they're the same, imagine this.\n99:59:59\nImagine this.\n99:59:59\nThat this year, so this is this year, so this is-- well,\n99:59:59\nlet me say this year.\n99:59:59\nThis year.\n99:59:59\nLet's say that we have our star.\n99:59:59\nLet's say that this number is 10.\n99:59:59\nWe have 10 new stars in the galaxy.\n99:59:59\nSo this is-- I'll just say it's 10.\n99:59:59\nSo our star is equal to 10.\n99:59:59\nSo this height over here is 10.\n99:59:59\nThat's what I'm depicting.\n99:59:59\nSo if I were to slide it, I could\n99:59:59\nshow that this is 10 units high, or whatever.\n99:59:59\nAnd then last year, there was also 10, so on and so forth.\n99:59:59\nNow, let's go to whatever-- let's\n99:59:59\nsay that this number, this number right over here\n99:59:59\nis 10 billion years.\n99:59:59\nThe average star life is 10 billion years.\n99:59:59\nSo let's go back 10 billion years into the past.\n99:59:59\nSo the average life of a star is equal to 10 billion years.\n99:59:59\nAnd we're assuming that this is constant.\n99:59:59\nSo 10 billion years ago this year,\n99:59:59\nthere were also 10 new stars came about.\n99:59:59\nAnd every year in between you had 10 stars come about.\n99:59:59\nNow, how many total stars would there be in our galaxy?\n99:59:59\nWell, any star that came about-- so we could go beyond that.\n99:59:59\nWe could go to stars that were born more than 10 billion years\n99:59:59\nago, more than this t sub s years ago.\n99:59:59\nSo you could have a star that was born 10\n99:59:59\nbillion and 1 years ago, on average.\n99:59:59\nWe're talking about on averages here.\n99:59:59\nOn average, that star will not exist anymore,\n99:59:59\nso that star is not in existence.\n99:59:59\nThe stars that are in existence, once again, on average,\n99:59:59\nare the ones that were born 10 billion years ago, all the way\n99:59:59\nto the ones that were born this year.\n99:59:59\nSo you have 10 billion years of star birth,\n99:59:59\nthe ones that are still around.\n99:59:59\nEach year there's 10 of those years,\n99:59:59\nso the total number of stars should\n99:59:59\nbe equal to the number of stars that\n99:59:59\nare born each year-- assuming that that is constant--\n99:59:59\ntimes the average lifespan of the stars.\n99:59:59\nTimes the average lifespan of the stars.\n99:59:59\nAnd once again, this works because the stars that\n99:59:59\nwere born before this lifespan don't exist anymore.\n99:59:59\nThey've died out, on average.\n99:59:59\nWe care about kind of this area right over here.\n99:59:59\n10 stars per year times 10 billion years.\n99:59:59\nAnd now if you manipulate this a little bit,\n99:59:59\nyou'll see that we'll get the result we want.\n99:59:59\nLet's solve for r.\n99:59:59\nSo we could just divide both sides by this t.\n99:59:59\nSo you get n star, so the number of stars in our galaxy now,\n99:59:59\nmaking a bunch of assumptions, divided\n99:59:59\nby the average life of the stars is\n99:59:59\nequal to the average number of new stars per year.\n99:59:59\nIs equal to the average number of new stars per year,\n99:59:59\nand we get our result.\n99:59:59\nIf you replace this with the total number of stars divided\n99:59:59\nby t, you get the exact same result that we had before.\n99:59:59\nYou just change the order a bit.\n99:59:59\nWe can take this divided by t, put it under this n,\n99:59:59\ntake it out up here, and then you get the exact same thing.\n99:59:59\nSo hopefully that reconciles it a little bit for you.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nOnce upon a time, there was a small world.\n0:03\nIt was a flat world.\n0:05\nAnd it wasn't very wide.\n0:06\nIn fact, it was so thin that if you weren't careful,\n0:09\nyou might fall right off the edge.\n0:11\nIn this world was a house.\n0:14\nAnd in this house lived a triangle.\n0:16\nHer name was wind.\n0:18\nWind lived all alone, and was sometimes sad about that.\n0:22\nBut she wasn't too lonely because she\n0:24\nhad a friend who lived just one house over.\n0:26\nHis name was Mr. Ug.\n0:29\nWind often went to visit Mr. Ug.\n0:31\nShe'd walked past the big rock, and the pine log, and the Beet\n0:35\nPeel store, though she'd never seen it open,\n0:37\nuntil she got to Mr. Ug's little yellow house.\n0:41\nThe problem with Mr. Ug was that he never seemed to be home.\n0:46\nSo Wind did what she always did, and left him a message so\n0:49\nthat he'd know that she'd been there.\n0:51\nHi Mr. Ug, she wrote.\n0:54\nShe hung around a little longer hoping he might come home soon,\n0:57\nbut eventually she gave up and walked back home.\n0:59\nPast the Beet Peel store, the pine log, and the big rock,\n1:03\nto her own little house.\n1:05\nWhen she got back, she saw that someone had left her a message.\n1:08\nIt said, Hi Wind.\n1:10\nMr. Ug must have come by to see her\n1:12\nwhile she was out trying to see him.\n1:14\nShe kicked herself for waiting around so long at his house,\n1:16\nmaybe if she'd gotten back sooner,\n1:18\nshe could've caught him while he was still there.\n1:20\nShe erased the message and decided to go back to his place\n1:22\nsince he was obviously heading back there as well.\n1:25\nTheir timing always seemed to be wrong.\n1:28\nWhenever she went to see him, he seemed to be out visiting her.\n1:31\nIn fact, she never actually met Mr. Ug,\n1:33\nbut she felt like she knew him very well,\n1:34\nbecause of the messages they were always leaving each other.\n1:37\nWhen she got to his place, she saw\n1:39\nthat he had already read her message,\n1:41\nerased it, and left again.\n1:43\nBut Wind was used to this kind of coincidence,\n1:45\nso she simply continued their conversation\n1:47\nby leaving another message.\n1:49\nHow are you right now, she asked, and turned around\n1:51\nto go home.\n1:53\nHer grammar and spelling weren't so good,\n1:55\nbecause, after all, there was no school in her little world.\n1:58\nMr. Ug didn't always have perfect spelling either,\n2:01\nbut Wind thought that he had a lovely way with words.\n2:04\nFor example, when she got home, she\n2:05\nfound that Mr. Ug had already written a reply to her\n2:08\nhow are you.\n2:09\nHe said, Nomin' life, nom.\n2:12\nShe thought this was a beautiful metaphor,\n2:14\nand felt lucky to have a neighbor who never answered how\n2:17\nare you, with something boring like, fine thank you.\n2:20\nBut what she really wanted, more than anything,\n2:23\nwas to actually meet him.\n2:25\nSee his face for the first time.\n2:27\nShe decided to try another tactic.\n2:29\nShe erased his note and left one saying, back soon.\n2:32\nThis way, if Mr. Ug came to visit while she was out,\n2:35\nhe'd know to stay around for a while until she got back.\n2:39\nThe prospect of finally meeting him\n2:41\nmade Wind feel nervous and self conscious about how\n2:43\nboring her messages always were compared to his.\n2:46\nSo she decided to get artistic and illustrated it\n2:48\nby drawing a foot with wings on the hill.\n2:51\nShe then rushed back to Mr. Ug's house\n2:53\nwith all the swiftness of Hermes,\n2:54\nto find that, indeed, he was, once again, not there.\n2:57\nThough it seemed he had taken up a new project as there\n3:00\nwas a sign up for a Buck Zoo, complete\n3:02\nwith a picture of a fully antlered buck.\n3:05\nMaybe he was out collecting deer for his zoo,\n3:08\nbut maybe, just maybe, he had gone to visit her\n3:10\nand saw her sign, and decided to wait until she got back.\n3:14\nSo she dashed out a quick, hello, leaving.\n3:16\nAnd then rushed back to her house\n3:18\nwith all the swiftness of Mercury.\n3:21\nShe approached her house, anticipating finally\n3:23\nsaying hello to Mr. Ug in real life, for the first time.\n3:26\nBut found only a message that said, revalue hello.\n3:30\nIt was an interesting message, and gave her something\n3:32\nto ponder.\n3:33\nMaybe she was spending too much time trying to greet and talk\n3:36\nto Mr. Ug, and not enough time on her own projects.\n3:39\nShe thought about how often they seem to cross paths,\n3:43\nand yet, she'd never actually passed him\n3:44\non the path between their houses.\n3:46\nMaybe there was another path he used.\n3:48\nWind had never explored the world to the left of her house,\n3:51\nbut maybe it was about time she stopped obsessing over Mr. Ug\n3:54\nand went on an adventure.\n3:56\nMaybe, while Mr. Ug worked on his Buck Zoo,\n3:59\nshe could have a project of her own\n4:01\nand work on exploring the world.\n4:03\nSo she went left, and discovered a few new places.\n4:06\nThere was a store which sold beef and beer,\n4:09\nthough unfortunately it seemed to have closed long ago.\n4:12\nAnd a blue rod, and a lock pie, which didn't sound\n4:15\ntoo appetizing to her.\n4:17\nBefore long, however, she found herself somewhere familiar.\n4:20\nShe was back at Mr. Ug's house, and as usual, he was not home.\n4:25\nBut now she knew why they kept missing each other.\n4:28\nTheir little world was a loop, and they\n4:30\nwere taking different paths from one side to the other.\n4:33\nWind was very excited by this discovery\n4:35\nbecause now she understood her world a little better.\n4:38\nBest of all, in such a small world, her and Mr. Ug\n4:40\nwere bound to meet eventually.\n4:43\nSo she went home and decided to start another project.\n4:46\nSometimes she worried that one of them\n4:47\nwould accidentally fall off the edge of the world,\n4:49\nand she would never get to meet Mr. Ug.\n4:52\nAfter all, she herself had fallen off\n4:54\nthe flat land where she grew up, which\n4:56\nwas how she'd gotten here.\n4:57\nShe'd thought about building a fence along the edge,\n5:00\nbut it had always seemed like too big a project.\n5:02\nNow that she knew that her world was a loop,\n5:04\nshe realized she could actually finish this project\n5:07\nand build a fence around the entire world.\n5:10\nShe started with the side below her house,\n5:12\nand started around towards Mr. Ug's.\n5:15\nShe passed the big rock, and the pine log,\n5:17\nand the beet peel store, until she\n5:19\ngot to Mr. Ug's little yellow house, her heart fluttering\n5:22\nat the hope that he might be home this time.\n5:24\nBut she saw to her surprise that Mr. Ug\n5:26\nwas building a fence of his own on the other edge of the world.\n5:29\nMaybe he had gone to visit her, and saw the beginnings\n5:31\nof her fence, and decided to help out.\n5:33\nWind continued building her fence,\n5:35\nthinking how sweet it was that Mr. Ug was\n5:37\nhelping with her project.\n5:39\nShe passed the lock pie, and the blue rod,\n5:42\nand the beef and beer store.\n5:44\nAnd when she got back to her home,\n5:45\nshe was pleased to see that her entire world was safe\n5:49\nand she only had to build a fence along one edge of it.\n5:52\nSecure in the knowledge that Mr. Ug wasn't going anywhere,\n5:55\nWind started pursuing other projects in the following days.\n5:58\nFor example, she got a pet dog which\n6:00\nhelped her feel a bit less lonely,\n6:02\nand built it a dog house.\n6:04\nShe still wandered over to Mr. Ug's place\n6:06\non occasion, just to see how he was doing.\n6:08\nIt seemed that recently he'd gotten religious,\n6:10\nbecause he built what appeared to be a small church.\n6:13\nOne day, Wind was out walking her dog\n6:15\nwhen the ground started to shake.\n6:17\nSuddenly, the ground began to split.\n6:20\nIt was an earthquake so powerful that it\n6:22\nwas ripping her world apart.\n6:24\nWind quickly got away from the dangerous new edge that\n6:27\nwas being torn through her world,\n6:28\nbut her dog was still on the other side.\n6:31\nShe ran trying to get past the crack,\n6:32\nbut the world was splitting right down the center,\n6:34\nall the way around.\n6:36\nShe could still hear her dog barking,\n6:37\nbut the sound faded as the two sides of her worlds separated\n6:41\nand drifted apart.\n6:42\nWould she ever see her dog again?\n6:45\nAnd what about Mr. Ug?\n6:47\nI hate to end on a cliffhanger, but luckily for you, you\n6:50\ncan figure out the ending to this story yourself.\n6:52\nWind lives on not just any loop, but a Mobius strip,\n6:55\nwhich you can make easily out of paper.\n6:57\nJust cut out a strip, and instead of taping it\n6:59\ninto a normal loop, give it a half twist first.\n7:01\nIf you use a marker that bleeds through the paper,\n7:03\nyou can draw Wind's house and see it from the other side.\n7:06\nBut all that's essential here is that you draw wind and her dog.\n7:09\nCut a line down the center of the paper, all the way around,\n7:12\nand you tell me how it ends.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nSo we talked about inhaling and exhaling.\n0:03\nAnd I'd mentioned that the key first step for both of them\n0:06\nis this change in volume, going up in volume\n0:09\nor going down in volume.\n0:10\nBut I didn't really talk about how that happens exactly,\n0:13\nso I thought I would jump into that now.\n0:16\nAnd let me begin by telling you that in the middle\n0:18\nof your chest, you have this enormous kind of bone that\n0:21\ngoes down.\n0:22\nAnd I'm drawing it out of proportion just\n0:24\nto make it very clear where this bone is.\n0:26\nBut you can go ahead and feel on your own body\n0:29\nthis bone, which we call either the breastbone,\n0:32\nor the more technical name is the sternum.\n0:35\nSo I'll write that down here.\n0:37\nThe sternum is this middle bone, and all the ribs on both sides\n0:41\nattach there.\n0:42\nSo you've got a total of 12 ribs and seven pairs of them.\n0:48\nActually, I should say 12 pairs of ribs.\n0:51\nI don't want you to think there are 12 total.\n0:53\nWe actually have 24 total and seven pairs of the ribs.\n0:57\nSo 14 ribs actually attach directly to this sternum bone.\n1:04\nSo in white, these are the ribs.\n1:05\nAnd between the ribs, you actually have muscle.\n1:07\nSo I'm going to draw in some of these muscles between the ribs.\n1:11\nAnd these muscles are all going to have their own nerve that\n1:16\nallows them to contract.\n1:18\nSo these muscles are controlled by your brain,\n1:23\nand their name-- let me just jot down here\n1:26\non the side-- is intercostal muscle.\n1:29\nAnd inter just means between, so this is the name of the muscle.\n1:33\nAnd costal refers to the ribs.\n1:35\nSo when you see that word costal,\n1:37\nyou'll know we're talking about the ribs.\n1:39\nSo what's between the ribs is these muscles,\n1:42\nintercostal muscles.\n1:44\nAnd they are going to start moving outwards when\n1:48\nyour brain says, hey, I want to take a deep breath.\n1:51\nSo these muscles are going to contract.\n1:54\nThe ribs, I should say, are going to move outwards.\n1:57\nSo these go out.\n1:59\nAnd you also have-- let me just make\n2:01\na little bit of space on this canvas-- another muscle\n2:04\nthat kind of rides down here and has\n2:07\nkind of an upside down U shape to it.\n2:11\nSo I'm drawing it kind of like a dome.\n2:14\nYou can think of it as a dome.\n2:16\nAnd this dome is the floor-- if you remember,\n2:19\nwe talked about the floor of the thorax.\n2:20\nSo this is, of course, our diaphragm muscle.\n2:24\nSo we've got our diaphragm muscle.\n2:25\nAnd this one when it contracts, instead of going out,\n2:29\nit's going to go down.\n2:31\nSo it's going to kind of flatten out.\n2:33\nAnd I can actually draw this.\n2:34\nIf you can now just stick with me for a moment,\n2:38\nI'm going to erase this dome-like shape.\n2:41\nAnd I'm going to draw what it looks like as it contracts.\n2:44\nSo when it contracts, it's actually going to be more flat.\n2:47\nAnd this flat diaphragm, as you can see,\n2:53\nis now further down than it used to be.\n2:56\nAnd as it goes down, all of the structures that\n2:59\nare inside this space-- so the two lungs.\n3:01\nAnd of course, I didn't draw the heart here.\n3:03\nBut the heart would be kind of in this cardiac notch.\n3:06\nIf you want, maybe I could even draw that heart here.\n3:10\nThey're all going to kind of physically move down.\n3:13\nSo this is our heart and our lungs.\n3:15\nThey're physically going to be kind of drawn\n3:18\ndownwards and out.\n3:20\nThey are going to also move out as the intercostal muscles move\n3:25\nout.\n3:26\nSo you have expansion of these lungs.\n3:28\nThat's basically the idea.\n3:30\nAnd if you were to kind of zoom in on this to kind of see\n3:32\nexactly what this expansion looks\n3:34\nlike, when I say you have more volume in the lungs,\n3:38\nreally what I should be saying, if I wanted to be more exact,\n3:42\nis that all the alveoli-- if these are the alveoli,\n3:45\nlet's say this is another branch.\n3:46\nAnd this is another alveoli right here.\n3:48\nAll these alveoli, they are actually expanding.\n3:52\nAnd you have about 500 million alveoli.\n3:56\nIf you can just kind of fathom how big a number that is.\n3:59\nIt's an enormous number of alveoli.\n4:01\nAnd if I was actually drawing them,\n4:02\nI would be here drawing forever.\n4:05\nIt would take forever to write out\n4:07\nthis many different alveoli.\n4:09\nBut basically what happens is that when the ribs go out\n4:12\nand the diaphragm moves down, these alveoli are actually\n4:15\nbeing pulled out.\n4:18\nThey're actually being pulled outwards,\n4:20\nso they are actually going to be getting larger in size.\n4:23\nThey literally look like they've grown in size,\n4:26\nand this is what they look like.\n4:28\nAnd actually, if you were to take an even closer look,\n4:31\nyou'd see that these alveoli have around them\n4:35\na bunch of protein.\n4:36\nThe cells around them have a bunch of protein,\n4:38\nand this protein is called elastin.\n4:42\nAnd you can guess what elastin might do.\n4:45\nIt has kind of a similar sound to the word elastic.\n4:49\nAnd elastin is basically kind of like a rubber band,\n4:52\nso you can kind of think of elastin as a rubber band.\n4:56\nAnd when the muscles move down and out\n5:00\nand the alveoli are pulled open--\n5:03\nlet me actually now scroll up, because you can kind of go back\n5:06\nto the idea of inhaling-- what is happening, then?\n5:09\nWell, you have a couple things happening.\n5:11\nOne, you have muscles-- I'll just write muscles contracting.\n5:17\nAnd when I say muscles, you know I'm\n5:19\ntalking about all those intercostal muscles\n5:21\nin your diaphragm.\n5:22\nAnd as a result of the muscles contracting,\n5:24\nyou have now the alveoli are stretched open.\n5:30\nSo those rubber bands, those elastin proteins,\n5:33\nare literally physically being stretched opened.\n5:40\nAnd keep that in mind, because what's going to happen then\n5:44\nis when the muscles relax, which is\n5:47\nwhat happens when you exhale, what do you\n5:51\nthink is going to happen to that elastin?\n5:53\nWell, if it's like a rubber band,\n5:55\nif that's what I'm saying it's going to be like,\n5:57\nthen the alveoli are going to recoil.\n6:01\nAnd that's actually the driving force\n6:04\nfor why the volume goes back down.\n6:07\nSo if you have a bunch of rubber bands\n6:08\nthat you're stretching out-- let me actually\n6:09\nbring up the picture.\n6:10\nYou'll see it really clearly.\n6:12\nIf you're physically kind of using your muscles to help\n6:16\npull this stuff open, then the moment\n6:18\nthat you stop pulling open, the moment\n6:21\nthat you stop contracting those muscles now\n6:24\nthat you have a nice big volume, what's going to happen?\n6:27\nWell, all these elastin molecules\n6:30\nare going to snap back.\n6:32\nLet me do it with a different color.\n6:33\nLet's do this color.\n6:34\nThey're going to snap back like this.\n6:38\nAll that protein is going to want\n6:39\nto snap back into the original size.\n6:43\nAnd when they do, this thing gets smaller.\n6:45\nSo my alveoli goes back to its original size,\n6:48\nwhich was much smaller than this.\n6:49\nLet me actually just quickly show that and show you\n6:53\nthat even though contraction is what opened up things,\n6:57\nit's the recoil that brings things\n6:59\nback down to their normal size.\n7:02\nAnd let me erase this to make it kind of a neater drawing.\n7:05\nSo you can see it now.\n7:06\nInhaling, the way that we actually increase the volume,\n7:09\nis by pulling things open through contraction.\n7:13\nAnd this actually requires energy.\n7:16\nRemember, you can't contract a muscle\n7:18\nwithout spending chemical energy.\n7:21\nSo this takes chemical energy, and we usually\n7:24\nthink of this molecule ATP as the specific type of chemical\n7:28\nenergy we're going to use.\n7:30\nAnd to exhale, when you reduce the volume,\n7:34\nit's going to be driven by this elastic recoil.\n7:37\nSo that's a type of elastic potential energy.\n7:43\nSo this process of inhaling and exhaling\n7:48\nis really a little different from each other.\n7:50\nOn the one hand, you're using ATP.\n7:52\nYou're actually burning through these molecules.\n7:54\nAnd then when you exhale, you're actually\n7:56\nnot using chemical energy anymore.\n7:59\nYou're just using that elastic potential energy,\n8:01\nkind of the same sort of energy that you\n8:03\ncan imagine you would have if you snap a rubber band.\n8:07\nSo let's stop there, and we'll pick up in the next video.",

Because if they lose an electron\n3:40\nthey get to the electron configuration\n3:43\nof the noble gas before it.\n3:46\nSo, if Lithium loses an electron\n3:49\nthen it has an outer shell electron configuration of Helium.\n3:53\nIt has two outer electrons and that's kind of,\n3:56\nwe typically talk about the Octet Rule\n3:58\nbut if we're talking about characters like Lithium or Helium\n4:01\nthey're happy with two 'cause you can\n4:03\nonly put two electrons in that first shell.\n4:06\nBut all the rest of 'em, Sodium, Potassium, etc., etc.,\n4:10\nif you take an electron away from them\n4:12\nthen their outermost shell,\n4:13\nwell, all of them in their outermost shell\n4:15\nthey're going to have the electron configuration\n4:17\nof the noble gas before it\n4:19\nand for Sodium on down that outer shell\n4:23\nis going to have that perfect eight.\n4:24\nLithium, if you remove an electron,\n4:26\nit would get to Helium and it would have\n4:27\ntwo electrons in its outer shell.\n4:29\nSo, you can imagine that the ionization energy\n4:32\nright over here, the energy required to remove electrons\n4:38\nfrom your Alkali Metals is very low.\n4:42\nSo, let me just write down this is...\n4:44\nSo, when I say low, I'm talking about low ionization energy.\n4:47\nLow.\n4:49\nNow, what happens as we move to the right\n4:51\nof the periodic table?\n4:52\nIn fact, let's go all the way\n4:53\nto the right on the periodic table.\n4:55\nWell, if we go here to the Noble Gases,\n4:57\nthe Noble Gases we've already talked about.\n4:59\nThey're very, very, very stable.\n5:01\nThey don't want no one,\n5:02\nthey don't want their electron configurations messed with.\n5:05\nSo, it would be very hard...\n5:06\nNeon on down has their eight electrons\n5:09\nthat (mumbling) Octet Rule.\n5:11\nHelium has two which is full for the first shell,\n5:14\nand so it's very hard to remove an electron from here,\n5:17\nand so it has a very high ionization energy.\n5:20\nLow energy, easy to remove electrons.\n5:22\nOr especially the first electron,\n5:24\nand then here you have a high ionization energy.\n5:28\nI know you have trouble seeing that H.\n5:30\nSo, this is high, high ionization energy,\n5:34\nand that's the general trend across the periodic table.\n5:36\nAs you go from left to right,\n5:38\nyou go from low ionization energy to high ionization energy.\n5:43\nNow, what about trends up and down the periodic table?\n5:46\nWell, within any group, if we,\n5:48\neven if we look at the Alkali,\n5:49\nif we look at the Alkali Metals right over here,\n5:52\nif we're down at the bottom,\n5:54\nif we're looking at, if we're looking at,\n5:55\nsay, Cesium right over here,\n5:58\nthat electron in the, one, two, three, four, five, six,\n6:04\nin the sixth shell, that's going to be\n6:06\nfurther from that one electron\n6:08\nthat Lithium has and its second shell.\n6:10\nSo, it's going to be, it's going to be further away.\n6:12\nIt's not going to be as closely bound to the nucleus,\n6:17\nI guess you could say.\n6:18\nSo, this is going to be even,\n6:19\nthat one electron's gonna even easier to remove\n6:22\nthan the one electron in the outermost shell of Lithium.\n6:25\nSo, this one has even lower, even lower,\n6:29\neven lower...\n6:32\nAnd that's even going to be true of the Noble Gases out here\n6:35\nthat Xenon, that it's electrons in its outermost shell,\n6:38\neven though it has eight valence electrons,\n6:41\nthey're further away from the nucleus,\n6:43\nand so they're a little, the energy required\n6:45\nto remove them is still going to be high\n6:47\nbut it's going to be lower than the energy from,\n6:51\nfrom say Neon or Helium.\n6:53\nSo, this is low.\n6:55\nSo, once again, ionization energy low to high\n6:58\nas we go from left to right,\n6:59\nand low to high as we go from bottom to top.\n7:02\nOr we could say a general trend\n7:03\nthat if we go from the bottom left to the top right\n7:08\nwe go from low ionization energy,\n7:10\nvery easy to remove an electron\n7:12\nfrom these characters right over here\n7:14\nto high ionization energy,\n7:16\nvery hard to move, remove an electron\n7:19\nfrom these characters over here.\n7:20\nAnd you can see it if, you could see\n7:23\nin a trend of actual measured ionization energies\n7:26\nand I like to see charts like this because\n7:28\nit kind of show you where the periodic table came from\n7:32\nwhen people noticed these kind of periodic trends.\n7:34\nIt's like, hey, it looks like\n7:35\nthere's some common patterns here.\n7:37\nBut on this one in particular we see on this axis\n7:40\nwe have ionization energy and electron volts,\n7:43\nthat's actually, it's literally a,\n7:44\nthis is units of energy.\n7:46\nYou could convert it to Joules if you like.\n7:49\nThen over here, we're increasing the atomic numbers.\n7:51\nSo, we're (mumbling), we're starting with\n7:53\nHydrogen then we go to Helium,\n7:55\nand we keep, and then we go,\n7:58\ngo from Hydrogen to Helium to Lithium\n8:00\nand let me show you what's happening right over here.\n8:02\nSo, you go to Hydrogen to Helium.\n8:05\nSo, Helium here is very stable,\n8:07\nso it's very hard to remove an electron.\n8:10\nAnd then you go to Lithium.\n8:12\nLithium, as we said, this is an Alkali metal.\n8:14\nYou remove an electron, it gets to a stable state.\n8:17\nSo, it takes very low energy to remove that electron.\n8:20\nAnd then as we go from left to right on the periodic table,\n8:22\nas we go from Alkali Metal to Noble Gases\n8:26\nwe see that the ionization energy increases.\n8:29\nAnd there are these little dips here\n8:30\nwhich you could think about why these...\n8:32\n(mumbling) Or theorize why these dips are occurring,\n8:35\nwhat you see in this general trend\n8:36\nas we go from Alkali Metals to Noble Gases.\n8:40\nAlkali Metals to Noble Gases.\n8:43\nAlkali Metals to Noble Gases.\n8:45\nNow, one thing you might be saying is,\n8:47\n\"Hey, look, you had from here to here,\n8:50\n\"that's the same distance as here to here,\n8:52\n\"but now we have a larger distance here.\n8:53\n\"What's going on here?\"\n8:54\nWell, we have to remember now we\n8:55\nhave all of our D block elements.\n8:58\nSo, now, once we get, once we get to the,\n9:02\nonce we get over here we're now adding\n9:05\nall of the D block elements.\n9:08\n(mumbling) On the fourth period\n9:09\nand so we have those, we have those added here,\n9:13\nso you have D block elements, D block elements,\n9:15\nand then here you have you F and D block elements.\n9:18\nAnd so, you see the general trend\n9:20\nthat your Alkali, your Alkali Metals\n9:24\nare very low ionization energy.\n9:26\nYour Noble Gases, very high ionization energy.\n9:31\nBut as they get, as the atoms get larger and larger\n9:35\nthe ionization energy goes lower and lower,\n9:37\nand sends something like Radon,\n9:39\nwhich even though it's Noble Gas\n9:40\nit's ionization energy because those outermost electrons\n9:43\nare further away from the nucleus\n9:46\nor they're quite far away from the nucleus,\n9:48\nthat its ionization energy is actually,\n9:52\nits ionization energy is\n9:54\nactually less then that of Hydrogen.\n9:58\nAnyway, hope you found that interesting.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Voiceover] Alright, this problem is a classic,\n0:01\nyou're gonna see this in basically\n0:03\nevery single physics text book.\n0:05\nAnd the problem is this, if you've got two masses\n0:07\ntied together by a rope, and that rope passes over a pulley,\n0:10\nwhat's the acceleration of the masses?\n0:13\nIn other words, what's the acceleration of the 3 kg mass?\n0:18\nAnd then what's the acceleration of the 5 kg mass?\n0:21\nAnd if you're wondering what the heck is a pulley?\n0:26\nThe pulley is this part right here.\n0:28\nThis right here is the pulley.\n0:30\nSo what a pulley does, a pulley is a little piece of plastic\n0:33\nor metal that can rotate.\n0:35\nAnd it's usually got a groove in it so that a string\n0:38\nor a rope can pass over it.\n0:40\nWhat it does, is it rotates freely so that you can turn\n0:44\nwhat's a horizontal tension on one side,\n0:46\ninto a vertical tension on the other.\n0:48\nOr vice versa.\n0:49\nIt turns vertical forces into horizontal forces.\n0:52\nIt allows you to transfer a force from one direction\n0:55\nto another direction.\n0:56\nSo that's what these pulleys are useful for.\n0:58\nAnd if they can spin freely, and if this pulley\n1:01\nhas basically no mass, if there's no resistance\n1:03\nto motion at all, then this tension on this side\n1:07\nis gonna be equal to the tension on this side.\n1:10\nThis vertical tension gets transferred fully undiluted,\n1:14\ninto a horizontal tension and these tension values\n1:17\nwill just be the same if this pulley can spin freely.\n1:20\nAnd if its mass is really small so that\n1:22\nthere's no inertial reason why it doesn't wanna spin.\n1:26\nSo that's the problem.\n1:28\nLet's say you wanted to figure this out.\n1:30\nWhat is the acceleration of the 3 kg mass\n1:33\nwith the acceleration of the 5 kg mass?\n1:36\nNow, I've gotta warn you, there's an easy way to do this,\n1:38\nand a hard way to do this.\n1:40\nNow, I'm gonna show you the hard way first.\n1:43\nSorry, no one ever wants to hear that.\n1:46\nBut, the reason is that, the easy way won't make any sense\n1:50\nunless I show you the hard way first.\n1:51\nIt won't make any sense why the easy way works unless\n1:54\nI show you the hard way.\n1:56\nAnd for two, the hard way isn't really all that hard.\n1:59\nSo I'm calling it the hard way,\n2:00\nbut it's not really that bad.\n2:01\nAnd for three, sometimes teachers and professors just wanna\n2:04\nsee you do it the hard way, so you should know how\n2:05\nto do this.\n2:07\nSo what do we do?\n2:08\nWe wanna find acceleration, well you know how\n2:09\nto find acceleration.\n2:11\nWe're gonna use Newton's second law.\n2:13\nSo we'll say that the acceleration in a given direction\n2:15\nis gonna equal the net force in that direction,\n2:18\ndivided by the mass.\n2:19\nNow what do we do?\n2:20\nWhat mass are we gonna choose?\n2:21\nWe've got a couple masses here.\n2:23\nOne thing we could do, let's just pick the 5 kg mass.\n2:26\nJust pick one of them.\n2:27\nSo I'm gonna say that the acceleration of the 5 kg mass\n2:30\nis the net force on the 5 kg mass, divided by the mass\n2:34\nof the 5 kg mass.\n2:36\nAnd remember, we should always pick a direction as well.\n2:38\nSo do we wanna pick the vertical direction\n2:40\nor the horizontal direction?\n2:42\nWell, since this box is gonna be accelerating horizontally,\n2:44\nand that's what we're interested in, I'm gonna put one more\n2:47\nsub-script up here, X, to let us know we're picking\n2:49\nthe horizontal direction.\n2:52\nSo I can fill this out now, I can plug stuff in.\n2:54\nThe acceleration of the 5 kg mass in the X direction\n2:58\nis gonna be equal to.\n3:00\nAlright what forces do we have to figure out what goes\n3:02\nup here?\n3:03\nYou always draw a force diagram.\n3:06\nSo what forces do I have on the 5 kg mass?\n3:08\nI'm gonna have a force of gravity, I'll draw\n3:10\nthat straight down.\n3:11\nFG, and there's gonna be an equal force,\n3:14\nnormal force upward.\n3:16\nSo this normal force up should be equal to the force\n3:19\nof gravity and magnitude because this box is probably not\n3:23\ngonna be accelerating vertically.\n3:24\nThere's no real reason why it should be\n3:26\nif this table is rigid.\n3:28\nAnd there's one more force on this box.\n3:30\nThere's a force to the right.\n3:31\nThat's gonna be the force of tension.\n3:34\nAnd if there's no friction on this table,\n3:36\nthen I have no leftward forces here.\n3:38\nI'm ignoring air resistance since\n3:39\nwe usually ignore air resistance.\n3:42\nSo that's is, the only horizontal force\n3:43\nI've got is T, tension.\n3:45\nAnd I divide by the mass of the 5 kg box, which is 5 kg.\n3:50\nBut we got a problem.\n3:51\nLook it, we don't know the acceleration of the 5 kg mass,\n3:54\nand we don't know the tension.\n3:56\nI can't solve this.\n3:58\nNormally what you do in this case, is you go to\n3:59\nthe vertical direction, the other direction in other words.\n4:02\nBut that's not gonna help me either.\n4:04\nThat's just gonna tell me that the normal force is gonna\n4:06\nbe equal to the force of gravity.\n4:08\nAnd we kind of already knew that.\n4:09\nSo that doesn't help.\n4:10\nSo what do we do?\n4:12\nWell, you might note, this is only the equation for\n4:14\nthe 5 kg mass.\n4:16\nAnd so now I have to do this for the 3 kg mass.\n4:18\nSo let's come over here, let's say that the acceleration\n4:21\nof the 3 kg mass is gonna be equal to the net force\n4:25\non the 3 kg mass, divided by the mass of the 3 kg mass.\n4:30\nAnd again, which direction should we pick?\n4:33\nWell this acceleration over here is gonna be vertical.\n4:35\nSo let's solve this for the vertical direction.\n4:37\nI'm gonna add one more sub-script, Y, to remind myself.\n4:40\nAnd you should do this too so you remember which direction\n4:43\nyou're picking.\n4:44\nSo what forces do I plug in here?\n4:46\nYou figure that out with a force diagram.\n4:48\nI'm gonna have a force of gravity on this 3 kg mass,\n4:52\nand then I'm gonna have the same size of friction,\n4:55\nor sorry, the same as tension, that I had over here.\n4:57\nSo the tension on this side of the rope, it's gonna\n4:59\nbe the same as the tension on this side.\n5:01\nAssuming this pulley offers no resistance either by its mass\n5:05\nor friction.\n5:06\nSo assuming that its mass is negligible, there's basically\n5:09\nno friction, then I'm gonna have a tension.\n5:11\nThat tension is gonna be the same size.\n5:14\nSo I'll draw that coming upward.\n5:16\nBut it's not gonna be as big as the force of gravity is\n5:19\non this 3 kg mass.\n5:21\nI've got the force of gravity here.\n5:23\nThis tension is gonna be smaller, and the reason is,\n5:26\nthis 3 kg mass is accelerating downwards.\n5:28\nSo these forces can't be balanced.\n5:30\nThe upward force of tension has gotta be smaller\n5:33\nthan the force of gravity on this 3 kg mass.\n5:36\nBut this tension here should be the same\n5:37\nas this tension here.\n5:39\nSo I'll plug those in.\n5:40\nSo let's plug this in.\n5:41\nA of the 3 kg mass, in the Y direction is gonna be equal to,\n5:46\nI've got two vertical forces.\n5:48\nI've got tension up, so I'll make that positive,\n5:50\n'cause we usually treat up as positive.\n5:52\nI've got gravity down, and so I'm gonna have negative,\n5:55\n'cause it's downward force of 3 kg times the acceleration\n6:01\non Earth, is 9.8 meters per second squared.\n6:07\nNow what do we do?\n6:07\nWe divide by 3 kg, 'cause that's the mass.\n6:10\nBut I've still got a problem.\n6:11\nI don't know this acceleration or this tension.\n6:14\nSo what do I do?\n6:16\nYou might notice, if you're clever you'll say wait,\n6:18\nI've got my unknown on this side is acceleration\n6:21\nand tension.\n6:22\nMy unknown on this side is acceleration and tension.\n6:24\nIt seems like I've got two equations, two unknowns,\n6:27\nmaybe we should combine them.\n6:28\nAnd that's exactly how you do these.\n6:30\nSo I've got tension in both of these equations.\n6:34\nLet me solve for tension over here,\n6:35\nwhere it's kind of simple.\n6:37\nAnd I'll just get the tension equals 5 kg,\n6:41\ntimes the acceleration of the 5 kg mass in the X direction.\n6:47\nSo now I know what tension is.\n6:48\nTension is equal to this.\n6:49\nAnd that tension over on this side is the same as\n6:51\nthe tension on this side.\n6:53\nSo I can take this and I can plug it in for\n6:56\nthis tension right here.\n6:57\nAnd let's see what we get.\n6:59\nWe get that the acceleration of the 3 kg mass vertically,\n7:02\nis gonna equal, alright, I'm gonna have a big mess on top,\n7:06\nwhat am I gonna get?\n7:07\nI'm gonna get, so T is the same as 5AX.\n7:11\nSo I'll plug in 5 kg times the acceleration\n7:16\nof the 5 kg mass in the X direction.\n7:19\nAnd then I get all of this stuff over here.\n7:21\nSo I'll get the rest of this right here.\n7:27\nI'll just bring that down right there.\n7:29\nAlright, now what do I have?\n7:31\nI've got 3 kg on the bottom still, so I have to put\n7:33\nthat here.\n7:35\nAre we any better off?\n7:36\nYeah, we're better, because now my only unknowns\n7:38\nare acceleration.\n7:39\nBut these are not the same acceleration.\n7:41\nLook, this acceleration here is the acceleration of\n7:43\nthe 3 kg mass, vertically.\n7:46\nThis acceleration here is the acceleration\n7:48\nof the 5kg mass horizontally.\n7:51\nNow here's where I'm gonna have to make an argument,\n7:53\nand some people don't like this.\n7:55\nBut, it's crucial to figuring out this problem.\n7:58\nAnd the key idea is this, if this 3 kg mass moves down,\n8:03\nlet's say one meter, let's say it moves downward one meter.\n8:06\nWell then this 5 kg mass had better move forward one meter.\n8:10\nBecause if it doesn't, then it didn't provide the one meter\n8:14\nof rope that this 3 kg mass needed to go downward.\n8:17\nWhich means either the rope broke, or the rope stretched.\n8:21\nAnd we're gonna assume that our rope does not break\n8:23\nor stretch.\n8:25\nThat's kind of a lie.\n8:25\nAll ropes are gonna stretch a little bit under tension.\n8:29\nWe're gonna assume that stretch is negligible.\n8:31\nSo the argument is that if this 3 kg mass moves downward\n8:35\na certain amount, this 5 kg mass has to move forward\n8:38\nby that same amount in order to feed that amount of rope\n8:41\nfor this 3 kg mass to go downward by that amount.\n8:44\nOtherwise, think about it.\n8:45\nIf this 5 kg mass just sat here and the 3 kg moved,\n8:49\nor the 3 kg moved farther than the 5 kg mass,\n8:53\nthen this rope is stretching or breaking.\n8:54\nSo if you believe that, if you don't believe it,\n8:56\npause it and think about it.\n8:57\n'Cause you've gotta convince yourself of that.\n8:59\nIf you believe that then you can also convince yourself\n9:01\nthat, well if the 3 kg mass was moving downward\n9:04\nat a certain speed, let's say two meters per second.\n9:07\nThen the 5 kg mass had better also be moving forward\n9:10\ntwo meters per second because otherwise it wouldn't\n9:13\nbe feeding rope at a rate that this 3 kg needs\n9:16\nto move downward at that rate.\n9:18\nAnd finally, if you believe all that,\n9:20\nit's not too much harder to convince yourself that\n9:22\nthis 3 kg mass, no matter what\n9:25\nits acceleration downward must be,\n9:27\nthis 5 kg mass had better have the same magnitude\n9:30\nof acceleration forward so that it's again,\n9:34\nfeeding the rope so this rope doesn't break,\n9:36\nor snap, or stretch.\n9:38\n'Cause we're gonna assume the rope doesn't do that.\n9:40\nSo what I'm saying is that the acceleration of the 3 kg mass\n9:44\nin the Y direction had better equal the magnitude.\n9:48\nSo these magnitudes have to be the same.\n9:50\nThe sign doesn't have to be the same.\n9:53\nSo this 3 kg mass has a negative acceleration\n9:56\njust 'cause it points down, and we're assuming up\n9:58\nis positive, down is negative.\n10:00\nThis 5 kg mass has a positive acceleration 'cause\n10:03\nit's pointing to the right, and we're assuming rightward\n10:05\nis the positive horizontal direction.\n10:08\nSo, they can have different signs, but the magnitudes\n10:11\nhad better be the same so that your feeding this rope at\n10:13\na rate that the other one needs in order to move.\n10:16\nAnd so we can say that the magnitudes are the same.\n10:18\nIn this case, since one is negative of the other,\n10:21\nI can say that the acceleration of the 3 kg mass\n10:23\nvertically downward is gonna be equal to, let's say negative\n10:28\nof the acceleration of the 5 kg mass in the X direction.\n10:33\nI could have written it the other way.\n10:34\nI could have wrote that A of the 5 kg mass\n10:37\nin the X direction is a negative A of the 3 kg mass\n10:40\nin the Y direction.\n10:41\nThey're just different by a negative sign is all\n10:43\nthat's important here.\n10:44\nOkay, so this is the link we need.\n10:46\nThis is it.\n10:47\nSo this allows us to put this final equation here\n10:49\nin terms of only one variable.\n10:51\n'Cause I know I've got A3Y on this left hand side.\n10:54\nI know A3Y should always be -A5X.\n10:57\nIf I take this and just plug it in for A3Y right here,\n11:02\nI'm gonna get -A5X =, well all of this stuff, so I'll\n11:10\njust copy this.\n11:11\nSave some time.\n11:12\nCopy, paste.\n11:14\nJust equals all of that.\n11:15\nAll I did was plug in what I know A3Y has to be equal to.\n11:19\n'Cause now look, I've got one equation with one unknown.\n11:22\nI just need to solve for what A5X is.\n11:24\nIt's on both sides.\n11:25\nSo I'll need to combine these and then isolate\n11:28\nit on one side.\n11:29\nSo there's gonna be a little bit of algebra here.\n11:31\nLet's just take this, let's give ourselves some room.\n11:35\nMove this up just a little bit.\n11:36\nOkay, so what do we do?\n11:38\nWe're gonna solve for A5X.\n11:39\nLet me just get rid of this denominator.\n11:41\nLet me multiply both sides by 3 kg.\n11:45\nSo I'm gonna get -3kg x A5 in the X direction,\n11:52\nif I multiply both sides by 3 kg,\n11:55\nand then I get 5 kg x A5 in the X direction.\n12:01\nAnd I've still got minus, alright 3 x 9.8 is 29.4 Newtons.\n12:08\nSo we'll just turn this into what it's supposed to be.\n12:10\n29.4 Newtons.\n12:12\nSo let's combine our A terms now.\n12:14\nLet's move this negative 3A to the right hand side\n12:17\nby adding it to both sides.\n12:19\nAnd let's add this 29.4 to both sides.\n12:22\nSo I'll get the 29.4 Newtons over here with a positive,\n12:26\nif I add it to both sides.\n12:27\nAnd it'll disappear on the right hand side.\n12:29\nAnd then I'll add this term to both sides.\n12:31\nAdd a positive 3 kg x A to both sides.\n12:36\nIt'll disappear on the left, and I'll get 5 kg x A5\n12:41\nin the X direction + 3 kg x A5 in the X direction.\n12:47\nNow we're close, look on the right hand side I can combine\n12:50\nthese terms because 5A plus 3A is the same thing as 8A.\n12:55\nSo 29.4 Newtons, .4 = 8 kg x, I'll put the parenthesis here,\n13:05\ntimes five.\n13:06\n85 in the X direction.\n13:08\nNow I can divide both sides by eight and usually we put\n13:12\nthe thing we're solving for on the left, so I'm just gonna\n13:14\nput that over here.\n13:15\nI'll get 29.4 Newtons over 8 kg is equal to\n13:22\nthe acceleration of mass five.\n13:24\nThe 5 kg mass in the X direction.\n13:27\nAnd if we calculate that,\n13:29\nI'll just put that into my calculator.\n13:30\n29.4 divided by eight.\n13:34\nI get 3.675.\n13:36\nSo we'll just round.\n13:37\nWe'll just say that's 3.68.\n13:40\n3.6 whoops, 3.68 and it's positive, that's good.\n13:45\nWe should get a positive because the 5 kg mass has\n13:49\na positive acceleration.\n13:50\nSo we get positive 3.68 meters per second squared.\n13:55\nBut that's just of the 5 kg mass.\n13:57\nHow do we get the acceleration of the 3 kg mass?\n14:00\nWell that's easy.\n14:00\nIt's gotta have the same magnitude of the 5 kg mass.\n14:04\nAll I have to do is take this number now.\n14:06\nI know what A5X is.\n14:08\nSo if I just plug that in right here,\n14:10\nwell then I know that A3Y is just gonna be equal\n14:15\nto -3.68 meters per second squared.\n14:22\nAnd I'm done, I did it.\n14:23\nWe figured out the acceleration of the 3 kg mass,\n14:27\nit's negative.\n14:28\nNo surprise, 'cause it's accelerating downward.\n14:30\nWe figured out the acceleration of the 5 kg mass,\n14:33\nit's positive, not a surprise.\n14:34\nIt was accelerating to the right.\n14:36\nThe way we did it, recapping really quick,\n14:38\nwe did Newton's second law for the 5 kg mass.\n14:41\nThat didn't let us solve.\n14:43\nWe did Newton's second law for the 3 kg mass,\n14:46\nthat didn't let us solve.\n14:47\nIn fact it got really bleak, because it seemed like we\n14:49\nhad three unknowns and only two equations,\n14:53\nbut the link that allowed us to make it so that we only\n14:56\nhad one equation with one unknown, is that we plugged\n14:59\none equation to the other first.\n15:01\nWe had to then write the accelerations in terms\n15:03\nof each other, that's because these accelerations\n15:07\nare not independent.\n15:08\nThe accelerations have to have the same magnitude.\n15:10\nAnd in this case one had the opposite sign.\n15:13\nSo when we plugged that in, we have one equation\n15:15\nwith one unknown, we solve, we get the amount\n15:18\nof acceleration.\n15:19\nSo that's the hard way to do these problems.\n15:21\nSo in the next video I'll show you the easy way\n15:24\nto do these problems.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn the last video, we talk about how seasons on Earth\n0:03\nare not caused by how close Earth\n0:06\nis to the sun in its orbit.\n0:08\nAnd we also hint at the fact that it's actually\n0:10\ncaused by the tilt of the earth.\n0:12\nAnd so in this video, I want to show you\n0:14\nhow the tilt of the earth causes the seasons to happen.\n0:19\nSo let's draw-- so I'm going to try\n0:21\nto draw as many diagrams as possible here.\n0:23\nBecause at least for my brain they\n0:25\nhelp me visualize what's actually going on.\n0:27\nSo we could imagine a top view first.\n0:30\nSo let's have a top view.\n0:32\nThat is the sun right over there.\n0:35\nAnd let me draw the earth's orbit.\n0:37\nSo Earth's orbit maybe looks something like that.\n0:41\nLet me draw it almost, it is almost circular.\n0:43\nSo I'll draw it as something that's\n0:45\npretty close to a circle right over here.\n0:47\nAnd I'm going to draw Earth at different points in its orbit.\n0:50\nAnd I'm going to try to depict the tilt\n0:53\nof its rotational axis.\n0:55\nAnd obviously, this is not drawn anywhere near close to scale.\n0:58\nEarth is much further away from the sun,\n1:00\nand much, much smaller than the sun as well.\n1:04\nSo I'll draw the earth at that point.\n1:05\nAnd at this point, the earth will\n1:07\nbe tilted away from the sun.\n1:09\nSo Earth's tilt does not change if you\n1:12\nthink about the direction, or at least\n1:13\nover the course of a year, if we think\n1:15\nabout relatively small periods of time.\n1:17\nIt does not change relative to the direction\n1:19\nthat it's pointing at in the universe.\n1:22\nAnd we'll talk about that in a second.\n1:24\nSo let's say right over here we are pointed away from the sun.\n1:28\nSo we're up and out of this page.\n1:32\nSo if I wanted to put some perspective on an arrow\n1:35\nit would be up and-- actually it would be more like\n1:39\nup and out of this page.\n1:42\nSo that's the direction.\n1:43\nIf you were to come straight out of the North Pole.\n1:44\nAnd if you were to go straight out of the South Pole\n1:46\nyou'd go below that circle right over there.\n1:49\nAnd if I wanted to draw the same position,\n1:50\nbut if we're looking sideways along the plane,\n1:53\nthe orbital plane, or the plane of Earth's orbit.\n1:58\nSo if we're looking at it from that direction.\n2:00\nSo let me do it this way.\n2:02\nIf we're looking at directly sideways,\n2:06\nthis is the sun right over here, and this\n2:12\nis Earth at that position.\n2:18\nThis is Earth right over there.\n2:20\nIf I were to draw an arrow pointing straight out\n2:24\nof the North Pole it would look something like this.\n2:31\nSo this arrow and this arrow they\n2:32\nare both popping straight out of the North Pole.\n2:35\nAnd so when we talk about the tilt of the earth,\n2:37\nwe're talking about the tilt of its orbital axis,\n2:40\nkind of this pole that could go straight between the South\n2:43\nPole and the North Pole.\n2:44\nThe angle between that and a pole that would actually\n2:46\nbe at a 90-degree angle, or perpendicular,\n2:49\nto the plane of its orbit.\n2:51\nAnd so compared to if it was just straight up and down,\n2:55\nrelative to the plane of the orbit.\n2:57\nSo this right here is the angle of Earth's tilt.\n3:00\nLet me draw that a little bit bigger\n3:02\njust so it becomes a little bit clearer.\n3:04\nSo if this is the plane of the orbit,\n3:07\nwe're looking sideways along the plane of the orbit.\n3:10\nAnd this is Earth right over here.\n3:15\nMy best attempt to draw a circle.\n3:17\nThat is Earth.\n3:19\nEarth does not rotate.\n3:20\nIts axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the plane\n3:24\nof the orbit.\n3:25\nSo this is how Earth would orbit.\n3:27\nThis is how Earth would rotate if it was.\n3:30\nEarth rotates, Earth's rotational axis\n3:33\nis at an angle to that vertical relative\n3:36\nto the plane of its orbit, I guess you could say it.\n3:39\nIt rotates at an angle like this.\n3:42\nSo this would be the North Pole.\n3:43\nThat is the South Pole.\n3:47\nAnd so it rotates like this.\n3:52\nAnd that angle relative to being vertical with respect\n3:58\nto the orbital plane, this angle right here for Earth\n4:02\nright now is 23.4 degrees.\n4:14\nAnd if we're talking about relatively short periods\n4:17\nof time, like our lifespans, that is constant.\n4:20\nBut it is actually changing over long periods of time.\n4:24\nThat is changing between-- and these are rough numbers--\n4:27\nit is changing between 22.1 degrees and 24.5 degrees,\n4:36\nif my sources are correct.\n4:38\nBut that gives a rough estimate of what it's changing between.\n4:41\nBut I want to make it clear, this\n4:42\nis not happening overnight.\n4:44\nThe period to go from roughly a 22-degree angle to a 24\n4:47\nand 1/2-degree angle and back to a 22-degree angle is 41,000\n4:52\nyears.\n4:58\nAnd this long-term change in the tilt, this\n5:01\nmight play into some of the long-term climactic change.\n5:04\nMaybe it might contribute, on some level,\n5:07\nto some of the ice ages that have formed over Earth's past.\n5:11\nBut for the sake of thinking about our annual seasons\n5:13\nyou don't have to worry too much,\n5:14\nor you don't have to worry at all really\n5:16\nabout this variation.\n5:17\nYou really just have to know that it is tilted.\n5:19\nAnd right now it is tilted at an angle of 23.4 degrees.\n5:24\nNow you might say OK, I understand what the tilt is.\n5:27\nBut how does that change the seasons\n5:29\nin either the Northern or that Southern Hemisphere?\n5:33\nAnd to do that, I'm going to imagine the earth when\n5:36\nthe Northern Hemisphere is most tilted away from the sun,\n5:40\nand when it is most tilted towards the sun.\n5:42\nSo remember this tilt, the direction this arrow points\n5:45\ninto relative to the rest of the universe,\n5:47\nif we assume that this tilt is at 23.4%,\n5:50\nit's not changing throughout the year.\n5:52\nBut depending on where it is in the orbit\n5:54\nit's either going to be tilting away from the sun,\n5:56\nas it is in this example right over here.\n5:58\nOr it will be tilting towards the sun.\n6:03\nI'll do the towards the sun in this magenta color,\n6:06\nor it would be tilting towards the sun.\n6:08\nSo six months later when the earth is over here,\n6:10\nit's going to, relative to the rest of the universe,\n6:14\nit will be tilted in that same direction, up out of this page\n6:21\nand to the right.\n6:26\nJust like it was over here.\n6:27\nBut now that it's on the other side of the sun that\n6:30\nmakes it tilt a little bit more towards the sun.\n6:32\nIf I were to draw it right over here,\n6:36\nit is now tilted towards the sun.\n6:42\nAnd what I want to think about is how much sunlight\n6:47\nwill different parts of the planet receive.\n6:49\nAnd I'll focus on the Northern Hemisphere.\n6:51\nBut you can make a similar argument\n6:53\nfor the Southern Hemisphere.\n6:54\nI want to think about how much sunlight they receive when it's\n6:57\ntilted away or tilted towards the sun.\n7:00\nAnd so let's think about those two situations.\n7:03\nSo first of all, let's think about this situation\n7:05\nhere where we are tilted away from the sun.\n7:07\nSo let me zoom in a little bit.\n7:10\nSo this is the situation, where we're tilted away from the sun.\n7:15\nSo if this is the vertical, so let me draw it.\n7:18\nI could actually just use this diagram.\n7:20\nBut let me make it.\n7:21\nSo we're tilted away from the sun like this.\n7:24\nI'm going to do this in a different color.\n7:26\nSo if we have an arrow coming straight out of the North Pole\n7:29\nit would look like this.\n7:33\nAnd we are rotating around like that.\n7:37\nSo we're out of the page on the left-hand side,\n7:40\nand then into the page on the right-hand side.\n7:42\nAnd so we're rotating towards the east, constantly.\n7:45\nSo this arrow is in the direction of the east.\n7:50\nSo when we're at this point in Earth's orbit, and actually\n7:52\nlet me copy and paste this.\n7:54\nAnd I'm going to use the same exact diagram\n7:56\nfor the different seasons.\n7:58\nSo let me copy.\n8:01\nAnd then let me paste this exact diagram.\n8:03\nI'll do it over here for two different points.\n8:09\nSo when we are here in Earth's orbit\n8:13\nwhere is the sunlight coming from?\n8:14\nWell, it's going to be coming from the left, at least the way\n8:17\nI've drawn the diagram right over here.\n8:19\nSo the sunlight is coming from the left in this situation.\n8:29\nAnd so if you think about it, what part of the earth\n8:33\nis being lit by sunlight?\n8:34\nOr what part of the earth is in daylight,\n8:36\nthe way I've drawn it right over here?\n8:38\nWell, the part that is facing the sun.\n8:41\nSo all of this right over here is going to be in daylight.\n8:46\nAs we rotate whatever part of the surface of the earth\n8:49\nenters into this yellow part right over here\n8:51\nwill be in daylight.\n8:53\nBut let's think about what's happening\n8:55\nat different parts of the earth.\n8:55\nSo let me draw the equator, which separates our Northern\n8:58\nand Southern Hemispheres.\n8:59\nSo this is the equator.\n9:05\nAnd then let me go into the Northern Hemisphere.\n9:07\nAnd I want to show you why when the North Pole is pointed away\n9:10\nfrom the sun why this is our winter.\n9:13\nSo when we're pointed away from the sun--\n9:15\nWell, if we go to the Arctic Circle-- so let\n9:17\nme go right over here.\n9:20\nLet me go to some point in the Arctic Circle.\n9:23\nAs it goes, as the earth rotates every 24 hours,\n9:27\nthis point on the globe will just rotate around just\n9:31\nlike that.\n9:32\nIt will just keep rotating around just like that.\n9:34\nAnd so my question is, that point in the Arctic\n9:36\nCircle, as it rotates will it ever see sunlight?\n9:39\nWell, no, it will never see sunlight.\n9:41\nBecause the North Pole is tilted away from the sun.\n9:45\nSo what I'm drawing, what I'm shading here in purple,\n9:49\nthat part of the earth, when it's completely tilted away,\n9:52\nwill never see sunlight.\n9:54\nOr at least it won't see sunlight\n9:55\nwhile it's tilted away, while it's in this position,\n9:58\nor in this position in the orbit.\n10:01\nI won't say never, because once it becomes summer\n10:03\nthey will be able to see it.\n10:04\nSo no sunlight, no day, I guess you could say, no daylight.\n10:10\nIf you go to slightly more southern latitudes,\n10:14\nso let's say you go over here.\n10:15\nSo maybe that's the latitude of something like, I don't know,\n10:18\nNew York or San Francisco or something like that.\n10:21\nLet's think about what it would see as the earth rotates\n10:23\nevery 24 hours.\n10:25\nSo this would be daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight,\n10:28\nthen nighttime, nighttime, nighttime, nighttime,\n10:30\nnighttime.\n10:31\nThis is now going behind the globe nighttime, nighttime,\n10:33\nnighttime, nighttime, nighttime, daylight, daylight, daylight,\n10:36\ndaylight.\n10:37\nSo if you just compare this.\n10:38\nSo let me do the daylight in orange.\n10:43\nAnd then nighttime I will do in this bluish purplish color.\n10:48\nSo night time over here.\n10:50\nSo if you go to really northern latitudes,\n10:52\nlike the Arctic Circle, they don't get any daylight\n10:55\nwhen we are tilted away from the earth.\n10:57\nAnd if we go to slightly still northern latitudes,\n11:01\nbut not as north as the Arctic Circle, it does get daylight.\n11:04\nBut it gets a lot less daylight.\n11:05\nIt spends a lot less time in the daylight\n11:08\nthan in the night time.\n11:09\nSo notice if you say that this circumference represents\n11:14\nthe positions over 24 hours, it spends much less time\n11:17\nin the daylight than it does in the nighttime.\n11:24\nSo because, while the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away\n11:28\nfrom the earth, the latitudes in the northern hemisphere\n11:32\nare getting less daylight.\n11:37\nThey are also getting less energy from the sun.\n11:40\nAnd so that's what leads to winter,\n11:42\nor just being generally colder.\n11:45\nAnd to see what happens in the summer\n11:46\nlet's just go the other side.\n11:48\nSo now we're going to the other side of our orbit\n11:51\naround the sun.\n11:51\nThis is going to be six months later.\n11:53\nAnd notice the actual direction, relative to the rest\n11:55\nof the universe, has not changed.\n11:57\nWe're still pointed in that same direction.\n11:59\nWe still have a 23.4 degree tilt relative to, I guess,\n12:04\nbeing straight up and down.\n12:06\nBut now once we're over here the light from the sun\n12:08\nis going to be coming from the right.\n12:15\nJust like that.\n12:16\nAnd now, if on this diagram at least,\n12:18\nthis is the side of the earth that\n12:21\nis going to be getting the sunlight.\n12:24\nAnd let me draw the equator again,\n12:27\nor my best attempt to draw the equator.\n12:29\nI'll draw the equator in that same color\n12:31\nactually, in that green color.\n12:34\nSo this separates the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere.\n12:38\nAnd now let's think about the Arctic Circle.\n12:41\nSo let's say I'm sitting here in the Arctic Circle.\n12:43\nAs the day goes on, as 24 hours go around,\n12:46\nI'll keep rotating around here.\n12:47\nBut notice the whole time I am inside of the sun.\n12:51\nI'm getting no nighttime.\n12:55\nThere is no night in the Arctic Circle\n12:58\nwhile we are tilted towards the sun.\n13:00\nAnd if we still do that fairly northern latitude,\n13:03\nbut not as far as the Arctic Circle,\n13:05\nmaybe in San Francisco or New York, or something like that .\n13:09\nIf we go to that latitude, notice how much time\n13:12\nwe spend in the sun.\n13:13\nSo maybe we just enter.\n13:15\nSo this is right at sunrise.\n13:18\nAnd then as the day goes on we're\n13:21\nin sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight,\n13:23\nsunlight, sunlight.\n13:25\nThen we hit sunset.\n13:27\nThen we hit nighttime, nighttime,\n13:29\nthen we hit nighttime, and then we get sunrise again.\n13:32\nAnd so when you look at the amount of time\n13:34\nthat something in the Northern Hemisphere\n13:36\nspends in the daylight versus sunlight,\n13:38\nyou'll see it spends a lot more time in the daylight when\n13:41\nthe Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun.\n13:45\nSo this is more day, less night.\n13:53\nSo it is getting more energy from the sun.\n13:56\nSo when it is tilted towards the sun\n13:57\nit is getting more energy from the sun.\n14:00\nSo things will generally be warmer.\n14:02\nAnd so you are now talking about summer\n14:08\nin the Northern Hemisphere.\n14:09\nAnd the arguments for the Southern Hemisphere\n14:11\nare identical.\n14:12\nYou could even play it right over here.\n14:14\nWhen the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun,\n14:16\nthen the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun.\n14:19\nAnd so for example, the South Pole\n14:21\nwill have all daylight and no nighttime.\n14:23\nAnd southern latitudes will have more daylight than nighttime.\n14:26\nAnd so the south will have summer.\n14:28\nSo this is summer in the south, in the Southern Hemisphere.\n14:31\nAnd it's winter in the north.\n14:32\nAnd then down here the Southern Hemisphere\n14:34\nis pointed away from the sun.\n14:36\nSo this is winter in the Southern Hemisphere.\n14:40\nAnd you might be saying, hey Sal, what about you haven't\n14:43\ntalked a lot about spring and fall.\n14:45\nWell let's think about it.\n14:46\nWell, if we're talking about the Northern Hemisphere,\n14:48\nthis over here, we decided, was winter\n14:51\nin the Northern Hemisphere.\n14:52\nAnd we're going to rotate around the sun.\n14:55\nAnd at some point, we're going to get over here.\n14:58\nAnd then because of this tilt we aren't\n15:02\npointed away or towards the sun.\n15:04\nWe're kind of pointed I guess sideways\n15:07\nrelative to the direction of the sun.\n15:09\nBut this doesn't favor one hemisphere over the other.\n15:13\nSo when we're over here in-- and this will actually\n15:16\nbe the spring now- when we're in the spring,\n15:21\nboth hemispheres are getting the equal amount of daylight\n15:24\nand sunlight, or for a given latitude\n15:26\nabove or below the equator, they're\n15:28\ngetting the same amount.\n15:29\nAnd the same thing is true over here\n15:31\nwhen we get to-- so this is spring.\n15:33\nThis is the summer in the Northern Hemisphere.\n15:35\nNow this will be the fall in the Northern Hemisphere.\n15:39\nAnd once again, we're tilted in this direction.\n15:42\nAnd so the Northern Hemisphere isn't\n15:44\ntilted away or towards the sun.\n15:48\nAnd so both hemispheres are going\n15:50\nto get the same amount of radiation from the sun.\n15:53\nSo you really see the extremes in the winters and the summers.\n15:56\nNow one thing I do want to make clear,\n15:58\nand I started off with just the length of day and nighttime.\n16:01\nBecause frankly, that's maybe a little bit, or at least\n16:03\nin my brain, a little bit easier to visualize.\n16:05\nBut that by itself does not account\n16:07\nfor all of the difference between summer and winter.\n16:10\nAnother cause, and actually this is probably the biggest cause,\n16:14\nis if you think about the total amount of sun.\n16:16\nSo let's talk about the Northern Hemisphere winter.\n16:19\nAnd let's say there's a certain amount of sunlight\n16:21\nthat is reaching the earth.\n16:26\nSo this is the total amount of sunlight\n16:28\nthat's reaching the earth at any point in time.\n16:32\nYou see that much more of that is hitting the Southern\n16:35\nHemisphere than the Northern Hemisphere here.\n16:37\nAll of these, if you imagine it, all\n16:40\nof these rays right over here are\n16:42\nhitting the Southern Hemisphere.\n16:45\nSo a majority of the rays are hitting the Southern\n16:47\nHemisphere.\n16:48\nAnd much fewer are hitting the Northern Hemisphere.\n16:50\nSo actually a smaller amount of the radiation period,\n16:53\nat even a given period in time, not even talking\n16:55\nabout the amount of time you are facing the sun.\n16:58\nBut at any given moment in time more energy\n17:01\nis hitting the Southern Hemisphere than the Northern.\n17:04\nAnd the opposite is true when the tilt is then\n17:08\ntowards the sun.\n17:09\nAnd now a disproportionate amount of the sun's energy\n17:16\nis hitting the Northern Hemisphere.\n17:19\nSo if you draw a bunch of, if you just\n17:21\nthink that this is all of the energy from the sun, most\n17:24\nof it, all of these rays up here,\n17:25\nare hitting the Northern Hemisphere.\n17:27\nAnd only these down here are hitting the Southern\n17:31\nHemisphere.\n17:31\nAnd on top of that, what makes it even more extreme\n17:34\nis that the actual angle, and of course, this is to some degree\n17:37\nis due to the fact that where the angle of the sun\n17:40\nrelative to the horizon, or where you are on Earth.\n17:44\nBut even more than that if you are on,\n17:46\nlet's say that this is the land, and we're\n17:50\ntalking about the winter in the Northern Hemisphere.\n17:53\nSo let's say you're talking about,\n17:55\nlet's say we're up over here at this northern latitude.\n18:00\nAnd we're just looking at the sun here.\n18:04\nAnd over here, you could see even\n18:06\nwhen we are closest to the sun the sun is not directly\n18:09\noverhead.\n18:10\nWhen we're closest to the sun the sun\n18:12\nstill is pretty low on the horizon.\n18:14\nSo it may be right over here when\n18:16\nwe're closest to the sun in the winter the sun might\n18:19\nbe right over here.\n18:21\nBut if you look at that same latitude in the summer\n18:26\nwhen it is closest to the sun, the sun\n18:30\nis more close to being directly overhead.\n18:33\nIt still won't be directly overhead.\n18:35\nBecause we are still at a relatively northern latitude.\n18:39\nBut the sun is going to be much higher in the sky.\n18:45\nAnd these are all related to each other.\n18:46\nIt's kind of connected with this idea\n18:48\nthat more energy is hitting one hemisphere or the other.\n18:52\nBut also, when you have a, I guess\n18:55\nyou could say, a steeper angle from the rays\n18:58\nof the sun with the earth, it's actually\n19:00\ngoing to be dissipated less by the atmosphere.\n19:02\nAnd let me just make it clear how this is.\n19:05\nSo in the summer-- so let's say that that's the land.\n19:10\nAnd let's say that-- let me draw the atmosphere in white--\n19:16\nso all of this area right over here, this is the atmosphere.\n19:18\nAnd obviously there's not a hard boundary for the atmosphere.\n19:21\nBut let's just say this is the densest part of the atmosphere.\n19:24\nIn the summer, when the sun is higher in the sky,\n19:32\nthe rays from the sun are dissipated by less atmosphere.\n19:35\nSo they have to get through this much atmosphere.\n19:38\nAnd they're bounced off.\n19:39\nAnd they heat some of that atmosphere.\n19:41\nAnd they're absorbed before they get to the ground.\n19:44\nIn the winter when the sun is lower in the sky,\n19:49\nso maybe the sun is out here.\n19:51\nLet me draw it a little bit.\n19:53\nSo when the sun is lower in the sky relative to this point,\n19:57\nyou see that the rays of sunlight\n19:59\nhave to travel through a lot more atmosphere.\n20:04\nSo they get dissipated much more before they\n20:07\nget to this point on the planet.\n20:09\nSo all in all it is the tilt that\n20:11\nis causing the changes in the season.\n20:13\nBut it's causing it for multiple reasons.\n20:16\nOne is when you're tilted, we'll say\n20:18\nwhen you're tilted towards the sun,\n20:20\nyou're getting more absolute hours of daylight.\n20:23\nNot only are you getting more absolute hours of daylight,\n20:26\nbut at any given moment, most or more of the sun's total rays\n20:30\nthat are hitting the earth are hitting the Northern\n20:32\nHemisphere as opposed to the Southern Hemisphere.\n20:35\nAnd the stuff that's hitting the places that have summer,\n20:40\nit has to go through less atmosphere.\n20:42\nSo it gets dissipated less.",

This was really the height\n2:22\nof the violence of the war.\n2:23\nNobody knew which way the war was going to turn at this point.\n2:26\nBeth: These are subjects that preoccupied Hopper\n2:28\nfor his entire career, images of lonliness and isolation\n2:33\nin the new urban spaces.\n2:36\nSteven: This is also a rendering\n2:37\nthat is particularly American.\n2:39\nIt's generalized.\n2:40\nWe don't know precisely where we are.\n2:42\nHopper lived in Greenwich Village,\n2:44\nand certainly the brick buildings behind us\n2:46\nare reminiscent of the architecture that we might find in the village,\n2:49\nbut this is not a specific street corner.\n2:51\nThis is not a specific cafe.\n2:53\nIt is a kind of stripping away of everything that's nonessential,\n2:57\nso that we're left with a kind of idealized rendering\n3:01\nof these forms of this American experience.\n3:04\nBeth: There's a sense of that in the geometry\n3:07\nof the composition, the horizontal line of the counter\n3:11\nthat the two figures in the background lean against,\n3:14\nthose very geometric forms of the coffee urns,\n3:18\nthe rectangular shape of that doorway.\n3:20\nSteven: Well, there's this conflict between these figures\n3:24\ngoing about their ordinary lives and the strict geometry\n3:27\nof the space that he's imposed in this imposed in this image.\n3:29\nI have to say that I love the fact\n3:31\nthat those coffee urns are so specific.\n3:33\nYou can even see the glass straws,\n3:35\nand see how much coffee is left in them.\n3:37\nThere is that sign just above this cafe\n3:40\nthat's advertising cigars for 5 cents.\n3:43\nThere's this specific turn of the cash register\n3:45\nacross the street, that is there are signifiers\n3:49\nof a kind of everyday American experience,\n3:52\neven as this painting has been emptied out.\n3:54\nHe's left these few clues that really place us\n3:58\nin a particular place, in a particular time, in our experience.\n4:02\nBeth: How about the napkin holders, and the sa-\n4:05\nSteven: (laughs)\n4:06\nBeth: and the salt and pepper shakers,\n4:08\nand the mugs of coffee, and the glass of water?\n4:11\nThere's a kind of love and attention to those very dinery objects here.\n4:17\nThat's really compelling.\n4:19\nSteven: Absolutely.\n4:20\nYou have those cherry-topped stools that spin.\n4:23\nYou see the cherry of the counter.\n4:25\nBeth: There's a kind of specificity,\n4:27\nbut at the same time, a generalizing that's happening.\n4:30\nSteven: That's right.\n4:31\nHe's given us enough specific so that we know we've been there,\n4:35\nand yet, this could be anywhere.\n4:36\n(piano playing)",

1s has gone by\n6:05\nwhat is now our velocity? well our initial velocity right here is 19.6m/s\n6:12\nthat was a given, and our acceleration is negative 9.8m/s*s\n6:20\nso it's negative right over there and you multiply that by delat t\n6:24\nin every situation, so in this situation we are gonna multiply it by 1\n6:28\ndelta t is 1, so you have 19.6 minus 9.8 that gives exactly 9.8m/s\n6:36\nand the unit we got cause we multiply here is second\n6:40\nso its give us meters per second\n6:41\n19.6m/s minus 9.8m/s one of these seconds go away multiply by second\n6:48\ngive you 9.8m/s so after 1s our velocity is now half of what it was before\n6:55\nso we are now going 9.8m/s, let me draw a line here\n7:01\n9.8m/s, now what is our displacement? so you look up here\n7:09\nLet me rewrite this displacement formular here with all the infomation\n7:13\nSo we know that displacement is going to be equal to initial veloctiy\n7:17\nwhich is 19.6m/s\n7:21\nnow I won't write the units here just for the sake of space\n7:22\ntimes change in time, times our, use the same color to see what is what\n7:28\ntimes our change in time, plus one half let me be clear one half\n7:33\ntimes negative 9.8m/s*s so one half times a is going to be\n7:40\nI rewrite this right over here cause this is gonna be negative 9.8m/s*s\n7:45\ntimes one half, so this is going to be negative 4.9\n7:50\nAll I did is one half times negative 9.8 over here\n7:57\nIt is important that is why the vector quantity is start to matter\n8:00\nbecause if you put a positive here you wouldn't have the obeject slowing\n8:04\ndown as you went up, because you will have gravity somehow accelerating\n8:07\nas it went up, but it's actually slowing it down\n8:09\nit's pulling it, it's accelerating it in downward direction\n8:12\nso that's why you have a negative right over there,\n8:15\nthat was out convention at the beginning\n8:16\nof last video, up is positive, down is negative, so let's focus\n8:22\nSo this part right over here, negative 4.9 m/s*s times delat t square\n8:27\ntimes delta t, times delta t square, this will make it a little bit easier\n8:32\nAlthough it still, let me get the calculator out\n8:34\nSo when one second has past, I let my trusty TI-85 out now\n8:42\nwhen 1s past it's 19.6 times 1,\n8:46\nwell that's just 19.6 minus 4.9 times 1 square\n8:50\nSo that's just minus 4.9, mius 4.9, gives us 14.7 meters\n8:58\nSo 14.7 meters So after 1s, the ball has travel 14.7 meters in the air\n9:06\nSo that's roughly over there, now what happen after 2s?\n9:12\nI'll do the same agenda, so after 2s,\n9:15\nour velocity is 19.6 minus 9.8 times 2, times 2 this is 2s has gone by\n9:23\nwell 9.8 times 2, 9.8 times 2 square seconds gives us 19.6 m/s\n9:32\nso these just cancel out, so we get out velocity now is zero\n9:36\nSo after two seconds our velocity now is zero\n9:40\nlet me make it so this thing should more look like a line\n9:47\nI don't get a sense, so this is let me just draw the line like this\n9:51\nso our velocity now is zero after 2 seconds\n9:55\nwhat is our displacement?\n9:57\nSo literally we at the point with the ball has no velocity\n10:01\nexactly two seconds, it kind of gone up,\n10:04\nand right for that exact moment of time it's stationary\n10:09\nand then what do we have going on in our displacement?\n10:13\nWe have 19.6 let me get the calculator out for this\n10:16\nWe can do it by hand but for the sake of quickness\n10:21\n19.6 times 2 minus 4.9 times 2s squared, this is 2s squared\n10:36\nso that's times four, so that gives us 19.6 meters\n10:41\nSo we have 19, we are at 19.6 meters after 2 seconds\n10:49\nwe are 19.6 meters in the air\n10:53\nnow let's go to 3s, so after 3s, our velocity now\n11:01\nit's 19.6 m/s minus 9.8 times 3, we could do that in our head but just\n11:09\nverified it for us, let me get the calculator out\n11:11\nit's 19.6-9.8*3, that gives us 9.8 m/s, negative 9.8m/s\n11:24\nSo after 3s, our velocity is now negative 9.8 m/s, what is that mean?\n11:29\nit's now going in downward direction, 9.8 m/s,\n11:33\nso this is our velocity graph, and what is our displacement?\n11:39\nSo once again, let's get the calculator out\n11:41\nyou are getting the hang of this\n11:43\nat anytime I encourage you to pause it and try it for yourself\n11:46\nSo now what is this is, Okay I'm looking at the displacement\n11:53\nOur displacment was delta t with 3s 19.6*3 - 4.9 times\n12:03\nso this is delat t so this is 3s\n12:06\nwe are talking about delat t, our change in time is 3s so that's square\n12:10\nSo times 9 and that gives us 14.7 meters, so 14.7 meters\n12:18\nSo after 3s we are 14.7m again, the same position with 1s\n12:24\nbut the difference is now we are moving downard\n12:27\nover here we were moving upwards\n12:28\nand finally what happen after 4s? Or what's our velocity?\n12:32\nLet me just get the calculator out\n12:34\nor you might be figure this out in your head\n12:36\nOur velocity is going to be 19.6 - 9.8 times 4s\n12:48\njust minus 19.6 m/s\n12:55\nSo we are going a magnitude of velocity which is the same initially\n12:59\nthrew the ball except now it's going at opposite direction\n13:02\nit's now going downward, so it's now going downward\n13:07\nand what is our displacement? get the calculator out\n13:11\nSo we have out displacement is 19.6 times 4, 4s has gone by\n13:18\nminus 4.9 times 4 square which is 16 times, which is equal to zero!\n13:27\nthe displacement here is zero!\n13:29\nWe are back on the ground\n13:32\nSo if you plot the displacement, you will actually got a parabola\n13:38\na downward opening parabola that looks something like this\n13:41\nI best draw it relatively neatly\n13:44\nSo my check to do it better than that\n13:46\nDotted line, dotted line is always easier to adjust than its streamed\n13:50\nso if you plot displacement verses time it look something like this\n13:56\nit's velocity just downward sloping line, and the acceleration is constant\n14:01\nand the whole reason why I wanted to this is I wanted to show you\n14:05\nthat velocity the whole time is decreasing at constant rate\n14:08\nand that make sense because that's the rate which the velocity increases\n14:13\nand decreases as the acceleration,\n14:15\nand the acceleration base on our convention is downward\n14:19\nso that why it's decreasing, we have a negative slope here\n14:22\nwe have a negative slope of negative 9.8 m/s*s\n14:28\nand just to think about what's happening for this ball\n14:32\nI know this video is getting long as it goes\n14:34\nI'm gonna draw the vectors for velocity\n14:38\nSo I'm gonna do that in orange, or maybe I will do that in blue\n14:42\nSo velocity in blue, so right when we start,\n14:45\nit has a positive velocity of 19.6m/s,\n14:49\nso I will draw a big vector like this\n14:52\n19.6m/s that's velocity, but after 1s is 9.8m/s so half of that\n14:58\nso then its maybe would look something like this\n15:01\n9.8m/s, then at the speed right over here has the velocity of zero\n15:06\nthen as you go to 3s, the magnitude of the velocity is 9.8m/s\n15:12\nbut it is now downwards, so it looks like this\n15:16\nand then finally right when it hits the ground,\n15:20\nright before it hits the ground it has a negative velocity of 19.6m/s\n15:26\nSo it would look like this, roughly like this\n15:32\nIf I use the same scale over here,\n15:35\nbut what was the acceleration the entire time?\n15:38\nwell the entire time the acceleration is negative\n15:40\nIt's 9.8m/s*s I will do that in orange\n15:44\nSo the acceleration over here\n15:46\nNegative, now I wanna do that in orange\n15:48\nThe acceleration is negative 9.8m/s*s\n15:58\nThe acceleration is constant the entire time\n16:02\nSo last one is negative 9.8m/s*s\n16:05\nit does not change depending on where you are\n16:07\nin the curve when you are near the surface of the earth\n16:10\nSo hopefully that clarify the things a little bit and gives you\n16:12\nwhat happen when you throw up a projectile into the air",

discovered the distances\n0:10\nfrom her house to Alnitak, 736 lights years,\n0:16\nand to Mintaka, 915 light years,\n0:20\nwhich are the endpoints of Orion's belt.\n0:23\nShe knows the angle between these\n0:26\nstars in the sky is three degrees.\n0:29\nWhat is the width of Orion's belt?\n0:31\nThat is, what is the distance\n0:32\nbetween Alnitak and Mintaka?\n0:36\nAnd they want us to the answer in light years.\n0:39\nSo let's draw a little diagram\n0:40\nto make sure we understand what's going on.\n0:42\nActually, even before we do that,\n0:43\nI encourage you to pause\n0:44\nthis and try this on your own.\n0:46\nNow let's make a diagram.\n0:48\nAlright, so let's say that this is Artemis'\n0:50\nhouse right over here.\n0:52\nThis is Artemis' house.\n0:53\nI'll say that's A for Artemis' house.\n0:57\nAnd then...\n0:58\nAlright, let me say H...\n1:00\nLet me say this is home.\n1:01\nThis is home right over here.\n1:03\nAnd we have these 2 stars.\n1:04\nSo she's looking out into the night sky\n1:07\nand she sees these stars,\n1:09\nAlnitak, which is 736 light years away,\n1:14\nand obviously I'm not going to draw this to scale.\n1:17\nSo this is Alnitak.\n1:21\nAnd Mintaka.\n1:25\nSo let's say this is Mintaka right over here.\n1:28\nMintaka.\n1:31\nAnd we know a few things.\n1:32\nWe know that this distance between her home\n1:35\nand Alnitak is 736 light years.\n1:40\nSo this distance right over here.\n1:42\nSo that right over there.\n1:44\nEverything we'll do is in light years.\n1:45\nThat's 736.\n1:47\nAnd the distance between\n1:48\nher house and Mintaka is 915 light years.\n1:54\nSo it would take light 915 years\n1:57\nto get from her house to Mintaka,\n1:58\nor from Mintaka to her house.\n2:01\nSo this is 915 light years.\n2:04\nAnd what we wanna do is figure out\n2:05\nthe width of Orion's belt,\n2:07\nwhich is the distance between Alnitak and Mintaka.\n2:11\nSo we need to figure out this distance\n2:15\nright over here.\n2:17\nAnd the one thing that they did give us\n2:21\nis this angle.\n2:23\nThey did give us that angle right over there.\n2:26\nThey said that the angle between\n2:28\nthese stars in the sky is three degrees.\n2:30\nSo this is three degrees right over there.\n2:33\nSo how can we figure out the distance\n2:36\nbetween Alnitak and Mintaka?\n2:38\nLet's just say that this is equal to X.\n2:40\nThis is equal to X.\n2:42\nHow do we do that?\n2:43\nWell if we have two sides\n2:45\nand an angle between them,\n2:47\nwe could use the law of cosines\n2:50\nto figure out the third side.\n2:55\nSo the law of cosines,\n2:56\nso let's just apply it.\n2:58\nSo the law of cosines tells us\n3:02\nthat X squared is going to be equal\n3:05\nto the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n3:09\nSo it's going to be equal to 736 squared,\n3:14\nplus 915 squared, minus two times 736,\n3:28\ntimes 915, times the cosine of this angle.\n3:37\nTimes the cosine of three degrees.\n3:41\nSo once again,\n3:43\nwe're trying to find the length of\n3:44\nthe side opposite the three degrees.\n3:46\nWe know the other two sides,\n3:48\nso the law of cosines, it essentially...\n3:51\nSorry, I just had to cough off camera\n3:54\nbecause I had some peanuts and my throat was dry.\n3:56\nWhere was I?\n3:56\nOh, I was saying,\n3:58\nif we know the angle and we know the two sides\n4:00\non either side of the angle,\n4:01\nwe can figure out the length of the side opposite\n4:03\nby the law of cosines.\n4:04\nWhere it essentially starts off not too\n4:06\ndifferent than the Pythagorean theorem,\n4:08\nbut then we give an adjustment\n4:09\nbecause this is not an actual right triangle.\n4:12\nAnd the adjustment...\n4:13\nSo we have the 736 squared, plus 915 squared,\n4:16\nminus two times the product of these sides,\n4:19\ntimes the cosine of this angle.\n4:21\nOr another way we could say, think about it is,\n4:23\nX, let me write that,\n4:28\nX is to equal to the square root of all\n4:31\nof this stuff.\n4:33\nSo, I can just copy and paste that.\n4:37\nCopy and paste.\n4:40\nX is going to be equal to the square root of that.\n4:44\nAnd so let's get our calculator to calculate it.\n4:48\nAnd let me verify that I'm in degree mode.\n4:51\nYes, I am indeed in degree mode.\n4:53\nAnd so let's exit that.\n4:55\nAnd so I wanna calculate the square root of\n4:58\n736 squared, plus 915 squared,\n5:06\nminus two times 736, times 915,\n5:15\ntimes cosine of three degrees.\n5:19\nAnd we deserve a drum roll now.\n5:22\nX is 100, if we round...\n5:24\nLet's see, what did they want us to do?\n5:25\nRound your answer to the nearest light years.\n5:27\nSo to the nearest light year\n5:28\nis going to be 184 light years.\n5:31\nSo X is approximately equal to 184 light years.\n5:40\nSo it would take light 184 years\n5:43\nto get from Mintaka to Alnitak.\n5:47\nAnd so hopefully this actually shows you\n5:49\nif you are going to do any astronomy,\n5:51\nthe law of cosines, law of sines,\n5:54\nin fact all of trigonometry,\n5:55\nbecomes quite, quite handy.",

law.\n0:06\nIt seems simple, but it's not nearly\n0:08\nas simple as you might think.\n0:09\nSo people often phrase it as,\n0:11\nfor every action there's an equal and opposite reaction.\n0:14\nBut that's just way too vague to be useful.\n0:16\nSo a version that's a little better,\n0:18\nsays that for every force, there's an equal\n0:21\nand opposite force.\n0:23\nSo this is a little better.\n0:24\nThe equal sign means that these forces\n0:26\nare equal in magnitude.\n0:28\nAnd this negative sign means they're just different\n0:31\nby the direction of the vector.\n0:33\nSo these are vectors, so this says that this pink\n0:35\nvector F, has the opposite direction,\n0:38\nbut equal in magnitude to this green vector F.\n0:41\nBut to show you why this is still a little bit too vague,\n0:44\nconsider this, if this is all you knew about\n0:46\nNewtons's Third Law, that for every force,\n0:48\nthere's an equal and opposite force,\n0:50\nyou might wonder, if you were clever,\n0:52\nyou might be like, wait a minute,\n0:54\nif for every force F, right, there's got to be\n0:59\na force that's equal and opposite.\n1:03\nWell why doesn't that just mean\n1:04\nthat every force in the universe cancels?\n1:07\nShouldn't every force just cancel then, at that point?\n1:09\nDoesn't that just mean that there's\n1:12\nno acceleration that's even possible?\n1:15\nBecause if I go and exert a force F on something,\n1:17\nif there's gonna be a force negative F,\n1:19\ndoesn't that mean that no matter what force I put forward,\n1:22\nit's just gonna get cancelled?\n1:24\nAnd the answer no, and the reason it's no\n1:26\nis because these two forces\n1:28\nare exerted on different objects.\n1:30\nSo you have to be careful.\n1:31\nSo the reason I say that this statement\n1:33\nof Newtons's Third Law is still a little bit too vague,\n1:35\nis because this is really on different objects.\n1:38\nSo if this is the force on object A,\n1:41\nexerted by object B, then this force over here\n1:45\nhas to be the force on object B, exerted by object A.\n1:53\nIn other words, these forces down here are exerted\n1:55\non different objects.\n1:56\nI'm gonna move this over to this side.\n1:58\nI'm gonna move this over to here.\n2:00\nLet's draw two different objects\n2:02\nto show explicitly what I mean.\n2:04\nSo if there was some object A,\n2:07\nso I put some object A in here.\n2:09\nJust wanna make sure there's an object A.\n2:11\nLet's say this is object A, and it had\n2:13\nthis green force exerted on it, F.\n2:16\nSo this object right here is A.\n2:19\nWell, there's gonna be another object, object B.\n2:23\nWe'll just make it another circle.\n2:26\nSo we'll make it look like this.\n2:29\nSo here's object B.\n2:31\nAnd it's gonna have this pink force,\n2:34\nF, negative F exerted on it.\n2:35\nSo I'm gonna call this object B.\n2:37\nNow we're okay, now we know these forces can't cancel,\n2:41\nand the reason these forces can't cancel,\n2:43\nis cause they're on two different objects.\n2:45\nBut when you just say that Newtons's Third Law,\n2:46\nis that every force has an equal and opposite force,\n2:48\nit's not clear that it has to be on different objects.\n2:51\nBut it does have to be on different objects.\n2:53\nSo these Newtons force law pairs,\n2:55\noften times is called force pairs,\n2:57\nor Newton's third law partner forces,\n3:00\nare always on different objects.\n3:02\nSo the convention I'm using is that the first letter\n3:05\nrepresents the object that the force is on.\n3:09\nSo this A represents that this green force F\n3:11\nthis green force F, is on A and it's exerted by B.\n3:18\nAnd this shows that it's exerted on B,\n3:20\nbecause the first letter's on the first one,\n3:23\nand it's exerted by the second object, A.\n3:27\nSo this pink force is exerted on B.\n3:30\nThis green force is exerted on A.\n3:32\nThey're equal and opposite, they do not cancel,\n3:34\nthey cannot cancel because they're not on the same object.\n3:38\nSo that's why these don't cancel.\n3:40\nAnd they are the same magnitude,\n3:41\neven if the two objects are not the same size.\n3:43\nThis is another misconception,\n3:45\nif object A is a planet, a big planet.\n3:48\nOr maybe a star, this is yellow, it looks like a star.\n3:50\nLet's say this is some big star,\n3:53\nand this is some smaller planet orbiting that star.\n3:55\nThis is not to scale, unless this planet was enormous.\n3:59\nSo this is some planet, but this planet could be\n4:02\nhundreds, thousands of times, millions of times\n4:05\nless massive than this star but it would still\n4:08\nexert the same force.\n4:10\nSo if this star is pulling on the planet\n4:11\nwith this pink force negative F,\n4:15\nthen this planet has to be pulling on the star\n4:17\nwith this green force F and they have to have\n4:19\nthe same magnitude, even if they are different sizes.\n4:23\nSo people quote Newtons's Third Law,\n4:24\nbut sometimes they don't really believe it.\n4:27\nIf I told you this planet was a million times\n4:28\nless massive than this star, people would want to say\n4:31\nthat well, then the star obviously pulls more on the planet,\n4:36\nthan the planet pulls on the star.\n4:37\nBut that's not true according to Newtons's Third Law.\n4:40\nAnd Newtons's Third Law says that they have to be the same,\n4:43\neven if they're different sizes.\n4:44\nSo if this was the earth and this was the moon,\n4:46\nthe earth pulls on the moon, just as much\n4:48\nas the moon pulls on the earth.\n4:50\nAnd you might still object, you might say,\n4:51\nwait that makes no sense, I know the star just basically\n4:54\nsits there and the planet gets whipped around in a circle.\n4:58\nHow come this planet's getting whipped around\n5:00\nand the star's just staying put?\n5:02\nThat's because, just because the forces are equal,\n5:04\nthat doesn't mean that the result is equal.\n5:06\nIn other words, the forces could be equal,\n5:08\nbut the accelerations don't have to be equal.\n5:11\nAcceleration is gonna be the net force divided by the mass.\n5:15\nSo even if the force is the same,\n5:18\nyou divide by that mass, you'll get\n5:19\na different acceleration and that's why the result of\n5:22\nthe force does not have to be the same,\n5:24\neven though the forces do have to be the same,\n5:27\nbecause of Newtons's Third Law.\n5:29\nAnother misconception people sometimes make,\n5:31\nis they think there might be a delay in the creation\n5:33\nof this Newtons's Third Law partner force.\n5:36\nAnd people think, maybe if I exert this first force\n5:39\nfast enough, I can catch the universe sleeping,\n5:42\nand there might be some sort of delay\n5:43\nin the creation of this other force.\n5:45\nBut that's not true, Newtons's Third Law is universal.\n5:48\nNo matter what the situation,\n5:49\nno matter what the acceleration or non acceleration,\n5:52\nor motion or no motion, whether one object\n5:54\nis bigger or smaller, if their Newtons's Third Law\n5:57\npartner forces, they are equal they are opposite\n6:00\nand they are always equal and opposite,\n6:02\nat every given moment in time.\n6:03\nSo even if I came in all guns a blazing,\n6:06\nChuck Norris style, trying to dropkick some wall.\n6:09\nThat does not look like the correct form for a drop kick.\n6:12\nBut even if I came in, flying at this wall,\n6:15\nas soon as I start to make contact with the wall,\n6:18\nI'm gonna exert a force on the wall,\n6:20\nand the wall has to exert a force back.\n6:22\nSo I'd exert a force on the wall to the right.\n6:26\nAnd this would be the force on the wall, by my foot.\n6:30\nThere'd have to be an equal and opposite force\n6:32\ninstantly transmitted backwards, on my foot.\n6:36\nSo this would be the force on my foot, by the wall.\n6:39\nThis happens instantaneously, there is no delay.\n6:42\nYou can't kick this wall fast enough,\n6:43\nfor this other force to not be generated instantaneously.\n6:46\nAs soon as your foot starts to exert any force on the wall\n6:49\nwhat so ever, the wall is gonna start exerting\n6:51\nthat same force back on your foot.\n6:54\nSo Newtons's Third Law is universal,\n6:56\nbut people still have trouble identifying\n6:58\nthese third law partner forces.\n7:00\nSo one of the best ways to do it,\n7:01\nis by listing both objects,\n7:03\nas soon as you list both objects,\n7:05\nwell to figure out where the partner force is,\n7:06\nyou can just reverse these labels.\n7:09\nSo I know over here, if one of my forces\n7:11\nis the force on the wall by my foot,\n7:14\nto find the partner force to this force,\n7:16\nI can just reverse the labels and say it's gotta be\n7:18\nthe force on my foot, by the wall, which I drew over here.\n7:22\nSo this is a great way to identify\n7:24\nthe third law partner forces,\n7:25\ncause it's not always obvious\n7:27\nwhat force is the partner force.\n7:29\nSo to show you how this can be tricky,\n7:30\nconsider this example.\n7:32\nSay we got the ground and a table.\n7:34\nSo this example drives people crazy for some reason.\n7:38\nIf I've got a box sitting on a table,\n7:40\nwe'll call it box A.\n7:42\nBox A is gonna have forces exerted on it.\n7:44\nOne of those forces is gonna be the gravitational force.\n7:47\nSo the force of gravity is gonna pull straight down\n7:49\non box A, and if I were to ask you,\n7:51\nwhat force is the third law partner force to this force\n7:54\nof gravity, I'm willing to bet a lot of people might say,\n7:58\nwell there's an upwards force on box A,\n8:00\nexerted by the table.\n8:02\nAnd that's true.\n8:04\nAnd if this box A is just sitting here,\n8:06\nnot accelerating, these two forces are going\n8:08\nto be equal and opposite.\n8:09\nSo it's even more tempting to say that these two forces\n8:12\nare equal and opposite because of the third law,\n8:15\nbut that's not true.\n8:16\nThese two forces are equal and opposite\n8:18\nbecause of the second law.\n8:19\nThe second law says if there's no acceleration,\n8:21\nthen the net force has to be zero,\n8:23\nthe forces have to cancel.\n8:25\nAnd that's what's happening here.\n8:26\nThese forces are equal and opposite,\n8:27\nthey're canceling on box A.\n8:29\nWhich is a way to know that they are not third law\n8:31\npartner forces, cause third law partner forces\n8:34\nare always exerted on different objects.\n8:36\nThey can never cancel if they're third law partner forces.\n8:40\nSo what's going on over here?\n8:41\nWe've got two forces that are canceling,\n8:43\nthat are equal and opposite, but they're not third law\n8:45\npartner forces, they're partner forces are somewhere else.\n8:49\nI haven't drawn their partner forces yet.\n8:50\nSo let's try to figure out what they're partner forces are.\n8:53\nSo let's get rid of this, let's come back to here,\n8:55\nlet's slow it down to figure out what the partner force is,\n8:58\nname the two objects interacting.\n9:00\nSo this force of gravity, I shouldn't be vague,\n9:02\nI should call it the force on object A,\n9:05\nour box A exerted by, well you can't just say gravity.\n9:09\nGravity is not an object.\n9:11\nSo the object that is exerting\n9:12\nthis gravitational force on A, is the earth.\n9:15\nSo this force really, this gravitational force,\n9:17\nif I wanna be careful, is the force on object A\n9:19\nexerted by the earth.\n9:21\nNow it's easy to figure out where the partner force is.\n9:23\nThe partner force can be found just\n9:25\nby reversing these labels.\n9:26\nSo instead of the force on A by the earth,\n9:28\nthere's gotta be an equal and opposite force,\n9:30\nwhich is the force on the earth, by box A.\n9:33\nSo opposite means it has to point up.\n9:35\nSo it has to be an upward force.\n9:37\nAnd that upward force has to be exerted on the earth,\n9:40\nby box A, and this is kind of weird,\n9:42\nbecause you may not have realized it,\n9:44\nbut if the earth is pulling down on a box, or you,\n9:48\nthat means you are pulling up on the earth.\n9:50\nAnd this might seem ridiculous,\n9:52\nI mean if you jump up, you jump up, you fall back down,\n9:55\nyou move around, but the earth just sits there.\n9:57\nIf your forces are equal, how come the earth doesn't\n9:59\nmove around like you do.\n10:01\nAnd again, it's because just because\n10:03\nthe forces are the same, the acceleration\n10:05\ndoesn't have to be the same.\n10:06\nThe mass of the earth is so big,\n10:08\ncompared to your mass, there's basically no acceleration.\n10:11\nEven though the forces on you\n10:13\nand the forces on the earth are the same.\n10:16\nSo these two are third law partner forces.\n10:19\nThese two are joined together forever.\n10:22\nThey have to be equal, no matter what happens,\n10:25\nthese two forces will always be equal.\n10:27\nI don't care if this box is accelerating\n10:29\nor not accelerating, or that there's motion or no motion.\n10:33\nWhether it's hitting a wall, sitting on a table,\n10:35\nfalling through space, these two forces must\n10:38\nalways be equal and opposite, because of the third law.\n10:41\nSo how about this other force,\n10:42\nthis force that the table was exerting.\n10:45\nSo this is, the force on A by the table.\n10:48\nSo if I wanna label it correctly,\n10:50\nI'd call it the force on box A, exerted by the table.\n10:54\nNow finding the third law partner force is easy,\n10:56\nI can just reverse these labels,\n10:57\nand I'd get that there must be,\n10:59\ninstead of an upwards force, a downwards\n11:01\nforce on the table, by A.\n11:03\nSo I'm gonna have another force here on the table.\n11:05\nIt's gonna be a downward force.\n11:07\nDownward force on the table by A,\n11:09\nthat's the third law partner force to this upward\n11:12\nforce that the table is exerting.\n11:14\nThese two forces are also third law partner forces.\n11:18\nthese forces are going to be equal\n11:20\nand opposite no matter what happens.\n11:22\nThis force on box A by the table.\n11:25\nAnd this force on the table by box A\n11:27\nmust be equal no matter what happens,\n11:30\nbut the force on box A by the table,\n11:32\ndoes not have to be equal and opposite\n11:34\nto the force on A by the earth.\n11:36\nIt happens to be equal and opposite,\n11:38\nin a case where there's no acceleration.\n11:40\nIf we stuck this whole situation into an elevator,\n11:43\nor a rocket that had some huge acceleration upwards,\n11:47\neven if there's acceleration upwards,\n11:50\nthese partner forces have to be equal.\n11:52\nSo the force on A by the table,\n11:53\nand the force on the table by A will have to be equal.\n11:56\nSimilarly the force on the earth by A,\n11:58\nand the force on A by the earth have to be equal.\n12:00\nBut no longer will these two forces have to be equal,\n12:03\ncause they're not partner forces.\n12:05\nThey might be equal and opposite in some circumstances,\n12:08\nbut they don't always have to be equal and opposite.\n12:10\nIf we're accelerating upwards,\n12:11\nthis upward force on the box,\n12:13\nmust be bigger than the downwards force on the box.\n12:15\nSo these won't be equal.\n12:17\nRecapping quickly, Newtons's Third Law is a statement\n12:19\nabout the forces on two different objects.\n12:22\nAnd because it's about two different objects,\n12:23\nthose forces can never cancel.\n12:25\nTo find the Newtons's Third Law partner force,\n12:28\njust reverse the label after you've identified\n12:30\nthe two objects that are interacting.\n12:32\nThe third law partner forces have to be equal in magnitude,\n12:36\neven if one object is larger than the other,\n12:38\nor has more charge or any property that might\n12:41\nseem like it would convey more force, than another object.\n12:44\nIf those are the two objects interacting,\n12:46\ntheir forces must be of equal magnitude\n12:47\nand opposite directions, the forces instantaneously\n12:51\ngenerated this partner forces.\n12:53\nAnd be careful, some forces might seem like partner forces,\n12:58\nand might be equal and opposite,\n12:59\nbut they're not necessarily third law partner forces.\n13:02\nThey made just be equal and opposite for other reasons.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's find the volume of a few more solid figures\n0:02\nand then if we have time, we might\n0:04\nbe able to do some surface area problems.\n0:06\nSo let me draw a cylinder over here.\n0:08\nSo that is the top of my cylinder.\n0:11\nAnd then this is the height of my cylinder.\n0:14\nThis is the bottom right over here.\n0:16\nIf this was transparent, maybe you\n0:18\ncould see the back side of the cylinder.\n0:20\nSo you could imagine this kind of looks like a soda can.\n0:23\nAnd let's say that the height of my cylinder, h, is equal to 8.\n0:30\nI'll give it some units.\n0:31\n8 centimeters, that is my height.\n0:34\nAnd then let's say that the radius of one\n0:37\nof the top of my cylinder of my soda can,\n0:40\nlet's say that this radius over here is equal to 4 centimeters.\n0:45\nSo what is the volume here?\n0:47\nWhat is the volume going to be?\n0:51\nAnd the idea here is really the exact same thing\n0:54\nthat we saw in some of the previous problems.\n0:55\nIf you can find the surface area of one side\n0:58\nand then figure out how deep it goes,\n1:00\nyou'll be able to figure out the volume.\n1:02\nSo what we're going to do here is figure out\n1:04\nthe surface area of the top of this cylinder,\n1:08\nor the top of the soda can.\n1:10\nAnd then we're going to multiply it by its height.\n1:12\nAnd that'll give us a volume.\n1:13\nThis will tell us essentially, how many\n1:15\nsquare centimeters fit in this top.\n1:17\nAnd then if we multiply that by how many centimeters\n1:20\nwe go down, then that'll give us the number\n1:23\nof cubic centimeters in this cylinder or soda can.\n1:27\nSo how do we figure out this area up here?\n1:30\nWell the area at the top, this is just\n1:32\nfinding the area of a circle.\n1:33\nYou could imagine drawing it like this.\n1:36\nIf we were to just look at it straight on,\n1:38\nthat's a circle with a radius of 4 centimeters.\n1:42\nThe area of a circle with a radius 4 centimeters, area\n1:45\nis equal to pi r squared.\n1:48\nSo it's going to be pi times the radius squared,\n1:51\ntimes 4 centimeters squared, which is equal to 4 squared,\n1:55\nis 16, times pi.\n1:58\nAnd our units now are going to be centimeters squared.\n2:03\nOr another way to think of these are square centimeters.\n2:06\nSo that's the area.\n2:07\nThe volume is going to be this area times the height.\n2:11\nSo the volume is going to be equal to 16 pi\n2:16\ncentimeters squared, times the height, times 8 centimeters.\n2:29\nAnd so, when you do multiplication,\n2:32\nthe associative property, you can kind of\n2:34\nrearrange these things, and the commutative property.\n2:36\nIt doesn't matter what order you do it\n2:38\nif it's all multiplication.\n2:39\nSo this is the same thing as 16 times 8.\n2:42\nLet's see.\n2:43\n8 times 8 is 64.\n2:44\n16 times 8 is twice that.\n2:45\nSo it's going to be 128 pi.\n2:50\nNow you have centimeter squared times centimeters.\n2:53\nSo that gives us centimeters cubed.\n2:56\nOr 128 pi cubic centimeters.\n2:59\nRemember, pi is just a number.\n3:01\nWe write it as pi, because it's kind\n3:03\nof a crazy, irrational number, that if you were to write it,\n3:06\nyou could never completely write pi.\n3:08\n3.14159 keeps going on, never a repeat.\n3:13\nSo we just leave it as pi.\n3:14\nBut if you wanted to figure it out, you can get a calculator.\n3:17\nAnd this would be 3.14 roughly, times 128.\n3:20\nSo it would be close to 400 cubic centimeters.\n3:25\nNow, how would we find the surface area?\n3:28\nHow would we find the surface area of this figure over here?\n3:32\nWell, part of the surface area of the two surfaces, the top\n3:34\nand the bottom.\n3:35\nSo that would be part of the surface area.\n3:39\nAnd then the bottom over here would also\n3:41\nbe part of the surface area.\n3:44\nSo if we're trying to find the surface area,\n3:51\nit's definitely going to have both of these areas here.\n3:54\nSo it's going to have the 16 pi centimeters squared twice.\n3:57\nThis is 16 pi.\n3:59\nThis is 16 pi square centimeters.\n4:01\nSo it's going to have 2 times 16 pi centimeters squared.\n4:06\nI'll keep the units still.\n4:08\nSo that covers the top and the bottom of our soda can.\n4:11\nAnd now we have to figure out the surface\n4:13\narea of this thing that goes around.\n4:15\nAnd the way I imagine it is, imagine\n4:16\nif you're trying to wrap this thing with wrapping paper.\n4:19\nSo let me just draw a little dotted line here.\n4:22\nSo imagine if you were to cut it just like that.\n4:24\nCut the side of the soda can.\n4:25\nAnd if you were to unwind this thing that\n4:30\ngoes around it, what would you have.\n4:32\nWell, you would have something.\n4:34\nYou would end up with a sheet of paper\n4:36\nwhere this length right over here\n4:40\nis the same thing as this length over here.\n4:42\nAnd then it would be completely unwound.\n4:45\nAnd then these two ends-- let me do it\n4:47\nin magenta-- these two ends used to touch each other.\n4:52\nAnd-- I'm going to do it in a color that I haven't used yet,\n4:54\nI'll do it in pink-- these two ends used\n4:57\nto touch each other when it was all rolled together.\n4:59\nAnd they used to touch each other right over there.\n5:02\nSo the length of this side and that side\n5:05\nis going to be the same thing as the height of my cylinder.\n5:09\nSo this is going to be 8 centimeters.\n5:11\nAnd then this over here is also going to be 8 centimeters.\n5:14\nAnd so the question we need to ask\n5:16\nourselves is, what is going to be this dimension\n5:21\nright over here.\n5:23\nAnd remember, that dimension is essentially,\n5:24\nhow far did we go around the cylinder.\n5:28\nWell, if you think about it, that's\n5:29\ngoing to be the exact same thing as the circumference\n5:32\nof either the top or the bottom of the cylinder.\n5:36\nSo what is the circumference?\n5:37\nThe circumference of this circle right\n5:39\nover here, which is the same thing as the circumference\n5:41\nof that circle over there, it is 2 times the radius times pi.\n5:47\nOr 2 pi times the radius.\n5:49\n2 pi times 4 centimeters, which is equal to 8 pi centimeters.\n5:57\nSo this distance right over here is the circumference\n6:00\nof either the top or the bottom of the cylinder.\n6:02\nIt's going to be 8 pi centimeters.\n6:06\nSo if you want to find the surface\n6:07\narea of just the wrapping, just the part that\n6:09\ngoes around the cylinder, not the top or the bottom,\n6:13\nwhen you unwind it, it's going to look like this rectangle.\n6:16\nAnd so its area, the area of just that part,\n6:19\nis going to be equal to 8 centimeters times 8 pi\n6:22\ncentimeters.\n6:23\nSo let me do it this way.\n6:24\nIt's going to be 8 centimeters times 8 pi centimeters.\n6:31\nAnd that's equal to 64 pi.\n6:35\n8 times 8 is 64.\n6:36\nYou have your pi centimeters squared.\n6:40\nSo when you want the surface area of the whole thing,\n6:42\nyou have the top, you have the bottom,\n6:44\nwe already threw those there.\n6:45\nAnd then you want to find the area of the thing around.\n6:47\nWe just figured that out.\n6:48\nSo it's going to be plus 64 pi centimeters squared.\n6:54\nAnd now we just have to calculate it.\n6:56\nSo this gives us 2 times 16 pi, is going to be equal to 32.\n7:02\nThat is 32 pi centimeters squared, plus 64 pi.\n7:09\nLet me scroll over to the right a little bit.\n7:12\nPlus 64 pi centimeters squared.\n7:15\nAnd then 32 plus 64 is 96 pi centimeters squared.\n7:23\nSo it's equal to 96 pi square centimeters, which\n7:26\nis going to be a little bit over 300 square centimeters.\n7:30\nAnd notice, when we did surface area,\n7:32\nwe got our answer in terms of square centimeters.\n7:35\nThat makes sense, because surface area,\n7:38\nit's a two-dimensional measurement.\n7:40\nThink about how many square centimeters can we\n7:42\nfit on the surface of the cylinder.\n7:45\nWhen we did the volume, we got centimeters cubed,\n7:48\nor cubic centimeters.\n7:49\nAnd that's because we're trying to calculate\n7:51\nhow many one by one by one centimeter\n7:58\ncubes can we fit inside of this structure.\n8:01\nAnd so that's why it's cubic centimeters.\n8:03\nAnyway, hopefully that clarifies things up a little bit.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's do some more problems\n0:02\nthat involve the ideal gas equation.\n0:04\nLet's say I have a gas in a container\n0:06\nand the current pressure is 3 atmospheres.\n0:14\nAnd let's say that the volume of the container is 9 liters.\n0:27\nNow, what will the pressure become\n0:29\nif my volume goes from 9 liters to 3 liters?\n0:39\nSo from the first ideal gas equation video,\n0:42\nyou can kind of have the intuition, that you have a bunch of\n0:44\n-- and we're holding-- and this is important.\n0:47\nWe're holding the temperature constant,\n0:50\nand that's an important thing to realize.\n0:52\nSo in our very original intuition\n0:58\nbehind the ideal gas equation we said,\n1:00\nlook, if we have a certain number of particles\n1:03\nwith a certain amount of kinetic energy,\n1:05\nand they're exerting a certain pressure on their container,\n1:09\nand if we were to make the container smaller,\n1:14\nwe have the same number of particles.\n1:15\nn doesn't change.\n1:17\nThe average kinetic energy doesn't change,\n1:19\nso they're just going to bump into the walls more.\n1:21\nSo that when we make the volume smaller,\n1:23\nwhen the volume goes down, the pressure should go up.\n1:30\nSo let's see if we can calculate the exact number.\n1:32\nSo we can take our ideal gas equation:\n1:34\npressure times volume is equal to nRT.\n1:41\nNow, do the number of particles change\n1:43\nwhen I did this situation when I shrunk the volume? No!\n1:48\nWe have the same number of particles.\n1:50\nI'm just shrinking the container,\n1:51\nso n is n, R doesn't change, that's a constant,\n1:55\nand then the temperature doesn't change.\n1:56\nSo my old pressure times volume is going to be equal to nRT,\n2:02\nand my new pressure times volume\n2:04\n-- so let me call this P1 and V1.\n2:07\nThat's V2.\n2:16\nV2 is this, and we're trying to figure out P2.\n2:20\nP2 is what?\n2:22\nWell, we know that P1 times V1 is equal to nRT,\n2:29\nand we also know that since temperature\n2:33\nand the number of moles of our gas stay constant,\n2:36\nthat P2 times V2 is equal to nRT.\n2:39\nAnd since they both equal the same thing, we can say that\n2:44\nthe pressure times the volume,\n2:46\nas long as the temperature is held constant, will be a constant.\n2:48\nSo P1 times V1 is going to equal P2 times V2.\n2:55\nSo what was P1?\n2:57\nP1, our initial pressure, was 3 atmospheres.\n3:03\nSo 3 atmospheres times 9 liters\n3:10\nis equal to our new pressure times 3 liters.\n3:15\nAnd if we divide both sides of the equation by 3,\n3:18\nwe get 3 liters cancel out,\n3:24\nwe're left with 9 atmospheres.\n3:33\nAnd that should make sense.\n3:35\nWhen you decrease the volume by 2/3\n3:39\nor when you make the volume 1/3 of your original volume,\n3:42\nthen your pressure increases by a factor of three.\n3:46\nSo this went by times 3, and this went by times 1/3.\n3:50\nThat's a useful thing to know in general.\n3:53\nIf temperature is held constant,\n3:55\nthen pressure times volume are going to be a constant.\n3:58\nNow, you can take that even further.\n4:01\nIf we look at PV equals nRT,\n4:06\nthe two things that we know don't change\n4:08\nin the vast majority of exercises we do is\n4:11\nthe number of molecules we're dealing with,\n4:13\nand obviously, R isn't going to change.\n4:15\nSo if we divide both sides of this by T,\n4:18\nwe get PV over T is equal to nR,\n4:22\nor you could say it's equal to a constant.\n4:25\nThis is going to be a constant number for any system\n4:27\nwhere we're not changing the number\n4:29\nof molecules in the container.\n4:30\nSo if initially we start with pressure one, volume one,\n4:38\nand some temperature one that's going to be\n4:40\nequal to this constant.\n4:41\nAnd if we change any of them, if we go back to pressure two,\n4:45\nvolume two, temperature two, they should still be\n4:49\nequal to this constant, so they equal each other.\n4:51\nSo for example, let's say I start off\n4:55\nwith a pressure of 1 atmosphere.\n4:59\nand I have a volume of-- I'll switch units here\n5:06\njust to do things differently-- 2 meters cubed.\n5:09\nAnd let's say our temperature is 27 degrees Celsius.\n5:19\nWell, and I just wrote Celsius because I want you to\n5:22\nalways remember you have to convert to Kelvin,\n5:24\nso 27 degrees plus 273 will get us exactly to 300 Kelvin.\n5:32\nLet's figure out what the new temperature is going to be.\n5:41\nLet's say our new pressure is 2 atmospheres.\n5:46\nThe pressure has increased.\n5:47\nLet's say we make the container smaller, so 1 meter cubed.\n5:52\nSo the container has been decreased by half\n5:54\nand the pressure is doubled by half.\n6:02\nLet me make the container even smaller.\n6:07\nActually, no. Let me make the pressure even larger.\n6:10\nLet me make the pressure into 5 atmospheres.\n6:12\nNow we want to know what the second temperature is,\n6:16\nand we set up our equation.\n6:18\nAnd so we have 2/300 atmosphere meters cubed per Kelvin\n6:27\nis equal to 5/T2, our new temperature,\n6:32\nand then we have 1,500 is equal to 2 T2.\n6:40\nDivide both sides by 2.\n6:41\nYou have T2 is equal to 750 degrees Kelvin,\n6:46\nwhich makes sense, right?\n6:48\nWe increased the pressure so much\n6:50\nand we decreased the volume at the same time that\n6:53\nthe temperature just had to go up.\n6:55\nOr if you thought of it the other way,\n6:56\nmaybe we increased the temperature\n6:58\nand that's what drove the pressure to be so much higher,\n7:00\nespecially since we decreased the volume.\n7:04\nI guess the best way to think about\n7:05\nis this pressure went up so much,\n7:08\nit went up by factor of five,\n7:09\nit went from 1 atmosphere to 5 atmospheres,\n7:12\nbecause on one level we shrunk the volume by a factor of 1/2,\n7:17\nso that should have doubled the pressure,\n7:19\nso that should have gotten us to two atmospheres.\n7:21\nAnd then we made the temperature a lot higher,\n7:24\nso we were also bouncing into the container.\n7:25\nWe made the temperature 750 degrees Kelvin,\n7:27\nso more than double the temperature,\n7:30\nand then that's what got us to 5 atmospheres.\n7:33\nNow, one other thing that you'll probably hear about\n7:37\nis the notion of what happens\n7:39\nat standard temperature and pressure.\n7:41\nLet me delete all of the stuff over here.\n7:44\nStandard temperature and pressure.\n7:46\nLet me delete all this stuff that I don't need.\n7:51\nStandard temperature and pressure.\n7:54\nAnd I'm bringing it up because even though it's called\n7:58\nstandard temperature and pressure, and sometimes called STP,\n8:03\nunfortunately for the world, they haven't really standardized\n8:07\nwhat the standard pressure and temperature are.\n8:13\nI went to Wikipedia and I looked it up.\n8:15\nAnd the one that you'll probably see in most physics classes\n8:18\nand most standardized tests is standard temperature\n8:21\nis 0 degrees celsius, which is,\n8:24\nof course, 273 degrees Kelvin.\n8:26\nAnd standard pressure is 1 atmosphere.\n8:29\nAnd here on Wikipedia, they wrote it as 101.325 kilopascals,\n8:38\nor a little more than 101,000 pascals.\n8:40\nAnd of course, a pascal is a newton per square meter.\n8:44\nIn all of this stuff,\n8:45\nthe units are really the hardest part to get a hold of.\n8:47\nBut let's say that we assume that\n8:49\nthese are all different standard temperatures and pressures\n8:52\nbased on different standard-making bodies.\n8:55\nSo they can't really agree with each other.\n8:56\nBut let's say we took this\n8:57\nas the definition of standard temperature and pressure.\n9:00\nSo we're assuming that temperature is equal to 0 degrees Celsius,\n9:06\nwhich is equal to 273 degrees Kelvin.\n9:10\nAnd pressure, we're assuming, is 1 atmosphere,\n9:14\nwhich could also be written as 101.325 or 3/8 kilopascals.\n9:21\nSo my question is if I have an ideal gas\n9:26\nat standard temperature and pressure,\n9:29\nhow many moles of that do I have in 1 liter?\n9:35\nNo, let me say that the other way.\n9:37\nHow many liters will 1 mole take up?\n9:40\nSo let me say that a little bit more.\n9:42\nSo n is equal to 1 mole.\n9:45\nSo I want to figure out what my volume is.\n9:49\nSo if I have 1 mole of a gas,\n9:50\nI have 6.02 times 10 to 23 molecules of that gas.\n9:55\nIt's at standard pressure, 1 atmosphere,\n9:58\nand at standard temperature,\n9:59\n273 degrees, what is the volume of that gas?\n10:03\nSo let's apply PV is equal to nRT.\n10:06\nPressure is 1 atmosphere,\n10:10\nbut remember we're dealing with atmospheres.\n10:11\n1 atmosphere times volume-- that's what we're solving for.\n10:16\nI'll do that and purple--\n10:17\nis equal to 1 mole times R times temperature, times 273.\n10:27\nNow this is in Kelvin; this is in moles.\n10:31\nWe want our volume in liters.\n10:38\nSo which version of R should we use?\n10:41\nWell, we're dealing with atmospheres.\n10:44\nWe want our volume in liters, and of course,\n10:47\nwe have moles and Kelvin, so we'll use this version, 0.082.\n10:50\nSo this is 1, so we can ignore the 1 there, the 1 there.\n10:54\nSo the volume is equal to 0.082 times 273 degrees Kelvin,\n11:01\nand that is 0.082 times 273 is equal to 22.4 liters.\n11:19\nSo if I have any ideal gas,\n11:21\nand all gases don't behave ideally ideal,\n11:24\nbut if I have an ideal gas and it's at standard temperature,\n11:27\nwhich is at 0 degrees Celsius, or the freezing point of water,\n11:30\nwhich is also 273 degrees Kelvin,\n11:32\nand I have a mole of it,\n11:33\nand it's at standard pressure, 1 atmosphere,\n11:37\nthat gas should take up exactly 22.4 liters.\n11:42\nAnd if you wanted to know\n11:43\nhow many meters cubed it's going to take up,\n11:46\nwell, you could just say 22.4 liters times--\n11:50\nnow, how many meters cubed are there\n11:53\n-- so for every 1 meter cubed, you have 1,000 liters.\n11:57\nI know that seems like a lot, but it's true.\n11:59\nJust think about how big a meter cubed is.\n12:02\nSo this would be equal to 0.0224 meters cubed.\n12:09\nIf you have something at 1 atmosphere,\n12:11\na mole of it, and at 0 degrees Celsius.\n12:14\nAnyway, this is actually a useful number to know sometimes.\n12:17\nThey'll often say, you have 2 moles\n12:22\nat standard temperature and pressure.\n12:25\nHow many liters is it going to take up?\n12:27\nWell, 1 mole will take up this many,\n12:29\nand so 2 moles at standard temperature and pressure\n12:32\nwill take up twice as much,\n12:33\nbecause you're just taking PV equals nRT and just doubling.\n12:35\nEverything else is being held constant.\n12:38\nThe pressure, everything else is being held constant,\n12:41\nso if you double the number of moles,\n12:43\nyou're going to double the volume it takes up.\n12:44\nOr if you half the number of moles,\n12:46\nyou're going to half the volume it takes up.\n12:47\nSo it's a useful thing to know that\n12:49\nin liters at standard temperature and pressure,\n12:51\nwhere standard temperature and pressure\n12:53\nis defined as 1 atmosphere and 273 degrees Kelvin,\n12:56\nan ideal gas will take up 22.4 liters of volume.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nThis exercises is from chapter 12 of the Kotz, Treichel in\n0:03\nTownsend and Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity book, and\n0:06\nI'm doing it with their permission.\n0:09\nSo they tell us you place 2 liters of water in an open\n0:13\ncontainer in your dormitory room.\n0:15\nThe room has a volume of 4.25 times 10 to the fourth liters.\n0:20\nYou seal the room and wait for the water to evaporate.\n0:24\nWill all of the water evaporate\n0:26\nat 25 degrees Celsius?\n0:28\nAnd then they tell us at 25 degrees Celsius, the density\n0:31\nof water is 0.997 grams per milliliter.\n0:36\nAnd its vapor pressure is 23.8 millimeters of mercury.\n0:44\nAnd this is actually the key clue to tell you how to solve\n0:47\nthis problem.\n0:47\nAnd just as a bit of review, lets just think about what\n0:49\nvapor pressure is.\n0:53\nLet's say it's some temperature, and in this case\n0:54\nwe're dealing at 25 degrees Celsius.\n0:57\nI have a bunch of water, and let me do\n0:59\nthat in a water color.\n1:00\nI have a bunch of water molecules\n1:03\nsitting here in a container.\n1:08\nAt 25 degrees Celsius, they're all bouncing around\n1:12\nin every which way.\n1:15\nAnd every now and then one of them is going to have enough\n1:17\nkinetic energy to kind of escape the hydrogen bonds and\n1:21\nall the things that keep liquid water in its liquid\n1:23\nstate, and it will escape.\n1:25\nIt'll go off in that direction, and\n1:26\nthen another one will.\n1:27\nAnd this'll just keep happening.\n1:29\nThe water will naturally vaporize in a room.\n1:32\nBut at some point, enough of these molecules have vaporized\n1:38\nover here that they're also bumping back into the water.\n1:42\nAnd maybe some of them can be captured back\n1:44\ninto the liquid state.\n1:46\nNow, the pressure at which this happens\n1:50\nis the vapor pressure.\n1:51\nAs you can imagine, as more and more these water molecules\n1:55\nvaporize and go into the gaseous state, more and more\n1:58\nwill also create pressure, downward pressure.\n2:01\nMore and more will also be colliding with the\n2:03\nsurface of the water.\n2:04\nAnd the pressure at which the liquid and the vapor states\n2:09\nare in equilibrium is the vapor pressure.\n2:12\nAnd they're telling us right now.\n2:13\nIt is 23.8 millimeters of mercury.\n2:18\nNow, what we need to do to figure out this problem is\n2:21\nsay, OK, if we could figure out how many molecules need to\n2:26\nevaporate, how many molecules of water need to evaporate to\n2:29\ngive us this vapor pressure, we can then use the density of\n2:33\nwater to figure out how many liters of water that is.\n2:37\nSo how do we figure out how many molecules-- let me write\n2:40\nthis down-- how many molecules of water need to evaporate to\n2:59\ngive us the vapor pressure of 23.8 millimeters of mercury?\n3:14\nSo what, I guess, law or formula-- and I never like to\n3:18\njust memorize formulas, but we've given this formal in the\n3:21\npast and it's probably one of the top most useful formulas\n3:25\nin chemistry, or really all of science-- what formula or law\n3:30\ndeals with pressure?\n3:33\nThey give us the volume of the room because that's where the\n3:36\npressure will be inside of.\n3:37\nSo we have pressure, the equilibrium vapor pressure.\n3:41\nWe have a volume of a room right over here.\n3:45\nWe know the temperature of the room right over there.\n3:49\nAnd we're trying to figure out the number of molecules that\n3:52\nneed to evaporate for us to get that pressure in that\n3:57\nvolume at that temperature.\n3:59\nSo what deals with pressure, volume, number of molecules--\n4:04\nlet's say in moles, so I'll write a lower case n-- number\n4:08\nof molecules, and temperature?\n4:10\nWell, we've seen this many, many times.\n4:12\nIt's the Ideal Gas Law.\n4:13\nPressure times volume is equal to the number of moles of our\n4:20\nideal gas-- in this case we're going to use water as our\n4:24\nideal gas, or vapor as our ideal gas-- times the\n4:29\nuniversal gas constant times temperature.\n4:32\nAnd this should never seem like some bizarre formula to\n4:35\nyou because it really, really makes sense.\n4:37\nIf your pressure goes up, then that means that either the\n4:42\nnumber of molecules have gone up, and we're assuming the\n4:44\nvolume is constant.\n4:45\nThat means either the number of molecules have gone up,\n4:48\nwhich makes sense-- more things bouncing onto the side\n4:50\nof the container.\n4:51\nOr your temperature has gone up-- the same number of\n4:53\nthings, but they're bumping with higher kinetic energy.\n4:56\nOr if your pressure stays the same and your volume goes up,\n5:01\nthen that also means that your number of molecules went up,\n5:04\nor your temperature went up.\n5:05\nBecause you now have a bigger container.\n5:06\nIn order to exert the same pressure you need either more\n5:09\nmolecules or more kinetic energy for the molecules you\n5:12\nhave.\n5:12\nAnd you could keep playing around with this, but I just\n5:14\nwant to make it clear this isn't some mysterious formula.\n5:16\nThe first time I was exposed to this I kind of did view it\n5:18\nas some type of mysterious formula.\n5:20\nBut it's just relating pressure, volume, number of\n5:22\nmolecules and temperature.\n5:23\nAnd then this is just the universal gas constant.\n5:29\nSo let's just get everything into the right units here.\n5:32\nAnd then what we're trying to solve for, we want to figure\n5:34\nout the number of molecules of water.\n5:36\nSo we want to solve for n.\n5:40\nAnd if we know the number of moles of water, we can figure\n5:44\nout the number of grams of water.\n5:46\nAnd then given the density of water we can figure out the\n5:48\nnumber of milliliters of water we are dealing with.\n5:52\nSo let's just rewrite the Ideal Gas Law by dividing both\n5:57\nsides by the universal gas constant and temperature.\n6:00\nSo that you get n is equal to pressure times volume, over\n6:07\nthe universal gas constant times temperature.\n6:10\nNow, the hardest thing about this is just making sure you\n6:13\nhave your units right and you're using the right ideal\n6:15\ngas constant for the right units, and we'll\n6:17\ndo that right here.\n6:18\nSo what I want to do, because the universal gas constant\n6:24\nthat I have is in terms of atmospheres, we need to figure\n6:27\nout this vapor pressuree- this equilibrium pressure between\n6:30\nvapor and liquid-- we need to write this down in terms of\n6:33\natmospheres.\n6:35\nSo let me write this down.\n6:36\nSo the vapor pressure is equal to 23.8\n6:47\nmillimeters of mercury.\n6:51\nAnd you can look it up at a table if you don't have this\n6:55\nin your brain.\n6:55\nOne atmosphere is equivalent to 760 millimeters of mercury.\n7:06\nSo if we wanted to write the vapor pressure as\n7:09\natmospheres-- let me get my calculator out, get the\n7:12\ncalculator out, put it right over there-- so it's going to\n7:15\nbe 23.8 times 1 over 760, or just divided by 760.\n7:24\nAnd we have three significant digits, so\n7:27\nit looks like 0.0313.\n7:31\nSo this is equal to 0.0313 atmospheres.\n7:40\nThat is our vapor pressure.\n7:41\nSo let's just deal with this right here.\n7:43\nSo the number of molecules of water that are going to be in\n7:46\nthe air in the gaseous state, in the vapor state, is going\n7:49\nto be equal to our vapor pressure.\n7:51\nThat's our equilibrium pressure.\n7:55\nIf more water molecules evaporate after that point,\n7:59\nthen we're going to have a higher pressure, which will\n8:01\nactually make them favor more of them going into the liquid\n8:04\nstate, so we'll go kind of past the equilibrium, which is\n8:06\nnot likely.\n8:07\nOr another way to think about it-- more water molecules are\n8:10\nnot going to of evaporate at a faster rate than they are\n8:12\ngoing to condense beyond that pressure.\n8:15\nAnyway, the pressure here is 0.0313 atmospheres.\n8:22\nThe volume here-- they told us right over here-- so that's\n8:26\nthe volume-- 4.25.\n8:28\n4.25 times 10 to the fourth liters.\n8:35\nAnd then we want to divide that by-- and you want to make\n8:37\nsure that your universal gas constant has the right units,\n8:40\nI just looked mine up on Wikipedia-- 0.08-- see\n8:46\neverything has three significant digits.\n8:48\nSo let me just allow that more significant digits and we'll\n8:51\njust round at the end.\n8:52\n0.082057, and the units here are liters atmospheres per\n9:07\nmole at kelvin.\n9:12\nAnd this makes sense.\n9:13\nThis liter will cancel out with that liter.\n9:14\nThat atmospheres cancels out with that atmospheres.\n9:17\nI'm about to multiply it by temperature\n9:19\nright here in kelvin.\n9:21\nWe'll cancel out there.\n9:22\nAnd then we'll have a 1 over moles in the denominator.\n9:24\nA 1 over moles in the denominator will just be a\n9:27\nmoles because you're going to invert it again.\n9:29\nSo that gives us our answer in moles.\n9:31\nAnd so finally our temperature-- and you've got\n9:33\nto remember you've got to do it in kelvin.\n9:35\nSo 25 degrees Celsius-- let me right it over here-- 25\n9:39\ndegrees Celsius is equal to, you just add 273 to it, so\n9:44\nthis is equal to 298 kelvin.\n9:52\nSo times 298 kelvin.\n9:56\nAnd now we just have to calculate this.\n9:58\nSo let's do that.\n10:02\nSo let me clear this out.\n10:04\nSo we have-- let me use my keyboard-- so 0.0313\n10:10\natmospheres times 4.25 times 10 to the fourth.\n10:21\nThat e just means times 10 to the fourth.\n10:24\nThat's just the way that it works on this calculator.\n10:27\nAnd then divided by 0.082057 divided by-- actually, just to\n10:39\nmake it clear, let me show you that I'm dividing by this\n10:41\nwhole thing, so let me insert some parentheses right here.\n10:50\nSo in the denominator we also are multiplying by 298.\n10:53\nAnd let me close the parentheses.\n10:58\nAnd then we get 54.4.\n11:02\nWe only have three significant digits.\n11:03\nSo this is equal to 54.4 moles.\n11:10\nAnd we could see this liters cancels out with that liters.\n11:13\nKelvin cancels out with kelvin.\n11:15\nAtmospheres with atmospheres.\n11:16\nYou have a 1 over mole in the denominator.\n11:18\nSo then 1 over 1 over moles is just going to be moles.\n11:24\nNow, this is going to be 54.4 moles of water vapor in the\n11:29\nroom to have our vapor pressure.\n11:32\nIf more evaporates, then more will condense-- we will be\n11:36\nbeyond our equilibrium.\n11:37\nSo we won't ever have more than this amount\n11:40\nevaporate in that room.\n11:41\nSo let's figure out how much liquid water that actually is.\n11:47\nLet me do it over here.\n11:48\nSo 54.4 moles-- let me write it down-- moles of H2O.\n11:59\nThat's going to be in its vapor form and\n12:00\nits going to evaporate.\n12:01\nBut let's figure out how many grams that is.\n12:04\nSo what is the molar mass of water?\n12:08\nWell, it's roughly 18.\n12:10\nI actually figured it out exactly.\n12:11\nIt's actually 18.01 if you actually use the exact numbers\n12:16\non the periodic table, at least one that I used.\n12:18\nSo we could say that there's 18.01 grams of H2O for every 1\n12:28\nmole of H2O.\n12:30\nAnd obviously, you can just look up the atomic weight of\n12:33\nhydrogen, which is a little bit over 1, and the atomic\n12:36\nweight of oxygen, which is a little bit below 16.\n12:38\nSo you have two of these.\n12:40\nSo 2 plus 16 gives you pretty close to 18.\n12:43\nSo this right here will tell you the grams of water that\n12:47\ncan evaporate to get us to that equilibrium pressure.\n12:51\nSo let's get the calculator out.\n12:53\nSo we have the 54.4 times 18.01 is equal to 970-- well,\n13:05\nwe only have three significant digits-- so 900, if your round\n13:07\nthis 0.7, it becomes 980.\n13:10\nSo this is 980 grams of H2O needs to evaporate for us to\n13:17\nget to our equilibrium pressure,\n13:19\nto our vapor pressure.\n13:20\nSo let's figure out how many milliliters of water this is.\n13:24\nSo they tell us the density of water right here.\n13:27\n0.997-- let me do this in a darker color-- 0.997 grams per\n13:33\nmillileter.\n13:34\nOr another way you could view this is for everyone 1\n13:39\nmilliliter you have 0.997 grams of water\n13:49\nat 25 degrees Celsius.\n13:52\nSo for every milliliter-- this is grams per milliliter-- we\n13:55\nwant milliliters per gram because we want this and this\n13:58\nto cancel out.\n13:59\nSo we're essentially just going to divide 980 by 0.997.\n14:04\nSo what is that?\n14:05\nGet the calculator out.\n14:06\nSo we have 980-- not cover up our work-- divided by 0.997 is\n14:16\nequal to 980-- we'll just round this-- 983.\n14:21\nSo this is equal to 983.\n14:25\nThis and this canceled out, or that and that canceled out.\n14:29\nSo 983 milliliters of H2O.\n14:32\nSo we've figured out, using the Ideal Gas Law, that at 25\n14:38\ndegrees Celsius, which was 298 kelvin, that 983 milliliters\n14:44\nof H2O will evaporate to get us to our\n14:47\nequilibrium vapor pressure.\n14:50\nNothing more will evaporate, because beyond that if we have\n14:53\nhigher pressure than that, then you'll also have more\n14:57\nvapor going to the liquid state.\n14:58\nBecause you'll have more stuff bouncing here.\n15:01\nSo if this much volume of water evaporates, we'll have\n15:07\nthe state where just as much is evaporating as just as much\n15:11\nis condensing.\n15:11\nSo you will never get to a higher pressure than that at\n15:16\nthat temperature.\n15:18\nSo going back to the question, we figured out that 983\n15:21\nmilliliters of water will evaporate.\n15:23\nThe question was is that we placed 2 liters of water in an\n15:26\nopen container.\n15:28\nSo we just figured out that only 983 milliliters of that--\n15:31\nso that's a little bit less than a liter.\n15:34\nSo this is a little bit less than 1,000 milliliters, and\n15:40\nthis is 1 liter.\n15:41\nSo a little bit less than half of this will evaporate for us\n15:47\nto get to our vapor pressure.\n15:48\nSo to answer our question-- will all of the water\n15:50\nevaporate at 25 degrees Celsius?\n15:52\nNo-- if we're assuming the room is sealed-- well, no, all\n15:55\nof it will not.\n15:56\nOnly a little bit less than half of it will.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nI've been wanting to make a video on a couple of terms\n0:03\nthat people have really thrown around for a while now.\n0:06\nAnd I think it really hits the core of some of the issues\n0:09\nwe're dealing with now with the credit debacle but it's\n0:11\nkind of at a deeper level.\n0:13\nSo the things I want to go over are the ideas of savings,\n0:20\nconsumption, and investment.\n0:28\nAnd you hear these a lot.\n0:29\nEveryone obviously says, I've invested in the stock market\n0:31\nor I've invested in a house and I really want to give you\n0:34\na framework for how I think about these ideas.\n0:38\nAnd frankly, I haven't seen them depicted this way in any\n0:44\neconomics book, although they've kind of touched on\n0:46\nthis, but I think this is really how you should think\n0:48\nabout these things.\n0:49\nSo if you save money, and I think we all know what that\n0:52\nmeans, that's money that you didn't spend, there's a couple\n0:54\nof things that you can do with it.\n0:56\nYou can either consume your money or you\n0:58\ncould invest your money.\n1:00\nSo, let's just think about a bunch of different situations\n1:02\nand think about whether those things are consumption or\n1:07\ninvestment.\n1:08\nSo let's say, I have $100,000 that I'm dealing with.\n1:15\nSo let's say, I take that $100,000\n1:17\nand I build a factory.\n1:23\nAnd I think that that factory is going to be able to\n1:26\nproduce-- I'll make up some product-- it'll be able to\n1:29\nproduce cars more efficiently and cheaper than any other car\n1:33\nfactory out there.\n1:35\nWell, I think we'd all agree that this is an investment.\n1:39\nAnd why is it an investment?\n1:42\nBecause I'm taking this $100,000 and I'm putting it to\n1:46\nsome use that is creating, hopefully, more value than my\n1:50\noriginal $100,000.\n1:52\nIn fact, I'm expecting some type of a return on this\n1:55\ninvestment.\n1:55\nAnd I've made a bunch of videos on what a return on\n1:58\ninvestment is, and you can usually quantify it.\n2:00\nIf I take a $100,000 and I build this factory and this\n2:03\nfactory spits out $50,000 a year, it's probably creating\n2:08\nat least $50,000 a year value, assuming that nothing corrupt\n2:12\nis happening in our system.\n2:13\nIn fact, it's normally creating more than $50,000 a\n2:16\nyear of value.\n2:16\nIt may be creating a $100,000 a year of value and $50,000 of\n2:20\nthat may be going to the person who's doing the\n2:22\nproduction and then the other half of the value is actually\n2:25\ngoing to the consumer of whatever\n2:27\nthis factory is making.\n2:28\nAnd you have to think about it, because if all of the\n2:30\nvalue went to the person who produced the factory then\n2:33\nthere's not a huge incentive for someone to use his\n2:35\nproducts anymore.\n2:36\nBut anyway, that's not the topic of discussion.\n2:38\nWe're just trying to get at a mental framework on what\n2:41\nconsumption is versus investment.\n2:43\nSo I think we all agree that if I were to build a factory\n2:46\nthat this is-- let's say I'll do everything in green as\n2:49\ninvestment.\n2:51\nSo building a factory is an investment.\n2:55\nNow let's say that I'm homeless\n3:00\nand I have this $100,000.\n3:01\nAnd because I'm homeless, I don't have a place to go and\n3:05\neat dinner and rest and relax.\n3:08\nBecause I don't have that, I can't get a job and I can't\n3:11\nbecome a productive member of society.\n3:13\nSo maybe, I'm going to use this $100,000 to buy a simple\n3:17\nhouse that meets all of my needs.\n3:19\nLet's say build a simple house, and I'll do that in a\n3:22\nneutral color.\n3:31\nThis is my other use of this $100,000, instead of building\n3:34\na factory, I'm going to build a simple house.\n3:36\nAnd this house, it provides shelter for me and my family,\n3:39\nit allows us that security that now my kids can go to\n3:43\nschool and they can themselves become\n3:45\nmore productive citizens.\n3:46\nI now have an address.\n3:49\nI have a place to take a shower, that allows me to go\n3:51\nget a job and I can now create value for society as a whole,\n3:55\ninstead of being on the corner and begging\n3:58\nfor money from people.\n4:00\nI would argue that this is also an investment.\n4:02\nWhy is it?\n4:03\nBecause I'm taking this $100,000, that maybe I had or\n4:06\nsomeone gave to me, and it's generating a return.\n4:10\nAnd what is that return?\n4:11\nWell, with a factory, it's maybe a\n4:12\nlittle easier to quantify.\n4:13\nBut at minimum, it's this work that I'm able to do because I\n4:17\nnow have a house.\n4:17\nBecause I have the security, I have the address.\n4:19\nI have the shelter.\n4:20\nI'm able to relax.\n4:21\nIt's that security and it's also the return that probably\n4:24\nmy kids are going to be able to now contribute to society.\n4:27\nMaybe if they grew up homeless, they would have\n4:29\nnever been able to contribute.\n4:30\nAnd now that they have a roof over their head, and are able\n4:33\nto go to school, et cetera, they are going to be able to\n4:35\ngive some economic value back to society.\n4:38\nIt's hard to value, maybe I didn't have any job before and\n4:40\nnow I have a job and I can contribute\n4:42\n$30,000 a year to society.\n4:45\nMaybe I'm working at someone's factory.\n4:47\nMaybe I'm providing some other-- maybe\n4:49\nI'm a farmer now.\n4:50\nWhatever, I'm providing some source of value.\n4:52\nAnd maybe my kids-- if they never got an education, they\n4:54\nwould have maybe added $10,000 of value per year to people\n4:59\nand now they can add $20,000 of value.\n5:01\nSo that difference would also be some of the return on this\n5:03\ninvestment.\n5:04\nSo I also consider this to be an investment.\n5:09\nNow, my question to you is, let's say that I already had a\n5:12\nhouse-- so this is an investment.\n5:15\nLet's say I already had a house and my family is happy\n5:17\nand we have everything we need.\n5:20\nWe have food on the table and my kids go to school and I'm\n5:23\nable to get a job and all of that exists.\n5:26\nBut let's say, I still have a $100,000 and I use that\n5:30\n$100,000-- I'll do it in yellow-- to put in some\n5:40\ngranite counter tops.\n5:44\nI have some money left over, let's say, I'm going to add a\n5:46\nbathroom to my house and I will put the latest hardwood\n5:55\nfloors, so that my family will be impressed.\n6:00\nYou can imagine.\n6:01\nAnd maybe I add 2,000 square feet.\n6:04\nYou normally can't get all that for a $100,000 but I\n6:06\nthink you'll bear with me.\n6:08\nSo I'm essentially doing some major home improvements.\n6:11\nSo my question to you is-- is this an investment or is this\n6:15\nconsumption?\n6:16\nNow, in our everyday world, with most people we deal with,\n6:20\nthey will call this investment in my house.\n6:22\nAnd why are they saying that?\n6:23\nBecause they say, by spending a $100,000 in the house in\n6:26\nthis way, that maybe-- if you watch the Home and Garden\n6:30\nchannel, they're doing this all the time-- that if you\n6:32\npour this a $100,000 into your house, that maybe the value of\n6:36\nyour house is going to increase by $150,000.\n6:39\nOr someone else, all of a sudden, is going to perceive\n6:41\nthe value of your house as being $150,000.\n6:44\nThey'll say, well, you got a $50,000 return on investment.\n6:48\nI'd argue that that is not investment.\n6:50\nThat it's speculation.\n6:52\nYou are, essentially, piling money into this stuff-- and\n6:56\nI'll do this in red, consumption is red.\n7:02\nWhat's happening here truly economically?\n7:05\nWhen you add granite, or you add an extra bathroom or\n7:08\nhardwood floors or this extra 2,000 square feet, is it\n7:11\nmaking anyone who's living in that house more productive?\n7:14\nIs it making you harder working; is it making you more\n7:16\nlikely to invent the cure for cancer, or more likely to\n7:20\ninvent a way of getting cheap energy, or\n7:26\nproduce more widgets?\n7:27\nNo, it's just, if anything, providing more things for you\n7:31\nto have to take care of, that you're not going to be able to\n7:34\nfocus as much on your work.\n7:35\nOr more energy is going to have to be extended to\n7:37\nmaintain this type of place, to heat and cool a 2,000\n7:41\nsquare foot house.\n7:42\nSo if anything, by actually pouring the $100,000 here,\n7:46\nyou're actually creating something that is going to\n7:47\nsuck more out of society.\n7:49\nIn fact, in no way is this going to contribute to the\n7:52\ncollective wealth of society.\n7:53\nThe last two examples I gave contribute to the collective\n7:56\nwealth society, some of which you share, and that is your\n7:59\nreturn on the investment.\n8:00\nBut as a whole, this is an investment into society.\n8:02\nAnd it's going to make the pie bigger.\n8:07\nThis right here, does not make the pie bigger.\n8:09\nIt might make you a little bit happier, make your ego feel a\n8:12\nlittle bit better, let your pride grow, and your self\n8:15\nrighteousness grow, and show other people that you've\n8:18\narrived, but it's not going to increase\n8:21\nthe wealth of society.\n8:22\nAnd when you say that you've invested, you are really just\n8:24\nsaying I've speculated.\n8:26\nWhat you're saying is-- by paying this $100,000, you're\n8:29\ngoing to find, essentially, a greater fool out there.\n8:33\nThey could have done the same thing, they could have bought\n8:34\nyour house, spent $100,000 and done this, if this is what\n8:38\nwould have made them happy.\n8:39\nBut what you're saying is, essentially, that you're going\n8:42\nto find somebody out there who's willing to pay $150,000\n8:45\nextra for something that should\n8:47\nhave only cost $100,000.\n8:48\nAnd in fact, if anything, if you use this at all, the value\n8:51\nof this is going to

are\n9:00\ngoing to be the taste someone else would like.\n9:01\nI would actually argue that when you customize your house\n9:04\nin this way, you are creating $100,000 of consumption to\n9:08\nyour taste.\n9:09\nAnd I'd be surprised if someone else, truly, is\n9:12\nwilling to pay more than $100,000 unless they're being,\n9:15\nin some way, irrational or they can finance this because\n9:18\nit's part of the mortgage.\n9:22\nAnyway, this is, I think, just the big picture: investment\n9:27\nadds value to society.\n9:29\nA simple house adds value to society.\n9:31\nConsumption is something where people might call it an\n9:36\ninvestment because it's kind of speculation.\n9:38\nOne might find some other guy willing to emotionally pay\n9:41\nmore for something.\n9:42\nBut it's money that's burned; it's not creating more value\n9:46\nfor society.\n9:47\nI continue this in the next video.",

    "question_type": "multiple-choices",
    "source_material": "Hi, I’m John Green. This is Crash Course\nWorld History and today we’re going to talk\nabout World War II. Finally, a war with some\ncolor film! So, here at Crash Course we try to make\nhistory reasonably entertaining, and fortunately,\nWorld War II was hilarious...said no one ever.\nMr. Green, Mr. Green! Is this, like, gonna\nbe one of the unfunny ones where you build\nto the big melodramatic conclusion about how\nI have to imagine the world more complexly?\nMe from the Past, as long as you have that\neighth rate soup-strainer, I’m not even\ngoing to acknowledge your existence.\n[theme music]\nRight, so you’ve probably heard a lot about\nWorld War II from movies and books, The History\nChannel, before it decided that Swamp People\nwere History, the incessant droning of your\ngrandparents, etc. We’re not gonna try to\ngive you a detailed synopsis of the war today.\nInstead, we’re going to try to give a bit\nof perspective on how the most destructive\nwar in human history happened, and why it\nstill matters globally.\nSo one of the reasons history classes tend\nto be really into wars is that they’re easy\nto put on tests. They start on one day and\nthey end on another day. And they’re caused\nby social, political, and economic conditions\nthat can be examined in a multiple choice\nkind of manner. Except, not really.\nLike, when did World War II start? In September\n1939, when the Nazis invaded Poland? I’d\nsay no - it actually started when Japan invaded\nManchuria in 1931, or at the very latest when\nthe Japanese invaded China in 1937, because\nthey didn’t stop fighting until 1945. Then again,\nyou could also argue 1933, when Hitler took power, or\n1941, when America started fighting. It’s complicated.\nBut anyway, in China the fighting was very\nbrutal, as exemplified by the infamous rape\nof Nanking, which featured the slaughter of\nhundreds of thousands of Chinese people and\nis still so controversial today that:\n1. It affects relations between Japan &amp;amp; China\nand\n2. Even though I have not described it in\ndetail, you can rest assured that there will be angry\ncomments about my use of the word “slaughter.”\nBut the World War II we know the most about\nfrom movies and TV is primarily the war in\nthe European theater, the one that Adolf Hitler\nstarted. Hitler is the rare individual who\nreally did make history - specifically he\nmade it worse - and if he hadn’t existed,\nit’s very unlikely that World War II would’ve\never happened. But he did exist, and after\ncoming to power in 1933, with the standard\nrevolutionary promises to return the homeland\nto its former glory, infused with quite a\nbit of paranoia and anti-Semitism, Germany\nsaw rapid re-militarization and eventually,\ninevitably, war.\nIn the beginning, it was characterized by\na new style of combat made possible by the\nmechanized technology of tanks, airplanes,\nand especially, trucks. This was the Blitzkrieg,\na devastating tactic combining quick movement\nof troops, tanks, and massive use of air power\nto support infantry movements. And in the\nvery early years of the war, it was extremely\neffective. The Nazis were able to roll over\nPoland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands,\nand then all of France, all within about 9 months\nbetween the fall of 1939 and the summer of 1940.\nSo after knocking out most of central Europe,\nthe Nazis set their sights on Great Britain,\nbut they didn’t invade the island, choosing\ninstead to attack it with massive air strikes.\nI mean, you look at this poster and think,\n“Man, the Queen wants me to finish my term\npaper, so I can do it,” but when this poster\nwas first produced in 1939, it was to quell\nterror in the face of bombardment.\nThe Battle of Britain was a duel between the\nRoyal Air Force and the Luftwaffe, and while\nthe RAF denied the Nazis total control of\nBritish airspace, the Nazis were still able\nto bomb Great Britain over and over again\nin what’s known as the Blitz. STAN, NO.\nNO JOKES this time. Yes, the Blitz.\nMeanwhile, Europeans were also fighting each\nother in North Africa. The Desert campaigns\nstarted in 1940 and lasted through 1942 - this\nis where British general “Monty” Montgomery\noutfoxed German general Irwin “the Desert\nFox” Rommel. It’s also the place where\nAmericans first fought Nazis in large numbers.\nBut most importantly, it’s where Indiana\nJones discovered the Ark of the Covenant.\nOkay, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.\n1941 was a big year for World War II. First,\nthe Nazis invaded Russia, breaking a non-aggression\npact that the two powers had signed in 1939.\nThis hugely escalated the war, and also made\nallies of the most powerful capitalist countries\nand the most powerful communist one, an alliance\nthat would stand the test of time and never end... until\nlike three seconds after the defeat of the Nazis.\nThe Nazi invasion of Russia opened the war\nup on the so-called Eastern Front, although\nif you were Russian, it was the Western Front,\nand it led to millions of deaths, mostly Russian.\nAlso, 1941 saw a day that would \"live in infamy\"\nwhen the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, hoping\nthat such an audacious attack would frighten\nthe United States into staying neutral, which\nwas a pretty stupid gamble because:\n1. The U.S. was already giving massive aid\nto the Allies and was hardly neutral and\n2. The United States is not exactly famed\nfor its pacifism or political neutrality.\n1941 also saw Japan invading much of Southeast\nAsia, which made Australia and New Zealand\nunderstandably nervous. As part of the British\ncommonwealth, they were already involved in\nthe war, but now they could fight the Japanese\ncloser to home. And shut up about how I never\ntalk about you Australians. I just gave you\n1.5 sentences.\nBut by the time the Americans and Australians\nstarted fighting the Japanese, it was already\na World War. Sometimes this meant fighting\nor starving or being bombed; other times,\nit meant production for the war - you don’t\nthink of Argentina as being a World War II\npowerhouse, for instance, but they were vital\nto the Allies, supplying 40% of British meat\nduring World War II. Thanks, Thought Bubble.\nSo, not to sound jingoistic, but the entry\nof the U.S. into the war really did change\neverything, although I doubt the Nazis could’ve\ntaken Russia regardless. No one conquers Russia\nin the wintertime, unless you are - wait for\nit - the Mongols.\nOkay, we’re going to skip most of the big\nbattles of 1942 - like the Battle of Midway,\nwhich effectively ended Japan’s chance of\nwinning the war - and focus on the Battle\nof Stalingrad. The German attack on Stalingrad,\nnow known as Volgograd because Stalin sucks,\nwas one of the bloodiest battles in the history\nof war, with more than two million dead. The\nGermans began by dropping more than 1,000\ntons of bombs on Stalingrad, and then the\nRussians responded by “hugging” the Germans,\nstaying as close to their front lines as possible\nso that German air support would kill Germans\nand Russians alike.\nThis kind of worked, although the Germans\nstill took most of the city. But then, a Soviet\ncounterattack left the sixth army of the Nazis\ncompletely cut off. And after that, due partly\nto Hitler’s overreaching megalomania and\npartly to lots of people being scared of him,\nthe sixth army slowly froze and starved to\ndeath before finally surrendering. And of\nthe 91,000 Axis POWs from Stalingrad, only\nabout 6,000 ever returned home.\nStalingrad turned the war in Europe and by\n1944, the American strategy of “island hopping”\nin the Pacific was taking GIs closer and closer\nto Japan. Rome was liberated in June by Americans\nand Canadians; and the successful British,\nCanadian, and American D-Day invasion of Normandy\nwas the beginning of the end for the Nazis.\nOh, it’s time for the Open Letter?\nAn Open Letter to Canada. But first, let’s\nsee what’s in the secret compartment today.\nOh, it’s Canadian mittens. I wanna thank\nthe Canadian Crash Course fans, who sent us\nthese mittens. Canadians are just so nice,\nStan. Like, all we ever do on this show is\nmake fun of them, and they’re just like, “It’s so\nkind of you to mention us. Here’s some mittens!”\nDear Canada, We’re not always nice to you here on\nCrash Course, but you are awesome. I’m pointing,\nbut you can’t tell because I’m wearing\nmittens. 45,000 Canadians died fighting for\nthe Allies in World War II, which means that, per capita,\nCanada lost more people than the United States.\nYou fought with the Royal Air Force to defend\nGreat Britain from the beginning of the war\nand you were there on D-Day, successfully\ninvading Juno Beach. And, as many of you have\npointed out in comments, you defeated the\nUnited States in the War of 1812, meaning\nthat, arguably, Canada, you are the greater\nmilitary power.\nPlus, you have lumberjacks, and excellent\nbeer, and hockey, and universal healthcare,\nand Justin Bieber. I’m jealous! That's what\nit is - I'm jealous!\nBest Wishes, John Green.\nSo, by the end of 1944, the Allies were advancing\nfrom the West and the Russian Red Army was\nadvancing from the East and then, the last-ditch\nGerman offensive at the battle of the Bulge\nin the winter of 1944-1945 failed. Mussolini\nwas executed in April of 1945. Hitler committed\nsuicide at the end of that month. And, on\nMay 8, 1945 the Allies declared victory in\nEurope after Germany surrendered unconditionally.\nThree months later, the United States dropped\nthe only two nuclear weapons ever deployed\nin war, Japan surrendered, and World War II\nwas over.\nThe war had a definite cause: unbridled military\nexpansion by Germany, Japan, and, to a small\nextent, Italy. Now, it’s easy to claim that\nHitler was crazy or evil, and, in fact, he\nwas certainly both, but that doesn’t explain\nthe Nazis decision to invade Russia, and it\nsure doesn’t explain Japan’s decision\nto bomb Pearl Harbor.\nAnd there are many possible explanations beyond\nmere evil; but the most interesting one, to\nme, involves food. Hitler had a number of\nreasons for wanting to expand Germany’s\nterritory, but he often talked about Lebensraum\nor living space for the German people. German\nagriculture was really inefficiently organized\ninto lots of small farms, and that meant that\nGermany needed a lot of land in order to be\nself-sufficient in food production.\nThe plan was to take Poland, the Ukraine,\nand Eastern Russia, and then resettle that\nland with lots of Germans, so that it could\nfeed German people. This was called the Hunger\nPlan because the plan called for 20 million\npeople to starve to death. Many would be the\nPoles, Ukrainians, and Russians who’d previously\nlived on the land. The rest would be Europe’s\nJews, who would be worked to death.\nSix million Jews were killed by the Nazis,\nmany by starvation, but many through a chillingly\nplanned effort of extermination in death camps.\nThese death camps can be distinguished from\nconcentration camps or labor camps in that\ntheir primary purpose was extermination of\nJews, Roma people, communists, homosexuals,\ndisabled people, and others that the Nazis\ndeemed unfit. Some historians believe that\nthe Nazis opened the death camps because the\nJews weren’t dying as fast as The Hunger\nPlan had intended.\nThis was a sickening plan, but it made a kind\nof demented sense. Rather than becoming more\ninvolved in global trade, as the British had,\nthe Germans would feed themselves by taking\nland and killing the people who’d previously\nlived there.\nSimilarly, Japan, at the beginning of the\nwar, was suffering from an acute fear of food\nshortage because its agricultural sector was\nhaving trouble keeping up with population\ngrowth. And the Japanese too, sought to expand\ntheir agricultural holdings by, for instance,\nresettling farmers in Korea.\nSo while it’s tempting to say that World\nWar II was about the Allies fighting for democratic\nideals against the totalitarian militaristic\nimperialism of the fascist Axis powers, it\njust doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. For instance,\na hugely important Allied power, Stalin’s\nSoviet Union, was, like, the least democratic\nplace, ever. Stan just said that was hyperbole,\nbut it’s not. Stalin’s Soviet Union is\ntied with all of the other completely undemocratic\ncountries for last place on the democracy\nscale. It’s a big community there, at last\nplace, but they’re definitely in there somewhere.\nAnd, by far, the biggest imperialists of the\nwar were the British. They couldn’t have\nfed or clothed themselves - or resisted the\nNazis - without their colonies and commonwealth.\nSo, why is World War II so important? Well\nfirst, it proved the old Roman adage homo homini\nlupus: Man is a wolf to man. This is seen most clearly\nin the Holocaust, but all the statistics are staggering.\nMore than a million Indian British subjects\ndied, mainly due to famine that could have\nbeen avoided if the British had redistributed\nfood. And their failure to do so helped convince\nIndians that the so-called superior civilization\nof the British was a sham. More than a million\nVietnamese died, mainly due to famine. 418,000\nAmericans. More than a million noncombatants\nin both Germany and Japan. And 20 million\npeople in the Soviet Union, most of them civilians.\nThese civilians were targeted because they\nhelped sustain the war, mostly through industrial\nand agricultural production. In a total war,\nwhen a nation is at war, not just its army,\nthere is no such thing as a non-military target.\nFrom the firebombing of Dresden to Tokyo to\nHiroshima, the line between soldier and civilian\nblurred.\nAnd then, of course, there is the Holocaust,\nwhich horrifies us because the elements of\nWestern progress - record-keeping, industrial\nproduction, technology - were used to slaughter\nmillions. World War II saw modern industrial\nnations, which represented the best of the\nEnlightenment and the Scientific Revolution,\ndescend into once unimaginable cruelty.\nAnd what makes World War II such a historical\nwatershed is that in its wake, all of us - in\nthe West or otherwise - were forced to question\nwhether Western dominance of this planet could,\nor should, be considered progress.\nThanks for watching.

He is totally different from most of the people\n0:15\nthat we talk to. He gained his fame on Youtube of all places\n0:18\nwhere people go to see how he explains things\n0:21\nthat many of us frankly don't understand. so, let's start with the basics\n0:24\nSal Khan, thanks for being with us from Khan Academy by the way.\n0:31\nBasic question, explain to our\n0:33\nviewers, explain to the million people out there. what is actually\n0:36\nbroken that we need to fix. Right! right now\n0:41\nwe have so many, stock market goes down every day and people having for\n0:45\nclosures and banks are stopping lending. so\n0:49\nit is really hard for the people to keep track what is the problem. Are these causes of the problems\n0:51\nor they the actual problems. so i think we did a step back to a durdle diagram here\n0:59\nlet's put it up, durdle diagram here and i think there is\n1:01\nthis basic fundamental question here that we all have to ask\n1:05\nis what does the financial system do? they make a lot of money. hopefully,\n1:09\nthey add some value to our economy and this diagram essentially\n1:13\nexplains what the financial system does. so in a\n1:16\ncapitalist economy you have a lot of people with capital that could be land, that could be gold\n1:19\nthat could be animals,that could be cash\n1:26\nand what you need to do in order to make the economy grow is to\n1:29\ninvest that capital into projects, build factories\n1:33\nplough seeds,hire people and what the financial system\n1:37\ndoes. the banks and the markets, they take that capital\n1:41\nand hopefully they allocate it on projects that put people to\n1:46\nwork, hire people, grow our GDP. The problem right now\n1:50\nis, as opposed to financial system putting more capital\n1:54\ninto the real world, it's more concerned with\n1:58\nself-preservation at the moment. they are in a kind of survival mode and because they\n2:00\nare in survival mode, you don't have this flow of capital going from\n2:06\nwhoever has it to the financial system and then to the projects.you pretty much have everything\n2:10\njust going back into the financial system because it's\n2:13\nessentially in survival mode. so, i see\n2:17\nthe financial system in the middle why is that piece broken\n2:22\nDraw that one up first. sure, and here i am going to\n2:27\nattempt to get everyone to a five-minute MBA\n2:30\nbut essentially what i have drawn here are balance sheet for some banks\n2:34\nand it might sound like a complicated term but a balance sheet is, i think something\n2:38\nthat most people are fairly familiar with when they talk about the home equity so\n2:42\nif i will draw a balance sheet for someone's house it would look something like this\n2:46\nso the asset would be your house\n2:51\nwhatever its worth and then your liability and would call 'A' for asset\n2:53\nand then your liability would be the mortgage\n2:56\nyour liability would be the loan. now if your house is\n3:02\nworth of a million dollars and your loan let's say you owe\n3:06\n$8,000 in your loan whatever is leftover is your\n3:10\nequity, that's the balance sheet which most people are\n3:14\nfairly familiar with. The corporations have exact same notion\n3:18\nand i think it's the important point to realise when people talk about the stock market and\n3:22\nwhat does it mean a company starts to go to zero. when you\n3:26\nbuy a stock in a company you essentially are not buying a share in all of its assets,\n3:29\nyou are buying a share in its equity so,if you look at the\n3:35\ntwo banks and i would talk about more what is broken\n3:38\nbut a bank has assets and a bank has liabilities\n3:43\nfor which you take some of the assets and you subtract the liabilities what's leftover\n3:47\nis essentially is the equity and you buy stock in a bank or in any company\n3:51\nyou essentially are taking a share of that so what's broken here\n3:55\nis through the housing bubble a lot of these banks in order to\n3:58\nfacilitate this whole securitization, i can go into more detail what that is\n4:03\nessentially accumulated these assets on their balance sheets and this\n4:07\nhas been the central focus of the entire bailout plan and\n4:11\nthere has been a lot of talk about Toxic CDOs and what are they\n4:14\ni just wanna show what they do to a bank's balance sheet and why it's so important\n4:18\nthat we figure out what these things are worth because what you see here i drew\n4:24\nthe kind of height on this left hand side of the asset, the height's right hand side\n4:27\nis liability, what's leftover is equity. if these Toxic CDOs\n4:31\nare worth nothing if this disappeared and then all of a sudden\n4:36\nyour assets are less than your liabilities.\n4:39\nif you house is worth less than your mortgage then you have no equity\n4:43\nin that situation your stock would be worthless and in that situation there is no reason why\n4:47\nanyone should be lending to you because you are essentially throwing good money after bad\n4:51\nso essentially, the situation the banks find themselves in is the same\n4:56\nas the as one homeowners would have found themselves in as a result of that.\n5:00\npretty much, as homeowner you have an asset which is worth less than your liability. what you do\n5:03\nyou try to get someone to bail you out and buy your asset for more than its worth\n5:09\nor you just claim bankruptcy. that's all for now, we gonna comeback\n5:12\nin just a little bit and continue our conversation. we will also be bringing you\n5:15\nyou something that is very exclusive to this particular hour\n5:19\non the CNN the story of kerbal, who is kerbal\n5:23\nhe may just be the only person which administration used\n5:26\nas their source for going to war in Iraq or certainly\n5:30\nas much as anyone else. was he right? no,\n5:33\nwho is he? no one knows upto now, an exclusive interview\n5:37\nwith kerbal,stay with us we will be right back\n5:52\ntwitter.com/ricksanchezcnn\n5:54\nso many of you… 23000 i believe when we last checked\n5:58\nare talking to us, watching this newscast as well as on Myspace and facebook\n6:02\ninfact we have somebody on My space righ now. she is watching our show and just wanna us to know this\n6:06\nshe says my son is 17 and excited about college. i am worried that\n6:09\nwe won't be able to get a loan to send him now. My husband hours have been cut from work as well.\n6:14\nThis absolutely affects all of America And that's why we are doing\n6:18\nwhat we are trying to do for you. let's go back now and bring in Sal, if we can, Sal Khan\n6:23\nHe explained to us a few moments ago what it is, that is\n6:26\nactually the problem, what it is that is broken\n6:30\nNow,let's take the next step let's try and understand because everyone seems\n6:35\nto be wondering i don't understand this bailout/rescue plan the government has been in\n6:38\nwhat is the government actually doing, explain that to us\n6:43\nso we can understand like a fifth grader. Right, so the main problem\n6:48\nas to picture wise, no one is lending to each other so what the government at least said\n6:50\nwhat they wanted to do is try to get the lending start again so their bailout plan\n6:55\nwas essentially, let's buyout these Toxic CDOs because if i am a\n7:00\ngood bank they didn't get involved in this. if the bank is holding\n7:04\nthese Toxic CDOs. i am not sure if bank a) should be bankrupt if the Toxic CDOs are\n7:08\nworth nothing or b) may be there are good for the money\n7:11\nso there is a lot of uncertainty of what these are of worth. the government at least what they said\n7:16\nit would do if they went in it will essentially reverse these auctions\n7:20\nand bought these assets. then that all of a sudden would give confidence in these banks.\n7:25\nand there wouldn't be uncertainty as to whether you can loan the money\n7:28\nand may be that will free up the credit the whole system again\n7:32\nwell,will it work? probably not, if you think about what's going to happen psychologically\n7:37\nso bank A let’s say, if you just switch\n7:42\nthese Toxic CDOs and if you just turn that back into cash because the government just bought it\n7:46\nfor exactly what the bank A says it's worth\n7:49\nso if you just turn this into cash, the question is the bank A all of a sudden is going to start lending\n7:55\nand a couple of things to think about because of the size of the Toxic CDOs there are\n7:58\nother things on its balance sheet and frankly, a lot of these things are starting to\n8:03\nget a little bit Toxic. Nobody is talking about them right now because if you have a debt continuing\n8:07\nhow you gonna notice the milks\n8:10\ngoing bad so essentially, you have a lot of assets\n8:13\non your balance sheet right here and if you are a prudent bank manager you are going to see\n8:16\nyou gonna say i will just keep that cash because if turn Toxic\n8:21\nbecause the economy might be turning slow or for whatever reason. i should just hold on to that cash\n8:26\nso that i don't go bankrupt so everyone is in complete survival mode even the good banks\n8:30\nif somehow you would give them capital and process\n8:34\nnew version of the plan then essentially they will inject equity. so buy stock, if you buy stock\n8:36\nyou will essentially make this pile bigger and put some cashier here\n8:44\nbut even this guy, the good bank is not so clear to me\n8:47\nthat he will actually start lending everyone is in survival mode this isn't the time\n8:50\nto make new loans and take on new roles\n8:52\nso it seems like when govt. went in and they decided what we gonna do, we gonna go and help these guys out. as soon as we will help them out\n8:58\neverybody will realize now they have the government backing so other people would be\n9:02\ninterested in helping them. more people would give them their money\n9:06\nthat hasn't worked. the people and other investors haven't\n9:12\ngone into that. when we come back, i wanna hear your idea\n9:15\nof what perhaps the government should have done or could still do\n9:19\nto rescue this. It’s unique it’s different and you and i have talked about this but\n9:24\ni wanna you to be able to show to our viewers. also kerbal\n9:27\nthe story we would have been telling you, this is going to be CNN exclusive to this hour\n9:32\nabout one particular individual who no one has ever talked to before, he speaks German\n9:35\nand Arabic. you will hear his conversation here\n9:39\nin next 10 minutes. be right back\n9:55\nnow we understand what actually is broken. we got a sense that government tried\n10:01\nto do to fix it but it doesn't seem to be working because people/\n10:04\ninvestors and regular folks don't seem to be buying into it.\n10:08\nlet's bring in Sal Khan once again from Khan Academy and talk about\n10:12\nwhat may be done either a) would have been the original plan\n10:16\nit would have worked a lot better or b) something we can still do now and that's.\n10:21\nso the big picture, going back to the big picture, in the financial system\n10:24\nno one is lending through. every bail-out plan so far as governement\n10:29\nkeeps injecting money either through loans\n10:31\neither through buying assets may be more than the worth or may be buying stocks.\n10:36\nand the logic here is that may that will start up the lending\n10:39\nbut most probably any new money\n10:42\nyou put into the system, for the large degree it's going to go into the survival mode\n10:44\nor it's gonna go to essentially make up mistakes which already have been made\n10:49\nso one idea and this actually came from a friend of mine Tard Plusky\n10:53\nit sounded crazy when he first said it but actually sounds like really good idea is, take that\n10:57\n$700 billion, remember the problem isn't you are not trying to save\n11:01\nthe financial system, you are trying to save the pipe, the goal from the capital to projects\n11:06\nso why not take the 700 billion and capitalize the brand new\n11:10\nfinancial system and one thing\n11:14\nthat Tard has pointed out 700 billion is astronomical amount of money\n11:18\nthat's more than the book value of the equity. book equity is this piece, right here\n11:22\non the balance sheet then JP Morgan,Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs,\n11:25\nWashington Mutual, wachovia and Bank of America combine\n11:30\nso government could overnight create banks bigger than those banks and i don't think they should concentrate on these five or six banks\n11:36\nso in other way, you are saying why try and put money\n11:40\ninto something that is so absolutely messed up. if they have dead\n11:44\nlet them die. create a new system altogether and that won't be a problem too\n11:46\nbecause those banks we own by the government, do we want them back? no\n11:53\nand this is the solution and first of all just to make the point clear the policies' current solution\n11:58\ninvolves government ownership, in this plan what you could do\n12:01\ngovernment can capitalize the banks may be 20 or 30 banks around the country with the $700b and then each of\n12:07\nthose banks could have 300 million shares and they give one share to every American\n12:12\nnew banks, totally new banks.. interesting\n12:16\nSal Khan, we will keep you on we gonna be talking about this throughout the hour\n12:20\nobviously, we are trying to get the people who can explain some of these things\n12:25\nwhat's the market doing right now let's have a look as we past weekend.\n12:29\ndown 71 a lot better than what we were looking at an hour ago\n12:32\nmay be you were heard Sal in some piece\n12:35\nhopefully, we gonna come back to that hopefully but obviously one of the key stories we have been serving throughout the day. the story of Kerbal\n12:42\nthe man who have been the source, the influence of the invasion of Iraq\n12:47\nas we expected Sal Khan is a bit of heard, that’s thing kind of differently. doesn't it?\n12:51\na lot of you have comments and questions including this one let's go and pick some\n12:58\nthis one comes from Sanchfan he watches this show a lot like everyday\n13:02\nhe says keep Khan talking look the market is going up\n13:07\nfairly it had been, I didn’t notice that.\n13:10\nwe were so engaged in conversation let's do this for a quick i wanna just step away from this for a moment\n13:15\nKhan, tell us if you could if we bring it back to the basics\n13:19\nhow we are being affected by ushering of the news everyday. the credit crunch\n13:24\nand the situation of the market. sure, if we don't unclock the credit system\n13:28\nwe know it's gonna unlever their debt. so we gonna have deleverage\n13:32\nthat's essentially everyone on winding their loans. Deleverage, and this is\n13:35\ni think is the critical point because there is a lot of misinformation out there that actually\n13:39\ncontracts the money supply. so a lot of people out there are worried about inflation\n13:44\nthese deficits that lead to inflation. but when you have deleverage, this has happened in Japan\n13:47\nthis is what happened in thirties, the money supply contracts. that's our printing press\n13:51\nthe leverages are printing press and that affect the credit system and that's gonna lead to deflation\n13:57\nso i think a lot of people are worried about we gonna see inflation\n14:00\nor we gonna see the deflation and if we don't fix the problem we gonna see\n14:04\nlike Japan saw deflation\n14:07\nwhat deflation means concretely to me and you. Things get cheaper,\n14:12\nthe opposite of inflation. unfortunately, may be salaries go down.\n14:17\nbut on the plus side,a lot of assets like people buying houses\n14:20\nwould get cheaper that probably won't be a good thing in a short term\n14:24\nyeah exactly, now i can understand what the situation is right now.thank you Sal Khan\n14:28\nyou have been a great guest what an original way of being able to explain things\n14:31\nthank you we will be right back",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nLet's say we had the reaction\n0:02\nmolecule A plus molecule B is in dynamic equilibrium\n0:09\nwith molecules C plus D.\n0:12\nWhich just means that the rate of the forward reaction\n0:15\nis going at the same rate as the backward reaction,\n0:18\nor the reverse reaction.\n0:19\nThere will be some equilibrium concentrations\n0:22\nof A, B, C, and D,\n0:24\nand we can figure out what the equilibrium constant is\n0:25\nif we want.\n0:26\nAnd I'll say it again.\n0:28\nI've said it like four times so far.\n0:29\nThe fact that the forward reaction rate\n0:32\nis the same as the backward reaction rate\n0:34\ndoesn't mean that all of the concentrations are the same.\n0:36\nThe concentrations themselves of each of the molecules\n0:38\ncould be very different.\n0:40\nThey're just not changing anymore\n0:41\nbecause the forward and backward rates are the same.\n0:43\nNow, given this, given that we're at equilibrium now,\n0:48\nwhat's going to happen if I add more A to the system?\n0:51\nSo remember, it was in equilibrium.\n0:54\nThe concentrations were constant.\n0:57\nBut now all of a sudden, i'm adding more A to the system.\n1:00\nSo now, the odds of an A and a B particle,\n1:04\neven though I'm not adding\n1:05\nany more B molecule to the system,\n1:07\nthe odds are slightly higher\n1:09\nthat an A and a B are going to collide\n1:11\nin just the right way,\n1:13\nso the forward reaction is going to be more likely.\n1:16\nSo if we add more A to the system,\n1:18\nyou're going to have more A's.\n1:20\nThey're going to bump with more B's,\n1:22\nso the B's are actually going\n1:23\nto go down a little bit, right?\n1:25\nBecause more B's are going to be consumed.\n1:27\nAnd even more important,\n1:29\nthe C's and D's are going to definitely be increased.\n1:33\nAnd the way it would really happen,\n1:35\nyou would add more A.\n1:36\nThose A's would bump into some more B's,\n1:39\nand so this forward reaction, all of a sudden,\n1:42\nit's rate would go faster than this backward reaction.\n1:44\nSo the reaction would go in that direction.\n1:46\nThen you would have more C's and D's\n1:48\nand maybe some of those are more likely to bump\n1:49\nand go back in this direction.\n1:51\nEventually, you would reach a new equilibrium.\n1:54\nBut the bottom line is you'll be left with more A,\n1:57\na little bit less B\n1:59\nbecause you didn't add more B.\n2:01\nSo more B's going to be used to consume\n2:04\nwith those extra A's you just added.\n2:05\nAnd then those are going to produce more C's and D's\n2:08\nin equilibrium.\n2:09\nAnd you can imagine, if you added more A and more B,\n2:12\nlet's say if you added more B as well,\n2:15\nthen the reaction is going\n2:19\nto go in the forward direction even more.\n2:22\nI don't think this is an amazing insight of the world.\n2:27\nI think this is kind of obvious,\n2:28\nthat if you stress this reaction\n2:31\nby adding more on this side,\n2:33\nthat naturally it's going to move in the direction\n2:36\nthat relieves the stress.\n2:38\nSo if you add more A,\n2:39\nyou're going to have more A's bumping with B's\n2:41\nand go in that direction\n2:43\nand maybe consume a little bit more B's.\n2:44\nIf you add more of both,\n2:45\nthe whole thing's going to go in that direction. Likewise\n2:47\n-- let me rewrite the reaction.\n2:49\nI'll do it in a different color.\n2:52\nA plus B, dynamic equilibrium, C plus D.\n2:57\nIf I add more C\n3:01\n-- I think you get the point here--\n3:04\nwhat's going to happen?\n3:05\nWell, that's going to drive A and B up,\n3:07\nand it's maybe going to consume a little bit extra D.\n3:10\nAnd then if you added more C and D,\n3:13\nthen, of course, it's going to produce a lot more A and B.\n3:18\nAnd this idea, it seems pretty common sense,\n3:22\nbut there's a fancy name for it, and it's called Le\n3:25\n-- let me put a capital L-- Chatelier's principle.\n3:31\nChatelier's principle.\n3:35\nIf you've watched enough of these videos,\n3:37\nyou know I have to be careful with my spelling.\n3:40\nAnd all it says is that\n3:44\nwhen you stress a reaction that's in equilibrium,\n3:48\nthe reaction will favor the side\n3:50\nor one side of the reaction to relieve that stress.\n3:54\nWhen they say stress the reaction,\n3:55\nthat's like adding more A,\n3:56\nso the reaction's going to move towards\n3:58\nthe forward direction to relieve the stress\n4:00\n-- the quote, unquote stress--\n4:02\nof that more A.\n4:05\nI mean, that's not stress in its traditional way\n4:08\nof thinking about stress,\n4:09\nbut that is a kind of stress.\n4:10\nYou're somehow changing it relative to it.\n4:12\nIt was nice and comfortable\n4:13\nbefore in a nice, stable environment.\n4:15\nSo given Le Chatelier's principle,\n4:17\nlet's think of some other situations.\n4:18\nLet's say if I had A plus B plus some heat,\n4:24\nand that produces some C plus D.\n4:35\nAnd maybe it produces some E as well.\n4:38\nSo if I were to add heat to this system,\n4:41\nwhat would happen?\n4:43\nSo in order for the reaction to progress\n4:47\nin the forward direction, you need heat.\n4:50\nThe more heat you have,\n4:51\nthe more likely you're going\n4:53\nto progress in the forward direction.\n4:54\nSo Le Chatelier's principle will say\n4:58\nwe're stressing this reaction by adding heat,\n5:00\nso the reaction will favor the direction\n5:03\nthat relieves that stressor.\n5:05\nAnd so to relieve that stressor,\n5:07\nyou have more of this input,\n5:08\nso you're going to consume more A.\n5:11\nSo the stable concentration of A\n5:13\nonce we reach equilibrium will go down.\n5:15\nB will go down because they're going to be consumed more.\n5:18\nThe forward reaction is happening more.\n5:20\nAnd then C, D, and E would go up.\n5:23\nNow, if you did the opposite.\n5:24\nLet me erase what I just did.\n5:26\nLet's say instead of adding heat,\n5:34\nyou were to take away heat.\n5:36\nSo let's say you were to take away heat.\n5:40\nLet me make sure my cursor's right.\n5:42\nSo if you took heat away from the reaction,\n5:45\nwhat will be favored?\n5:46\nWell, then you're going to be favoring it\n5:49\nin the other direction\n5:50\nbecause there'll be less heat here.\n5:53\nI mean, all of this is together.\n5:54\nThere'll be less heat for this reaction to occur,\n5:57\nso this rate will start dominating this rate over here,\n6:01\nright? If you take away heat,\n6:02\nthe rate of this reaction will slow down,\n6:04\nthis one will be bigger,\n6:05\nand so you'll have more movement of concentration\n6:07\nin that direction,\n6:09\nor the reverse reaction will be favored.\n6:12\nNow, let's think of another stressor\n6:14\n-- pressure.\n6:15\nNow, imagine that we had--\n6:17\nwe mentioned the Haber process before,\n6:19\nand this is the reaction for the Haber process.\n6:22\nNitrogen gas plus 3 moles of hydrogen gas\n6:27\nin equilibrium with 2 moles of ammonia gas.\n6:33\nNow, what's going to happen\n6:37\nif I apply pressure to this system?\n6:38\nI'm going to apply pressure.\n6:42\nSo if you think about what happens with pressure,\n6:48\neverything all of a sudden is getting squeezed,\n6:52\nalthough the volume isn't necessarily decreasing,\n6:54\nbut something is somehow\n6:56\nmaking all the molecules want to be\n6:58\nor forcing them to be closer together.\n6:59\nNow, when things are getting closer together,\n7:02\nthe stress of the pressure could be relieved\n7:05\nif we end up with fewer molecules.\n7:08\nThink about it this way.\n7:11\nPV is equal to nRT.\n7:14\nWe learned this multiple times, right?\n7:16\nAnd let's say we could write P is equal to nRT/V.\n7:23\nNow, if we increase the pressure,\n7:31\nhow can we relieve that?\n7:33\nRemember, Le Chatelier's principle says that\n7:37\nwhatever's going to happen\n7:38\nis going to relieve the stressor.\n7:40\nThe reaction is going to go in the direction\n7:41\nthat it relieves it.\n7:42\nWell, if we lower the number of molecules,\n7:46\nthen that will relieve the pressure, right?\n7:48\nYou'll have fewer things bouncing against each other.\n7:51\nSo if we lower the number of molecules\n7:52\nwhere you can kind of view it\n7:55\n-- I mean, I shouldn't have written it this way,\n7:58\nbecause it's not quite an equation,\n7:59\nbut I want you to think of it that way.\n8:00\nLet me erase this.\n8:03\nThis probably wasn't the best intuition.\n8:09\nIf I have a container\n8:11\n-- nope, too shocking.\n8:13\nIf I-- nope, same thing.\n8:16\nIf I have a container\n8:19\nand I'm applying pressure to it,\n8:21\nand in one option I could have 2 molecules--\n8:27\nlet's say I could have 4 molecules in some volume.\n8:34\nAnd in another situation, let's say they get merged\n8:37\nand I only have 2 molecules, right?\n8:40\nIn either of these, the reaction can go between these,\n8:43\nthese 4 could merge to make 2 molecules.\n8:46\nActually, let me use this example up here.\n8:48\nLet's say this nitrogen molecule\n8:51\nis this blue one here.\n8:52\nActually, let me do it in a more different color.\n8:53\nThis brown one right here,\n8:55\nit can merge with 3 hydrogen. It could produce this.\n8:57\nSo this is another way of writing this reaction,\n9:01\nmaybe in a more visual way.\n9:02\nNow, if I'm applying pressure,\n9:04\nif I'm applying pressure to this system,\n9:06\nso pressure I just imagine is\n9:09\nkind of more force per area from every direction,\n9:12\nwhich of these situations is more likely\n9:16\nto relieve the situation?\n9:17\nWell, the situation\n9:19\nwhere we have fewer molecules bumping around\n9:21\nbecause it's easier to kind of apply\n9:24\nor I guess squeeze them together than\n9:27\nwhen you have more molecules bumping around.\n9:29\nI'm doing this very hand wavy,\n9:30\nbut I think it gives you the intuition.\n9:32\nSo if you apply pressure to the system,\n9:34\nif pressure goes up, you're applying--\n9:38\nthis doesn't mean the pressure goes down.\n9:40\nThis means pressure is applying to the system.\n9:41\nBut the pressure is going up,\n9:43\nwhat side of the reaction is going to be favored?\n9:45\nThe reaction's going to\n9:46\nbe favoring the side of that has fewer molecules.\n9:49\nAnd this side has 2 molecules,\n9:51\nalthough they'll be bigger molecules obviously,\n9:54\nbecause it's not like we're losing mass\n9:56\nin one direction or the other,\n9:57\nas opposed to this situation\n9:58\nwhere we have 4 molecules, right?\n10:00\n1 mole of nitrogen gas and 3 moles of hydrogen.\n10:04\nAnd just to bring this all back to the whole idea\n10:08\nthat we saw earlier with the kinetic equilibrium,\n10:13\nlet's just imagine a reaction like this.\n10:15\nAnd to show that it works with Le Chatelier's principle\n10:18\nis consistent with everything\n10:20\nwe've learned with equilibrium constants.\n10:23\nSo let's say we had the reaction 2 moles,\n10:27\nor the coefficient of two,\n10:29\n2 A's in the gaseous form plus B in the gaseous form\n10:34\nis in equilibrium with C in the gaseous form.\n10:38\nAnd let's say initially where our first equilibrium,\n10:42\nour concentration of A is 2 molar,\n10:46\nor our molarity is 2,\n10:48\nour concentration of B is 6 molar concentration,\n10:55\nand then our concentration of C is 8 molar.\n10:59\nSo what's the equilibrium constant here?\n11:02\nThe equilibrium constant here is the product,\n11:07\nconcentration of C,\n11:08\nthat's 8 molar divided by 2 molar squared,\n11:14\nbecause of this, 2 squared times 6.\n11:19\nWhich is equal to 8/24, which is equal to 1/3.\n11:25\nNow, let's say we were to add more A,\n11:28\nand I'm not going to say exactly how much.\n11:30\nWe could actually get quite complicated\n11:32\nwith the mathematics,\n11:33\nbut let's say after adding more A,\n11:34\nwe have a new concentration.\n11:36\nNow, let's say our concentration of A is 3 molar.\n11:40\nYou might say, hey, Sal, didn't you add 1 molar?\n11:43\nNo.\n11:44\nI actually added probably more than 1 molar.\n11:47\nWhat happens is, whatever I added,\n11:49\nthat'll push the reaction towards the right direction,\n11:52\nor towards the forward direction,\n11:54\nand so some of it will get consumed\n11:56\nand go in that direction,\n11:57\nbut whatever's left over is here.\n11:59\nSo I might have added more than 1 molar concentration\n12:02\nto this system.\n12:04\nBut whatever was extra beyond the 1 was consumed,\n12:07\nand I'm just left with this equilibrium concentration of 3.\n12:10\nSo I didn't necessarily add 1.\n12:13\nI could've added more than that.\n12:14\nAnd let's say that our new equilibrium for C is 12 molar,\n12:20\nwhich is consistent with what we say.\n12:23\nWe should be producing\n12:24\n-- if we add some A,\n12:27\nthen our concentration of C should go up,\n12:30\nand the intuition is that\n12:32\nthe concentration of B should go down a little bit,\n12:34\nbecause a little bit more B is going to be consumed,\n12:36\nbecause it's going to be colliding with\n12:38\n-- or it's more likely to collide with--\n12:40\nmore A particles or A molecules.\n12:42\nSo let's see what B's new concentration is.\n12:45\nSo remember, the equilibrium constant stays constant.\n12:51\nSo our equilibrium constant is now going to\n12:54\nbe equal to the concentration of C, right?\n12:57\nThat was the reaction.\n12:58\nSo it's 12 molar\n12:59\n-- whoops--\n13:02\nI don't have to write the units here\n13:04\n-- divided by our new concentration of A, that's 3.\n13:08\nBut remember the reaction.\n13:10\nThe coefficient on A is 2.\n13:12\nSo it's 3 squared\n13:14\ntimes the new concentration for B, right?\n13:20\nThere's no coefficient here\n13:21\nso I don't have to worry about any exponents.\n13:23\nAnd let's just solve this.\n13:25\nSo you get 1/3 is equal to 12 over 9B.\n13:31\nSo if we just cross-multiply,\n13:34\nwe get 9 times the concentration of B\n13:39\nis equal to 3 times 12, which is 36.\n13:44\nAnd so divide both sides by 9.\n13:47\nThe new concentration of B is 4, or 4 molar.\n13:52\nSo B is equal to 4 molar.\n13:57\nSo that makes sense.\n13:58\nWe added some more A to the reaction.\n14:00\nSo we started with 2 molar of A,\n14:03\n6 molar of B, 8 molar of C.\n14:06\nWhen we added more A, at the end, we added a bunch.\n14:10\nIt went in that direction,\n14:11\nmaybe it went back and forth a little bit,\n14:12\nbut it stabilized at 3 molar of A, 12 molar of C,\n14:17\nso C went up, so that definitely went up.\n14:20\nAnd notice, our stable equilibrium concentration of B\n14:25\nactually went down,\n14:27\nand this is consistent with what we were saying,\n14:29\nthat the reaction moves in that direction,\n14:30\nmore C gets produced,\n14:32\na little bit of B gets consumed.\n14:33\nSo anyway, hopefully you're fairly comfortable now\n14:36\nwith the whole notion of stressing a reaction\n14:39\nand Le Chatelier's principle.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nFor those of you who are just starting\n0:02\nto learn about the history of China\n0:04\nin the first half of the 20th century,\n0:07\nit can be a little bit confusing.\n0:09\nSo the goal of this video is really to give you an overview,\n0:13\nto give you a scaffold, of the history of the first half\n0:17\nof the 20th century in China.\n0:19\nSo as we go into the early 1900s,\n0:22\nyou have the end of imperial dynastic rule in China.\n0:27\nThis is a big deal.\n0:28\nChina has been ruled by various dynasties\n0:31\nfor multiple thousands of years.\n0:34\nBut as you get into the 1900s, the dynastic rule,\n0:38\nin particular the Qing Dynasty, was getting weaker and weaker.\n0:43\nIt had suffered at the hands of the Japanese\n0:45\nduring the first Sino-Japanese War at the end of the 1800s.\n0:50\nThere was growing discontent amongst the opposition\n0:53\nthat the dynasty, that the emperors,\n0:55\nwere not modernizing China enough.\n0:57\nRemember, this is the early 1900s.\n0:59\nThe rest of the world was becoming a very, very modern\n1:01\nplace.\n1:02\nChina in the 1800s had suffered at the hands of Western powers\n1:06\nwho were essentially exerting their own imperial influence\n1:10\nin China.\n1:11\nMany people felt that this was because China was not\n1:14\nas modernized economically, politically,\n1:17\ntechnologically as it needed to be.\n1:20\nAnd so you fast-forward to 1911.\n1:22\nYou have what is known as the Wuchang Uprising, which\n1:26\nled to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty.\n1:30\nBy 1912, a Republic of China was established in Nanjing.\n1:35\nSo Nanjing right over here was where it was established.\n1:38\nBeijing was, of course, the seat of dynastic rule in China.\n1:43\nAnd the first provisional president\n1:45\nof the Republic of China was Dr. Sun Yat-sen, right over here.\n1:51\nAnd he actually did not directly participate\n1:53\nin this final uprising that finally\n1:55\nled to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty.\n1:59\nHe was actually in Denver at the time, Denver, Colorado.\n2:02\nBut he was a leading or one of the leading figures in the run\n2:05\nup to this uprising, one of the leading figures\n2:07\nwho was providing opposition and had tried\n2:10\nmultiple times to overthrow the dynasty.\n2:13\nNow along with Sun Yat-sen, he was essentially in cahoots\n2:17\nwith Yuan Shikai, who was a general in the old dynasty.\n2:21\nAnd he has his own fascinating history.\n2:24\nAnd Sun Yat-sen struck a deal with Yuan Shikai,\n2:27\nwho was very politically ambitious.\n2:30\nYuan Shikai said, hey, if I can get the emperor Puyi, who\n2:33\nwas the last emperor of China, if I can get him to officially\n2:37\nabdicate, I want to become the president.\n2:40\nSo Sun Yat-sen agrees to this.\n2:43\nSo Yuan Shikai becomes the president\n2:48\nof the Republic of China.\n2:50\nBut that wasn't enough for him.\n2:52\nHe declares himself emperor in 1915,\n2:56\nwhich you could imagine did not make many people happy\n2:58\nbecause they were tired of having emperors.\n3:01\nAnd by 1916, he abdicates and he passes away, actually.\n3:06\nAnd this actually begins a period\n3:09\nof extremely fragmented rule for China.\n3:13\nEven under imperial rule, the Chinese military\n3:16\nwas not one consolidated body.\n3:18\nThe military was controlled by various warlords\n3:21\nin various regions that all had allegiance to the emperor.\n3:25\nOnce you have Yuan Shikai abdicating and then dying\n3:29\nin 1916, and even prior to that, when\n3:31\nhe declared himself emperor, people\n3:33\ndid not want to pledge allegiance to Yuan Shikai.\n3:37\nAnd so you had what is known as the beginning of the Warlord\n3:40\nEra in China.\n3:42\nAnd this is a fragmented period where you did not\n3:44\nhave any centralized leadership.\n3:47\nThis map over here shows kind of the rough picture\n3:51\nof what the Warlord Era looked like.\n3:53\nEach of these regions were controlled\n3:55\nby a different warlord who was in charge\n3:57\nof a different military.\n3:59\nWhen this was going on during the Warlord Era,\n4:02\nespecially as we go back to the early '20s, in 1921\n4:05\nin particular, Sun Yat-sen hasn't given up.\n4:09\nHe goes to the south in Guangzhou\n4:12\nand sets up, essentially, a revolutionary government,\n4:16\nessentially a desire from there to try\n4:19\nto consolidate power in China again and reestablish\n4:23\nthe Republic of China.\n4:25\nSo he goes there.\n4:27\nBut unfortunately he passes away in 1925 from cancer.\n4:32\nAnd the hands or the power of the movement that he started,\n4:38\nwhich is now being referred to as the Kuomintang-- Let me\n4:42\nwrite that down.\n4:53\nEssentially, the power there passes on\n4:56\nto Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.\n5:00\nAnd Chiang Kai-shek, the reason why\n5:01\nwe say the power essentially goes to him\n5:03\nis because he was in control of the major part\n5:05\nof the military forces of the Kuomintang.\n5:09\nAnd this is essentially the very nascent early stages\n5:13\nof what would essentially be the Chinese Civil\n5:15\nWar because in the period from 1921 until Sun Yat-sen's death,\n5:22\nyou actually had a lot of collaboration\n5:24\nbetween the Chinese nationalists, the Kuomintang,\n5:27\nand the Soviet Union, and the Chinese Communist Party.\n5:31\nThey were trying to collaborate in order\n5:33\nto think about how China would unify.\n5:36\nBut then once Sun Yat-sen dies and the power of the Kuomintang\n5:41\nessentially goes into the hands of Generalissimo Chiang\n5:44\nKai-shek, he starts to consolidate power.\n5:48\nAnd right from the get-go, he doesn't\n5:50\nantagonize the communists.\n5:51\nBut by 1927, he's starting to consolidate,\n5:56\nhe's starting to merge these various factions\n6:01\nin the rest of China.\n6:02\nSo he's able to consolidate power.\n6:04\nBut he also starts to go after the communists.\n6:08\nSo Chiang Kai-shek, by '27, also starts\n6:11\nto go after the communists.\n6:13\nAnd the communists are saying, hey, we\n6:14\nare the ones that really represent the spirit of what\n6:18\nSun Yat-sen represented, while the Kuomintang\n6:21\nunder the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek said, no, no, no.\n6:23\nWe represent what Sun Yat-sen represented when he first\n6:28\nestablished the Republic of China.\n6:31\nAnd so in 1927, you have the beginning of the Chinese Civil\n6:36\nWar.\n6:37\nThis is when the Kuomintang, as part of its efforts\n6:39\nto consolidate power, not only tries\n6:41\nto consolidate power of the warlords,\n6:43\nbut also goes after the Communist Party.\n6:46\nNow while all of this is happening,\n6:48\nas we get into the early 1930s, Japan once again\n6:53\nis trying to exert its imperial, its military,\n6:56\nmight on the Chinese mainland.\n6:58\nThey had already captured Formosa,\n7:00\nwhich is now known as Taiwan, and Korea\n7:03\nduring the first Sino-Japanese War at the end of the 1800s.\n7:07\nAnd then in 1931, the Japanese start to encroach on Manchuria.\n7:16\nAnd this would essentially become a multi-year occupation\n7:19\nand infiltration of Japan into China.\n7:23\nAnd this continues all the way until 1937,\n7:26\nwhen it becomes an official all-out war\n7:29\nbetween the Japanese and the Chinese.\n7:32\nAnd I have a map here that shows kind\n7:35\nof the maximum Japanese control over this period.\n7:40\nAnd so in east Asia between the Chinese and the Japanese,\n7:43\nWorld War II was really just part of the Sino-Japanese War.\n7:49\nThe Japanese had already encroached\n7:51\non the mainland of China well before World War\n7:56\nII had officially begun.\n7:58\nNow while all this is happening, Japan\n8:01\nis encroaching into Manchuria, in 1934, you have to remember,\n8:04\nthe Kuomintang, the Nationalist Party under Chiang Kai-shek\n8:08\nis going after the communists.\n8:11\nAnd in 1934, he almost has them, or he does.\n8:16\nThe communists are nearly defeated.\n8:20\nThey're surrounded by the Nationalist Party.\n8:22\nAnd this becomes what is a fairly famous event\n8:25\nin Chinese history, the famous Long March, where\n8:28\nthe Chinese Communist Party, their military,\n8:31\nis marched through extremely tough terrain\n8:34\nall the way to the northwest of China.\n8:38\nSo this right over here is a map of the Long March.\n8:42\nThe Chinese Communist Party seemed to be on the ropes\n8:46\nhere in 1934.\n8:48\nAnd it was during this Long March\n8:50\nthat Mao Zedong really started to exert and show leadership.\n8:55\nThe leadership during this Long March,\n8:57\nduring this retreat to the northwest of China,\n9:00\nis really what allowed Mao Zedong to eventually take\n9:02\ncontrol of the Chinese Communist Party.\n9:06\nNow as we fast forward, we know that the Sino-Japanese War--\n9:10\nyou could view this as one theater, eventually, of World\n9:12\nWar II-- eventually the US goes in on the side\n9:16\nof the Allies against Japan after Pearl Harbor.\n9:19\nAnd then in 1945, you have the attacks\n9:25\non Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic weapons,\n9:27\nwhich essentially ends the Pacific theater.\n9:30\nIt's defeat for Japan, and Japan has lost World War II.\n9:36\nAnd at this point, full-scale civil war\n9:38\nbetween the two parties break out again.\n9:40\nThe Civil War started in 1927, and then it kept continuing.\n9:45\nBut then once there was a common enemy in Japan that was clearly\n9:48\naggressively trying to take over more and more of China's\n9:53\npeople, resources, exert its imperial influence,\n9:56\nthen you had the two parties kind of go into a low-grade war\n9:59\nand say, hey, we need to fight these Japanese.\n10:01\nBut once World War II ended in 1945,\n10:04\nonce the Japanese were defeated, then you\n10:06\nhad full-scale civil war break out\n10:08\nagain between the Chinese Communist\n10:10\nParty and the Kuomintang.\n10:12\nAnd this is probably one of the biggest comebacks in history.\n10:14\nThis was the Chinese Communist Party that in 1934 and 1935\n10:18\nlooked like they were on the ropes.\n10:20\nThey were forced into, essentially, retreat.\n10:23\nThey were able to come back.\n10:25\nAnd in 1949-- and there's a lot of theories\n10:28\nas to why they were able to pull this off.\n10:31\nThat they were able to get much more of the support\n10:33\nfrom the rural population.\n10:35\nThey were more savvy about getting support generally\n10:37\nthan the Kuomintang.\n10:38\nBut we could talk about that in a future video.\n10:41\nBut by 1949, they were able to defeat\n10:44\nChiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang,\n10:46\nforce the Kuomintang to retreat to Taiwan,\n10:53\nestablish government in Taiwan.\n10:56\nAnd ever since then, you had the establishment\n10:58\nby the Chinese Communist Party in 1949\n11:02\nof the People's Republic of China.",

new series.\n0:09\nHowever, this one won't end here.\n0:11\nIf anything, we are kind of at the beginning still.\n0:14\nSo I'm going to do 3 different checkpoint videos.\n0:17\nThis one is on 'Advanced Lessons'.\n0:20\nHowever, I also want to eventually talk about Tests and Challenges,\n0:24\nand what we can do with more interactive explorations\n0:27\nand computer science lessons as it applies to cryptography.\n0:31\nBut for now, let's talk about Advanced Lessons.\n0:33\nWhen I say 'Advanced', I don't necessarily mean 'harder lessons',\n0:37\nI mean 'more detailed'.\n0:39\nLet me give you a conceptual idea\n0:41\nfor what I think this series could be and future series.\n0:45\nI like to think of each series as the trunk of a tree,\n0:48\nwhere I took you from prehistoric times\n0:51\nto around the 20th century, which is here,\n0:53\nwith a few different threads.\n0:55\nAnd these ideas kind of branch apart.\n0:59\nOnce you get to the 20th and 21st centuries,\n1:01\nthey start getting highly specific.\n1:04\nAnd way down here on the leaves are current research questions,\n1:09\nwhich over here might be\n1:11\nproblems related to prime number distribution\n1:13\nand over here some very specific work being done\n1:18\non randomized algorithms or hash functions,\n1:21\nand way up here we might have new public key protocols\n1:27\n- because RSA was just the first -\n1:29\nor we also have encryption standards such as DES and AES.\n1:33\nWe would have a whole new branch on quantum cryptography.\n1:37\nSo as you can see, there are so many different things\n1:40\nthat branch out of this series\n1:41\nand I couldn't possibly do justice to them all.\n1:44\nSo I think of this video as living right here.\n1:46\nAt kind of a junction point.\n1:49\nNow I can branch off with help of the community\n1:52\nand possibly other video creators\n1:54\nto fill out this tree gradually over time.\n1:58\nSpecifically with the help of the community.\n2:01\nI am really excited about the Q&A community\n2:04\nand the work being done to improve\n2:06\nhow people can help people on Khan Academy.\n2:09\nSo, for example,\n2:11\nin terms of where one of these branches can go,\n2:15\nI've noticed clusters of questions\n2:17\nkind of leading into a common branch.\n2:20\nFor example, under 'the pseudo-random number generator',\n2:23\nI have two questions here: one by Sonny and one by Drakain.\n2:26\nDrakain's question is:\n2:27\n\"Why has he suggested that time in milliseconds...\n2:31\n...is a suitable random seed?...\n2:33\nThis is a huge no-no in security. ...\n2:35\nThe time it is on your machine...\n2:38\n...is the time it is on my machine,...\n2:40\n...give or take 100 milliseconds...\n2:42\n(which can be brute-force attacked)\"\n2:44\nAnd again, this is a great question too\n2:46\nbecause it speaks to the need that\n2:48\nI didn't present a cryptographically secure pseudo-random generator.\n2:53\nSo the middle square's method is back here\n2:56\nin early 20th century, but up until today,\n2:59\nwe are not using the middle square's method\n3:02\nand that's a whole interesting branch.\n3:05\nIt is these sorts of questions which cluster together\n3:08\nand really drive new content.\n3:12\nI want to show you a really interesting example\n3:14\nof how this has happened already.\n3:16\nThis is a question Samuel asked on the 'One time pad'-video\n3:20\nhe said: \"wouldn't a computer be able to test all the possibilities very fast?\"\n3:24\nand Chuck Patrol basically asked the same question.\n3:28\nI see this happening a lot.\n3:30\nSimilar questions all speak to the need of a new video.\n3:33\nSo I went and created a video on 'perfect secrecy'\n3:37\nwhich really nails down\n3:39\nhow you can't beat randomness in the world of encryption.\n3:43\nOut of this video, Dawn made a really great comment.\n3:48\nWhat they did, was basically summarise my video in two sentences.\n3:52\nSo, this is what I want to try to do more of\n3:55\nin filling out these branches:\n3:56\ntake questions, make new content,\n3:58\nand have this feed-back loop and see what we can do.\n4:03\nNow what I would really love,\n4:05\nis for you to ask questions below this video\n4:08\nwhich arise after watching the entire series.\n4:12\nNot specific details about certain video's,\n4:14\n- those can go with the videos -\n4:16\nbut new questions, which are opening new can of worms.\n4:19\nAnd what I think will be fun to do, is:\n4:22\nYour question will lead to answers,\n4:26\nby both me and the rest of the community,\n4:30\nso we'll have multiple answers.\n4:32\nAnd what I can do is take this body of answers,\n4:35\nand out of this draft up a rough script\n4:40\nfor more advanced videos on specific topics\n4:43\nthat sub-sets of the community care about\n4:47\nSo hopefully, out of the discussion below,\n4:49\nover time we can grow a bunch of new videos!\n4:53\nI want to be clear: this is an ongoing process.\n4:56\nThis will not happen tomorrow or next week.\n4:59\nI hope it can happen months, even years from now.\n5:02\nWe can still be building out new videos after the series\n5:05\nand these videos can be a collaborative effort\n5:08\nbetween myself and the community\n5:10\nand perhaps other video creators down the road.\n5:13\nSo, let me know what you think below,\n5:15\nand let's get started!",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nIn this video, I want to talk a little bit\n0:02\nabout Newton's First Law of Motion.\n0:06\nAnd this is a translation from Newton's Principia from Latin\n0:09\ninto English.\n0:10\nSo the First Law, \"Every body persists\n0:13\nin a state of being at rest, or moving uniformly\n0:20\nstraightforward, except insofar as it is compelled\n0:24\nto change its state by force impressed.\"\n0:27\nSo another way to rephrase what they're saying\n0:30\nis, that if there's something-- every body persists--\n0:33\nso everything will stay at rest, or\n0:35\nmoving with a constant velocity, unless it\n0:39\nis compelled to change its state by force.\n0:42\nUnless it's acted on by a force, especially an unbalanced force.\n0:45\nand I'll explain that in a second.\n0:47\nSo if I have something that's at rest, so completely at rest.\n0:50\nSo I have-- and this is something\n0:53\nthat we've seen before.\n0:56\nLet's say that I have a rock.\n0:59\nLet's say that I have a rock someplace\n1:03\nand it's laying on a field of grass,\n1:08\nI can keep observing that rock.\n1:10\nAnd it is unlikely to move, assuming\n1:11\nthat nothing happens to it.\n1:13\nIf there's no force applied to that rock,\n1:15\nthat rock will just stay there.\n1:17\nSo the first part is pretty obvious.\n1:20\nSo, \"Every body persists in a state of being at rest\"--\n1:23\nI'm not going to do the second part--\n1:25\n\"except insofar as there's some force being applied to it.\"\n1:28\nSo clearly a rock will be at rest,\n1:30\nunless there's some force applied to it, unless someone\n1:33\nhere tries to push it or roll it or do something to it.\n1:37\nWhat's less intuitive about the first law is the second part.\n1:41\n\"Every body persists in,\" either, \"being in a state\n1:44\nof rest or moving uniformly straight forward,\n1:48\nexcept insofar as it is compelled\n1:50\nto change its state by force impressed.\"\n1:52\nSo this Newton's first law-- and I\n1:55\nthink I should do a little aside here,\n1:56\nbecause, this right here is Newton.\n2:00\nAnd if this is Newton's first law,\n2:01\nwhy do I have this huge picture of this guy over here?\n2:04\nWell, the reason is is because Newton's first law is really\n2:07\njust a restatement of this guy's law of inertia.\n2:10\nAnd this guy, another titan of civilization\n2:14\nreally, this is Galileo Galilei.\n2:19\nAnd he is the first person to formulate the law of inertia.\n2:22\nAnd Newton just rephrased it a little bit and packaged it\n2:25\nwith his other laws.\n2:26\nBut he did many, many, many other things.\n2:28\nSo you really have to give Galileo\n2:30\ncredit for Newton's first law.\n2:32\nSo that's why I made him bigger than here.\n2:34\nBut I was in the midst of a thought.\n2:36\nSo we understand if something is at rest,\n2:38\nit's going to stay at rest, unless there's\n2:39\nsome force that acts on it.\n2:41\nAnd in some definitions, you'll see\n2:42\nunless there's some unbalanced force.\n2:44\nAnd the reason why they say unbalanced\n2:46\nis, because you could have two forces that act on something\n2:49\nand they might balance out.\n2:50\nFor example, I could push on this side of the rock\n2:53\nwith a certain amount of force.\n2:55\nAnd if you push on this side of the rock\n2:56\nwith the exact same amount of force, the rock won't move.\n3:00\nAnd the only way that it would move if there's a lot more\n3:03\nforce on one side than on the other side,\n3:05\nso if you have an unbalanced force.\n3:07\nSo if you have a ton of-- and maybe the rock\n3:09\nis a bad analogy.\n3:10\nLet's take ice, because ice is easier to move, or ice on ice.\n3:14\nSo there's ice right here.\n3:16\nAnd then, I have another block of ice\n3:17\nsitting on top of that ice.\n3:19\nSo once again, we're familiar with the idea,\n3:21\nif there's no force acting on it that ice won't move.\n3:25\nBut what happens if I'm pushing on the ice\n3:29\nwith a certain amount of force on that side,\n3:31\nand you're pushing on the ice on that side\n3:32\nwith the same amount of force?\n3:34\nThe ice will still not move.\n3:36\nSo this right here, this would be a balanced force.\n3:41\nSo the only way for the ice to change its condition, to change\n3:47\nits restful condition is if the force is unbalanced.\n3:50\nSo if we add a little bit of force on this side,\n3:53\nso it more than compensates the force pushing it this way,\n3:57\nthen you're going to see the ice block start to move,\n4:00\nstart to really accelerate in that direction.\n4:04\nBut I think this part is obvious.\n4:05\nThis, you know, something that's at rest\n4:07\nwill stay at rest, unless it's being acted on\n4:09\nby an unbalanced force.\n4:11\nWhat's less obvious is the idea that something\n4:14\nmoving uniformly straightforward, which\n4:16\nis another way of saying something\n4:18\nhaving a constant velocity.\n4:22\nWhat he's saying is, is that something\n4:24\nthat has a constant velocity will continue\n4:26\nto have that constant velocity indefinitely,\n4:29\nunless it is acted on by an unbalanced force.\n4:33\nAnd that's less intuitive.\n4:34\nBecause everything in our human experience--\n4:37\neven if I were to push this block of ice,\n4:41\neventually it'll stop.\n4:42\nIt won't just keep going forever, even\n4:44\nassuming that this ice field is infinitely long, that ice\n4:47\nwill eventually stop.\n4:48\nOr if I throw a tennis ball.\n4:54\nThat tennis ball will eventually stop.\n4:59\nIt'll eventually grind to a halt.\n5:01\nOr if I roll a bowling ball, or if I, anything.\n5:04\nWe've never seen, at least in our human experience,\n5:06\nit looks like everything will eventually stop.\n5:09\nSo this is a very unintuitive thing to say,\n5:11\nthat something in motion will just\n5:12\nkeep going in motion indefinitely.\n5:14\nEverything in human intuition says if you want something\n5:17\nto keep going in motion, you have to keep\n5:19\nputting more force, keep putting more energy into it\n5:22\nfor it to keep going.\n5:23\nYour car won't go forever, unless you keep,\n5:25\nunless the engine keeps burning fuel to drive and consuming\n5:29\nenergy.\n5:30\nSo what are they talking about?\n5:31\nWell, in all of these examples-- and I\n5:33\nthink this is actually a pretty brilliant insight from all\n5:36\nof these fellows is that-- all of these things\n5:39\nwould have gone on forever.\n5:41\nThe ball would keep going forever.\n5:42\nThis ice block would be going on forever,\n5:44\nexcept for the fact that there are unbalanced\n5:47\nforces acting on them to stop them.\n5:50\nSo in the case of ice, even though ice on ice\n5:52\ndoesn't have a lot of friction, there\n5:54\nis some friction between these two.\n5:56\nAnd so you have, in this situation,\n5:58\nthe force of friction is going to be\n6:00\nacting against the direction of the movement of the ice.\n6:03\nAnd friction really comes from, at an atomic level--\n6:06\nso if you have the actual water molecules in a lattice\n6:10\nstructure in the ice cube, and then here are\n6:12\nthe water molecules in a lattice structure on the ice,\n6:17\non the actual kind of sea of ice that it's traveling on--\n6:20\nthey do kind of bump and grind into each other.\n6:22\nAlthough they're both smooth, there are imperfections here.\n6:25\nThey bump and grind.\n6:26\nThey generate a little bit of heat.\n6:28\nAnd they'll, essentially, be working against the movement.\n6:32\nSo there's a force of friction that's being applied to here.\n6:34\nAnd that's why it's stopping.\n6:35\nNot only a force of friction, you also\n6:37\nhave some air resistance.\n6:38\nThe ice block is going to be bumping\n6:40\ninto all sorts of air particles.\n6:42\nIt might not be noticeable at first,\n6:44\nbut it's definitely going to keep it from going on forever.\n6:47\nSame thing with the ball being tossed to the air.\n6:49\nObviously, at some point, it hits\n6:51\nthe ground because of gravity.\n6:52\nSo that's one force acting on it.\n6:54\nBut even once it hits the ground,\n6:55\nit doesn't keep rolling forever, once again,\n6:57\nbecause of the friction, especially if there's grass\n7:01\nhere.\n7:02\nThe grass is going to stop it from going.\n7:04\nAnd even while it's in the air, it's going to slow down.\n7:06\nIt's not going to have a constant velocity.\n7:08\nBecause you have all of these air particles\n7:10\nthat are going to bump into it and exert\n7:15\nforce to slow it down.\n7:17\nSo what was really brilliant about these guys\n7:19\nis that they could imagine a reality where\n7:22\nyou didn't have gravity, where you did not\n7:24\nhave air slowing things down.\n7:27\nAnd they could imagine that in that reality,\n7:30\nsomething would just keep persisting in its motion.\n7:33\nAnd the reason why Galileo, frankly, was probably good\n7:36\nat thinking about that is that he\n7:37\nstudied the orbits of planets.\n7:41\nAnd he could, or at least he's probably\n7:43\ntheorized that, hey, maybe there's no air out there.\n7:45\nAnd that maybe that's why these planets can just\n7:47\nkeep going round and round in orbit.\n7:49\nAnd I should say their speed, because their direction is\n7:54\nchanging, but their speed never slows down,\n7:56\nbecause there's nothing in the space\n7:58\nto actually slow down those planets.\n8:01\nSo anyway, hopefully you found that as fascinating as I do.\n8:04\nBecause on some level, it's super-duper obvious.\n8:06\nBut on a whole other level, it's completely not obvious,\n8:08\nespecially this moving uniformly straightforward.\n8:10\nAnd just to make the point clear,\n8:12\nif gravity disappeared, and you had no air,\n8:16\nand you threw a ball, that ball literally\n8:18\nwould keep going in that direction\n8:20\nforever, unless some other unbalanced force acted\n8:24\nto stop it.\n8:26\nAnd another way to think about it-- and this\n8:28\nis an example that you might see in everyday life-- is,\n8:32\nif I'm in an airplane that's going at a completely\n8:38\nconstant velocity and there's absolutely\n8:40\nno turbulence in the airplane.\n8:42\nSo if I'm sitting in the airplane right over here.\n8:45\nAnd it's going at a constant velocity, completely smooth,\n8:51\nno turbulence.\n8:52\nThere's really no way for me to tell whether that airplane is\n8:55\nmoving without looking out the window.\n8:57\nLet's assume that there's no windows in that airplane.\n8:59\nIt's going at a constant velocity.\n9:01\nAnd there's no turbulence.\n9:02\nAnd let's say, I can't hear anything.\n9:06\nSo I can't even hear the engines.\n9:07\nThere's no way for me to sense that the plane is moving.\n9:10\nBecause from my frame of reference,\n9:12\nit looks completely identical to if I\n9:15\nwas in that same plane that was resting on the ground.\n9:18\nAnd that's another way to think about it.\n9:20\nThat it's actually very intuitive\n9:22\nthat they're similar states, moving at a constant velocity\n9:25\nor being at rest.\n9:27\nAnd you really can't tell whether you\n9:29\nare one or the other.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n- [Instructor] In other videos,\n0:01\nwe talk about how 10 to 15,000 years ago.\n0:04\nYou have the emergence of agriculture\n0:07\nprimarily around river valleys,\n0:10\nand it's no surprise that agriculture\n0:12\nfirst came about around river valleys\n0:14\nbecause the rivers would flood,\n0:17\nmaking the soil around them fertile.\n0:19\nThey would provide fresh water for crops\n0:22\nand for the people who would live near them.\n0:24\nLater on, the rivers could be useful for\n0:26\ntransporting things like crops,\n0:29\nand so it's not surprising that our\n0:31\nfirst significant civilizations also emerged\n0:33\nwhere the first agriculture emerged.\n0:37\nAnd our first civilizations we'll see\n0:38\nin ancient Egypt along the Nile.\n0:41\nWe will see it in the Indus Valley along the Indus River.\n0:45\nWe'll see it in China along the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers,\n0:49\nand we'll also see it in Mesopotamia\n0:51\nalong the Tigress and Euphrates Rivers.\n0:56\nAnd what we're gonna focus on in\n0:58\nthis video in particular is Mesopotamia.\n1:03\nNow, the word Mesopotamia literally come from\n1:05\nmeso, between, and potamos.\n1:07\nI'm probably not pronouncing it right, rivers.\n1:10\nSo it's the area between rivers is literally\n1:13\nwhat Mesopotamia is referring to.\n1:15\nAnd it's primarily modern day Iraq.\n1:19\nNow the reason why this is particularly interesting\n1:21\nand it's called the cradle of civilization,\n1:24\nis not only is it one of or perhaps\n1:27\nthe first place that agriculture developed,\n1:29\nit was at the crossroads of many other early civilizations.\n1:33\nNotice it's right in between\n1:35\nthe Indus Valley civilization here,\n1:37\nand then the ancient Egyptians,\n1:39\nand other civilizations that were emerging in the area.\n1:42\nAnd so it's not surprising that this was\n1:44\na geography that had significant developments\n1:47\nin terms of technology, in terms of architecture,\n1:50\nin terms of religion, in terms of writing.\n1:54\nAnd the first civilization we believe\n1:57\nthat emerged in Mesopotamia are the Sumerians.\n2:01\nSumerians.\n2:04\nAnd Sumeria and Sumerians, it's most associated with\n2:07\nthis region right over here of, let me circle it,\n2:12\nthis region right over here of southern Mesopotamia.\n2:17\nAnd we currently think that this civilization\n2:19\nstarted to emerge around 4000 BCE.\n2:22\nYou can see it on this timeline here in orange,\n2:25\nand they developed things as basic as the wheel.\n2:30\nThe first wheel that was ever discovered\n2:31\nwas 3500 BCE in Sumeria.\n2:35\nThey're famous for their architectural structures.\n2:37\nThis is a picture here of a ziggurat,\n2:39\nwhich was at the center of many of\n2:41\nthese Sumerian and as we'll see Mesopotamian cities.\n2:44\nThis would require an incredible amount of labor to produce,\n2:47\nand at the top of these they had temples to their Gods\n2:50\nand their Gods, they had a polytheistic religion,\n2:53\nand their Gods took human form.\n2:58\nAlso amongst the Sumerians is where we think\n3:02\none of the first written languages developed.\n3:05\nIt wasn't the first.\n3:06\nYou also have the Egyptian hieroglyphics\n3:07\nand written language emerged amongst\n3:09\nthe Harappans and the Indus Valley civilization\n3:12\nand amongst the Chinese,\n3:14\nbut it was one of the first languages.\n3:16\nThis right over here is an example of a cuneiform tablet.\n3:20\nThis is a cuneiform tablet written in the script.\n3:24\nCuneiform developed by these ancient Sumerians.\n3:30\nNow, when you talk about Mesopotamia,\n3:32\nyou'll talk about Sumerians,\n3:33\nbut we'll also talk about other civilizations that emerge.\n3:36\nIn particular, let me write them all down.\n3:38\nYou have the Sumerians.\n3:39\nYou'll also hear something called Akkadian,\n3:41\nand as we'll see, Akkadian is both a language\n3:45\nand an empire that will emerge.\n3:48\nIn Mesopotamia over the roughly 3,000 years BCE,\n3:54\nthe two primary languages are Akkadian,\n3:58\nwhich is considered a Semitic language.\n4:01\nIt's related to modern Semitic languages,\n4:03\nlike Arabic and Hebrew,\n4:06\nand the reason why they're called Semitic is\n4:08\nbecause they're spoken or they're reported to be spoken\n4:10\nby the descendants of Shem, who was Noah's son,\n4:14\nin the Hebrew bible.\n4:16\nSo, you have the language Akkadian, which is Semitic,\n4:19\nand then you have the other language, which is Sumerian.\n4:21\nAnd as we get into the third millennium BCE,\n4:26\nthe Sumerians start to have a lot of\n4:28\ninteraction with Akkadian speaking people,\n4:31\nand Akkadian speaking people are initially associated\n4:33\nprimarily with northern Mesopotamia,\n4:37\nand we believe the first empire, true empire,\n4:41\nperhaps the first empire in the world emerged from Acadia,\n4:45\nand it was called the Akkadian Empire.\n4:47\nAnd if we scroll down over here,\n4:52\nwe can see how the Akkadian Empire spread.\n4:56\nWe believe that the town of Akkad,\n4:58\nwhich the Akkadian Empire is named for,\n5:00\nsome place in this region right over here,\n5:03\nand the first significant ruler\n5:04\nwho really spread that empire was Sargon,\n5:07\noften referred to as Sargon the Great.\n5:10\nAnd you can see, you can see that\n5:13\nthat would have been established around\n5:15\nthe middle of the 23rd, or actually the 24th century BCE.\n5:21\nSo around 2350, you have Sargon establishing\n5:24\nwhat might be the first Dynastic empire in the world,\n5:27\nthe Akkadian Empire,\n5:29\nand he was able to take control of\n5:31\nboth northern and southern Mesopotamia,\n5:33\nso even the Sumerians were under\n5:35\nthe control of the Akkadians.\n5:37\nAs we'll see over time,\n5:38\nyou have a lot of mixing between the Akkadian language,\n5:41\nthe Sumerian language.\n5:42\nAkkadian gets written in the Cuneiform script,\n5:46\nand starting at around this period,\n5:47\nSumerian starts to die as a spoken language\n5:50\nand Akkadian really becomes dominant.\n5:52\nNow, the Akkadians rule for a little over 100 years,\n5:57\nand then you have several other empires.\n6:00\nIt can get confusing.\n6:01\nThe way I have structured this timeline is\n6:03\nthis top line right over here is southern Mesopotamia\n6:05\nand this bottom line right over here is northern Mesopotamia\n6:09\nso this orange shows you where the Sumerians were reigning.\n6:12\nSome people think that they might\n6:14\nhave been the first empire.\n6:15\nThis bottom line here, you can see the Akkadian speakers,\n6:17\nbut they were fragmented until you have Sargon the great\n6:20\nestablishing the Akkadian Empire.\n6:22\nNow, you briefly then have a short-term neo-Sumerian empire,\n6:28\nbut the next significant empire that's often talked about\n6:31\nwhen associated with Mesopotamia is the Babylonian Empire.\n6:36\nSo Babylon, the Babylonian Empire\n6:38\nwas centered at Babylon, right over here,\n6:40\nand it really became a significant empire\n6:44\nunder the ruler Hammurabi.\n6:47\nAnd Hammurabi is perhaps most known,\n6:49\nyou can see how he was able to spread the empire.\n6:52\nThe dark brown is what he had with\n6:55\nthis empire when he took rule,\n6:57\nand the light brown is what he was able to spread it to,\n7:00\nso once again, both north and south,\n7:01\nand he's perhaps most famous for\n7:03\nhis famous code of Hammurabi, which is depicted here,\n7:07\nand it wasn't the first written code,\n7:09\nbut it was one of the earliest,\n7:11\nand you could view it as almost a proto-constitution,\n7:14\nand it was based on things that the Sumerians had before,\n7:17\nbut they've even influenced things like biblical laws,\n7:20\nthings that come down to modern codes of law today.\n7:24\nNow, after the Babylonians,\n7:26\nthe other significant empire that would have control over\n7:30\nsignificant portions of Mesopotamia is the Assyrian Empire.\n7:34\nAnd the Assyrian Empire is named for their,\n7:37\nI guess you could say their home base, the town of Assur.\n7:41\nYou can see it in this map here,\n7:43\nwhere we showed the Akkadian Empire.\n7:45\nAnd both the Babylonians and the Assyrians\n7:47\nwere Akkadian speaking, so at this point now,\n7:49\nand as we get into the later Assyrian period,\n7:52\nwe'll start to have Aramaic be a more significant language,\n7:54\nanother Semitic language, but as you can see here,\n7:57\nthe Assyrian Empire at its peak controlled\n7:59\nmuch of the modern day Middle East.\n8:03\nNow, the Assyrian Empire would eventually collapse\n8:06\nin the seventh century BCE,\n8:09\nand it would be taken over by the Neobabylonian Empire.\n8:12\nI have a map of that right over here,\n8:16\nwhich also controlled much of the modern middle east.\n8:19\nProbably the most famous ruler of the Neobabylonian Empire\n8:22\nwas Nebuchadnezzar II from the Hebrew bible famous for\n8:26\ntaking the early Jewish people captive,\n8:31\nthe famous Babylonian captivity,\n8:33\nbut eventually they would be overthrown,\n8:35\nand they would be overthrown in the sixth century BCE\n8:39\nby the Persians and Cyrus the Great,\n8:43\nand that'll actually be the end of\n8:44\nthe Babylonian captivity according to biblical accounts.\n8:48\nBut the big picture is that Mesopotamia is called\n8:50\nthe cradle of civilization for a good reason.\n8:54\nNot only do we have these technological\n8:56\nand architectural advancements,\n8:58\ntheir religion, their writing has influenced civilization\n9:01\nsince, for the last five, six, 7,000 years.\n9:08\nWell, I'd say definitely the last 5,000 years,\n9:11\nand a lot of these ideas that came out of Mesopotamia,\n9:14\nlike written codes of law and the technologies\n9:17\nand all the rest follow with us today.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "Gentlemen of the Congress:\n\nI have called the Congress into extraordinary session because there are serious, very serious, choices of policy to be made, and made immediately, which it was neither right nor constitutionally permissible that I should assume the responsibility of making.\n\nOn the 3d of February last I officially laid before you the extraordinary announcement of the Imperial German Government that on and after the 1st day of February it was its purpose to put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every vessel that sought to approach either the ports of Great Britain and Ireland or the western coasts of Europe or any of the ports controlled by the enemies of Germany within the Mediterranean. That had seemed to be the object of the German submarine warfare earlier in the war, but since April of last year the Imperial Government had somewhat restrained the commanders of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then given to us that passenger boats should not be sunk and that due warning would be given to all other vessels which its submarines might seek to destroy, when no resistance was offered or escape attempted, and care taken that their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their lives in their open boats. The precautions taken were meagre and haphazard enough, as was proved in distressing instance after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business, but a certain degree of restraint was observed The new policy has swept every restriction aside. Vessels of every kind, whatever their flag, their character, their cargo, their destination, their errand, have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board, the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of belligerents. Even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of Belgium, though the latter were provided with safe-conduct through the proscribed areas by the German Government itself and were distinguished by unmistakable marks of identity, have been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or of principle.\n\nI was for a little while unable to believe that such things would in fact be done by any government that had hitherto subscribed to the humane practices of civilized nations. International law had its origin in the at tempt to set up some law which would be respected and observed upon the seas, where no nation had right of dominion and where lay the free highways of the world. By painful stage after stage has that law been built up, with meagre enough results, indeed, after all was accomplished that could be accomplished, but always with a clear view, at least, of what the heart and conscience of mankind demanded. This minimum of right the German Government has swept aside under the plea of retaliation and necessity and because it had no weapons which it could use at sea except these which it is impossible to employ as it is employing them without throwing to the winds all scruples of humanity or of respect for the understandings that were supposed to underlie the intercourse of the world. I am not now thinking of the loss of property involved, immense and serious as that is, but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of the lives of noncombatants, men, women, and children, engaged in pursuits which have always, even in the darkest periods of modern history, been deemed innocent and legitimate. Property can be paid for; the lives of peaceful and innocent people can not be. The present German submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare against mankind.\n\nIt is a war against all nations. American ships have been sunk, American lives taken, in ways which it has stirred us very deeply to learn of, but the ships and people of other neutral and friendly nations have been sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way. There has been no discrimination. The challenge is to all mankind. Each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it. The choice we make for ourselves must be made with a moderation of counsel and a temperateness of judgment befitting our character and our motives as a nation. We must put excited feeling away. Our motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the nation, but only the vindication of right, of human right, of which we are only a single champion.\n\nWhen I addressed the Congress on the 26th of February last, I thought that it would suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms, our right to use the seas against unlawful interference, our right to keep our people safe against unlawful violence. But armed neutrality, it now appears, is impracticable. Because submarines are in effect outlaws when used as the German submarines have been used against merchant shipping, it is impossible to defend ships against their attacks as the law of nations has assumed that merchantmen would defend themselves against privateers or cruisers, visible craft giving chase upon the open sea. It is common prudence in such circumstances, grim necessity indeed, to endeavour to destroy them before they have shown their own intention. They must be dealt with upon sight, if dealt with at all. The German Government denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all within the areas of the sea which it has proscribed, even in the defense of rights which no modern publicist has ever before questioned their right to defend. The intimation is conveyed that the armed guards which we have placed on our merchant ships will be treated as beyond the pale of law and subject to be dealt with as pirates would be. Armed neutrality is ineffectual enough at best; in such circumstances and in the face of such pretensions it is worse than ineffectual; it is likely only to produce what it was meant to prevent; it is practically certain to draw us into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness of belligerents. There is one choice we can not make, we are incapable of making: we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated. The wrongs against which we now array ourselves are no common wrongs; they cut to the very roots of human life.\n\nWith a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step I am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves, but in unhesitating obedience to what I deem my constitutional duty, I advise that the Congress declare the recent course of the Imperial German Government to be in fact nothing less than war against the Government and people of the United States; that it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it, and that it take immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough state of defense but also to exert all its power and employ all its resources to bring the Government of the German Empire to terms and end the war.\n\nWhat this will involve is clear. It will involve the utmost practicable cooperation in counsel and action with the governments now at war with Germany, and, as incident to that, the extension to those governments of the most liberal financial credits, in order that our resources may so far as possible be added to theirs. It will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible. It will involve the immediate full equipment of the Navy in all respects but particularly in supplying it with the best means of dealing with the enemy's submarines. It will involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the United States already provided for by law in case of war at least 500,000 men, who should, in my opinion, be chosen upon the principle of universal liability to service, and also the authorization of subsequent additional increments of equal force so soon as they may be needed and can be handled in training. It will involve also, of course, the granting of adequate credits to the Government, sustained, I hope, so far as they can equitably be sustained by the present generation, by well conceived taxation....\n\nWhile we do these things, these deeply momentous things, let us be very clear, and make very clear to all the world what our motives and our objects are. My own thought has not been driven from its habitual and normal course by the unhappy events of the last two months, and I do not believe that the thought of the nation has been altered or clouded by them I have exactly the same things in mind now that I had in mind when I addressed the Senate on the 22d of January last; the same that I had in mind when I addressed the Congress on the 3d of February and on the 26th of February. Our object now, as then, is to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the observance of those principles. Neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of the world is involved and the freedom of its peoples, and the menace to that peace and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic governments backed by organized force which is controlled wholly by their will, not by the will of their people. We have seen the last of neutrality in such circumstances. We are at the beginning of an age in which it will be insisted that the same standards of conduct and of responsibility for wrong done shall be observed among nations and their governments that are observed among the individual citizens of civilized states.\n\nWe have no quarrel with the German people. We have no feeling towards them but one of sympathy and friendship. It was not upon their impulse that their Government acted in entering this war. It was not with their previous knowledge or approval. It was a war determined upon as wars used to be determined upon in the old, unhappy days when peoples were nowhere consulted by their rulers and wars were provoked and waged in the interest of dynasties or of little groups of ambitious men who were accustomed to use their fellow men as pawns and tools. Self-governed nations do not fill their neighbour states with spies or set the course of intrigue to bring about some critical posture of affairs which will give them an opportunity to strike and make conquest. Such designs can be successfully worked out only under cover and where no one has the right to ask questions. Cunningly contrived plans of deception or aggression, carried, it may be, from generation to generation, can be worked out and kept from the light only within the privacy of courts or behind the carefully guarded confidences of a narrow and privileged class. They are happily impossible where public opinion commands and insists upon full information concerning all the nation's affairs.\n\nA steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a partnership of democratic nations. No autocratic government could be trusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants. It must be a league of honour, a partnership of opinion. Intrigue would eat its vitals away; the plottings of inner circles who could plan what they would and render account to no one would be a corruption seated at its very heart. Only free peoples can hold their purpose and their honour steady to a common end and prefer the interests of mankind to any narrow interest of their own.\n\nDoes not every American feel that assurance has been added to our hope for the future peace of the world by the wonderful and heartening things that have been happening within the last few weeks in Russia? Russia was known by those who knew it best to have been always in fact democratic at heart, in all the vital habits of her thought, in all the intimate relationships of her people that spoke their natural instinct, their habitual attitude towards life. The autocracy that crowned the summit of her political structure, long as it had stood and terrible as was the reality of its power, was not in fact Russian in origin, character, or purpose; and now it has been shaken off and the great, generous Russian people have been added in all their naive majesty and might to the forces that are fighting for freedom in the world, for justice, and for peace. Here is a fit partner for a league of honour.\n\nOne of the things that has served to convince us that the Prussian autocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very outset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities and even our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel, our peace within and without our industries and our commerce. Indeed it is now evident that its spies were here even before the war began; and it is unhappily not a matter of conjecture but a fact proved in our courts of justice that the intrigues which have more than once come perilously near to disturbing the peace and dislocating the industries of the country have been carried on at the instigation, with the support, and even under the personal direction of official agents of the Imperial Government accredited to the Government of the United States. Even in checking these things and trying to extirpate them we have sought to put the most generous interpretation possible upon them because we knew that their source lay, not in any hostile feeling or purpose of the German people towards us (who were, no doubt, as ignorant of them as we ourselves were), but only in the selfish designs of a Government that did what it pleased and told its people nothing. But they have played their part in serving to convince us at last that that Government entertains no real friendship for us and means to act against our peace and security at its convenience. That it means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors the intercepted Zimmermann note to the German Minister at Mexico City is eloquent evidence.\n\nWe are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that in such a government, following such methods, we can never have a friend; and that in the presence of its organized power, always lying in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose, there can be no assured security for the democratic governments of the world. We are now about to accept gage of battle with this natural foe to liberty and shall, if necessary, spend the whole force of the nation to check and nullify its pretensions and its power. We are glad, now that we see the facts with no veil of false pretence about them, to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples, the German peoples included: for the rights of nations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life and of obedience. The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\n\nJust because we fight without rancour and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\n\nI have said nothing of the governments allied with the Imperial Government of Germany because they have not made war upon us or challenged us to defend our right and our honour. The Austro-Hungarian Government has, indeed, avowed its unqualified endorsement and acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopted now without disguise by the Imperial German Government, and it has therefore not been possible for this Government to receive Count Tarnowski, the Ambassador recently accredited to this Government by the Imperial and Royal Government of Austria-Hungary; but that Government has not actually engaged in warfare against citizens of the United States on the seas, and I take the liberty, for the present at least, of postponing a discussion of our relations with the authorities at Vienna. We enter this war only where we are clearly forced into it because there are no other means of defending our rights.\n\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity towards a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us -- however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts. We have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship -- exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions towards the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy, who live amongst us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it towards all who are in fact loyal to their neighbours and to the Government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\n\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts -- for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free. To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do no other.",

And we assumed in that video\n0:14\nthat we were able to calculate the actual\n0:16\nexternal cost of a plastic bag.\n0:19\nThis two cents a bag is the impact on\n0:21\nlitter in the environment.\n0:22\nThen we were able to figure out\n0:24\nthat if we factor this in,\n0:25\ninstead of just having the regular\n0:27\nmarginal cost cover the suppliers,\n0:28\nif we added that marginal cost curve\n0:30\nto the external cost,\n0:32\nwe would get a supplier plus\n0:33\nexternal costs, marginal cost curve,\n0:36\nand then we'd get what is actually\n0:37\nthe optimal price and quantity of plastic bags\n0:42\nso that we actually do not eat into\n0:44\nour surplus by creating all of this\n0:45\nnegative surplus where the total cost\n0:49\nof the bags are higher than\n0:50\nthe total benefit.\n0:52\nOne thing that we did not touch on\n0:53\nin that video, is how does this actually happen?\n0:56\nIf we just let things be,\n0:59\nand we just had the supplier's\n1:00\nmarginal cost curve\n1:01\nand we have the consumer's demand curve,\n1:04\nin this case, the consumers were the supermarkets,\n1:06\nthen the equilibrium price that'll be\n1:08\nreached will be right over here\n1:09\nbecause although we're theoretically\n1:12\nsaying that there's this cost over here,\n1:14\nthe cost won't be factored in\n1:17\ninto the markets.\n1:18\nSo if you are the benevolent emperor\n1:21\nin this society, what do you do?\n1:23\nWhat do you do to get the quantity\n1:26\ncloser to this point right over here\n1:28\nthan what the equilibrium quantity\n1:30\nwill be when you don't factor in\n1:31\nthe external cost?\n1:33\nThere's a bunch of options here.\n1:34\nYou could just ban plastic bags ...\n1:37\nban plastic bags,\n1:41\nyou could put a quota on plastic bags,\n1:44\nyou could put a quota, so saying that\n1:47\nmore than a certain amount of bags\n1:50\ncould not be produced, or\n1:52\nyou could tax plastic bags,\n1:54\nor you could tax plastic bags.\n1:57\nLet's think about which of these will\n1:59\nresult in the most surplus,\n2:01\nthe most benefit to society in aggregate.\n2:05\nOne core assumption we're going to make\n2:06\nis that this is an accurate assessment\n2:10\nof the external cost per bag.\n2:13\nIf you were to just ban plastic bags\n2:15\nas this benevolent emperor,\n2:16\nmaybe seemingly or hopefully\n2:18\nbenevolent emperor of this society right here,\n2:20\nif you just banned plastic bags,\n2:22\nwhat would happen?\n2:23\nWell, then this market just won't exist.\n2:25\nAll of this surplus that could have existed,\n2:27\nwon't exist anymore,\n2:29\nso you would actually be destroying surplus.\n2:32\nYou could say, \"No, no, no ... plastic bags\n2:33\nare horrible. They should just be outright banned.\n2:35\nThere's no amount of benefit for which\n2:37\nplastic bags are worth using,\"\n2:40\nbut in that case, you're actually arguing\n2:41\nthis point right over here.\n2:43\nYou'd be arguing that, \"No, it's not\n2:45\n2 cents a bag, it's 10 cents a bag,\"\n2:46\nof negative externality, and because of that,\n2:50\nyou would have this curve shift up even more\n2:52\nand then there's no positive quantity there\n2:54\nand maybe a ban would be all right.\n2:56\nBut if the 2 cents is the externality,\n2:58\nthe negative externality,\n3:00\nand if you were to ban plastic bags,\n3:02\nthen you would actually be removing,\n3:04\nyou would be removing this surplus from society.\n3:07\nThat doesn't seem like a good option.\n3:10\nNow what about a quota?\n3:12\nYou kind of look at the study right over here\n3:15\nand you say, \"Look, the optimal amount\n3:17\nof plastic bags is 1.9 million bags per week,\n3:20\nso I will just say that that's most\n3:22\nthat the market can produce.\"\n3:24\nBut when you say that, that's assuming\n3:26\nthat you really do understand what this\n3:28\ndemand curve looks like.\n3:30\nI just drew a straight line here\n3:31\njust out of simplicity, and\n3:32\nassuming that you really do understand\n3:33\nwhat this marginal cost curve looks like.\n3:36\nThroughout this [unintelligible],\n3:38\nwe've been assuming that we kind of do\n3:39\nunderstand those things, but\n3:40\nin the real world, it's actually very hard\n3:43\nto know exactly what the marginal cost\n3:45\nof the curve looks like,\n3:46\nand it's also hard to know exactly\n3:47\nwhat the marginal benefit curve,\n3:49\nor the demand curve looks like,\n3:51\nespecially because they're always changing.\n3:53\nThere's always more competitors,\n3:54\nless competitors, more substitute products,\n3:56\nmore R&D, things are getting more efficient,\n3:58\nless efficient; and so it's very hard\n4:00\nto know what the true equilibrium\n4:03\nquantity should be.\n4:05\nA quota is difficult.\n4:07\nWe don't have quite the right information.\n4:10\nA tax is interesting.\n4:12\nA tax says, \"Look, regardless of\n4:14\nwhat the marginal cost curve really is,\n4:16\nwe're just going to shift it up by 2 cents.\"\n4:19\nWe saw that when we first talked about taxes.\n4:21\nWhen we first talked about taxes, we talked about\n4:24\nthey're introducing a dead weight loss\n4:26\nbecause you're not producing as much quantity\n4:28\nas you would have otherwise, or\n4:30\nas much quantity isn't being consumed.\n4:32\nBut here, a tax could actually prevent\n4:34\na dead weight loss because if you have\n4:36\na 2 cent tax, essentially adding the cost\n4:40\nof the negative externality in the form of a tax\n4:43\non top of the supplier's cost right over here,\n4:46\nyou are going to cause the equilibrium quantity\n4:48\nto be the quantity where you're not\n4:51\ngenerating all of this negative surplus,\n4:53\nand it's just a positive side effect,\n4:56\nand once again, this is all assuming\n4:57\nthat this is the right number,\n4:58\nbut it would be a positive side effect\n5:00\nthat you would also generate some revenue\n5:02\nfor the government.\n5:03\nWhat's good about the tax in this circumstance\n5:05\nright over here, you're not assuming anything\n5:07\nabout what the marginal cost curve looks like\n5:09\nor what the demand curve looks like.\n5:12\nAs long as you're assuming that this\n5:13\nis the right number,\n5:14\nthe tax will always shift whatever\n5:18\nthe marginal cost curve is,\n5:19\nit'll always shift it to the right point\n5:21\nto intersect wherever the demand curve is\n5:26\nat this equilibrium point,\n5:28\nthat gives us an equilibrium price\n5:29\nand an equilibrium quantity.\n5:30\nSo if this is the right number and\n5:32\nyou put a 2 cent tax per bag,\n5:34\na 2 cent tax per bag,\n5:37\nthen this is probably going to be the best option\n5:40\nin terms of optimizing the total surplus.",

although how far we go down determines how much pressure\n0:50\nthere is, the pressure is actually acting in all\n0:53\ndirections, including up.\n0:54\nThe reason why that makes sense is because I'm assuming\n0:58\nthat this is a static system, or that the fluids in this\n1:02\nliquid are stationary, or you even could imagine an object\n1:05\ndown here, and it's stationary.\n1:07\nThe fact that it's stationary tells us that the pressure in\n1:09\nevery direction must be equal.\n1:12\nLet's think about a molecule of water.\n1:13\nA molecule of water, let's say it's roughly a sphere.\n1:20\nIf the pressure were different in one direction or if the\n1:24\npressure down were greater than the pressure up, then the\n1:28\nobject would start accelerating downwards,\n1:30\nbecause its surface area pointing upwards is the same\n1:32\nas the surface area pointing downwards, so the force\n1:36\nupwards would be more.\n1:37\nIt would start accelerating downwards.\n1:39\nEven though the pressure is a function of how far down we\n1:43\ngo, at that point, the pressure is\n1:45\nacting in every direction.\n1:48\nLet's remember that, and now let's keep that in mind to\n1:51\nlearn a little bit about Archimedes' principle.\n1:54\nLet's say I submerge a cube into this liquid, and let's\n2:01\nsay this cube has dimensions d, so every side is d.\n2:17\nWhat I want to do is I want to figure out if there's any\n2:19\nforce or what is the net force acting on this\n2:22\ncube due to the water?\n2:25\nLet's think about what the pressure on this cube is at\n2:27\ndifferent points.\n2:29\nAt the depths along the side of the cube, we know that the\n2:32\npressures are equal, because we know at this depth right\n2:35\nhere, the pressure is going to be the same as at that depth,\n2:38\nand they're going to offset each other, and so these are\n2:40\ngoing to be the same.\n2:41\nBut one thing we do know, just based on the fact that\n2:44\npressure is a function of depth, is that at this point\n2:47\nthe pressure is going to be higher-- I don't know how much\n2:50\nhigher-- than at this point, because this point is deeper\n2:54\ninto the water.\n2:55\nLet's call this P1.\n2:59\nLet's call that pressure on top, PT, and let's call this\n3:03\npoint down here PD.\n3:06\nNo, pressure on the bottom, PB.\n3:11\nWhat's going to be the net force on this cube?\n3:17\nThe net force-- let's call that F sub N-- is going to be\n3:22\nequal to the force acting upwards on this object.\n3:27\nWhat's the force acting upwards on the object?\n3:29\nIt's going to be this pressure at the bottom of the object\n3:35\ntimes the surface area at the bottom of the object.\n3:38\nWhat's the surface area at the bottom of the object?\n3:41\nThat's just d squared.\n3:42\nAny surface of a cube is d squared, so the bottom is\n3:45\ngoing to be d squared minus-- I'm doing this because I\n3:54\nactually know that the pressure down here is higher\n3:56\nthan the pressure here, so this is going to be a larger\n3:58\nquantity, and that the net force is actually going to be\n4:01\nupwards, so that's why I can do the minus confidently up\n4:04\nhere-- the pressure at the top.\n4:07\nWhat's the force at the top?\n4:09\nThe force at the top is going to be the pressure on the top\n4:14\ntimes the surface area of the top of the cube,\n4:16\nright, times d squared.\n4:20\nWe can even separate out the d squared already at that point,\n4:24\nso the net force is equal to the pressure of the bottom\n4:30\nminus the pressure of the top, or the difference in pressure\n4:33\ntimes the surface area of either the top or the bottom\n4:37\nor really any of the sides of the cube.\n4:39\nLet's see if we can figure what these are.\n4:41\nLet's say the cube is submerged h units or h meters\n4:45\ninto the water.\n4:48\nSo what's the pressure at the top?\n4:51\nThe pressure at the top is going to be equal to the\n4:55\ndensity of the liquid-- I keep saying water, but it could be\n4:58\nany liquid-- times how far down we are.\n5:02\nSo we're h units down, or maybe h meters, times gravity.\n5:08\nAnd what's the pressure the bottom?\n5:10\nThe pressure at the bottom similarly would be the density\n5:15\nof the liquid times the depth, so what's the depth?\n5:18\nIt would be this h and then we're another d down.\n5:24\nIt's h plus d-- that's our total depth-- times gravity.\n5:29\nLet's just substitute both of those back into our net force.\n5:31\nLet me switch colors to keep from getting monotonous.\n5:35\nI get the net force is equal to the pressure at the bottom,\n5:40\nwhich is this.\n5:42\nLet's just multiply it out, so we get p times h times g plus\n5:52\nd times p times g.\n5:58\nI just distributed this out, multiplied this out.\n6:00\nThat's the pressure at the bottom, then minus the\n6:06\npressure at the top, minus phg, and then we learned it's\n6:13\nall of that times d squared.\n6:17\nImmediately, we see something cancels out.\n6:20\nphg, phg subtract.\n6:23\nIt cancels out, so we're just left with--\n6:25\nwhat's the net force?\n6:27\nThe net force is equal to dpg times d squared, or that\n6:36\nequals d cubed times the density of the\n6:42\nliquid times gravity.\n6:45\nLet me ask you a question: What is d cubed?\n6:50\nd cubed is the volume of this cube.\n6:51\nAnd what else is it?\n6:54\nIt's also the volume of the water displaced.\n6:56\nIf I stick this cube into the water, and the cube isn't\n6:59\nshrinking or anything-- you can even imagine it being\n7:03\nempty, but it doesn't have to be empty-- but that amount of\n7:05\nwater has to be moved out of the way in order for\n7:08\nthat cube to go in.\n7:11\nThis is the volume of the water displaced.\n7:15\nIt's also the volume of the cube.\n7:24\nThis is the density-- I keep saying water, but it could be\n7:28\nany liquid-- of the liquid.\n7:30\nThis is the gravity.\n7:32\nSo what is this?\n7:33\nVolume times density is the mass of the liquid displaced,\n7:38\nso the net force is also equal to the\n7:42\nmass of liquid displaced.\n7:47\nLet's just say mass times gravity, or we could say that\n7:52\nthe net force acting on this object is-- what's the mass of\n7:55\nthe liquid displaced times gravity?\n7:57\nThat's just the weight of liquid displaced.\n8:05\nThat's a pretty interesting thing.\n8:08\nIf I submerge anything, the net force acting upwards on\n8:12\nit, or the amount that I'm lighter by, is equal to the\n8:15\nweight of the water being displaced.\n8:18\nThat's actually called Archimedes' principle.\n8:20\nThat net upward force due to the fact that there's more\n8:24\npressure on the bottom than there is on the top, that's\n8:27\ncalled the buoyant force.\n8:28\nThat's what makes things float.\n8:30\nI'll leave you there to just to ponder that, and we'll use\n8:35\nthis concept in the next couple of videos to actually\n8:37\nsolve some problems. I'll see you soon.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nTwo words you'll hear thrown a lot in macroeconomic circles\n0:04\nare monetary policy and fiscal policy.\n0:11\nAnd they're normally talked about in the context of ways\n0:15\nto shift aggregate demand in one direction or another\n0:19\nand often times to kind of stimulate aggregate demand,\n0:21\nto shift it to the right.\n0:23\nAnd what I want to do in this video\n0:24\nis focus on what these two different tools who\n0:27\nare, who are the actors, and how do\n0:28\nthey go about actually shifting the aggregate demand curve.\n0:32\nSo monetary policy-- this is literally\n0:35\ndeciding how much money to print.\n0:37\nSo it's literally printing money--\n0:39\neither deciding to print more of it or deciding to print less.\n0:43\nIt tends to be done in the United States--\n0:45\nespecially in most large countries-- it's\n0:47\ndone by the central bank, which is sometimes directly\n0:52\npart of the government.\n0:54\nSometimes it's quasi-independent.\n0:56\nIn the US, it's a quasi-- The US central bank, which\n0:59\nis the Federal Reserve, is quasi-independent.\n1:02\nAnd in future videos we'll talk more\n1:04\nabout the governance structure of the Federal Reserve.\n1:08\nMost of the major appointees are made by the US government.\n1:12\nAll of its excess profits goes back to the US Treasury,\n1:15\nso in that way it's part of the US government.\n1:18\nBut it's set up to be-- also has some influence\n1:20\nfrom private industry.\n1:22\nThe member banks have a stake in what's going on.\n1:26\nIt often coordinates amongst member banks.\n1:28\nSo you have your Federal Reserve as a central bank\n1:31\nin the United States.\n1:31\nIt's quasi-independent, but it's been\n1:34\ngiven the right to print money.\n1:36\nAnd I'll just draw it here as physical dollars,\n1:38\nbut most of the money that is going to print actually\n1:40\nis electronic money.\n1:42\nAnd the way this affects the aggregate demand curve,\n1:45\nthe Federal Reserve doesn't just print money\n1:47\nand go out and start buying things with that money.\n1:49\nWell, it does buy things, but it doesn't\n1:51\ngo out and buy goods and services.\n1:52\nWhat it does with this is it essentially lends it out,\n1:55\nso it's essentially buying debt.\n2:02\nAnd if buying debt seems like a weird thing to say, buying debt\n2:05\nit is the same thing as lending money.\n2:10\nIf I buy a treasury bond, so if I'm buying debt,\n2:13\nI'm buying a treasury bond means I'm implicitly\n2:16\nlending that money.\n2:17\nIf I buy the bond directly from the government,\n2:19\nthat means I'm lending that money to the US government.\n2:22\nIf I directly buy a bond from a US corporation,\n2:26\nI'm essentially lending that money to the corporation.\n2:29\nThey're going to give me interest payments\n2:30\nin the form of coupons, and then they're\n2:32\ngoing to pay back that money at some future date.\n2:34\nSo this is essentially lending money.\n2:36\nAnd what this does is it's increasing the supply of money\n2:39\nthat's out there to be lent.\n2:41\nAnd so if we think of the market for money-- so let's\n2:45\nsee, now we're thinking microeconomic terms\n2:47\nfor the market for money.\n2:51\nIf this is the price of money, which is really\n2:53\njust the interest rate as a percentage,\n2:59\nand this right over here is the supply of money.\n3:04\nAnd I'll just draw-- so this might be our supply curve.\n3:08\nThat's supply.\n3:10\nAnd this is the demand curve.\n3:14\nAnd let's say right over here, this is short-term money.\n3:17\nAnd we won't focus on the different durations and all\n3:19\nof that.\n3:19\nBut let's say we're sitting right over here\n3:21\nat a clearing interest rate of 5%.\n3:24\nSo it makes sense.\n3:25\nSo this is right here.\n3:26\nThis is our demand curve.\n3:28\nSo all of the people who will get more than 5% benefit out\n3:31\nof the money-- maybe they have an investment where they could\n3:34\nget 10% on the money or 8% or 5.1%--\n3:37\nthey're all willing to borrow that money and then invest it\n3:40\nin whatever they want to do.\n3:41\nOr this might even be consumption,\n3:42\npeople who are saying, hey, 5%.\n3:44\nThat's worth it for me to go out and buy\n3:46\nthat thing that makes me whatever happy.\n3:48\nBut from an investment point of view it makes even more sense.\n3:49\nIf I'm going to get an 8% return on my money-- that's\n3:52\nmy benefit-- it makes sense for me to borrow it at 5%.\n3:55\nIt makes sense all the way up to 5.0001%.\n3:58\nI'd actually borrow it.\n3:59\nAnd so in the Federal Reserve, or any central bank,\n4:02\nprints money and it buys debt.\n4:04\nIt goes out into debt markets and it usually\n4:06\nbuys the safest kind of debt, but that\n4:07\naffects all of the debt markets.\n4:09\nIt goes out and buys debt market.\n4:11\nThey're essentially shifting the supply curve of money\n4:14\nto the right.\n4:15\nThey shift the supply curve to the right.\n4:17\nAnd so at any given interest rate\n4:19\nyou could say that there is more money.\n4:22\nAnd so the supply curve might look something like that.\n4:26\nAnd this is interesting because assuming the demand has not\n4:28\nshifted, what you now have is a different clearing\n4:32\nprice, a different equilibrium price, for the money.\n4:35\nMaybe this is now at 3%.\n4:40\nAnd you also have more money being lent and borrowed.\n4:43\nSo if this was the old quantity of money\n4:44\nthat was lent and borrowed-- I'm just\n4:47\ngoing to make up a number here.\n4:48\nLet's say that this is $100 billion in some time period.\n4:54\nAnd now we're at $120 billion.\n4:59\nSo now by essentially printing money, buying debt, increasing\n5:02\nthe supply of money two things happen.\n5:04\nInterest rates went down.\n5:06\nAnd so now you have all of these characters\n5:08\nout here who before, they weren't going to borrow money\n5:11\nat 5% because their benefit on that money\n5:14\nwas between 5% and 3%.\n5:16\nMaybe it's 4% or 3.5%.\n5:19\nIt didn't make sense for them to borrow at 5%\n5:21\nand invest it and only get a 4% return or a 3% return.\n5:25\nBut now that interest rates have gone down,\n5:27\nnow it does make sense for them to borrow the money,\n5:30\nall the way down to someone who has some type of project\n5:32\nor investment that has a 3% return.\n5:34\nThey also say, hey, I'm neutral.\n5:36\nNow I could borrow at 3%, and then I could invest it.\n5:39\nBut definitely the person with 3.1% or 3.2%,\n5:41\nif they have investments that give them that much,\n5:43\nthey would definitely want to borrow.\n5:45\nAnd we could assume that all this incremental borrowing--\n5:48\nso this little example that I did right over here--\n5:49\nall this incremental $20 billion of borrowing\n5:52\nis going to be spent.\n5:53\nPeople will borrow money not to just sit\n5:56\nbut stuff it into their mattresses.\n5:58\nThey'll borrow that money to go invest it in some way,\n6:01\nto spend it.\n6:02\nAnd so what this will do, all of this\n6:03\nwill shift aggregate demand to the right.\n6:06\nRight here, we're talking in microeconomic terms,\n6:08\nbut then if we think about aggregate supply and demand--\n6:11\nso this is aggregate.\n6:14\nLet me write aggregate right over here.\n6:17\nThis is price.\n6:18\nThis is real GDP.\n6:21\nThis is our aggregate demand.\n6:26\nAnd then our short run aggregate supply might look something\n6:29\nlike this.\n6:34\nAnd so if we're shifting aggregate demand\n6:36\nto the right where there's going to be more demand for goods\n6:39\nand services, these people are going to borrow this money\n6:41\nand spend it.\n6:42\nYou're going to essentially stimulate the economy.\n6:47\nSo this shifts to the right.\n6:49\nYou have a situation where real GDP will go from this state\n6:53\nto this state right over here.\n6:55\nSo it was expansionary.\n6:56\nAnd obviously, if the Federal Reserve decides\n6:58\nto print less money or if they even\n7:01\ndecide to essentially soak up the money that's in the market\n7:04\nby selling some of the debt that they own,\n7:07\nso that they're sucking dollars out of it,\n7:09\nthen the opposite effect would happen.\n7:11\nNow fiscal policy is essentially the government\n7:14\ndirectly going out there and demanding goods and services\n7:17\nfrom the economy.\n7:19\nYou have the government.\n7:21\nIt has two sources of revenue that it can spend.\n7:25\nIt has money from taxes.\n7:27\nIt has tax revenue.\n7:28\nAnd then it can go out and borrow money.\n7:30\nAnd so it also has access to debt markets.\n7:34\nAnd when the government borrows money,\n7:36\nthey're essentially issuing treasury bills,\n7:38\nif you're talking about the US Treasury Bills and Treasury\n7:40\nBonds.\n7:40\nIf you were to buy those from the US government,\n7:42\nyou're essentially lending money to the government\n7:44\nto finance their debt.\n7:47\nAnd so they can take these two sources of money,\n7:49\nand then if they decide to spend more-- and let's\n7:53\nsay that they're going to hold taxes fixed.\n7:55\nSo they're not going to take out any demand from the economy.\n7:57\nThey might ratchet up debt and then ratchet up spending.\n8:03\nAnd then this government is directly\n8:05\ngoing out there and demanding more goods and services.\n8:09\nSo that could also shift the aggregate demand curve\n8:12\nto the right.\n8:12\nSo these are two different levers, two different tools,\n8:15\nthat have been used in governments\n8:17\nall around the world to shift aggregate demand one way\n8:20\nor another or an attempt to shift aggregate demand one\n8:23\nway or the other.\n8:23\nMonetary policy is more indirect.\n8:25\nPrinting money, using that to increase the supply of money\n8:28\nthat's out there to be lent, that lowers interest rates.\n8:32\nAnd then because it lowers interest rates,\n8:35\nthere's more willingness to borrow and invest that money.\n8:38\nFiscal policy, you're directly going out there and just buying\n8:42\nmore goods and services by usually ratcheting up\n8:45\nyour debt.\n8:46\nOr fiscal policy could go the other way.\n8:47\nIf you're trying to restrain the economy, you could lower\n8:49\nyour debt, lower your spending, or you\n8:51\ncould do some other combination. s",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nEver since the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 to 1871,\n0:04\nthe Germans recognized that they were\n0:06\nlikely to face another war with France.\n0:08\nThat was the war that allowed Germany to unify.\n0:10\nThey humiliated France.\n0:12\nThey were able to capture some very valuable territory\n0:15\nfrom France, in particular Alsace and Lorraine,\n0:17\nwhich is very mineral rich.\n0:19\nAnd so the Germans were plotting too, well,\n0:21\nwhat are we going to do if we get into another war with them?\n0:23\nAt the same time, once France and Russia had this alliance,\n0:26\nGermany fully recognized if there is a war with France,\n0:29\nit's likely to not be just with France.\n0:31\nIt's likely to be a two front war.\n0:33\nOn the Western Front, they'll be in conflict with France.\n0:37\nAnd on the Eastern Front, they'll\n0:38\nbe in conflict with Russia.\n0:40\nAnd so to deal with this eventuality--\n0:42\nthis is all the scheming that Germany\n0:43\ndid in the decades going up to World War\n0:46\nI-- they came up with the Schlieffen Plan.\n0:49\nAnd I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it.\n0:57\nNamed for Alfred von Schlieffen, he\n0:59\nwas chief of the German Empire's general staff\n1:02\nfrom 1891 to 1905.\n1:05\nAnd it was based on how do you deal with a two front war?\n1:09\nAnd the general ides here were that Russia\n1:13\nhad a large and almost inexhaustible army.\n1:15\nBut because it was so large it would take a long time for it\n1:18\nto mobilize.\n1:23\nAnd the Germans are actually able to approximate it\n1:25\ncorrectly because this is how long it\n1:27\ndid take the Russians to mobilize\n1:28\nat the beginning of World War I. They estimated that it would\n1:31\ntake them about six weeks.\n1:34\nSo the Schlieffen Plan called for enough German troops\n1:38\non the Eastern Front, initially, in order\n1:40\nto keep the Russians at bay.\n1:43\nBut then the main fighting force of the Germans,\n1:45\nwhile the Russians are mobilizing,\n1:48\nis to go after France and try to essentially knock France out\n1:51\nof commission, so that they're not facing a two front\n1:53\nwar anymore.\n1:55\nAnd then have those troops go back\n1:56\nto fight against the Russians.\n1:58\nAnd the way that they wanted to do it\n2:00\nis by rolling through Belgium in a wheel like pattern like this.\n2:04\nAnd the reason why they wanted to do this wheel like pattern\n2:07\nis that they correctly predicted that the French were\n2:10\nvery eager to get this territory right over here.\n2:13\nAnd the French actually had a plan--\n2:14\nthey called it Plan 17- for going\n2:16\nafter Alsace and Lorraine.\n2:17\nIt was an offensive plan.\n2:19\nAnd the view is if the French army is\n2:20\ngoing in that direction, if the German army\n2:23\nrolls through Belgium and is able to get them from the rear,\n2:25\nthey could put the French army out of commission.\n2:28\nSo in early August 1914, the Germans,\n2:32\nonce they declared war on France and on Russia,\n2:35\nthe Germans tried to put the Schlieffen Plan into action.\n2:39\nAnd they frankly, almost succeeded.\n2:42\nSo through August and early September,\n2:46\nthe Germans were able to essentially roll\n2:49\nthrough Belgium and keep the combined, mainly French forces,\n2:56\nbut there was also some assistance from British,\n2:59\nto keep them on their heels.\n3:01\nAnd this happened all the way until early September\n3:04\nwhen they get near the Marne, or a little bit\n3:06\npast the Marne River in France.\n3:10\nAnd it was here that the Sixth French Army--\n3:13\nand when we talk about armies we're\n3:16\ntalking about huge numbers of troops.\n3:17\nThe Sixth French Army had over 200,000 troops in it.\n3:21\nWhen we're talking about the Battle of the Marne--\n3:23\nwhich I'm about to talk to you.\n3:24\nWe're talking about the first Battle of the Marne.\n3:27\nWe're talking about a battle that\n3:29\ninvolves two million troops.\n3:32\nSo these are battles that are occurring on an epic scale.\n3:35\nJust each of these armies-- this army\n3:37\nor this one, or even the German armies-- we're\n3:41\ntalking about tens to hundreds of thousands of troops.\n3:44\nIn general, an army characterize you're\n3:47\ntalking about over 50,000, 60,000 troops.\n3:51\nSo what happens as you go to early September, especially\n3:54\nSeptember 5, 1914, the Sixth French Army\n3:59\nrecognizes a mistake that the First German Army made.\n4:04\nBy trying to roll around like this,\n4:07\nthey exposed their right flank.\n4:09\nSo right over here would be the right flank of the German army.\n4:13\nAnd just as most mammals, our flanks\n4:17\nare our weak spot, that area between your ribs\n4:21\nand your hips, the same thing is true for armies.\n4:24\nThe front of the army tends to be\n4:26\nwhere you have the strongest forces.\n4:28\nAnd then you have your supply routes going back.\n4:31\nSo if you can outflank an army-- and that's\n4:33\nwhat a lot of military strategy is designed around--\n4:36\nyou can hit an army in its weaker points.\n4:38\nSo by September 5, the First German Army recognized this,\n4:43\nbut it was too late.\n4:44\nBy September 6, they were essentially\n4:48\nbeing confronted by the Sixth French Army.\n4:51\nAnd by essentially turning to meet them\n4:57\nthey created an opening between them and the Second German\n5:00\nArmy.\n5:00\nAnd that opening was able-- the French and the British\n5:04\nwere able to take advantage of that to essentially put\n5:06\nthe Germans on their heels after a month of advancing.\n5:10\nAnd so right over here, you have the various French armies.\n5:16\nAnd they were assisted by the British expeditionary force.\n5:22\nAnd so from the Battle of the Marne, which\n5:25\nwas essentially, most historians would say, between September 6,\n5:28\nor September 5, September 6 and September 12,\n5:31\nthey were able to put the Germans on the retreat.\n5:35\nThe Germans retreated past the Aisne River.\n5:37\nAnd then once you get into November\n5:39\nand the end of the year of 1914, the Germans essentially\n5:43\nentrenched themselves.\n5:44\nThey were literally building deep trenches\n5:48\nin northern France and a little bit of western Belgium.\n5:51\nAnd what I have right over here-- let\n5:53\nme see if I can draw it.\n5:54\nWhat I have right over here, what the boundaries are\n5:57\neventually happened after the Germans\n6:00\nsuffered, essentially, their first big defeat.\n6:03\nThey had to retreat and they had to literally retrench.\n6:06\nAnd this is what the borders would then be like.\n6:10\nAnd these were literally trenches getting dug here.\n6:14\nThis first stage of the war was hugely dynamic.\n6:17\nYou had armies moving fairly rapidly\n6:19\nover a period of weeks and months.\n6:22\nBut then once the Germans retrenched,\n6:23\nyou have roughly this position being static for the next three\n6:27\nyears and the famous trench warfare of the Western front\n6:30\nthat you might have seen movies on.\n6:33\nAnd I want to emphasize this was a big deal.\n6:35\nThe first Battle of the Marne-- sometimes\n6:37\nit's called the Miracle of the Marne--\n6:41\nif the French, with British help,\n6:43\nwere not able to push the Germans back,\n6:45\nthey might have accomplished the Schlieffen Plan\n6:47\nand actually maybe would have won World War I,\n6:50\nor at least been able to win the Western front fairly quickly.\n6:53\nAnd then been able to deal with the Russians\n6:55\na little bit better.\n6:56\nBut because of the Miracle at the Marne--\n6:59\nwhich was hugely bloody.\n7:00\nWe're talking about 500,000 casualties on both sides.\n7:03\nWe're talking 100,000 to 200,000 dead on both sides.\n7:07\nBut because of that, that was able to hold off the Germans.\n7:10\nBut it got the Western front into this ugly three year\n7:13\nlong trench warfare.",

In fact, President Wilson has just won a re-election based\n0:10\non the platform that he kept us out of war.\n0:14\nAnd to large degree, he was able to keep the US out of war\n0:17\nbecause the German Empire had pulled back\n0:19\nfrom its unrestricted submarine warfare.\n0:22\nAfter the sinking of the Lusitania\n0:23\nand how angered America had gotten,\n0:25\nthey said, OK, we're not going to attack\n0:27\npassenger vessels anymore.\n0:28\nWe're only going to attack things that are definitely\n0:31\nBritish, non-passenger vessels.\n0:34\nBut as we go into January 1917, the British blockade\n0:39\non the Central Powers was having its effect.\n0:41\nAnd the Central Powers were getting desperate,\n0:43\nin particular Germany.\n0:45\nAnd so they are eager to essentially do\n0:47\nthe same to the British.\n0:49\nOnce again, go with the unrestricted submarine warfare.\n0:53\nBut the Germans knew that if they\n0:55\nwere to go back to this, that it's likely that the US would\n0:58\nenter the war on the side of the Allies.\n1:01\nSo knowing that was likely to happen.\n1:03\nThey said, well, how could we slow the US down.\n1:05\nAnd the thinking was, well, maybe we could somehow\n1:07\nenlisted the help of Mexico which at the time\n1:10\nwas not the best terms with the United States.\n1:13\nAnd so Arthur Zimmerman who was the German Foreign Secretary,\n1:19\nthe equivalent of the United States Secretary of State.\n1:21\nThe Foreign Minister, Arthur Zimmerman\n1:24\nsends an encoded a telegram to the Mexicans.\n1:28\nAnd it's encoded, especially because it\n1:30\nhas to go over lines that are controlled by the Americans.\n1:34\nAnd in it, he actually proposes an alliance\n1:38\nto slow the Americans down.\n1:41\nSo this is what he wrote.\n1:42\nSo this is a coded telegram.\n1:44\nAnd then, it was actually intercepted\n1:46\nby British intelligence and decoded and then shared\n1:49\nwith the Americans, and then that\n1:51\nwas also then made public to the American public.\n1:55\nAnd so this is why it's fascinating to actually read\n1:57\nthis stuff.\n1:57\nThis is January 1917.\n2:00\nThis is the Germans talking to the Mexicans.\n2:02\n\"We intend to begin on the first of February\n2:05\nunrestricted submarine warfare.\n2:09\nWe shall endeavor in spite of this\n2:11\nto keep the United States of America neutral.\n2:13\nIn the event of this not succeeding,\n2:16\nwe make Mexico a proposal alliance\n2:18\non the following basis-- make war together, make peace\n2:22\ntogether, generous financial support, and an understanding\n2:26\non our part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost\n2:32\nterritory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.\n2:37\nThe settlement in detail is left to you.\n2:39\nYou will inform the President--\" they're\n2:41\ntalking about the president of Mexico.\n2:42\n\"--of the above most secretly as soon as the outbreak of war\n2:46\nwith the United States of America is certain and add\n2:50\nthe suggestion that he should, on his own initiative,\n2:53\ninvite Japan to immediate adherence and at the same time\n2:56\nmediate between Japan and ourselves.\n2:59\nPlease call the President's attention to the fact\n3:02\nthat the ruthless employment of our submarines\n3:06\nnow offers the prospect of compelling England\n3:09\nin a few months to make peace.\n3:12\nSigned Zimmerman.\"\n3:14\nNow, the Mexicans, when they read this,\n3:15\nthey really didn't take it too seriously.\n3:17\nThey didn't think that they could seriously\n3:19\nengage the US in a war.\n3:20\nThey couldn't seriously take back\n3:21\nor occupy these territories.\n3:23\nSo they didn't really think much of it.\n3:24\nThe real effect of this telegram was\n3:26\nto make the American public angry.\n3:30\nThey were going to go back into the unrestricted submarine\n3:32\nwarfare.\n3:33\nAnd the Germans, themselves, talk about ruthless-- \"ruthless\n3:36\nemployment of our the submarines.\"\n3:40\nSo when people talk about, what were the causes.\n3:42\nWhat brought the US into war?\n3:44\nThe ones that are typically cited\n3:46\nare the unrestricted submarine warfare.\n3:49\nThe sinking of the Lusitania.\n3:50\nThe Zimmerman telegram that was trying\n3:52\nto get Mexico to somehow get into a war with the US\n3:56\nand reclaim these territories.\n3:59\nAnd as we'll see, a few months after this,\n4:02\nthe US actually does declare war on Germany\n4:06\nand enter into World War I.",

with the Austrians and now since\n1:54\nthe Austro-Hungarian empire is being broken up,\n1:56\nthe Hungarians, the Ottomans, so on and so forth.\n1:59\nThe Treaty of Versailles did several things.\n2:02\nFirst, this was kind of in line\n2:04\nespecially with the French-thinking, is\n2:06\nit assigned the guilt to Germany ...\n2:08\nSo war guilt.\n2:10\nWar guilt for Germany.\n2:14\nAnd depending on where you view,\n2:16\nyou could view this as a fairly strong thing.\n2:17\nThe argument for saying Germany is\n2:19\nresponsible for the war is in\n2:21\nlate July, early August of 1914,\n2:25\nit didn't take much for Germany\n2:27\nto declare war on Russia, then on France,\n2:29\nand then invade Belgium.\n2:31\nThis was literally a matter of days.\n2:33\nIt was pretty clear that Germany was\n2:34\nalready mobilized to do this,\n2:36\nit was eager to do this,\n2:37\nand it did do this without much provocation.\n2:40\nAt that point, it was really just based on\n2:42\nRussian mobilization.\n2:43\nThose who would argue this was a little strong,\n2:45\nwould say Germany definitely played a role\n2:48\nin the war, in maybe escalating the war,\n2:50\nbut it didn't start the war.\n2:52\nYou have the assassination of\n2:54\nthe Archduke of Franz Ferdinand,\n2:57\nof Austro-Hungary.\n2:59\nIt was supported by elements in Serbia.\n3:04\nThen you have the Austro-Hungarians who\n3:05\nput out these very hard terms to\n3:08\nthe Serbians, bring these people to justice\n3:10\nimmediately, otherwise we're declaring war.\n3:12\nIt seemed like they wanted to declare war.\n3:14\nThey do declare war in July of 1914.\n3:16\nThe Russians, they don't let that be\n3:18\na little regional conflict,\n3:19\nthe Russians decide to start mobilizing,\n3:22\ngiving the Germans the pretext to\n3:26\njustify their invasions,\n3:27\nto kind of trigger this blank check\n3:29\nthat they've given the Austro-Hungarians.\n3:31\nThere's a lot of blame that could go around,\n3:34\nbut the Treaty of Versailles places it\n3:36\nwith Germany.\n3:37\nThis justifies the rationale to make\n3:40\nGermany pay for the war.\n3:42\nThis leads to reparations ...\n3:45\nReparations for Germany,\n3:46\nwhich is essentially is like,\n3:47\n\"Look, Germany, you don't have to pay\n3:49\nthe ally powers for all of their lost,\n3:51\nespecially their losses to their\n3:53\neconomy due to the fact that you\n3:55\nare guilty of starting of this war guilt.\"\n4:01\nThe reparations were not just in\n4:02\npaper currency, the reparations were\n4:05\nin gold, in resources.\n4:07\nIt was a very tangible reparations.\n4:10\nIt's an interesting question because\n4:11\nthese reparations are often referred to\n4:14\nwhen people talked to,\n4:15\nthese were disabling reparations.\n4:17\nThey brought the German economy down.\n4:19\nIt is an open question. They were large.\n4:22\nIn modern dollars, the estimates I've seen,\n4:24\nthey were approximately\n4:25\n$400 billion in 2013 money.\n4:31\nThat is a very, very large number,\n4:33\nbut it's not a huge number for\n4:34\na reasonably-sized economy like Germany.\n4:37\nAlthough the economy was in bad shape\n4:38\nat the end of World War I.\n4:40\nIt's not clear whether it by itself\n4:43\nwould have debilitated their economy.\n4:46\nMore likely, or if you were to think\n4:48\nit's a cause, it's more the humiliation of it,\n4:50\nthat generations of Germans,\n4:52\nmany of them; 10, 20, 30 years in the future,\n4:54\nhad nothing to do with World War I,\n4:56\nwould be continuing to pay\n4:57\nreparations to the allies.\n5:00\nSo there's a question of its impact on\n5:01\nthe economy and there's just the question\n5:05\nof how humiliating it was.\n5:10\nAs we go, the reparations only last\n5:12\nfor about 10 years and\n5:14\nGermany pays the equivalent of about\n5:16\n$60 billion in modern terms,\n5:18\n$60 billion in 2013 dollars.\n5:20\nThat's equivalent to about $5 billion\n5:22\nin 1920 money.\n5:25\nOn top of the reparations,\n5:27\nthe allies were not interested in\n5:29\nfighting another war with Germany,\n5:31\nalthough ironically, by having very harsh\n5:33\nterms of the treaty, they might have\n5:34\ntriggered the next war in World War II,\n5:37\nThe Rise of Hitler.\n5:38\nSince they didn't want to have another\n5:40\nwar with Germany, they essentially limited\n5:41\nthe German army to 100,000 men,\n5:44\nwhich is a very small army,\n5:46\nas we've seen in many of the battles.\n5:48\nYou had battles with 400,000 or 500,000 men,\n5:51\nso this is pretty much just like a\n5:53\npolice force, it's not really an army.\n5:56\nThey weren't allowed any longer to have\n5:57\nsubmarines, U-boats, any kind of\n6:01\nheavy military equipment, artillary,\n6:03\nheavy artillary, military airplanes,\n6:06\nbattleships of any kind.\n6:09\nIt was really just a scaffold of an army\n6:11\nso that there wouldn't be another,\n6:14\nor they hoped there would not be,\n6:16\nanother German invasion.\n6:18\nOn top of that, Germany was stripped of territory.\n6:23\n... Territory ...\n6:24\nSome of that was directly in Germany.\n6:27\nPoland was carved out of part of\n6:33\nthe German empire.\n6:34\nThis is the new Poland that's carved out\n6:36\nout of the Paris Peace Conference.\n6:38\nYou see right over here, it cuts Germany\n6:40\ninto two pieces.\n6:41\nEast Prussia is still part of Germany,\n6:43\nbut it's all by itself right out here.\n6:45\nPoland is cut out,\n6:46\nGermany loses Alsace-Lorraine, which\n6:48\nit captured in 1871 after the\n6:50\nFranco-Prussian war.\n6:52\nMineral-rich region, the French had been\n6:54\neager to get it back.\n6:55\nThe Germans, actually that was one of their\n6:57\narguable justification why they wanted\n6:59\nto premptively attack France,\n7:00\nbecause they knew that France was\n7:02\neager to capture it back\n7:03\nat some point in the future.\n7:05\nOn top of that, Germany lost its colonies.\n7:09\nGermany was nowhere near as big of an\n7:11\nempire as the British or even the French,\n7:13\nit was actually a fairly new country\n7:14\nformed in 1871, but it did have an empire.\n7:19\nIt had colonies in southwest Africa,\n7:22\nI'll do this in darker colors,\n7:23\nactually throughout Africa and had colonies\n7:27\nin the Pacific.\n7:29\nIt even had a colony in China.\n7:34\nAll of that was then given over to\n7:37\nthe allies.\n7:40\nThe big idea, from the Treaty of Versailles,\n7:42\nis that, most historians would say it\n7:44\nwas really kind of sticking it to\n7:46\nthe Germans.\n7:47\nThe Germans felt it was humilating\n7:48\nand one could argue that it led to\n7:51\nsome of the extremism that we'll see\n7:53\nin the next few decades of Germany.\n7:55\nThe one win that Woodrow Wilson was able\n7:57\nto get out the Treaty of Versailles,\n7:59\nis it did set up the League of Nations.\n8:01\nThe League of Nations.\n8:05\nThe irony here is that the US does not\n8:08\nratify the Treaty of Versailles because\n8:09\nit's suspicious of these kind of\n8:11\nextra national organizations.\n8:13\nIt actually wasn't happy with some of the\n8:14\nterritorial distribution, that it was\n8:16\njust giving it from empire to another\n8:18\nas opposed to having self-determination.\n8:21\nThe US was not actually a signatory,\n8:23\nit did not actually sign the treaty.\n8:26\nIt did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles.\n8:28\nRegardless of that, the Treaty of Versailles\n8:30\nhad a huge impact in sticking it to the Germans.\n8:34\nOn top of that, the Paris Peace Conference,\n8:36\nas we've already said,\n8:37\nhad various treaties with the other\n8:39\ncentral powers and some of the,\n8:42\nand I'm not going to go into detail\n8:43\non what happened, especially\n8:44\nthe Ottoman Empire, that's worth another video,\n8:46\nbut the big effect on the Austro-Hungarian\n8:50\nEmpire is that it essentially is not\n8:51\nan empire anymore.\n8:52\nIt was split up into various countries.\n8:54\nAustria was set up as a separate country.\n8:57\nActually the Treaty of Versailles,\n8:59\nin the Treaty of Versailles,\n9:00\nGermany is forbidden from in any way\n9:03\nmerging with Austria, a German-speaking country.\n9:06\nYou have Hungary becoming a separate state.\n9:11\nYou have a new state of Czechoslovakia.\n9:14\nYou have a new state of Yugoslavia.\n9:18\nAll of a sudden, the trigger of\n9:23\nWorld War I, the desire of having this\n9:24\nunified southern Slavik state is now\n9:26\nbecoming a reality.\n9:28\nYou have Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia ...\n9:32\nand Slovenia are taken out of\n9:33\nthe Austro-Hungarian empire.\n9:36\nYou have a major redrawing of the map\n9:38\nof Europe.\n9:39\nSome of these new nations here\n9:41\nin eastern Europe are out of\n9:44\nthe old Russian empire.\n9:45\nThey were able to declare their independence,\n9:47\nsome of it short-lived before becoming\n9:49\nsatellite states or becoming part of\n9:50\nthe USSR, but they had their\n9:53\nshort-lived independence after the fall\n9:56\nof the Russian empire.\n9:57\nThe map of Europe is dramatically changed\n10:00\ndue to the Paris Peace Conference,\n10:01\nthe Treaty of Versailles,\n10:02\nthe fall of the Russian empire,\n10:04\nthe other treaties that were outcomes\n10:07\nof World War I.",

And war profiteers,\n4:31\nthese are people who might be selling arms to the Allies.\n4:35\nOr who might sell arms to the US government\n4:37\nif the US were to get into a war that might somehow\n4:39\nsupply the troops.\n4:40\nAnd it includes, potentially, folks on Wall Street.\n4:43\nThere were significant lending to the Allies,\n4:46\nand mainly the Allies, not the Central Power.\n4:49\nAnd so the view is if the Allies win,\n4:50\nthose loans are going to be made good.\n4:53\nAnd I had the entire text of the speech\n4:56\nfrom Senator George Norris who was one of five senators,\n5:00\nor sorry, one of six senators to vote against the resolution\n5:04\nto go to war.\n5:04\nThere were 50 representatives who also voted against it.\n5:09\nThis is a little excerpt but also in this tutorial,\n5:11\nI have the full text of his speech.\n5:12\nAnd I highly, highly, highly recommend reading that\n5:15\nalong with Wilson's text of his speech to Congress in his war\n5:20\nmessage.\n5:21\nBut I'll just read this part because it does, I think,\n5:23\npoint out that the US, from the beginning,\n5:26\ndid have biases that were more pro-British.\n5:30\nAnd so this is part of his speech.\n5:31\n\"The reason given by the President\n5:33\nin asking Congress to declare war against Germany\n5:36\nis that the German government has declared certain war zones,\n5:39\nwithin which by the use of submarines,\n5:41\nshe sinks, without notice, American ships\n5:43\nand destroys American lives.\n5:45\nThe first war zone was declared by Great Britain.\n5:49\nShe gave us and the world notice of it\n5:51\non the 4th day of November 1914.\n5:54\nThe zone became effective November 5, 1914.\n5:58\nThis zone, so declared by Great Britain,\n6:00\ncovered the whole of the North Sea.\n6:02\nThe first German war zone was declared\n6:04\non the 4th day of February, 1915,\n6:07\njust three months after the British war zone was declared.\n6:10\nGermany gave 15 days notice of the establishment\n6:13\nof her zone, which became effective\n6:15\non the 18th day of February, 1915.\n6:18\nThe German war zone cover the English Channel\n6:21\nand the high seawaters around the British Isles.\n6:24\nIt is unnecessary to cite authority\n6:26\nto show that both of these orders declaring military zones\n6:30\nwere illegal and contrary to international law.\n6:34\nIt is sufficient to say that our government has officially\n6:37\ndeclared both of them to be illegal\n6:40\nand has officially protested against both of them.\n6:43\nThe only difference is that, in the case of Germany\n6:46\nwe have persisted in our protest,\n6:48\nwhile in the case of England, we have submitted.\"\n6:51\nAnd I encourage you, once again, to read\n6:54\nthe text of both Wilson's speech and Senator Norris' speech\n7:00\nand come up to your, with your own decisions.\n7:02\nAnd it might be a little bit of both.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWe know the US is running a relatively large trade\n0:03\ndeficit relative to China in 2009.\n0:06\nWe imported $260 billion more than we exported to China.\n0:13\nAnd we know from the last few videos\n0:15\nthat the way that China is keeping their currency\n0:18\nfrom appreciating because of this trade imbalance\n0:20\nis that they're going out there, printing money, and using\n0:23\nthat yuan to buy dollar assets.\n0:27\nAnd we see over here in 2006, 2007, 2008,\n0:31\nmajor increases in US assets.\n0:34\nBut what's a little bit more interesting\n0:36\nis that, in 2009, we didn't have a huge increase.\n0:39\nIt's pretty large by any standard, but not large enough\n0:42\nto offset the actual trade imbalance.\n0:44\nSo how did China keep its currency peg?\n0:47\nEven better, let's actually look at-- because this isn't just\n0:50\nthe Chinese government.\n0:51\nThese are just ownership of US assets by Chinese nationals.\n0:56\nBut we can actually look at the major foreign holders\n0:59\nof treasury securities.\n1:01\nThis actually comes from the Treasury's own website.\n1:04\nAnd it tells us how much different central banks,\n1:08\nhow many the treasury securities they are actually holding.\n1:12\nAnd you can see China is the biggest holder.\n1:16\nIf you go to November of 2009, it has $929 billion.\n1:21\nThis is the People's Bank of China.\n1:23\nIt has $929 billion worth of US treasuries.\n1:29\nBut what's interesting here, it is the largest holder,\n1:31\nbut as we go from November of 2009 to November of 2010\n1:35\ntheir holdings actually went down.\n1:38\nNot by a ton.\n1:39\nThey're still right around $900 billion.\n1:41\nBut they went down.\n1:43\nSo given the fact that we have this trade deficit, given\n1:45\nthe fact that they want to peg their currency,\n1:48\nand that they want to print money, and go\n1:49\nbuy other people's assets, how did this happen?\n1:52\nHow did the number of treasuries actually go down?\n1:56\nAnd actually how were they able to reduce the amount of all US\n2:00\nassets that they bought?\n2:03\nNow, the treasury answer is they don't\n2:05\nhave to just buy treasuries.\n2:06\nThey could by other US assets, but even over here we\n2:09\nsaw that they didn't buy a ton of other US assets.\n2:12\nAnd a clue to what's happening here,\n2:15\nand this isn't exactly what's necessarily happening,\n2:17\nit's far more complicated than I could explain in one video,\n2:20\nis that we do see other countries whose US Treasury\n2:23\nholdings are increasing dramatically\n2:25\nover the course of 2010.\n2:27\nIn particular, you see the United Kingdom.\n2:31\nTheir holdings have grown from $155 billion to $500 billion\n2:36\nover the course of 2010.\n2:38\nAnd this is relative.\n2:39\nThe United Kingdom does not have a significant trade imbalance\n2:43\none way or the other with the United States.\n2:45\nAnd we actually see we actually see that it's currency really\n2:49\ndidn't change much over the course of 2010.\n2:52\nIt's been about the same.\n2:54\nAnd this looks more dramatic than it really is.\n2:57\nSo the answer, and it could be much more complicated\n3:00\nthan this, is that China has decided to somewhat diversify\n3:03\nfrom buying US treasuries, and in particular US assets.\n3:07\nAnd maybe they're diversifying to the pound sterling,\n3:10\nmaybe they're diversifying to the Euro.\n3:12\nAnd so they will start buying, say, British assets.\n3:17\nBut the British don't want their currency\n3:19\nto appreciate too much because then they'll\n3:21\nsuffer trade consequences.\n3:23\nTheir goods will be too expensive.\n3:25\nAnd so the British Central Bank would then\n3:27\nwant to maybe, so that their currency does not\n3:29\nappreciate relative to the dollar,\n3:31\nthey'll want to go and buy American assets.\n3:35\nAnd that's what it looks like is actually happening.\n3:37\nAnd maybe one other small point is that the Chinese government\n3:40\nhas slowly allowed its currency to appreciate.\n3:43\nBut the appreciation isn't as dramatic\n3:46\nas this chart makes it look.\n3:47\nThis is 6.8 yuan to the dollar at the beginning of 2010\n3:53\nto about 6.6.\n3:55\nAnd we're not getting close to 0 here.\n3:57\nThis is just from 6.8 to 6.6.\n3:59\nBut over the last several years they\n4:01\nhave slowly been allowing their currency to appreciate.\n4:04\nBut what's really happening is that they're diversifying away\n4:07\nfrom dollar assets.\n4:08\nBut when they buy those other currencies\n4:10\nthose people are going to want to buy dollar assets to keep\n4:12\ntheir currency from moving too much.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\n(piano playing)\n0:04\nDr. Steven Zucker: We're on the first floor\n0:04\nof Orsanmichele, which is this extraordinarily\n0:07\ncomplicated and important building.\n0:09\nIt's a grainary and it's odd to think\n0:11\nof a grainary right in the middle of town.\n0:13\nDr. Beth Harris: Well, we don't often\n0:15\nthink about granaries.\n0:17\nGranaries were a place to store grain.\n0:20\nDr. Zucker: But this was incredibly important\n0:21\nbecause there were years when a town\n0:23\nmight be under siege and you couldn't get to the fields,\n0:26\nor there might be bad harvests.\n0:27\nDr. Harris: Right, so right here on the first floor\n0:29\nof Orsanmichele, there was a grain market\n0:32\nand it was open.\n0:33\nDr. Zucker: And then upstairs there were\n0:35\nthe storage areas and those are huge spaces.\n0:38\nDr. Harris: So this was, at one point,\n0:39\nthe church and then became a grainary\n0:42\nand there was an image of the Madonna\n0:45\nthat was located here that was believed to have\n0:47\nmiraculous powers and at some point it burned\n0:50\nand then another image of the Virgin was created\n0:53\nDr. Zucker: Was endued with the same powers\n0:56\nand I think we're up to the third version.\n0:58\nThis was by Bernardo Daddi, but it's surrounded\n1:01\nby this extraordinary alter,\n1:03\nwhich was by [Orcania], who we generally\n1:05\nthink of as a painter.\n1:07\nDr. Harris: It's an amazing tabernacle\n1:09\nhousing this miraculous image of the Virgin,\n1:12\nso we have to imagine that this space was once open.\n1:16\nDr. Zucker: Okay, so the walls that are there now\n1:17\nwe're not there originally.\n1:18\nThis was really a part of the city.\n1:20\nThe city, in a sense, flowed through it.\n1:22\nI think it's important to think about this place\n1:24\nas an intersection of the spiritual,\n1:27\nit was a church, and of the sort of everyday\n1:30\nbusiness of the city, that is it was a grainary.\n1:32\nIn even it's location, it's midway between\n1:36\nthe great cathedral the Duomo and\n1:38\nof the town hall, the Signoria.\n1:40\nDr. Harris: It's here that the first Renaissance\n1:42\nsculptures were created for the niches\n1:45\non the outside of this building.\n1:47\nIt's in this context that the first, really,\n1:50\nhumanist Renaissance sculptures are born.\n1:53\nDr. Zucker: Let's go upstairs\n1:54\nbecause sculptures that used to be in the niches\n1:56\nare now all protected upstairs in the area\n1:58\nthat used to hold the grain.\n2:00\nDr. Harris: We just climbed up a long flight of stairs\n2:03\nand we entered a large open space,\n2:06\nfilled with the sculptures, the monumental figures,\n2:10\nthat stood on the outside of Orsanmichele\n2:13\nin the niches.\n2:15\nDr. Zucker: So, now if you go outside,\n2:16\nyou see casts of the originals, which are here\n2:19\nbecause it's safer from the elements.\n2:21\nDr. Harris: To protect them.\n2:22\nDr. Zucker: Yeah.\n2:23\nDr. Harris: In the very early 15th century\n2:24\nthe guilds of Florence each were responsible\n2:27\nfor completing a figure for a niche\n2:31\non the outside of Orsanmichele\n2:33\nand the guilds each commissioned a sculptor\n2:35\nof their choice and we're sitting in front\n2:39\nof Donatello's Saint Mark, which was commissioned\n2:42\nby the Linen Drapers Guild.\n2:44\nDonatello gives us this classical figure.\n2:47\nDr. Zucker: So, what is classical about it?\n2:49\nI mean, the first things your eyes see,\n2:51\nof course, is this incredible contrapposto\n2:52\nthat comes through even under that heavy cloth.\n2:55\nI mean, look at the way, for instance,\n2:57\nthat his right engaged leg, the drape falls down\n3:01\nto almost as if that's the fluting of the column.\n3:03\nDr. Harris: And we can see his left knee\n3:04\npressing through the drapery, so Donatello\n3:07\nis really reviving contrapposto,\n3:09\nwhich hasn't been seen in western art\n3:12\nin a thousand years.\n3:14\nDr. Zucker: But it's so beautifully handled.\n3:16\nYou have the sense of the absolute stability\n3:19\nof this figure and yet the sense of his movement.\n3:22\nDr. Harris: The thing that's most impressive\n3:24\nis the psychological intensity of this figure,\n3:26\nwhich is really overwhelming.\n3:29\nThere's a sense, almost as though,\n3:31\nalong with the contrapposto, he's going to move\n3:34\nand he's going to speak.\n3:36\nThere's a real sense of the dignity of Mark here\n3:40\nand I think by extension, that sense that one has\n3:43\nin the Florentine Renaissance of the dignity of man,\n3:45\nof human beings.\n3:47\nDr. Zucker: There's a kind of intensity.\n3:48\nThere's a kind of focus.\n3:49\nThere's a kind of deep human sense of understanding\n3:53\nin that face, in the just little bit\n3:56\nof the furrow of the brow that you can see\n3:58\nand the way that the head is cocked slightly\n4:01\nand it's off-center in terms of the shoulders,\n4:04\nturning back around and there's an interior\n4:07\nawareness, a kind of interior intelligence\n4:10\nthat comes through so starkly.\n4:12\nDr. Harris: At the same time, without a halo.\n4:16\nDr. Zucker: Yeah.\n4:16\nDr. Harris: I have no doubt that this is\n4:18\nsomeone who sees something that ordinary human beings\n4:22\ndon't see, when you look at his eyes,\n4:24\nhe is, in a way, seeing past us.\n4:26\nDr. Zucker: So, isn't that the core\n4:28\nof the story of the Florentine experience\n4:30\nin the 15th century?\n4:32\nYou have this intensely devout culture\n4:35\nand yet at the same time, you have a culture\n4:37\nthat is beginning to really celebrate human experience,\n4:40\nthe individual and the idea of the rational.\n4:43\n(piano

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWelcome back.\n0:01\nSo I was trying to rush and finish a problem in the last\n0:05\ntwo minutes of the video, and I realize that's just bad\n0:08\nteaching, because I end up rushing.\n0:09\nSo this is the problem we were going to work on, and you'll\n0:11\nsee a lot of these.\n0:12\nThey just want you to become familiar with the variables in\n0:17\nNewton's law of gravitation.\n0:19\nSo I said that there's two planets, one is Earth.\n0:23\nNow I have time to draw things, so that's Earth.\n0:27\nAnd then there's Small Earth.\n0:28\nAnd Small Earth-- well, maybe I'll just call it the small\n0:32\nplanet, so we don't get confused.\n0:34\nIt's green, showing that there's probably\n0:37\nlife on that planet.\n0:40\nLet's say it has 1/2 the radius, and 1/2 the mass.\n0:45\nSo if you think about it, it's probably a\n0:46\nlot denser than Earth.\n0:48\nThat's a good problem to think about.\n0:49\nHow much denser is it, right?\n0:51\nBecause if you have 1/2 the radius, your volume is much\n0:55\nless than 1/2.\n0:56\nI don't want to go into that now, but that's something for\n0:58\nyou to think about.\n0:58\nBut my question is what fraction, if I'm standing on\n1:01\nthe surface of this-- so the same person, so Sal, if I'm on\n1:06\nEarth, what fraction is the pull when I'm on this small\n1:13\ngreen planet?\n1:15\nSo what is the pull on me on Earth?\n1:18\nWell, it's just going to be-- my weight on Earth, the force\n1:23\non Earth, is going to be equal to the gravitational constant\n1:28\ntimes my mass, mass of me.\n1:35\nSo m sub m times the mass of Earth divided by what?\n1:41\nWe learned in the last video, divided by the distance\n1:44\nbetween me and the center of the mass of Earth.\n1:45\nReally, my center of mass and the center of mass of Earth.\n1:49\nBut this is between the surface of the Earth, and I'd\n1:52\nlike to think that I'm not short, but it's negligible\n1:56\nbetween my center of mass and the surface, so we'll just\n1:58\nconsider the radius of the Earth.\n2:00\nSo we divide it by the radius of the Earth squared.\n2:08\nUsing these same variables, what's going to be the force\n2:11\non this other planet?\n2:13\nSo the force on the other planet, this green planet--\n2:16\nI'll do it in green-- and we're calling it the small\n2:20\nplanet, it equals what?\n2:23\nIt equals the gravitational constant again.\n2:26\nAnd my mass doesn't change when I go from one planet to\n2:29\nanother, right?\n2:31\nIts mass now is what?\n2:33\nWe would write it m sub s here, right?\n2:37\nThis is the small planet.\n2:39\nAnd we wrote right here that it's 1/2 the mass of Earth, so\n2:41\nI'll just write that.\n2:42\nSo it's 1/2 the mass of Earth.\n2:48\nAnd what's its radius?\n2:49\nWhat's the radius now?\n2:51\nI could just write the radius of the small planet squared,\n2:54\nbut I'll say, well, we know.\n2:54\nIt's 1/2 the radius of Earth, so let's put that in there.\n2:57\nSo 1/2 radius of Earth.\n3:00\nWe have to square it.\n3:02\nLet's see what this simplifies to.\n3:04\nThis equals-- so we can take this 1/2 here-- 1/2G mass of\n3:12\nme times mass of Earth over-- what's 1/2 squared?\n3:18\nIt's 1/4.\n3:19\nOver 1/4 radius of Earth squared.\n3:26\nAnd what's 1/2 divided by 1/4?\n3:30\n1/4 goes into 1/2 two times, right?\n3:32\nOr another way you can think about it is if you have a\n3:33\nfraction in the denominator, when you put it in the\n3:35\nnumerator, you flip it and it becomes 4.\n3:38\nSo 4 times 1/2 is 2.\n3:39\nEither way, it's just math.\n3:41\nSo the force on the small planet is going to be equal to\n3:45\n1/2 divided by 1/4 is 2 times G, mass of me, times mass of\n3:53\nEarth, divided by the radius of Earth squared.\n3:56\nAnd if we look up here, this is the same\n4:01\nthing as this, right?\n4:05\nIt's identical.\n4:07\nSo we know that the force that applied to me when I'm on the\n4:10\nsurface of the small planet is actually two times the force\n4:15\napplied on Earth, when I go to Earth.\n4:19\nAnd that's something interesting to think about,\n4:20\nbecause you might have said initially, wow, you know, the\n4:24\nmass of the object matters a lot in gravity.\n4:27\nThe more massive the object, the more it's\n4:29\ngoing to pull on me.\n4:31\nBut what we see here is that actually, no.\n4:33\nWhen I'm on the surface of this smaller planet, it's\n4:36\npulling even harder on me.\n4:37\nAnd why is that?\n4:38\nWell, because I'm actually closer to its center of mass.\n4:41\nAnd as we talked about earlier in this video, this object is\n4:45\nprobably a lot denser.\n4:46\nYou could say it's only 1/2 the mass, but it's much less\n4:50\nthan 1/2 of the volume, right?\n4:51\nBecause the volume is the cube of the radius and all of that.\n4:55\nI don't want to confuse you, but this is just something to\n4:56\nthink about.\n4:57\nSo not only does the mass matter, but the\n4:59\nradius matters a lot.\n5:01\nAnd the radius is actually the square, so it actually\n5:03\nmatters even more.\n5:06\nSo that's something that's pretty\n5:09\ninteresting to think about.\n5:10\nAnd these are actually very common problems when they just\n5:14\nwant to tell you, oh, you go to a planet that is two times\n5:16\nthe mass of another planet, et cetera, et cetera, what is the\n5:21\ndifference in force between the two?\n5:23\nAnd one thing I want you to realize, actually, before I\n5:25\nfinish this video since I do have some extra time, when we\n5:29\nthink about gravity, especially with planets and\n5:30\nall of that, you always feel like, oh, it's\n5:33\nEarth pulling on me.\n5:36\nLet's say that this is the Earth, and the Earth is huge,\n5:41\nand this is a tiny spaceship right here.\n5:45\nIt's traveling.\n5:48\nYou always think that Earth is pulling on\n5:50\nthe spaceship, right?\n5:51\nThe gravitational force of Earth.\n5:53\nBut it actually turns out, when we looked at the formula,\n5:57\nthe formula is symmetric.\n5:57\nIt's not really saying one is pulling on the other.\n5:59\nThey're actually saying this is the force\n6:01\nbetween the two objects.\n6:03\nThey're attracted to each other.\n6:04\nSo if the Earth is pulling on me with the force of 500\n6:13\nNewtons, it actually turns out that I am pulling on the Earth\n6:16\nwith an equal and opposite force of 5 Newtons.\n6:18\nWe're pulling towards each other.\n6:20\nIt just feels like the Earth is, at least from my point of\n6:23\nview, that the Earth is pulling to me.\n6:25\nAnd we're actually both being pulled towards the combined\n6:29\ncenter of mass.\n6:30\nSo in this situation, let's say the Earth is pulling on\n6:33\nthe spaceship with the force of-- I don't know.\n6:37\nI'm making up numbers now, but let's say\n6:40\nit's 1 million Newtons.\n6:43\nIt actually turns out that the spaceship will be pulling on\n6:46\nthe Earth with the same force of 1 million Newtons.\n6:51\nAnd they're both going to be moved to the combined system's\n6:55\ncenter of mass.\n6:56\nAnd the combined system's center of mass since the Earth\n7:00\nis so much more massive is going to be very close to\n7:02\nEarth's center of mass.\n7:03\nIt's probably going to be very close to\n7:05\nEarth's center of mass.\n7:06\nIt's going to be like right there, right?\n7:07\nSo in this situation, Earth won't be doing a lot of\n7:12\nmoving, but it will be pulled in the direction of the\n7:15\nspaceship, and the spaceship will try to go to Earth's\n7:18\ncenter of mass, but at some point, probably the\n7:20\natmosphere, or the rock that it runs into, it won't be able\n7:24\nto go much further and it might crash\n7:27\nright around there.\n7:28\nAnyway, I wanted just to give you the sense that it's not\n7:31\nnecessarily one object just pulling on the other.\n7:33\nThey're pulling towards each other to their\n7:35\ncombined center of masses.\n7:36\nIt would make a lot more sense if they had just two people\n7:40\nfloating in space, they actually would have some\n7:42\ngravity towards each other.\n7:43\nIt's almost a little romantic.\n7:47\nThey would float to each other.\n7:48\nAnd actually, you could figure it out.\n7:52\nI don't have the time to do it, but you could use this\n7:55\nformula and use the constant, and you could figure out,\n7:58\nwell, what is the gravitational attraction\n8:00\nbetween two people?\n8:01\nAnd what you'll see is that between two people floating in\n8:04\nspace, there are other forms of attraction that are\n8:06\nprobably stronger than their\n8:09\ngravitational attraction, anyway.\n8:11\nI'll let you ponder that and I will see\n8:13\nyou in the next video.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:12\nSo this is an airplane here.\n0:15\nOK, so you probably already knew that.\n0:18\nIf you've flown in one, or maybe just seen them fly.\n0:22\nBut even if you've seen them or been in one,\n0:24\ndo you know how they work?\n0:26\nIs it magic?\n0:27\n[CHANTS GIBBERISH]\n0:29\nAre there invisible fairies that hold the plane aloft?\n0:32\nAll right, men.\n0:33\nWe've got a busy morning and lots of flights to carry.\n0:36\nOr is it science?\n0:39\nWell, you can guess that the answer is indeed science.\n0:43\nThat's ridiculous.\n0:45\nWhat?\n0:47\nSo to discuss how an airplane flies,\n0:50\nwe first have to talk about the forces\n0:52\non an airplane which push it around\n0:54\nin all sorts of different directions.\n0:56\nNow we're going to focus on airplanes today\n0:59\nbecause they're awesome, but most of these forces\n1:03\napply to any other vehicle.\n1:05\nThe first force acts on all these vehicles-- really,\n1:09\nit acts on everything.\n1:11\nIt's the weight force, which points down\n1:14\ntowards the center of Earth.\n1:17\nWeights is equal to the mass of the airplane-- m\n1:21\nright here-- times the acceleration due to gravity.\n1:25\nHere on Earth, g is equal to 9.81 meters per second squared.\n1:31\nNow that's only for Earth.\n1:33\nThe acceleration due to gravity really\n1:36\ndepends on the mass of the planet that your are on.\n1:39\nThe larger the planet, the higher the gravity.\n1:41\nSo 9.81 meters per second squared here on Earth.\n1:45\nThe moon, however-- it's smaller than Earth.\n1:48\nSo the acceleration due to gravity is only 1/6\n1:51\nthat on Earth-- 1.6 meters per second squared.\n1:56\nThis is why astronauts can bounce high on the moon,\n1:59\nbut not on Earth.\n2:02\nThis isn't nearly as much fun.\n2:04\nObviously, there has to be another force\n2:06\nopposing the weight and pushing the airplane up.\n2:09\nThis force is called lift.\n2:13\nLift operates perpendicular to the airplane's wings, which are\n2:18\nright here in this side view.\n2:20\nNow, if these are our only two forces,\n2:22\nour aircraft will be able to go up and down,\n2:25\nbut it won't go anywhere.\n2:27\nSo we have to have a force that pushes the airplane forward,\n2:31\nand this is called thrust.\n2:36\nAll vehicles have thrust, otherwise\n2:38\nthey wouldn't go anywhere like our airplane.\n2:41\nWhy didn't you buy a car with thrust?\n2:43\nI'm sorry.\n2:44\nWe can at least roll down the hill.\n2:47\nOn an aircraft, this thrust is produced by engines.\n2:51\nThere are two main types of engines.\n2:54\nWe have propellers, like this little guy right here.\n2:57\nAnd jet engines, like our first model.\n3:01\nWhatever the type of engines, they all\n3:03\nwork by the same principle.\n3:05\nLet's draw a little side view of an engine here.\n3:09\nThe engines accelerate air out the back this direction.\n3:14\nAnd by Newton's third law, there's\n3:17\nan equal and opposite reaction, and that's\n3:20\nthe thrust force pushing the aircraft forward.\n3:24\nThis is really the same thing that happens when you blow up\n3:26\na balloon and you let it go.\n3:28\nThe air come out the back and the balloon moves forward.\n3:32\nWe have a force that opposes the thrust.\n3:36\nIt's called drag.\n3:37\nIt points opposite the direction of flight.\n3:41\nThe major type of drag is pressure drag,\n3:43\nwhich is the force caused by the air smacking into the airplane.\n3:48\nSo we try to minimize this type of drag\n3:50\nby making the airplane as aerodynamic as possible.\n3:54\nThat means that it has smooth lines\n3:57\nin the air flows nice and cleanly over the front here.\n4:00\nYou can feel the pressure drag when you stick your hand\n4:02\nout the window of a moving car.\n4:04\nUh, honey, honey.\n4:06\nYour hand-- your hand, please.\n4:08\nWhen your hand this horizontal, it's aerodynamic\n4:11\nand you really don't feel a lot of drag.\n4:13\nBut if you slowly turn your hand vertical,\n4:15\nyou really feel the drag increasing.\n4:19\nSo these are our four forces on the airplane,\n4:22\nbut perhaps you're thinking--\n4:24\nSo this really cool and everything,\n4:26\nbut how do we increase and decrease the airplanes lift\n4:29\nto move up and down?\n4:30\nThat's a great question.\n4:32\nLet's look at the equation for the magnitude\n4:34\nof lift per unit wing area.\n4:36\nWe'll call that L. L equals 1/2 times rho times\n4:42\ncl times v squared.\n4:46\nThat simple.\n4:48\nOK, OK, I'll tell you what each of these things mean.\n4:51\nSo rho-- it's not a P. It's the Greek letter, rho.\n4:55\nRho is the density of the air, which\n4:57\nis a measure of the number of air\n4:59\nmolecules in a certain volume.\n5:01\nDensity of the air varies with altitude and temperature,\n5:06\nso you go higher up.\n5:08\nThere, the air is thinner, and so the density is lower.\n5:12\nIf we want to simplify things, we generally\n5:13\nuse the standard density, which is 1.2754 kilograms per meters\n5:21\ncubed.\n5:23\nv here is the speed of the aircraft,\n5:26\nor how fast it's traveling.\n5:28\nAnd cl is something called the coefficient of lift.\n5:32\nIt's a number that gives us some information\n5:35\nabout the shape of the aircraft's wings-- these things\n5:38\nright here.\n5:39\nThe coefficient of lift changes with the angle of attack.\n5:44\nAngle of what?\n5:45\nAircraft can pitch up and down, and even if they're pitched up,\n5:50\nthey're still traveling in a horizontal direction like that.\n5:55\nNow the angle formed here by the horizontal direction of travel\n6:00\nand the direction of the aircraft's nose\n6:03\nis called the angle of attack, and we\n6:06\ndenote that with the Greek letter alpha.\n6:10\nSo we can make a little plot here of that.\n6:12\nWe're going to put coefficient of lift up on the y-axis,\n6:16\nand the angle of attack down on the x-axis.\n6:20\nSo as the airplane starts to pitch up--\n6:23\nif I can get a little hand here-- thank you.\n6:27\nAs the aircraft starts to pitch up, the coefficient of lift\n6:30\nincreases.\n6:31\nThis is a good thing because we have more lift.\n6:35\nAs we continue to increase, we eventually\n6:37\nreach a point where we keep pitching up\n6:40\nbut the lift starts decreasing.\n6:43\nThis is something called stall, and it's not a good thing.\n6:49\nSo we generally avoid try to pitching up this much.\n6:53\nThere's a similar equation for the drag per unit wing area,\n6:56\nD. D equals 1/2 rho.\n7:01\nNot cl-- that wouldn't make any sense.\n7:03\ncd, as you can guess, is the coefficient of drag times\n7:08\nthe velocity squared.\n7:10\nThe coefficient of drag is-- it's\n7:12\nanother number that tells us something about the wings,\n7:15\nand it also varies with the angle of attack.\n7:18\nSo as the angle of attack increases--\n7:21\noh, thank you-- the coefficient of drag increases as well.\n7:26\nThank you very much.\n7:28\nThis is because as the aircraft is pitching up,\n7:33\nthere is more wing area perpendicular to the flow.\n7:38\nNow, this reminds me of something\n7:41\nthat we talked about earlier.\n7:44\nExactly.\n7:45\nThis is very similar to whenever you hold your hand\n7:49\nout the window of a car.\n7:51\nAnd so, that's pretty much everything\n7:55\nyou need know about how an aircraft flies.\n7:59\nSo the next time you're on an airplane or you just see one,\n8:03\nyou can really know exactly what it is that's keeping it up\n8:05\nin the air.\n8:07\nNope.\n8:08\nNo, it's not them either.\n8:09\nAh, there you are.\n8:11\nNow you got it.",

videos\n0:07\nwhere I really dive into the innards of bitcoin\n0:10\nand explain how it works in detail,\n0:12\nand my plan for this first video in this series\n0:15\nis to describe some of those mechanics\n0:18\nat a high level.\n0:19\nAnd then what I'll do in subsequent videos\n0:21\nis dive a bit deeper into all of the underlying aspects\n0:24\nthat I have touched upon within this first video.\n0:27\nAnd my hope is that by the end of this video series,\n0:29\nyou'll know not only what a bitcoin is,\n0:31\nbut you'll also understand the mechanics\n0:33\nof how transactions are initiated.\n0:35\nYou'll see how verification occurs\n0:38\nfor those transactions,\n0:38\nand you'll also learn what it means for someone\n0:41\nto really engage in a process\n0:43\nknown as \"bitcoin mining\",\n0:44\nand that may be a term that you've heard\n0:46\nif you've had any interest in bitcoin recently.\n0:49\nI do want to point out, also,\n0:50\nthat the bitcoin scheme is fairly involved.\n0:53\nIt requires some time to really cover\n0:56\nall of the relevant details,\n0:58\nand to me the best way to really wrap your head\n1:00\naround a scheme like bitcoin\n1:02\nis to really suspend belief for a bit\n1:04\nand get exposed to all of these relevant details.\n1:08\nNow, undoubtedly, you'll have a lot of questions\n1:10\nalong the way,\n1:11\nbut my hope is that by the end of this video series,\n1:13\nall of the relevant stones will have been overturned\n1:16\nand your questions will have been\n1:17\nappropriately answered,\n1:18\nbut it might take some time to get there,\n1:21\nand in part, that's because I'll try to describe things\n1:23\nin a way that's sensible\n1:25\nand that might involve leaving some details out\n1:28\nuntil I can explain enough pieces of the scheme\n1:31\nand then add in those details in as I go along\n1:33\nso that you're not inundated\n1:34\nwith too many minor points and nuances\n1:38\nalong the way,\n1:39\nbut you get a feel for the overall system\n1:41\nas I go through things.\n1:42\nWith that, let me go ahead and just dive right in.\n1:44\nFirst of all, I do want to point out\n1:46\nthat bitcoin has been described, really,\n1:48\nas a decentralized currency\n1:51\nbecause there's no real central bank or entity\n1:54\nthat's involved in generating or transacting bitcoins,\n1:57\nand, in fact, what happens in the content of a bitcoin\n2:00\nis all the transactions really require\n2:02\nwhat's known as a peer-to-peer network,\n2:04\na network of just individual hosts that essentially\n2:08\ncollectively agree on different aspects\n2:09\nof how the protocol is implemented and used.\n2:15\nBitcoin itself is also referred to sometimes\n2:17\nas a cryptocurrency,\n2:19\nand by a cryptocurrency,\n2:19\nI mean that we use a lot of cryptographic techniques\n2:22\nin order to facilitate or to really enable\n2:25\nbitcoin transactions to take place,\n2:27\nand I'll do separate videos\n2:28\non some of these techniques,\n2:29\nbut just take it at face value right now,\n2:31\nthat it's decentralized\n2:33\nand is a type of cryptocurrency.\n2:35\nI also want to point out that the term \"bitcoin\" itself\n2:38\ncan in fact be a bit confusing,\n2:40\nand in many ways, bitcoin transactions\n2:42\ndon't really resemble traditional coin transactions\n2:46\nso much as they represent really entries\n2:49\nin some type of a global ledger,\n2:51\nand by that, I mean let's say you have\n2:54\na transaction taking place,\n2:56\nand let's say the transaction is taking place\n2:58\nwithin, or among two parties,\n3:00\nand we'll call them Alice and Bob,\n3:03\nwhich are traditional names that are used\n3:04\nin many cryptographic protocols\n3:06\nto describe the parties involved,\n3:08\nand imagine that Alice wants to transfer,\n3:12\nor really wants to assign,\n3:13\na certain number of bitcoins that she possesses\n3:15\nover to Bob,\n3:17\nand you can think of this transaction, really,\n3:19\nas an entry in a ledger of some sort,\n3:24\nand I also want to point out before proceeding\n3:26\nthat even though I've used terms\n3:28\nlike Alice and Bob,\n3:29\nwhat I really mean in the context of bitcoin\n3:32\nis not the actual identities in the physical sense,\n3:36\nbut really that Alice and Bob are identities\n3:39\nin the bitcoin system,\n3:41\nand these identities are just,\n3:42\nin actual implementation,\n3:44\nare just collections of numbers\n3:46\nthat do not have to be tied\n3:49\nwith Alice and Bob's real-world identities.\n3:52\nIn that capacity, you can think of bitcoin at any,\n3:55\nit really is effectively being,\n3:57\nof being pseudonyms,\n3:59\nrather than real names,\n4:00\nand the idea is that bitcoin really becomes more\n4:02\nof a pseudonymous protocol,\n4:03\nwhere people are addressed by their pseudonyms,\n4:06\nand that provides some level of privacy\n4:09\nto users that want to transact\n4:10\nusing the bitcoin system.\n4:13\nNow, in a transaction between Alice and Bob,\n4:15\nwhat Alice will basically do\n4:16\nis specify a few different numbers.\n4:18\nShe has to specify how many bitcoins\n4:21\nshe wants to allocate to Bob.\n4:22\nLet's say Alice started off with 50 bitcoins of her own.\n4:25\nShe might decide that she wants to give,\n4:27\nlet's say, 30 of these bitcoins over to Bob,\n4:31\nand let's say she wants to have\n4:33\nsome number of bitcoins returned back to her,\n4:35\nso you have to specify,\n4:36\nor Alice has to specify, rather,\n4:37\nhow much change she's going to get,\n4:39\nso in this case, let's say her change is going to be\n4:40\n18 bitcoins for herself,\n4:43\nand then the remaining 2 bitcoins are going to be\n4:45\na transaction fee,\n4:47\nand we'll talk about what a transaction fee means\n4:50\na little later,\n4:51\nand I think I'll also dive into it in future videos,\n4:54\nbut it's basically an incentive for other nodes\n4:56\nin the bitcoin network to help Alice\n4:58\nin essentially validating some of the details\n5:00\nof this transaction for Bob.\n5:04\nNow, Alice will take these transaction details\n5:07\nand apply what's known as a digital signature\n5:12\nto these transaction details,\n5:13\nand a digital signature is basically\n5:14\nthe mathematical analog of a traditional signature.\n5:18\nIt really binds Alice's identity to the details\n5:21\nof this transaction.\n5:23\nAnd by Alice's identity, again,\n5:24\nI mean her identity within the bitcoin system,\n5:27\nand this binding is really done\n5:28\nin a cryptographically strong way.\n5:31\nNow, the details of this transaction\n5:33\nonce it takes place,\n5:34\nare going to be broadcast out,\n5:36\nso Alice is going to take these transaction details\n5:38\nand effectively just broadcast them out\n5:40\nto all the nodes in the peer-to-peer network\n5:45\nthat represent bitcoin nodes.\n5:47\nNow, Bob, when he receives information\n5:50\nabout this transaction,\n5:51\nhe receives it over the peer-to-peer network.\n5:53\nHe'll probably sandy check\n5:55\nsome part of the transaction.\n5:56\nFor example, he might check that the numbers\n5:58\nwork out correctly,\n5:59\nthat Alice, let's say, started off with 50 bitcoins\n6:02\nand is not trying to transfer\n6:03\nmore than 50 bitcoins to him, and so on and so forth.\n6:06\nHe's going to have some mathematical assurance\n6:08\nbecause of some of the cryptography involved\n6:11\nthat some of these claims are accurate,\n6:13\nthat Alice, let's say, has the bitcoins\n6:15\nthat she's claimed to possess,\n6:17\nand that she's expressed an interest\n6:19\nto assign those bitcoins to him,\n6:21\nbut what he won't know yet is whether\n6:23\nAlice has really tried to transfer those same bitcoins\n6:26\nto anyone else over the course of time\n6:28\nor maybe just prior to that point.\n6:31\nthe way that we handle that situation,\n6:33\nand by the way, I should point out\n6:34\nthat this concept of Alice trying to, let's say,\n6:37\nspend coins twice,\n6:39\nin the context of digital cash\n6:41\nand electronic currency systems,\n6:42\nthis concept is known as double spending,\n6:45\nand it's something you have to worry about\n6:47\nwhen you have virtual currencies\n6:49\nbecause it's very easy for someone to just copy\n6:51\nthe numbers that represent this transaction\n6:53\nand try to use them elsewhere.\n6:57\nThe way we basically handle\n6:58\nand reduce the risk of double spending\n7:00\nis through a specific set of nodes\n7:03\nin this peer-to-peer network\n7:05\nwho are known as bitcoin miners.\n7:08\nYou might have heard this term bitcoin miners,\n7:10\nand the bitcoin miners are basically\n7:12\nspecific individuals,\n7:14\nspecific nodes within this peer-to-peer network,\n7:17\nand what they basically do is they take\n7:19\nall of the transactions that they see,\n7:21\nand remember,\n7:21\nthey're listening to all of these transactions,\n7:23\nand not just Alice and Bob's,\n7:24\nbut other transactions that are taking place,\n7:26\nand they'll take those transactions,\n7:27\nand ultimately, they will take those transactions\n7:29\nand will compile them\n7:31\ninto what's known as a transaction block.\n7:34\nSo it's basically a recording\n7:35\nof all the previously unrecorded transactions.\n7:40\nIf you think of a single transaction\n7:42\nlet's say, as a ledger item,\n7:44\nyou could think of a transaction block\n7:45\nas representing, let's say, an entire page\n7:47\nin a ledger book.\n7:50\nThese bitcoin miners will also include in this block,\n7:54\nin addition to all these unrecorded transactions,\n7:55\nthey will also include in this block\n7:57\na special transaction that's meant just for themselves\n8:01\nto basically reward themselves for the effort\n8:04\nof doing this mining.\n8:06\nNow, a transaction block will also contain\n8:09\nan encoding of the previous transaction block,\n8:11\nso there's going to be some level of continuity,\n8:14\nand then bitcoin miners will also include\n8:16\na specially-crafted sequence of numbers\n8:19\nassociated with these transactions,\n8:21\nand this sequence of numbers is known\n8:23\nas a proof of work,\n8:26\nand it's called a proof of work\n8:27\nbecause it's sometihng that's really hard to generate,\n8:30\nsomething that requires a lot of effort to do,\n8:31\nand that kind of makes it hard for just anybody\n8:34\nto get involved with bitcoin mining willy-nilly,\n8:36\nbut it requires that they really exhibit or exert\n8:39\nsome computational effort,\n8:42\nbasically in exchange for getting this extra reward\n8:45\nof a payment,\n8:45\nand also in exchange for getting\n8:47\nthis transaction fee that they're going to be promised\n8:50\nby Alice to engage in this sort of work.\n8:54\nI'll talk about what proof-of-work protocols are\n8:55\nin a separate video in more detail.\n8:57\nNow, because each transaction block\n8:59\ncontains information about previous transactions,\n9:03\nreally what you end up having\n9:04\nis not just a single block.\n9:06\nYou ultimately have what you can think of as a chain\n9:09\nof transactions,\n9:11\nand you can call this a transaction block chain.\n9:15\nThe idea is as soon as a bitcoin miner\n9:17\nis able to construct a transaction block chain\n9:19\ncontaining all these unrecorded transactions,\n9:21\nand this proof of work,\n9:22\nit'll broadcast the details of that chain out\n9:26\nto all of the nodes, all of the peers\n9:29\non that peer-to-peer network for bitcoin.\n9:33\nAnd then once the newly-broadcast chain\n9:36\ngets kind of verified and meets the right properties,\n9:39\nthe nodes on the network\n9:40\nare just going to go ahead and start using it,\n9:42\nand they're going to start appending\n9:43\nnew transaction blocks to that chain.\n9:46\nThey're going to take anything\n9:47\nthat hasn't yet been processed\n9:48\nand start incorporating it into the transaction chain\n9:51\nthat was broadcast out by the node\n9:54\nwho came up with the proof of work correctly.\n9:57\nNow, this transaction block chain,\n9:58\nreally what we're going to be doing\n10:01\nin the context of bitcoin\n10:02\nis the nodes are only going to consider\n10:05\nthe transaction block chain that reflects\n10:08\nthe greatest amount of work to generate its contents,\n10:10\nand again, there's this proof of work that I mentioned\n10:12\nthat is used to kind of determine\n10:14\nor identify what the, what work was involved\n10:17\nin coming up with the transaction block chain.\n10:20\nThe one that's the longest is going to be considered\n10:22\nsacrosanct within the bitcoin system.\n10:24\nFuture miners are supposed to only work\n10:26\noff the chain that has the most work put into it.\n10:30\nNow, what's remarkable here\n10:32\nis that the whole process is decentralized.\n10:34\nThere is no bank or no centrally-trusted entity\n10:38\nthat was actually involved in the transaction.\n10:40\nHopefully this first video gave you\n10:42\na bit of description, a flavor, if you will,\n10:44\nfor the high-level mechanics of the bitcoin system.\n10:47\nThere are a lot of stones I have left unturned,\n10:50\nand what I'll do in subsequent videos\n10:52\nis start covering those details,\n10:54\nand I'm sure you have a lot of questions,\n10:55\nand hopefully the future videos\n10:57\nwill help answer some of those questions for you.",

    "question_type": "Essay",
    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nWelcome back.\n0:01\nWe just finished this problem with the pulleys and the\n0:03\ninclined plane.\n0:04\nAnd I just wanted to do one final thing on this problem\n0:06\njust because I think it's interesting.\n0:08\nAnd then we can move onto what seems like\n0:11\na pretty fun problem.\n0:12\nSo the last thing I want to figure out is, we figured out\n0:14\nthat this 20 kilo-- actually, the whole system will\n0:17\naccelerate up and to the right at 4.13\n0:20\nmeters per second squared.\n0:22\nAnd then the second part of this question is, what is the\n0:24\ntension in this rope or this wire?\n0:28\nAnd at first you might say, this is complicated.\n0:30\nYou know, this thing isn't static anymore.\n0:32\nThe thing is actually accelerating.\n0:34\nHow do I do it?\n0:35\nWell this is how you think about it.\n0:36\nJust pick one part of the system.\n0:39\nLet's say that all we could see was this 20 kilogram mass.\n0:43\nSo let's say all we could see was this 20 kilogram mass.\n0:48\nAnd we know it's suspended from a wire.\n0:50\nAnd we also know that this 20 kilogram mass is not\n0:54\naccelerating as fast as it would if\n0:56\nthe wire wasn't there.\n0:57\nIt's accelerating only at 4.13 meters per second.\n1:01\nIf the wire wasn't there, it'd be accelerating at 9.8 meters\n1:04\nper second, the acceleration of gravity.\n1:06\nSo the wire must be exerting some upward\n1:09\nforce on the object.\n1:10\nAnd that is the force of tension.\n1:13\nThat is what's slowing-- that's what's moderating its\n1:17\nacceleration from being 9.8 meters per second squared to\n1:21\nbeing 4.13 meters per second squared.\n1:24\nSo essentially, what is the net force on this object?\n1:27\nOn just this object?\n1:29\nWell the net force is-- and you can ignore what I said\n1:32\nbefore about the net force in all the other places.\n1:36\nBut we know that the object is accelerating downwards.\n1:42\nWell, we know it's 20 kilograms. So that's its mass.\n1:44\nAnd we know that it's accelerating downwards at 4.13\n1:46\nmeters per second squared.\n1:51\nSo the net force, 20 times-- see, times 20 is 82-- let's\n2:00\njust say 83 Newtons.\n2:03\n83 Newtons down.\n2:05\nWe know that the net force is 83 Newtons down.\n2:08\nWe also know that the tension force plus the force of\n2:16\ngravity-- and what's the force of gravity?\n2:18\nThe force of gravity is just the weight of the object.\n2:20\nSo the force of tension, which goes up, plus the weight of --\n2:24\nthe force of gravity is equal to the net force.\n2:29\nAnd the way I set this up, tension's going to be a\n2:31\nnegative number.\n2:33\nJust because I'm saying positive numbers are\n2:36\ndownwards, so a negative number would be upwards.\n2:39\nSo tension will be what is 83 minus 196?\n2:46\nMinus 196 is equal to minus 113 Newtons.\n2:54\nAnd the only reason why I got a negative number is because I\n2:57\nused positive numbers for downwards.\n2:59\nSo minus 113 Newtons downwards, which is the same\n3:02\nthing as 113 Newtons upwards.\n3:06\nAnd so that is the tension in the rope.\n3:09\nAnd you could have done the same thing on this side of the\n3:11\nproblem, although it would have been-- well, yeah.\n3:14\nYou could have done the exact same thing on\n3:15\nthis side of the problem.\n3:16\nYou would've said, well what would it have accelerated\n3:17\nnaturally if there wasn't some force of tension on this rope\n3:20\ngoing backwards?\n3:22\nAnd then you're saying, oh, well, we know it would have\n3:24\ngone in this direction at some acceleration, but instead it's\n3:26\ngoing in the other direction.\n3:27\nSo you use that.\n3:29\nYou figure out the net force, and then you say the tension\n3:31\nplus all of these forces have to equal the net force.\n3:33\nAnd then you should solve for the tension.\n3:36\nAnd it would be the same tension.\n3:38\nNow we will do a fun and somewhat simple, but maybe\n3:44\ninstructive problem.\n3:46\nSo I have a pie.\n3:49\nThis is the pie.\n3:54\nThis is parallel.\n3:55\nAnd I have my hand.\n3:58\nYou can tell that my destiny was really to be a great\n4:02\nartist. This is my hand.\n4:04\nAnd I'm holding a pie, and I'm looking to smash this pie into\n4:10\nthis individual's face.\n4:19\nI actually was a, I was the newspaper cartoonist in high\n4:24\nschool, so I have some minor-- but anyway.\n4:28\nLet's make it a bald man.\n4:30\nWell anyway, I shouldn't be focusing on the drawing.\n4:36\nHe has a moustache.\n4:41\nAnyway, I'm looking to throw this pie into this guy's face.\n4:45\nAnd the problem is, I need to figure out how fast do I need\n4:49\nto accelerate this pie for it to not fall down?\n4:52\nRight?\n4:52\nBecause what's happening?\n4:53\nWell there's the force of gravity on this pie.\n4:56\nThere's a force of gravity on this pie and if I don't\n4:58\naccelerate it fast enough, it's just going to slide down.\n5:01\nAnd I'll never be able to, It'll never\n5:03\nreach the guy's face.\n5:04\nSo I don't want this pie to slide down at all.\n5:06\nHow fast do I have to push on it?\n5:09\nWell, we know that the coefficient of friction-- you\n5:11\ndon't know this, but I know that the coefficient of\n5:13\nfriction between my hand and the pie, the coefficient of\n5:17\nfriction is equal to 0.8.\n5:23\nSo given that, how fast do I have to accelerate it?\n5:26\nWell let's see what's happening.\n5:28\nSo we have the force of gravity pulling down.\n5:30\nSo let's say that the mass of the pie is m.\n5:35\nm equals mass.\n5:38\nSo what is the force of gravity\n5:40\npulling down on the pie?\n5:41\nWell the force of gravity is just equal to m times 9.8.\n5:47\nRight?\n5:48\nThe force of gravity is equal to m times 9.8.\n5:51\nIn order for this pie to not move down, what do we know\n5:55\nabout the net forces on that pie?\n5:57\nWell we know the net forces on that pie have to be 0.\n6:02\nSo what would be the offsetting force?\n6:04\nWell, it would be the force of friction.\n6:05\nSo we would have a force of friction acting upwards.\n6:08\nRight?\n6:08\nBecause the force of friction always acts opposite to the\n6:11\ndirection that the thing would move otherwise.\n6:14\nSo essentially, our force of friction has to be greater\n6:20\nthan, roughly, greater than or equal to.\n6:23\nBecause if it's greater than, it's not like the pie is going\n6:24\nto move up.\n6:25\nFriction by itself will never move something, it'll just\n6:28\nkeep something from being moved.\n6:29\nBut let's just figure out the minimum.\n6:31\nI won't do the whole inequalities.\n6:33\nThe force of friction has to be equal similarly, to 9.8\n6:37\ntimes the mass of the pie.\n6:42\nSo if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, what is the\n6:46\nforce that I have to apply?\n6:50\nWell, the force I have to apply in this case is going to\n6:52\nbe the normal force, right?\n6:53\nThat's normal to the bottom of the pie.\n6:58\nRight?\n7:00\nMy hand is now like the surface of the ramp.\n7:03\nSo this is the normal force.\n7:05\nAnd we know that the force of friction is equal to the\n7:09\ncoefficient of friction times the normal force.\n7:11\nI'm going to switch colors because this is getting\n7:12\nmonotonous.\n7:15\nAnd the force of friction, we know has to be\n7:17\n9.8 times the mass.\n7:20\nSo 9.8 meters per second times the mass.\n7:23\n9.8m is the force of friction.\n7:25\nAnd that has to equal to coefficient of friction times\n7:27\nthe normal force.\n7:28\nAnd remember, the normal force is essentially the force that\n7:31\nI'm pushing the pie with.\n7:33\nAnd we know this is 0.8, so we have 9.8 times the mass--\n7:38\nthat's not meters, that's the mass-- is equal to 0.8 times\n7:43\nthe normal force.\n7:45\nSo you have the normal force is equal to 9.8 times the mass\n7:51\ndivided by 0.8.\n7:54\nWhat's 9.8 divided by 0.8?\n7:56\n9.8 divided by 0.8 is equal to 12.25.\n8:05\nSo the normal force that I have to apply is\n8:08\n12.25 times the mass.\n8:12\nSo that's the force I'm applying.\n8:14\nIt's time the mass.\n8:15\nWe don't know the mass of the pie.\n8:17\nSo how fast am I accelerating the pie?\n8:19\nWell, force is equal to mass times acceleration.\n8:22\nThis is the force, 12.25m-- that's the force-- is equal to\n8:29\nthe mass times the\n8:31\nacceleration of the pie, right?\n8:32\nAnd it's the same pie that we're dealing with the whole\n8:34\ntime, so it's still m.\n8:35\nAnd you can take out m from both sides of the equation.\n8:39\nSo the acceleration, the rate at which I have to change the\n8:42\nvelocity, or the acceleration that I have to apply to the\n8:45\npie is 12.25 meters per second squared.\n8:53\nAnd so actually, I have to apply more than 1g, right?\n8:58\nBecause g is the force of gravity.\n9:01\nAnd gravity accelerates something at 9.8 seconds-- 9.8\n9:05\nmeters per second squared.\n9:06\nSo I have to do something at 12-- I have to push and\n9:09\naccelerate the pie at 12.25 meters per second squared.\n9:13\nSo it's something a little over 1g in order for that pie\n9:16\nto not fall and in order for my normal force to provide a\n9:19\nforce of friction so that the pie can reach\n9:22\nthis bald man's face.\n9:25\nI will see you in the next video.",

    "source_material": "The term modern art sounds like it\nmeans art that is popular at the moment,\nbut in fact, modern art is a style\nthat originated over 150 years ago,\nand includes artists that by now\nhave attained classic status,\nsuch as Picasso, Matisse, and Gauguin.\nAnd what's even more ironic is that\nthe movement they pioneered,\nconsidered revolutionary\nand even scandalous at the time,\nwas inspired largely by an object\nof a traditional and ancient design.\nAs far back as the Renaissance,\nthe primary European art movements\nemphasized conventional representation\nand adherence to classical forms.\nBut that began to change \nin the late 19th century\nas artists like Van Gogh and Cézanne\nexpanded the boundaries of painting.\nSoon, a movement arose that sought\nto create an entirely new style of art,\nand one way of doing so was to look\nbeyond Western civilization.\nFor example, Paul Gauguin moved\nto the island of Tahiti in the 1890s.\nThere, he found inspiration in the island's\ninhabitants, landscape, and culture\nto create artwork that intertwined\nEuropean themes and Polynesian lore.\nOthers looked the cultures \nof the Islamic world,\nbut the most influential inspiration\nwould come from Sub-Saharan Africa.\nAs European empires expanded\ndeeper into the African continent,\nits artifacts and artworks made their way\ninto the hands of museums and collectors.\nOne such collector was Henri Matisse,\nwho showed his friend Picasso \na mask he had acquired\nmade by the Dan tribe of the Ivory Coast.\nThe mask awoke Picasso's curiosity,\nleading him to visit the Trocadéro \nEthnographic Museum in Paris in 1907.\nFounded to house acquisitions \nfrom colonial conquests,\nthe museum boasted \na collection of African art,\nwith stylized figures \nand masks made of wood\nand decorated with simple colors \nand materials.\nThe visit was a revelation for Picasso,\nwho proclaimed that African masks\nwere what painting was all about.\nAt this time, Picasso had been working\non a painting of five nude women\nin a style that would later come\nto be known as Cubism.\nAnd while three of these ladies\nshow facial features\nfound in ancient Iberian art,\na nod to Picasso's Spanish heritage,\nthe faces of the two on the right\nclosely resemble African masks.\nCreated in 1907 after hundreds\nof sketches and studies,\n\"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\"\nhas been considered \nthe first truly 20th century masterpiece,\nbreaking with many previously \nheld notions in art.\nIt was at once aggressive and abstract,\ndistorted yet primal in its raw geometry,\na new artistic language with new forms,\ncolors, and meanings.\nAnd these avant-garde qualities\ncaused a sensation\nwhen the painting was first exhibited\nalmost ten years later.\nThe public was shocked,\ncritics denounced it as immoral,\nand even Picasso's own friends\nwere simultaneously surprised,\noffended,\nand mesmerized at his audacity.\nMore artists soon followed \nin Picasso's footsteps.\nConstantin Brâncuși \nand Amedeo Modigliani in Paris,\nas well as the German Expressionists,\nall drew on the aesthetics \nof African sculptures in their work.\nOthers looked to a different continent\nfor their inspiration.\nBritish sculptor Henry Moore based many\nof his semi-abstract bronze sculptures\non a replica of a chacmool,\na distinctive reclining statue\nfrom the Toltec-Maya culture.\nPre-Columbian art was also a major\ninfluence for Josef Albers.\nHe created a series of compositions,\nsuch as the geometrical series\nHomage to the Square,\nthat were inspired by pyramids\nand local art\nhe encountered\non his frequent visits to Mexico.\nInspiration from ancient cultures\ninitiated one of the most revolutionary \nmovements in art history,\nbut were these artists playing the role\nof explorers or conquistadors,\nappropriating ideas and profiting\nfrom cultures they considered primitive?\nQuestions like this deserve scrutiny,\nas artists continue to redefine standards.\nPerhaps not too long from now,\nthe bold innovations of modern art\nwill seem like stale orthodoxies,\nready to be overturned by a new set\nof radical trailblazers\ndrawing inspiration from another\nunlikely source.",

problems are gonna be way easier\n0:42\nand the whole process is gonna make a lot more sense.\n0:45\nLet's figure out how to do this.\n0:46\nHow do you do these things?\n0:47\nWe'll do the first one first.\n0:48\nLet's try to tackle this one.\n0:49\nLet's try to figure out how do you determine\n0:51\nthe direction of the electric field\n0:52\nthat's created by a charge.\n0:54\nLet's say we didn't know, this is what the electric field\n0:56\nlook like around a positive charge.\n0:59\nI just gave this to you\n0:59\nbut how do we know that this is what the electric field's\n1:02\nsupposed to look like?\n1:03\nWhat we can do is this.\n1:04\nWe can say that we know the definition of electric field\n1:07\nis that it's the amount of electrical force\n1:10\nexerted per charge.\n1:12\nIn other words, if you took some test charge,\n1:14\nthink of this Q as the test charge\n1:16\nand we usually just make this a positive test charge\n1:19\nso this is easier to think about.\n1:20\nIf you took some positive test charge into some region\n1:23\nlet's do that, let's put some positive test charge in here.\n1:26\nWe take this test charge, we move it around.\n1:27\nAll we have to do to figure out\n1:29\nthe direction of the electric field,\n1:31\nsince this Q would be positive,\n1:32\nwe can just figure out what direction\n1:34\nis the electric force on that positive test charge.\n1:37\nIn other words, the direction of the electric field E\n1:40\nis gonna be the same direction as the electric force\n1:43\non a positive test charge.\n1:45\nBecause if you know about vector equations,\n1:47\nlook at this electric fields vector,\n1:49\nthis electric forces vector.\n1:50\nThis electric field is just gonna adopt\n1:52\nthe same direction as the electric force\n1:55\nas long as this Q is positive.\n1:56\nIf this Q were negative it would flip the sign\n1:59\nof this electric force\n2:00\nand then the E would point the opposite direction.\n2:02\nBut if we keep our test charge positive\n2:04\nthen we know, okay, the electric field's\n2:06\njust gonna point the same direction\n2:08\nas the electrical force on that positive test charge.\n2:11\nHere's what I mean.\n2:12\nWe take our positive test charge.\n2:14\nWe move it around.\n2:14\nIf I wanna know the electric field at this spot right here,\n2:17\nI just ask myself,\n2:19\nwhich way does the electrical force\n2:20\npoint on that test charge?\n2:22\nThe electric force would point to the right\n2:24\nsince it's being repelled\n2:26\nby this other positive charge over here.\n2:28\nI know that the electric force points to the right,\n2:30\nthese charges repel each other.\n2:32\nAnd since the electric force points to the right,\n2:33\nthat means the electric field in this region\n2:35\nalso points to the right.\n2:37\nIt might not have the same magnitude.\n2:39\nThe electric force might be 20 newtons\n2:41\nand the electric field might be 10 newtons per coulomb\n2:44\nbut they have the same direction.\n2:45\nAnd I can move this charge somewhere else,\n2:47\nlet's say I move it over here.\n2:48\nWhich way would the electric force point?\n2:50\nWell, these positive charges are still repelling.\n2:52\nI'd still have an electric force to the right.\n2:54\nThat electric force would be smaller\n2:56\nbut it would still point to the right\n2:57\nand that means the electric field\n2:59\nalso still points to the right,\n3:00\nit would be smaller as well\n3:02\nbut it would still point to the right.\n3:03\nAnd if we wanna determine the electric field elsewhere,\n3:05\nwe can move our positive test charge,\n3:06\nI'll move it over to here.\n3:08\nI'll ask which way is the electric force\n3:10\non this positive test charge?\n3:11\nThat would be in this direction\n3:13\nsince these positive charges are repelling each other,\n3:16\nthey're pushing each other away\n3:17\nso this positive always gets pushed away\n3:19\nfrom this other positive charge.\n3:21\nAnd so, that also means that the electric field\n3:23\nis pointing in that direction as well.\n3:25\nWe keep doing this.\n3:26\nI can move this somewhere else.\n3:27\nI can move this positive charge down here.\n3:29\nThe charges repel so the electric force\n3:30\nwould point downward.\n3:31\nAnd that means the electric field would also point down.\n3:34\nIf you keep doing this,\n3:35\nif you keep mapping what's the direction\n3:37\nof the electric force on a positive test charge?\n3:39\nEventually, you realize oh, it's always just gonna point\n3:42\nradially out away from this other positive charge.\n3:46\nAnd so we know the electric field\n3:47\nfrom a positive charge is just gonna point\n3:49\nradially outward, that's why we drew it like this.\n3:52\nBecause this positive charge would push\n3:54\nsome positive test charge radially away from it\n3:57\nsince it would be repelling it.\n3:59\nPositive charges create electric fields\n4:01\nthat point radially away from them.\n4:03\nNow what if the charge creating the field\n4:05\nwere a negative charge?\n4:07\nSo, let's try to figure that one out,\n4:08\nlet me get rid of this.\n4:09\nLet's say the charge creating the electric field\n4:11\nwere negative, a big negative charge,\n4:13\nhow do we determine the electric field\n4:14\ndirection around this negative charge?\n4:16\nWe're gonna do the same thing,\n4:17\nwe're gonna take our positive test charge\n4:19\nand we're gonna keep our test charge positive,\n4:21\nthat way we know that the direction\n4:24\nof the electric force on this positive test charge\n4:27\nis gonna be the same direction\n4:28\nas the electric field in that region.\n4:30\nIn other words, the positivity of this test charge\n4:33\nwill just make it so that the electric field\n4:34\nand electric force point in the same direction.\n4:37\nAnd if we do that, I'll move this around.\n4:38\nWe'll just put it at this point here,\n4:39\nwe'll move this test charge here.\n4:41\nWhich way is the force on that test charge?\n4:43\nThis time it's getting attracted to this negative charge.\n4:46\nOpposite charges attract\n4:47\nso the electric force would point this way\n4:49\nand since it's a positive test charge\n4:51\nand it preserve the direction in this equation,\n4:53\nthat means the electric field\n4:55\nalso points in that leftward direction.\n4:57\nAnd we can keep mapping the field\n4:58\nwe'll move the test charge over to here.\n5:00\nThe electric force this time is gonna point up\n5:02\nbecause this positive test charges\n5:03\nis attracted to this negative charge.\n5:05\nAnd if the electric force points up,\n5:07\nthat means the electric field also points up in that region.\n5:10\nAnd you'd realize the electric force\n5:12\nis always gonna pull a positive test charge\n5:15\ntoward this negative creating the field around it.\n5:17\nAnd because of that, the electric field\n5:19\ncreated by a negative charge points radially inward\n5:24\ntoward that negative charge.\n5:25\nThis is different.\n5:26\nPositive charge created a field that pointed\n5:28\nradially away from\n5:30\nbecause it always repelled the positive test charge.\n5:33\nBut a negative charge creates an electric field\n5:34\nthat points radially into\n5:37\nbecause it's always attracting a positive test charge.\n5:40\nBasically what I'm saying is\n5:41\nthat if we got rid of all these,\n5:42\nclean this up,\n5:43\nthe electric field from a positive charge\n5:44\npoints radially outward\n5:46\nbut if it were a negative charge,\n5:48\nyou'd have to erase all these arrowheads\n5:49\nand put them on the other end.\n5:51\nBecause the electric field from a negative charge\n5:53\npoints radially inward toward that negative charge.\n5:56\nIn other words, the electric field created by\n5:59\na negative charge at some point in space around it\n6:02\nis gonna point toward that negative charge\n6:04\ncreating that electric field.\n6:06\nAnd so, that's how you could determine\n6:07\nthe direction of the electric field created by a charge.\n6:09\nIf it's a positive charge you know\n6:11\nthe electric field points radially out from that positive.\n6:14\nAnd if it's a negative charge,\n6:16\nyou know the field points radially inward\n6:18\ntoward that negative charge.\n6:20\nOkay, so that was number one here.\n6:21\nWe found the direction\n6:23\nof the electric field created by a charge.\n6:25\nCheck, we've done this.\n6:26\nNow we should get good at finding\n6:28\nthe direction of the electric force\n6:29\nexerted on a charge in a field.\n6:32\nWhat does that mean?\n6:33\nLet's say you had a region of space\n6:34\nwith electric field pointing to the right.\n6:36\nWhat's creating this electric field?\n6:38\nI don't know.\n6:39\nIt doesn't even really matter.\n6:40\nThis is why the electric field is a cool idea.\n6:42\nI don't really need to know\n6:43\nwhat created this electric field.\n6:45\nI mean, it could be positive charges over here\n6:47\ncreating fields that point radially away from them.\n6:51\nBut it could also be negative charges over here\n6:53\ncreating fields that point radially toward them\n6:56\nor both, we don't really know.\n6:58\nIt doesn't really matter.\n6:58\nAs long as I now have an electric field\n7:00\nthat points to the right,\n7:01\nI can figure out the direction of the electric force\n7:03\non a charge in that field.\n7:05\nLet's put a charge in this field.\n7:06\nWe'll just start with a positive charge.\n7:08\nWe'll put this charge in here.\n7:09\nSince the electric field is equal to\n7:12\nthe electric force on a charge\n7:13\ndivided by that charge,\n7:15\nif this is a positive charge\n7:17\nand this charge we put down here is positive,\n7:20\nthen the electric force points in the same direction\n7:22\nas the electric field and vice versa.\n7:24\nThe electric field and electric force\n7:26\nwould point the same direction\n7:27\nif the charge feeling that force is a positive charge.\n7:30\nThis is just a long way of saying\n7:32\nthat the electric force on a positive charge\n7:34\nis gonna point in the same direction\n7:36\nas the electric field in that region.\n7:39\nIf there's an electric field that points to the right\n7:41\nlike we have in here\n7:42\nthen the electric force on a positive charge in that region\n7:45\nis also gonna point to the right.\n7:46\nAnd you might be thinking well,\n7:47\nduh, isn't that kind of obvious?\n7:49\nDoesn't this equation say\n7:50\nthat the electric force has to be\n7:52\nthe same direction as the electric field.\n7:54\nAlmost, not quite.\n7:55\nThere's one exception.\n7:56\nIf this charge in here were negative,\n7:59\nif you put a negative charge in here,\n8:00\nnow this force vector gets multiplied by a negative,\n8:04\nwell, divided by a negative but the same thing.\n8:06\nDividing by negative ones like multiplying by negative one.\n8:09\nYou would swap the direction of this force vector\n8:12\nand this electric field would point\n8:13\nthe opposite direction as the force\n8:15\non a negative charge in that region,\n8:17\nand that's confusing.\n8:18\nIn other words, check this out.\n8:19\nSay we took a negative charge in this region\n8:21\nand we wanted to know which way\n8:22\nwould the electric force be on this negative charge\n8:25\ndue to this electric field that points to the right.\n8:27\nWell, if the electric field points to the right\n8:29\nand this charge is negative,\n8:31\nthen the electric force has to point to the left.\n8:33\nAnd the reason is if this force vector is leftward\n8:36\nand we divide it by a negative sign,\n8:38\nthat's gonna take this force vector\n8:40\nand turn it from left to right.\n8:41\nThat means the electric field\n8:42\nwould be pointing to the right.\n8:44\nIf the charge experiencing the electric force is negative\n8:47\nbecause multiplying a vector by negative one\n8:49\nchanges its direction,\n8:51\nthe electric force and the electric field\n8:53\nare gonna have opposite directions.\n8:54\nA negative charge feels a force\n8:56\nin the opposite direction as the electric field\n8:59\nbut a positive charge feels a force\n9:01\nin the same direction as the electric field.\n9:03\nAnd I'll repeat that because it's important.\n9:05\nPositive charges experience an electric force\n9:08\nin the same direction as the electric field.\n9:11\nAnd negative charges experience an electric force\n9:14\nin the opposite direction as the electric field.\n9:17\nPeople mess this up all the time.\n9:18\nThis confuses people a lot\n9:20\nso here's a way that might make it seem a little simpler.\n9:23\nNotice that neither of these charges\n9:24\nare creating this electric field\n9:26\nthat's exerting the force on them\n9:28\nbut let's draw some possibilities\n9:29\nfor charges that might be creating this electric field.\n9:32\nOne way to create an electric field to the right\n9:34\nis by having a bunch of positive charges over here,\n9:37\ncreating electric fields that point radially away from them.\n9:41\nThat would create an electric field to the right.\n9:42\nAnd what would be the force on these charges then?\n9:45\nWell, we know positive charges repel other positive charges\n9:48\nso the electric forces to the right.\n9:50\nAnd positive charges attract negative charges\n9:52\nso the electric force would point to the left.\n9:54\nThis convention of electric forces pointing\n9:56\nin the same direction as the electric field\n9:59\nfor a positive charge\n10:00\nand electric forces pointing in the opposite direction\n10:02\nof the electric field for a negative charge\n10:04\nagrees with what we already know\n10:05\nabout opposites attracting and likes repelling.\n10:08\nIt's just that people get confused\n10:09\nwhen we don't draw these charges\n10:10\nthat are creating the electric field,\n10:12\nsometimes people forget how to find\n10:14\nthe direction of the force.\n10:15\nIf you want to, you can always draw them in there.\n10:17\nThe other possibility is that\n10:18\nto create fields to the right,\n10:20\nwe can put negative charges over here.\n10:22\nThese might be creating that electric field\n10:24\nbecause they'd create fields\n10:25\nthat point radially into them\n10:27\nbecause that's what negative charges do.\n10:29\nAnd which way will the forces be?\n10:30\nThese negatives would be attracting\n10:32\nthis positive to the right just like we said\n10:34\nin the same direction as the electric field.\n10:36\nWhether that electric field created by\n10:38\npositives or negatives, it doesn't matter.\n10:40\nIf the electric field points to the right,\n10:42\npositive charges feel the force to the right.\n10:44\nAnd then a negative charge in this region\n10:46\nwould be repelled by these negatives\n10:47\nor attracted by these positives\n10:49\nand it would feel a force to the left.\n10:51\nIt doesn't matter whether it was positives\n10:53\nor negatives creating the field.\n10:55\nIf the field points right,\n10:57\npositive charges are gonna feel a force\n10:59\nin that region to the right.\n11:00\nNegative charges are gonna feel a force\n11:01\nin that region to the left.\n11:03\nLet's do one more for practice.\n11:04\nLet's say you had this example.\n11:06\nLet's say you had a negative charge\n11:07\nand it was experiencing an electric force downward.\n11:10\nNow we wanna know what direction\n11:12\nis the electric field in this region?\n11:14\nWell, if the electric force\n11:15\non a negative charge is downward,\n11:17\nthe only way that happens is\n11:18\nfor there to be an electric field\n11:20\nin this region that points upward.\n11:22\nBecause negative charges are gonna feel\n11:23\nan electric force in the opposite direction\n11:26\nas the electric field.\n11:27\nThe direction of the E would be the opposite direction\n11:30\nas the direction of F\n11:31\nor it could just ask what charge would cause\n11:33\nan electric force downward on this negative charge?\n11:35\nA big positive charge down here would do it.\n11:37\nWell, positive charges create fields\n11:39\nthat point radially away from them.\n11:41\nSo in this region up here\n11:42\nit would have to point radially upward\n11:44\nsince that's a away from the positive charge.\n11:47\nOr you could say something else\n11:48\nthat would cause an electric force\n11:49\ndownward on this negative charge\n11:51\nwould be a big negative charge up here.\n11:53\nAnd negative charges always create fields\n11:55\nthat point radially into them.\n11:57\nWhat would the field be in this region down here,\n11:59\nit would still point upward\n12:01\nbecause upward would be radially in\n12:03\ntoward the negative charge creating that field.\n12:06\nRecapping, you can find the direction\n12:08\nof the electric field created by a charge\n12:10\nsince positive charges create fields\n12:12\nthat point radially away from them.\n12:14\nAnd negative charges create fields\n12:16\nthat point radially toward them.\n12:18\nAnd you can find the direction of\n12:19\nthe electric force on a charge\n12:21\nsince positive charges are gonna feel an electric force\n12:24\nin the same direction as the electric field in that region.\n12:27\nAnd negative charges are gonna feel an electric force\n12:29\nin the opposite direction\n12:31\nto the electric field in that region.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:01\nMale: What I'm going to talk about in this video\n0:02\nis one of the darker periods in Chilean history\n0:04\nand depending on your point of view,\n0:05\nalso one of the darker periods in American history.\n0:08\nWhat I want to make clear in this video,\n0:11\nand it applies to every video I'll make in history,\n0:13\nis be skeptical of everything that I'm telling you.\n0:15\nI'm going to do my best attempt to give a reasonably\n0:18\naccurate series of events and draw connections\n0:22\nwhen they're clear and also make it clear where\n0:24\nthere might be connections and no one is sure.\n0:26\nBut you should be skeptical and frankly you should\n0:28\nbe skeptical of anything anyone is telling you.\n0:30\nI encourage y'all to kind of use this as a scaffold\n0:32\nfor your own research, for you to look up\n0:34\nthese names and these events and figure out\n0:36\nwhat actually happened.\n0:38\nNow, with that said, let's rewind back to 1970\n0:42\nwhen Chile was having an election for president.\n0:45\nAnd they have their election and it's considered\n0:47\na fairly free and fair election,\n0:50\nand one of the candidates in that election\n0:51\nwas this gentleman over here,\n0:53\nSalvadore Allende, who was a known Marxist.\n0:57\nA known Marxist.\n0:59\nHe has communist ideologies here.\n1:04\nHe's known to be sympathetic to what has\n1:07\nhappened in Cuba, sympathetic to the Soviets.\n1:10\nSo you can imagine in this context America is concerned.\n1:16\nIt's in the middle of the cold war.\n1:17\nYou have Richard Nixon President.\n1:19\nYou have Henry Kissinger is his Secretary of State.\n1:22\nThey're actively watching this election.\n1:25\nThey clearly do not want Salvadore Allende\n1:27\nto become president.\n1:28\nAll of a sudden a major country in Latin America\n1:31\nbeing controlled by a Marxist.\n1:34\nUnlucky for them, Salvadore Allende actually does\n1:37\nget more votes than everyone else.\n1:39\nHe gets 36% of the votes, which is a plurality.\n1:44\nJust so you know what plurality means, it means\n1:46\nthat you got more of the votes than anyone else\n1:48\nbut not necessarily the majority of the votes.\n1:50\nIf he'd gotten 51% of the votes that would be a majority.\n1:53\nIn this case, he didn't get a majority\n1:55\nand the standard procedure in Chile is that\n1:58\nif no one gets a majority it goes to Congress\n2:00\nand Congress picks who's president.\n2:03\nThe usual thing that they would do is they would\n2:06\npick whoever has the largest amount of votes.\n2:08\nThey normally didn't do a runoff.\n2:10\nSo, you can imagine Nixon and Kissinger they're worried.\n2:13\nSo they kind of get into let's mess with what's going\n2:16\non in Chile mode.\n2:18\nAnd this part is well established that they had this\n2:19\nwhat they called a track one strategy\n2:21\nof actually trying to get the Chilean congress\n2:24\nto not do what they normally do, to not pick the guy\n2:28\nwith the largest number of votes.\n2:31\nSo, they were trying to mess there, didn't seem\n2:32\nlike something they would be able to pull off.\n2:33\nThe other thing that it looks like they started\n2:36\nto kind of get involved with through the CIA\n2:41\nis they started to at least interface, it's not clear\n2:46\nhow much they actually supported, they actually\n2:49\nstarted to talk to people in the military and see\n2:52\nhow likely is a coup to happen.\n2:55\nHow likely is Allende to be overthrown\n2:58\nif he becomes president?\n2:59\nThey were looking for people who could I guess\n3:02\nkeep this known Marxist from becoming president.\n3:07\nAnd the number one problem was this guy right over here,\n3:11\nthe number one problem was this guy right over here.\n3:14\nIn this whole video I would say that Rene Schneider\n3:17\nwas the only unambiguously good guy in this video.\n3:21\nHe was the commander in chief of the Chilean military.\n3:24\nHe said, \"Look, I don't care who becomes president.\n3:29\nI don't care how much I disagree with him.\n3:31\nI don't care how much pressure the Americans\n3:33\nput on me or how much pressure the rest of the\n3:35\nmilitary puts on me, the role of the Chilean military\n3:39\nis not to mess with politics.\"\n3:42\nThe called him the constitutionalist.\n3:44\n\"The role of the Chilean military is not to overthrow\n3:47\npeople when we don't like them.\n3:49\nThe role of the Chilean military is only to defend Chile.\n3:52\nIt's only to literally do ...\"\n3:54\nI guess you know what militaries are supposed to do\n3:55\nwhat constitutions say the military is supposed to do.\n3:59\nSo, you can imagine that the people who wanted\n4:02\nto overthrow Allende, now that it looks\n4:06\nlike he's coming to power.\n4:08\nThey said this guy is not a convenient guy to have in power.\n4:11\nHe doesn't like to play the way we play,\n4:13\neven though maybe there were other elements\n4:16\nin the military that did want to do that.\n4:17\nSo, this is what's a little bit unclear.\n4:19\nYou have this former general in the Chilean military\n4:22\nwho is clearly anti Allende, and he's also\n4:27\nanti Schneider because this guy right here\n4:29\nRoberto Viaux, he thinks that the military should be\n4:32\nI guess actively overthrowing dictators\n4:35\nand so there is some contact between him and\n4:39\nthe CIA.\n4:41\nIt seems like the CIA may have supplied some\n4:43\nsupport to him and then maybe got a little bit\n4:45\nfreaked out that ...\n4:47\nAt least Kissinger might have gotten a little bit\n4:48\nfreaked out that this guy seemed a little bit extreme.\n4:52\nBut remember we're in this period where Allende\n4:54\nwas, he got 36% of the votes, Congress is\n4:58\ntrying to figure out what they do about it\n5:00\nand during this period there are some people who say\n5:02\nWell look, if Rene Schneider is not going to do,\n5:05\nwhat's in their mind, the right thing\n5:08\nand depose the eventual Allende then we'll have to\n5:12\ndepose Rene Schneider.\n5:14\nSo, you have this plot that's worked up by\n5:16\nRoberto Viaux to essentially kidnap Rene Schneider.\n5:20\nAnd that would essentially depose him from being\n5:23\nhead of the military and maybe they could put\n5:24\nsomebody in his place who is more likely to have\n5:28\na coup, more likely to want to overthrow Allende.\n5:32\nUnfortunately, when this guy's people tried to kidnap\n5:37\nSchneider, Schneider he's got a gun, he sees\n5:41\nthese guys kidnapping, he takes out the gun\n5:43\nand then the kidnappers shoot him several times\n5:46\nand he eventually dies.\n5:48\nSo, this kidnapping turns into an assasination of Rene Schneider\n5:53\nand they wanted to kill him or remove him or whatever\n5:58\njust because he essentially wanted to do his job.\n6:00\nSo he's the only person in this whole narrative\n6:02\nwhere I'll say he was an unambiguous good guy.\n6:08\nNow, what's not clear is how much involvement the Americans\n6:12\nor the CIA had in supporting this kind of assassination\n6:17\nor this kidnapping of Scheider.\n6:19\nIt does look like they kind of knew that something was going on.\n6:21\nThis is a quote from Kissinger.\n6:23\nSeems pretty well substantiated.\n6:25\nWhere he told Nixon a few days before Schneider\n6:29\nwas assassinated when Nixon said hey what's\n6:30\ngoing on in Chile?\n6:32\nAre we working on any ways through the military\n6:35\nand are we doing anything about potentially\n6:37\nmaybe about Schneider. I don't know look that up for yourself.\n6:41\nI don't know how much Nixon may or may not have known.\n6:43\nKissinger told Nixon, \"This looks hopeless. I turned\n6:47\nit off. Nothing could be worse than an aborted coup.\"\n6:51\nSo this quote is interesting because it looks like\n6:54\nthey thought about it.\n6:55\nI turned it off.\n6:56\nWhich implies that at one point he had it turned on.\n6:59\nSo at one point they were actively thinking\n7:00\nabout working with Roberto Viaux maybe to kidnap\n7:04\nSchneider, maybe to orchestrate a coup against Allende,\n7:09\nbut they turned it off.\n7:10\nSo, they're not morally above doing this kind of thing,\n7:14\nbut they decided that this guy was a little bit ...\n7:16\nWas not as competent as maybe they thought he should,\n7:19\nand at least according to Kissinger he's saying\n7:21\nwe turned it off because nothing could be worse\n7:23\nthan an abortive coup.\n7:25\nIt turned out that's exactly what happened\n7:26\nbecause as soon as this guy got killed everyone\n7:29\nwas like oh my God you have all these shady elements\n7:31\nwho are trying to overthrow democracy and that\n7:35\nactually put more pressure on Congress to say\n7:37\nhey we have to let Allende become president.\n7:40\nSo, in November he gets inaugurated president.\n7:43\nNovember Allende becomes president.\n7:49\nThere's a bunch of different stories here how\n7:53\nmuch the CIA was involved.\n7:54\nThe counter argument is look the CIA would not\n7:57\nhave wanted to assassinate Schneider because this\n8:00\nwould have only made Allende all the more popular.\n8:03\nThey would have only maybe wanted to remove him\n8:06\nand put someone else there who was more likely\n8:09\nto have a coup against Allende later.\n8:11\nWho knows.\n8:12\nIf you believe Kissinger's words here it looks\n8:14\nlike maybe they provided some initial support to Viaux\n8:17\nand then they backed off a little bit.\n8:19\nWho knows.\n8:20\nWell, regardless to say by November of 1970 Salvadore Allende\n8:24\nbecame president, and he started implementing\n8:26\nhis kind of Marxist ideology and it didn't go that well.\n8:32\nChile's economy especially if you fast forward\n8:35\nto 1972, 1973, not doing so well.\n8:38\nHe started price-fixing.\n8:40\nHe tried to do the fairly naive approach of\n8:43\nraising salaries while keeping prices fixed,\n8:46\nwhich will obviously lead to shortages.\n8:48\nSo, all around he wasn't the most popular president.\n8:51\nIt didn't look like it, especially his economic policies\n8:53\nwereworking out that well.\n8:55\nPeople who were pro Allende would say well look\n8:57\njust like what the United States did to Cuba\n8:59\nthey started doing to Chile as soon as they had\n9:01\na Marxist in charge, someone they didn't like.\n9:03\nThe United States started swinging its huge\n9:06\neconomic power around to kind of hurt the Chilean\n9:10\neconomy so that this guy would come out of power.\n9:13\nI'll let you decide that.\n9:15\nYou fastforward all the way to 1973 so now Allende\n9:19\nhas been in power for about three years,\n9:21\nthings are not going well for him.\n9:23\nThere are strikes going on.\n9:25\nHe tries to clamp down on the media a bit.\n9:28\nThere is unrest.\n9:31\nThere are people who definitely don't want\n9:33\nhim to be president anymore, and the people who\n9:38\ndon't think much of the United States will say\n9:40\nhey but the United States the whole time was\n9:41\nkind of actively undermining Allende and that's probably true.\n9:44\nThe United States will say no look we were trying\n9:46\nto keep the press free.\n9:48\nThis guy was clamping down on free press.\n9:49\nWe were trying to keep things so that there will\n9:52\nbe another election so that this guy won't\n9:54\nturn into another Fidel Castro and essentially\n9:56\njust turn Chile into a totalitarian communist regime.\n10:01\nRegardless of which side you take, on September 11, 1973,\n10:06\nAllende is deposed.\n10:08\nThe military surrounds the presidential palace\n10:12\nand it is said that he commits \"suicide.\"\n10:17\nI put that in quotes because once again some\n10:18\npeople believe that he really did commit suicide.\n10:21\nSome people believe that he was assassinated,\n10:23\nand some accounts say that he committed suicide\n10:26\nwith an automatic weapon and well I guess\n10:28\nyou could commit suicide with an automatic weapon\n10:30\nbut it doesn't seem like the weapon of choice\n10:32\nfor many peoples, but I'll leave that once again\n10:34\nfor you to decide.\n10:36\nWhether or not he committed suicide or whether he was killed,\n10:40\nbut regardless to say September 11 he gets\n10:43\nthrown out of power and once again it's not clear\n10:45\nwhat role the CIA played.\n10:50\nThey clearly were sympathetic to the people\n10:52\nthat wanted to overthrow him.\n10:53\nClearly were providing indirect support throughout\n10:57\nAllende's regime to all of the people who were\n10:59\nanti Allende, and you can look up.\n11:01\nThere actually are some declassified documents\n11:03\nthat hint at what the level of CIA involvement\n11:06\nmight have been.\n11:08\nRegardless to say, Allende deposed and this gentleman,\n11:12\nthis gentleman comes to power right over here, Augusto Pinochet.\n11:18\nAnd he comes to power and he says look\n11:21\nyou know this democracy thing is silly.\n11:24\nI am the president.\n11:26\nI am the commander in chief.\n11:28\nChile will be run by military junta.\n11:32\nLet me write that down.\n11:35\nChile will be run by a junta.\n11:37\nA junta just means a government that's run\n11:40\nby the military.\n11:41\nIt's a military dictatorship.\n11:43\nThe military is now in charge of Chile.\n11:45\nWe don't need people to do silly things like voting anymore.\n11:49\nAnd you can imagine Nixon didn't care so much\n11:52\nthat this guy didn't like democracy but he was happy.\n11:54\nLet me see if I can put a smile on his face.\n11:57\nHe was happy that at least Pinochet was not a Marxist,\n12:01\nthat at least we had stopped the spread\n12:05\nof communism in Latin America.\n12:08\nAnd Nixon, with that said, and this is explicit,\n12:11\nhe wanted everything in his power to make\n12:14\nAugusto Pinochet successful especially\n12:17\nfrom an economic point of view.\n12:19\nSo, the United States does start supporting Pinochet.\n12:25\nHe's viewed as kind of an American friend.\n12:27\nUnfortunately for America and unfortunately for Chile,\n12:30\nthis guy is one of those big time tyrants in history.\n12:34\nSo, he is a tyrant.\n12:36\nHe starts rounding up people.\n12:38\nHe starts killing people.\n12:40\nHe's one of those people that anything\n12:42\nanyone...there was a whiff of communism, a whiff\n12:45\nof political opposition he would round them up,\n12:47\nhe would round their family up.\n12:49\nHe would torture people, and just to kind of put some ...\n12:52\nThis is another picture of him when he's older.\n12:54\nIt's amazing how gentle some fairly evil people\n12:57\ncan look in the world.\n12:59\nSo I'll put some unambiguous horns on him.\n13:03\nHe killed many, many people and many, many\n13:07\npeople disappeared.\n13:08\nJust to give an idea, these are some of the people\n13:11\nwho disappeared.\n13:13\nIt was anyone from people who were critical of him,\n13:15\npeople who were perceived to be left-leaning,\n13:18\nwhatever it was.\n13:19\nHe tortured including women and children and all the rest.\n13:23\nSo, all around bad guy.\n13:25\nHe stuck around in Chile as president until 1990.\n13:29\nSo, that's 17 years, and he really stayed\n13:30\nin power until 1998 where he was commander and chief\n13:33\nof the army.\n13:34\nYou can imagine if the military is in control\n13:36\nPresident isn't that important of a title.\n13:39\nCommander and chief is.\n13:40\nSo for 25 years he hung around Chile and\n13:44\ncontinued to be this totalitarian guy,\n13:48\nalthough he liked free markets.\n13:51\nHe was a capitalist in the traditional sense\n13:53\nand the one I guess silver lining if you\n13:58\nhad to throw a silver lining on Pinochet's regime\n14:00\nwas that the Chilean economy actually did well\n14:03\nduring his regime.\n14:05\nChile is considered one of the success stories\n14:08\neconomically over that time period.\n14:10\nSo, I'll let you decide, and some people would\n14:13\nsay oh that's because Pinochet understood economics,\n14:16\nhe didn't try to do all this price fixing stuff that\n14:18\nAllende tried to do.\n14:20\nRegardless of the fact that he was a tyrant,\n14:22\nat least the economy was doing well.\n14:26\nThe other side of the equation would be well look\n14:28\nof course the economy did well, now you had\n14:30\nthe United States doing everything in its power,\n14:33\nthis huge the largest economy in the world,\n14:35\ndoing everything in its power to make sure\n14:38\nthat Chile's economy thrives while one of its\n14:41\nbuddies are in power.\n14:42\nSo, I'll let you decide who's right, who's wrong,\n14:44\nwhat was the actual involvement of the CIA\n14:48\nand Nixon and Kissinger and all of this mess over here.\n14:52\nBut I think needless to say that this was a\n14:54\nnot so pleasant chapter in I guess world history.",

    "source_material": "•\n0:00\nLet's say I have a balloon.\n0:03\nAnd in that balloon I have a bunch of\n0:05\nparticles bouncing around.\n0:07\nThey're gas particles, so they're floating freely.\n0:10\nAnd they each have some velocity, some kinetic energy.\n0:17\nAnd what I care about, let me just draw a few more, what I\n0:23\ncare about is the pressure that is exerted on the surface\n0:27\nof the balloon.\n0:28\nSo I care about the pressure.\n0:29\nAnd what's pressure?\n0:30\nIt's force per area.\n0:36\nSo the area here, you can think of it as the inside\n0:39\nsurface of the balloon.\n0:40\nAnd what's going to apply force to that?\n0:42\nWell any given moment-- I only drew six particles here, but\n0:46\nin a real balloon you would have gazillions of particles,\n0:50\nand we could talk about how large, but more particles than\n0:54\nyou can really probably imagine-- but at any given\n0:57\nmoment, some of those particles are bouncing off the\n0:59\nwall of the container.\n1:01\nThat particle is bouncing there, this particle is\n1:03\nbouncing there, this guy's bouncing like that.\n1:06\nAnd when they bounce, they apply force to the container.\n1:10\nAn outward force, that's what keeps the balloon blown up.\n1:14\nSo think about what the pressure is going to be\n1:16\ndependent on.\n1:18\nSo first of all, the faster these particles move, the\n1:22\nhigher the pressure.\n1:31\nSlower particles, you're going to be bouncing into the\n1:34\ncontainer less, and when you do bounce into the container,\n1:37\nit's going to be less of a ricochet, or less of a change\n1:40\nin momentum.\n1:41\nSo slower particles, you're going to\n1:45\nhave pressure go down.\n1:47\nNow, it's practically impossible to measure the\n1:50\nkinetic energy, or the velocity, or the direction of\n1:53\neach individual particle.\n1:55\nEspecially when you have gazillions\n1:56\nof them in a balloon.\n1:57\nSo we do is we think of the average\n2:00\nenergy of the particles.\n2:01\nAnd the average energy of the particles, you might say oh,\n2:04\nSal is about to introduce us to a new concept.\n2:08\nIt's a new way of looking at probably a very familiar\n2:11\nconcept to you.\n2:12\nAnd that's temperature.\n2:14\nTemperature can and should be viewed as the average energy\n2:18\nof the particles in the system.\n2:20\nSo I'll put a little squiggly line, because there's a lot of\n2:23\nways to think about it.\n2:24\nAverage energy.\n2:28\nAnd mostly kinetic energy, because these particles are\n2:31\nmoving and bouncing.\n2:32\nThe higher the temperature, the faster that these\n2:35\nparticles move.\n2:36\nAnd the more that they're going to bounce into the side\n2:40\nof the container.\n2:41\nBut temperature is average energy.\n2:44\nIt tells us energy per particle.\n2:52\nSo obviously, if we only had one particle in there with\n2:57\nsuper high temperature, that's going to have less pressure\n3:00\nthan if we have a million particles in there.\n3:02\nLet me draw that.\n3:05\nIf I have, let's take two cases right here.\n3:12\nOne is, I have a bunch of particles with a certain\n3:16\ntemperature, moving in their different directions.\n3:22\nAnd the other example, I have one particle.\n3:25\nAnd maybe they have the same temperature.\n3:27\nThat on average, they have the same kinetic energy.\n3:29\nThe kinetic energy per particle is the same.\n3:32\nClearly, this one is going to be applying more pressure to\n3:35\nits container, because at any given moment more of these\n3:38\nparticles are going to be bouncing off the side than in\n3:40\nthis example.\n3:41\nThis guy's going to bounce, bam, then going to go and\n3:43\nmove, bounce, bam.\n3:44\nSo he's going to be applying less pressure, even though his\n3:46\ntemperature might be the same.\n3:47\nBecause temperature is kinetic energy, or you can view it as\n3:51\nkinetic energy per particles.\n3:53\nOr it's a way of looking at kinetic energy per particle.\n3:55\nSo if we wanted to look at the total energy in the system, we\n3:59\nwould want to multiply the temperature times the number\n4:04\nof particles.\n4:05\nAnd just since we're dealing on the molecular scale, the\n4:08\nnumber of particles can often be represented as moles.\n4:11\nRemember, moles is just a number of particles.\n4:13\nSo we're saying that that pressure-- well, I'll say it's\n4:19\nproportional, so it's equal to some constant,\n4:26\nlet's call that R.\n4:29\nBecause we've got to make all the units work out in the end.\n4:31\nI mean temperature is in Kelvin but we eventually want\n4:33\nto get back to joules.\n4:34\nSo let's just say it's equal to some constant, or it's\n4:36\nproportional to temperature times the number of particles.\n4:41\nAnd we can do that a bunch of ways.\n4:43\nBut let's think of that in moles.\n4:44\nIf I say there are 5 mole particles there, you know\n4:47\nthat's 5 times 6 times 10 to the 23 particles.\n4:50\nSo, this is the number of particles.\n4:55\nThis is the temperature.\n4:57\nAnd this is just some constant.\n5:02\nNow, what else is the pressure dependent on?\n5:04\nWe gave these two examples.\n5:06\nObviously, it is dependent on the temperature; the faster\n5:08\neach of these particles move, the higher pressure we'll\n5:10\nhave. It's also dependent on the number of particles, the\n5:13\nmore particles we have, the more pressure we'll have. What\n5:16\nabout the size of the container?\n5:18\nThe volume of the container.\n5:20\nIf we took this example, but we shrunk the container\n5:23\nsomehow, maybe by pressing on the outside.\n5:26\nSo if this container looked like this, but we still had\n5:29\nthe same four particles in it, with the same average kinetic\n5:37\nenergy, or the same temperature.\n5:39\nSo the number of particles stays the same, the\n5:41\ntemperature is the same, but the volume has gone down.\n5:44\nNow, these guys are going to bump into the sides of the\n5:47\ncontainer more frequently and there's less area.\n5:50\nSo at any given moment, you have more force and less area.\n5:54\nSo when you have more force and less area, your pressure\n5:56\nis going to go up.\n5:57\nSo when the volume went down, your pressure went up.\n6:08\nSo we could say that pressure is inversely\n6:10\nproportional to volume.\n6:12\nSo let's think about that.\n6:13\nLet's put that into our equation.\n6:15\nWe said that pressure is proportional-- and I'm just\n6:22\nsaying some proportionality constant, let's call that R,\n6:26\nto the number of particles times the temperature, this\n6:31\ngives us the total energy.\n6:32\nAnd it's inversely proportional to the volume.\n6:36\nAnd if we multiply both sides of this times the volume, we\n6:39\nget the pressure times the volume is proportional to the\n6:46\nnumber of particles times the temperature.\n6:49\nSo PV is equal to RnT.\n6:51\nAnd just to switch this around a little bit, so it's in a\n6:53\nform that you're more likely to see in your chemistry book,\n6:56\nif we just switch the n and the R term.\n6:58\nYou get pressure times volume is equal to n, the number of\n7:03\nparticles you have, times some constant times temperature.\n7:08\nAnd this right here is the ideal gas equation.\n7:14\nHopefully, it makes some sense to you.\n7:21\nWhen they say ideal gas, it's based on this little mental\n7:25\nexercise I did to come up with this.\n7:27\nI made some implicit assumptions when I did this.\n7:30\nOne is I assumed that we're dealing with an ideal gas.\n7:35\nAnd so you say what, Sal, is an ideal gas?\n7:38\nAn ideal gas is one where the molecules are not too\n7:43\nconcerned with each other.\n7:44\nThey're just concerned with their own kinetic energy and\n7:46\nbouncing off the wall.\n7:47\nSo they don't attract or repel each other.\n7:56\nLet's say they attracted each other, then as you increased\n7:59\nthe number of particles maybe they'd want to\n8:01\nnot go to the side.\n8:02\nMaybe they'd all gravitate towards the center a little\n8:04\nbit more if they did attract each other.\n8:06\nAnd if they did that, they would bounce into the walls\n8:08\nless and the pressure would be a little bit lower.\n8:10\nSo we're assuming that they don't attract\n8:11\nor repel each other.\n8:13\nAnd we're also assuming that the actual volume of the\n8:17\nindividual particles are inconsequential.\n8:20\nWhich is a pretty good assumption, because they're\n8:22\npretty small.\n8:22\nAlthough, if you start putting a ton of particles into a\n8:28\ncertain volume, then at some point, especially if they're\n8:31\nbig molecules, it'll start to matter in terms of their size.\n8:34\nBut we're assuming for the purposes of our little mental\n8:37\nexercise that the molecules have inconsequential volumes\n8:43\nand they don't attract or repel each other.\n8:45\nAnd in that situation, we can apply the ideal gas equation\n8:50\nright here.\n8:52\nNow, we've established the ideal gas equation.\n8:54\nBut you're like, well what's R, how do I deal with it, and\n8:56\nhow do I do math problems, and solve chemistry\n8:59\nproblems with it?\n8:59\nAnd how do the units all work out?\n9:01\nWe'll do all of that in the next video where we'll solve a\n9:03\nton of equations, or a ton of exercises with\n9:06\nthe ideal gas equation.\n9:08\nThe important takeaway from this video is just to have the\n9:12\nintuition as to why this actually does make sense.\n9:15\nAnd frankly, once you have this intution, you should\n9:17\nnever forget it.\n9:17\nYou should be able to maybe even derive it on your own.",

And to understand\n0:18\nthat, I've distilled a bunch of the alliances that occurred\n0:20\nin those decades leading up to World War I.\n0:22\nAnd this is just a distilled version.\n0:24\nThere were many other alliances that were tangentially related.\n0:26\nBut I tried to distill down the ones that were directly related\n0:29\nto all of the dominoes falling in 1914 that\n0:33\nled to all of Europe being essentially at war\n0:35\nwith each other.\n0:36\nSo to understand that, we have to rewind 75 years.\n0:39\nSo World War I starts in 1914.\n0:42\n75 years before that, in 1839, you have the Treaty of London.\n0:47\nAnd the Treaty of London did many things.\n0:49\nBut Article 7 is what's relevant to the beginning of World War\n0:52\nI, where Britain agrees to protect\n0:55\nthe neutrality of Belgium.\n0:57\nAnd if you're skeptical, you might say, hey,\n0:59\nthis is a 75-year-old treaty.\n1:01\nWhy does this matter anymore?\n1:02\nAnd that, actually, would be a good question.\n1:05\nReally, all of these alliances-- it's\n1:06\na very healthy debate you can have as to\n1:08\nwhether these are the direct causes of why\n1:10\none of these powers declared war on the other.\n1:13\nOr whether these were just excuses.\n1:15\nThese were a legal pretext for saying,\n1:17\noh, I need to declare war on you.\n1:18\nWhen in reality, they really did want\n1:20\nto declare war for a whole set of reasons\n1:21\nto keep the other person's empire in check,\n1:24\nto flex their military muscle, to go\n1:26\nafter more territory in their empires.\n1:28\nWho knows what it might be?\n1:30\nBut needless to say, 1839 was the legal basis\n1:33\nfor the British Empire to protect Belgium.\n1:39\nNow, you fast-forward 40 years, you get to 1879.\n1:43\nYou have a newly born German Empire\n1:46\nout of the Franco-Prussian War in 1871.\n1:50\nThat newly born German empire, they just had-- essentially,\n1:53\nit's an extension of Prussia, fundamentally,\n1:57\na German kingdom.\n1:58\nThey just had a war with France.\n2:00\nThey took some very valuable territory from France.\n2:02\nThey're paranoid that France wants to get back at them.\n2:05\nThey're paranoid about the Russians.\n2:08\nAnd they have some connection with the Austrians--\n2:12\nthe Austro-Hungarians, I should say.\n2:14\nAnd so in 1879, they sign the Dual Alliance Treaty\n2:19\nbetween Germany and Austria-Hungary\n2:21\nto protect each other if Russia attacks.\n2:24\nThey have this common enemy right over here, Russia.\n2:27\nSo they are going to-- let me do this in a different color.\n2:30\nThey are going to protect each other.\n2:32\nSo this makes the new German Empire feel a little bit better\n2:35\nabout its position in Europe, in case\n2:37\nthey were to get into a war with either of these characters.\n2:41\nThen in 1892-- you could imagine,\n2:43\nif you ever play a game of Risk or if you ever\n2:45\nplay the game of Diplomacy, which is actually\n2:47\nbased on what happened in World War\n2:49\nI. If you see some people that you might be\n2:52\nat war with starting to become friends,\n2:54\nyou want to look for other friends, other alliances\n2:56\nthat you can form in case they declare war on you.\n2:59\nSo in 1892, you have an alliance between the French\n3:02\nand the Russians, the Franco-Russian Military\n3:04\nConvention.\n3:05\nSo this is an alliance.\n3:07\nLet me do this in the magenta color again.\n3:10\nYou have an alliance between France and Russia.\n3:16\nAnd then finally, in the early 1900s, 1904 to 1907,\n3:20\nyou have a series of agreements.\n3:22\n\"Entente\" essentially means agreements.\n3:24\nAgreements between the British Empire and France,\n3:26\nbetween the British Empire and the Russian Empire,\n3:29\nto essentially get on good terms with each other.\n3:32\nThese weren't as formally bonding\n3:34\nthat, hey, if someone's going to attack you,\n3:35\nI'm going to attack them.\n3:37\nBut they were, essentially, able to resolve\n3:39\na lot of their issues on what's going on\n3:41\nin their other imperial conquests.\n3:43\nAnd they formed what is called the Triple Entente,\n3:46\nthe triple agreement between Britain,\n3:50\nbetween the British Empire-- and right here, I just\n3:52\ncircled the United Kingdom-- France, and Russia.\n3:57\nAnd on the other side of that, you had the Triple Alliance.\n4:00\nYou have Germany.\n4:00\nYou have Austria-Hungary.\n4:02\nAnd you also have Italy.\n4:06\nNow, the reason why, even though entering into World War I,\n4:09\nItaly was formerly part of the Triple Alliance.\n4:11\nAnd there were treaties between Italy and Germany\n4:14\nto become part of this Triple Alliance.\n4:16\nThe reason I don't focus on those is once the war started,\n4:18\nItaly did not go on the side of Germany and Austria-Hungary.\n4:24\nIt went on the side of the Allies,\n4:26\non the side of the Triple Entente.\n4:29\nBut this will give you a good background\n4:30\nfor why what would seem like a regional skirmish in southeast\n4:36\nEurope turns into a pan-Europe and eventually pan-global war.",

It looks like we'll be talking about the Renaissance Period.\n0:33\nDuring the medieval period, the torch lit by the Greeks, carried on by the Romans, had been rejected,\n0:38\nMedieval values instead elevated the spiritual and denounced the flesh.\n0:44\nThen, in the mid-14th century, Petrarch, an Italian poet and scholar of Latin,\n0:49\nwas able to reconcile Christianity and classical Roman and Greek thought in his writings,\n0:55\nand revive interest in what had been dismissed as the pagan past.\n1:00\nThis started the period called the Renaissance, or rebirth.\n1:05\nThe shift of focus from god-centered toward human-centered interest became known as Humanism.\n1:13\nOf course, there wouldn't have been much of a Renaissance without a Renaissance man or two,\n1:18\na man with expertise in many fields.\n1:21\nTake Brunelleschi, who was a goldsmith, architect, engineer, sculptor and mathematician.\n1:27\nAs an artist, he discovered the principles of linear perspective, which gives the illusion of 3-dimensional space, to 2-dimensional art.\n1:35\nStart with the horizon line, add a vanishing point, and then lines that converge to that vanishing point.\n1:42\nNow you have a framework for making objects appear farther away. Or closer.\n1:48\nOf course, Brunelleschi was most famous for his massive dome. No, not that dome.\n1:53\nThe dome he built for the Florence Cathedral, equal in size to the dome of the Pantheon.\n1:58\nBrunelleschi's new method of construction was so different that some Florentines wondered if he was mad!\n2:04\nHe devised a way to build the dome without scaffolding, and without using flying buttresses,\n2:09\ncommonly used in Gothic architecture to support the weight of large structures.\n2:14\nSixteen years later when the dome was completed, it was recognized as a marvel of the era,\n2:19\nand Brunelleschi was heralded as a genius.\n2:26\nDonatello also started as a goldsmith.\n2:29\nNo, no, no, no, Donatello was not a crime-fighting turtle,\n2:32\nbut Donatello did study the old Roman styles of sculpture and ornamentation.\n2:38\nHis David is famous as the first free-standing bronze sculpture cast during the Renaissance.\n2:43\nIt depicts David as the beautiful youth of the Bible, just after decapitating the giant Goliath,\n2:49\nand uses classical techniques like contrapposto in its design.\n2:53\nDonatello also developed a new way of sculpting in shallow relief, that applied the rules of linear perspective\n2:59\nto create a greater illusion of depth.\n3:02\nHe would have been hailed as the most accomplished sculptor of the Renaissance,\n3:06\nif not for the coming of Michelangelo,\n3:08\nwho, along with da Vinci and Raphael kicked the art world into high gear for the High Renaissance.\n3:13\nPerhaps no one exemplifies the ideal of the Renaissance man more than Leonardo da Vinci.\n3:22\nNo, Renaissance man was not a superhero. Really, read your history.\n3:29\nLeonardo was a talented painter, sculptor, scientist, architect, and even a military engineer.\n3:36\nHe painted the most famous portrait in the world, the Mona Lisa.\n3:40\nHis boundless curiosity was best exemplified by his notebooks, which were filled with inventions,\n3:45\nlike a tank, flying machine, and a parachute.\n3:49\nIn 1482, Leonardo went to Milan where he painted his famous mural, The Last Supper, on the wall of a monastery.\n3:57\nHe chose to portray the emotional moment when Jesus predicts that one of the apostles will betray him,\n4:02\nand the betrayer will take bread at the same time he does.\n4:06\nThe apostles react in different degrees of surprise and horror, except for Judas, who, distracted by the commotion,\n4:12\nreaches for a piece of bread.\n4:16\nLeonardo used perspective lines as a compositional device that leads the eye to Jesus' face,\n4:20\nthe calm center of the chaos.\n4:24\nThough The Last Supper had been painted by others, Leonardo's was the first to depict the apostles as\n4:29\nacting, or reacting, like real people.\n4:36\nNow we come to Michelangelo. You think we can do this one straight? Ok.\n4:43\nAt 24, Michelangelo carved the famous Pieta, which in Italian, means pity.\n4:48\nThe Pieta depicts the body Jesus on his mother Mary's lap, as she mourns his death by crucifixion,\n4:54\nand combines the Renaissance ideals classical beauty and realism.\n4:59\nShortly after installing the Pieta, Michelangelo overheard someone say that the sculpture\n5:03\nwas the work of another artist.\n5:05\nThat night Michelangelo chiseled the words,\n5:08\n\"Michelangelo Bourinati Florentine made this\" across the sash running across Mary's breast.\n5:14\nLater, Michelangelo regretted this act. It was the only\n5:17\nstatue he ever signed. Michelangelo was reluctant to accept the commision\n5:21\nto paint the Sistine chapel, but Pope Julius II insisted.\n5:26\nContrary to popular belief, Michelangelo did not lay on his back to paint,\n5:30\nbut stood on specially designed scaffolding and had to reach upward\n5:34\ncraning his neck awkwardly to paint. Fresco required painting in to a newly\n5:38\napplied layer of wet plaster, and Michelangelo, also a\n5:41\npoet, complained in a letter to a friend, \"My beard turns up to heaven\n5:46\nmy nape falls in, a rich embroidery bedews my face,\n5:50\nfrom brushstrokes thick and thin.\" Four years later the arduous\n5:53\ntask was done, and a masterpiece created.\n6:01\nThe paintings of the Sistine Chapel had a profound effect on other artists. One story\n6:05\nclaims that Raphael slipped into the chapel to examine the paintings\n6:09\nwhen Michelangelo was absent. \"Mamma mia!\n6:15\nWhat's the matter with me? It's back to the drawing board.\"\n6:16\nRaphael scraped the fresco he was working on off the wall and repainted it.\n6:21\nImititating the more powerful style of Michelangelo. Raphael became\n6:25\na favorite of the Pope, and was commissioned to paint other rooms in the Vatican.\n6:29\nHis greatest masterpiece, The School of Athens, portrays Plato,\n6:32\nAristotle and other Greek philosophers, mathematicians, scientists, from\n6:36\nclassical antiquity, sharing their ideas, learning from each other.\n6:41\nIt's a kind of intellectual fantasy gathering, since these figures\n6:45\nall lived at different times, and it shows that Humanism had become\n6:48\naccepted in the church. Raphael even included himself standing\n6:52\nwith the astronomers. Sounds like my kind of party, Plato,\n6:57\nAristotle, Arturo, huh?\n7:03\nOh. We haven't mentioned the\n7:04\nNorthern Renaissance. No, no, no, Leonardo, Michelangelo,\n7:08\nand Raphael did not go North for a skiing trip. Sorry folks,\n7:12\nyou'll have to excuse the hand today, it's just that, well, for many, the Renaissance\n7:17\nwas an intoxicating time. Ok, so what happened in Italy\n7:20\ndidn't stay in Italy. The ideas of the Renaissance migrated\n7:24\nup into the rest of Europe, and started what was called the Northern Renaissance.\n7:28\nJan van Eyck pioneered the techniques of painting with oil\n7:32\nbased paints on wooden panels. Artists of the North had a\n7:36\nfondness for meticulous detail, and were more interested in realism than\n7:40\nclassicism. Albrecht Dürer traveled to Italy and was friends with\n7:44\nRaphael and other artists of the Renaissance. He was able to incorporate the\n7:48\nItalian and Northern ideas into his paintings and prints.\n7:51\nHe became one of the most influential artists of printmaking, and elevated this\n7:55\nrelatively art form to new levels of aesthetic quality and\n7:59\npopularity.\n8:03\nAfter the death of Leonardo in 1519 and Raphael in 1520\n8:08\nartists rejected the values of the High Renaissance for\n8:11\na more heightened or more mannered approach. Mannerists like Tito and\n8:16\nRegel created unbalanced compositions that gave for visual tension\n8:19\nto the work. Tintoreto's painting of The Last Supper shifts the table\n8:23\nfrom the center to the left side, and emphasizes dramatic lighting and\n8:27\nmotion to increase the drama of the image. Mannerist artists also\n8:31\nintentionally distorted and stylized the human body and spatial relationships\n8:35\nlike this painting of the Madonna, by Parmegianino.\n8:39\nThe figures are elongated, and instead of balancing the angels on either side\n8:43\nof Mary, they are deliberately squeezed into the left side with only a tiny\n8:47\nSaint Jerome on the right. Oww, how does she\n8:51\ndo it!\n8:54\nThe Renaissance was a period of great discovery, invention, and creativity\n8:59\nThe Renaissance included the discovery of the New World by Columbus, the invention of the printing press by Gutenberg,\n9:05\nthe beginning of the Protestant Reformation by Martin Luther, and the scientific\n9:09\nadvances of Copernicus and Galileo, to name a few.\n9:13\nThe influence of the Renaissance on Western art is ongoing, and even\n9:17\nwent viral without Facebook or Twitter or Youtube, because of the\n9:23\nstrength of its ideas, and the beauty\n9:24\nof its creations.\n9:35\nCreated as a part of TICE Art 1010 Online Course\n9:40\nSpecial thanks to the Utah System of Higher Education\n9:45\nFor their generous support\n9:48\nProduced by:\n9:53\nand:\n10:02\nVideo Production:",
